mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, john. and welcome everyone to patterson's fiscal 2021 third quarter earnings conference call. as we approach the one-year mark of when the covid-19 pandemic began to significantly disrupt our daily lives, i want to begin by acknowledging the tremendous resiliency of our customers and business partners and thanking our 7,000-plus patterson employees for consistently upholding our purpose, vision and values each and every day.
these core principles have motivated our team to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. i'm incredibly proud of our organization's focus during these past 12 months and the resiliency our teams have exhibited in helping to overcome these historic challenges and continue to improve our performance. while i know we are all hopeful that the ongoing administration of the covid-19 vaccine will help us fully emerge from this pandemic, our customers and the industries we serve are still managing through the disruption and patterson remains focused on continuing to be their trusted and indispensable partner to help them succeed.
even in light of the challenges we've all faced these past 12 months, patterson's consistent and disciplined approach to strong execution and operational excellence, combined with our ongoing investments to drive sales productivity and enhance our value proposition, enabled us to build momentum across our entire business.
let me start by summarizing some of the key highlights from our fiscal '21 third quarter. first, on a year-over-year basis, total internal sales grew 7%. dental segment internal sales increased approximately 4%, fueled by consumables growth of 14%. animal health segment internal sales increased 10%, driven by companion animal growth of approximately 21%.
second, our strong sales results and our continued expense discipline contributed to our adjusted operating margin growth of 30 basis points to 4.6%, reflecting continued year-over-year improvement in our consolidated operating margin. the dental and animal health segments each grew their respective operating margins during the third quarter, further reinforcing the strong execution taking place across both of our businesses.
next, we delivered adjusted earnings of $0.58 per diluted share, representing an increase of 23% year-over-year. and finally, we maintained our focus on the core principles that continue to guide us as we navigate the disruption from the pandemic, protecting employee health and safety, ensuring business continuity for our customers and doing our part to help reduce the spread of the virus in our communities.
with that, i will now dive into the performance drivers in each of our segments during our third quarter. as i mentioned, internal sales in our dental segment increased about 4%. this increase was driven by growth of approximately 14% in the consumables category. this performance is the direct result of a continued strong execution of our field sales and operations teams and also reflects the health and resiliency of our customers and the increased demand for infection control products.
within the consumables category, sales of infection control products contributed 11% year-over-year growth of our 14% year-over-year total dental consumables growth, meaning the remaining year-over-year consumables sales growth was due to our non-infection control product categories.
as we think about the consumables category going forward, i want to share some additional context. first, while we believe the rate of growth will moderate as we begin to lap the impact of covid-19, we expect the increased demand for infection control products to continue over the long-term as customers turn to patterson to help them meet this new standard of care.
second, the consumables category overall, including non-infection control products, is also likely to benefit as patient traffic increases over time. patient traffic continues to remain below pre-pandemic levels and we know that some patients are still hesitant to visit a dentist under the current conditions. as widespread vaccine administration advances, we expect these patients to begin returning to the dentist, driving improved demand going forward.
our total consumables product growth can also be attributed to the ongoing investments we've been making in our field sales and support teams to deepen their relationships with our customers as well as the increased enrollment in our patterson advantage customer loyalty program. during the third quarter, we also continued to see strong demand for our more profitable private label products, which grew at an even faster rate than our overall consumables category.
turning now to our equipment results, internal sales of equipment were down 7% year-over-year with fairly consistent year-over-year sales performance across all three of our equipment categories: core equipment, digital x-ray and cad/cam. as we previously stated during our fiscal '21 second quarter call, we expected a challenging equipment comparison for the fiscal third quarter due to our strong performance in this category during the 2020 fiscal year.
our strong performance last fiscal year was primarily driven by growth in the cad/cam category following certain new product introductions, which patterson was very successful in promoting and selling.
however, even with the tough equipment comparison and in light of the current environment, our equipment sales during the third quarter exceeded our internal expectations due to the strong execution by our team. additionally, innovation in equipment, software and technology remains a core driver of the modernization of today's dental practices, which provides a clear opportunity for patterson to leverage our expertise in sourcing, selling and installing the latest technologies.
patterson's unique ability to support our customers throughout the entire life cycle of their equipment and technology investments is an important driver of patterson's overall value proposition. and since the onset of the pandemic, our comprehensive network of local field service technicians and branch offices, coupled with the national support through our patterson technology center, have continued to deliver the unmatched expertise and support our customers expect from patterson.
looking forward, we remain encouraged by the resiliency of our customers and the overall dental market. while patient traffic remains below pre-pandemic levels, we expect demand to improve and we are well positioned to continue serving our customers by focusing on strong execution, operational excellence and leveraging our unmatched expertise, customer service and support. i want to acknowledge and thank the entire dental team for another strong quarter.
turning now to our animal health segment. our animal health business achieved total internal sales growth of 10% during the third quarter, led by internal sales growth of nearly 21% in our companion animal business. our top-line results in companion animal can be attributed to a number of factors. first, the rise in pet ownership and pet adoptions during the pandemic has led to increased spending, veterinary clinic traffic and pet wellness visits.
in addition, our companion animal sales teams continue to do an excellent job promoting and executing new product launches and working closely with our preferred manufacturing partners to execute business plans that drive value across the supply chain. these efforts have not only enabled us to outpace the market, but also helped drive demand toward our preferred manufacturing partners who reward us for our ability to move market share. we also improved our companion sales mix during the third quarter through our continued focus on selling more profitable product categories, including equipment, software and services and private label products. our companion animal team is clearly executing their business plan and delivering great value to their customers.
on the production animal side, internal sales in the third quarter were slightly positive on a year-over-year basis. and there are several factors that are impacting our production animal performance. one factor in our beef segment during the quarter was the shift of the fall cattle run, which positively impacted our fiscal second quarter performance and created a more challenging year-over-year comparison during our fiscal third quarter.
in addition, we are seeing continued improvement in the dairy market as the price of milk has increased compared to the year-ago period. in the swine market, processing plant disruption due to covid-19 created a greater shortage of market-ready animals being raised in production facilities. so, the covid-19 disruption in swine was more significant than these and will take more time to recover. however, we believe the swine market recovery will eventually serve as a tailwind for patterson's production animal business once the overall herd size begins to normalize. while the pandemic-related end market challenges are evident in the food animal portion of our business, our production animal team continues to execute well, drive operational improvements and deliver great value to our customers.
we're pleased with the top and bottom line results in our animal health segment. the pandemic is impacting the animal health industry in different ways, but our teams remain steadfast on supporting our customers in this challenging environment. our third quarter animal health performance is a direct result of the focus and passion of our team and i also want to thank and congratulate the entire animal health group on their strong third quarter performance.
to sum it up, patterson delivered another strong quarter across both of our businesses. our teams are engaged and focused on helping our customers and business partners succeed and we remain confident in patterson's long-term positioning in each of our end markets.
and with that, i'll turn the call now over to don for a deeper dive into our financial results.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
thank you, mark. and good morning, everyone. consolidated reported sales for patterson companies in our fiscal 2021 third quarter were $1.55 billion, an increase of 6.5% versus the third quarter a year ago. internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and changes in product selling relationships, increased 6.9% compared to the same period last year.
as mark already mentioned, patterson's consistent and disciplined approach to strong execution and operational excellence, combined with our ongoing investments to drive sales productivity and enhance our value proposition, enabled us to continue our momentum across the entire business this quarter. our third quarter adjusted gross margin was 20.9%, which was down 50 basis points versus the third quarter of fiscal 2020. this difference compared to the previous year was primarily attributable to the impact of segment mix.
adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter were 16.3% and favorable by 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis as we have continued to benefit from our efforts to drive operational improvements and expense discipline, along with leveraging impact of higher sales volumes. in the fiscal third quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 4.6%, which represents a 30-basis-point improvement over the same period in the prior year.
as you recall, our consolidated adjusted operating margin has improved for a number of quarters, posting year-over-year improvement in each of the past eight quarters as a result of our efforts to drive operational improvements and expense discipline, along with the added impact of improved mix within our business segments and the ongoing expense leveraging with higher sales volumes. we continue to be encouraged about our year-over-year margin improvement for another quarter.
our adjusted tax rate for the fiscal third quarter was 20.2%, which represents a decrease of 320 basis points compared to the fiscal third quarter of the prior year and primarily related to the impact of excess tax benefit deductions. reported net income attributable to patterson companies, inc. for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was $48.8 million or $0.50 per diluted share. this compares to a reported net income attributable to patterson companies, inc. of $23.2 million or $0.24 per diluted share in the third quarter one year ago.
adjusted net income attributable to patterson companies, inc. in the fiscal third quarter, which excludes deal amortization, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal reserve costs and accelerated debt-related costs totaled $55.8 million or $0.58 per diluted share. this compares to $44.5 million or $0.47 in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and this represents $0.11 or 23% year-over-year increase in our adjusted earnings per share over the prior year period. this increase over the prior year is primarily attributed to our strong sales execution and operating margin improvement across both of our business segments and the benefit of continued operating expense discipline.
now let's turn to our business segments, starting with our dental business. in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, internal sales for our dental business increased 3.6% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020. on that same basis, patterson's sales of consumable dental supplies were up 13.6% versus the same period one year ago. as mark described earlier, this nearly 14% growth in consumables can be broken down into two components: growth of infection control products and non-infection control products. the growth of infection control products in the fiscal third quarter translated to approximately 80% of our year-over-year total consumables growth.
the internal sales of equipment in the fiscal third quarter decreased 6.3% versus the same period a year ago. while we mentioned the difficult comparisons to the prior year on our fiscal second quarter earnings call, we were pleased that our equipment performance in the fiscal third quarter came in better than we had expected. and finally, internal sales of software and value-added services decreased 3.9% in fiscal third quarter.
adjusted operating margins in dental were 9.4% in the quarter, a 50-basis-point improvement compared to the prior year. the primary drivers of this operating margin improvement were improved mix, continued expense discipline and the leveraging impact of higher sales volume.
now let's move on to our animal health segment. during the fiscal third quarter, internal sales for our animal health business were up 10% compared to the same period a year ago. increased pet adoptions and increased attention to pets, along with our strong sales execution, continue to drive our animal health results, with sales growth of 20.7% in our companion animal business compared to the same period last year.
adjusted operating margins in our animal health segment were 3.3% in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 50 basis points compared to the third quarter of the prior year. our animal health can continue to drive higher sales growth with our vendor partners who reward us for our value-added strategy. in addition, we benefited from improved product mix and the leveraging impact of higher sales volumes.
let me now cover several cash flow and balance sheet items. during the first nine months of fiscal 2021, we used $604.9 million in cash from operating activities. we also collected deferred purchase price receivables of $634.5 million during the year, which is included in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. to fully understand our free cash flow, the total of these two amounts is a generation of cash for the first nine months of fiscal 2021 of $29.6 million.
free cash flow, which we have explained and calculated in a table within our press release, has decreased $120 million through the first nine months of fiscal 2021 compared to the same period one year ago. the year-over-year decrease is primarily due to the elevated levels of accounts payable at the beginning of the fiscal year due to covid-19, as we carefully managed our cash and which continued to normalize as we've progressed through fiscal 2021.
as previously disclosed, we amended and restructured our credit facility and bank term loan. transaction allows us additional financial capacity and extended the agreement through february of 2024 on substantially similar terms as our previous agreement.
turning to capital allocation. we continued to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid during the first week of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. on a year-to-date basis, patterson has returned $50.1 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. our board continues to view our dividend as an important component of returning value to our shareholders. and the current dividend yield provides a meaningful baseline return to shareholders as we continue focusing on our plans to drive improved performance in the business.
let me conclude with comments on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2021. due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the covid-19 pandemic and its potential impact on business operations, we are not providing fiscal 2021 financial guidance at this time.
and now, i will turn the call back over to mark.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, don. now before we take your questions, i want to take a few minutes and touch on the positive trends in our end markets as well as our investment priorities for the future.
in the dental market, there are three factors we believe will impact demand and create expanded sales opportunity for patterson going forward. first, we expect the increased demand for infection control products is here to stay. that said, while the infection control supply chain has stabilized from where it was a number of months ago, we are continuing to manage through some supply chain disruption and price fluctuations for certain infection control products. we continue to work closely with our supply partners to source the highest quality products and manage the price impact on our customers.
second, we expect that dentists will continue investing in the latest technologies to build and modernize their practices. and third, we believe that continued progress around vaccine administration will improve patient demand. we also expect that when patients return to the dentist after a long time away, they may require higher acuity procedures further driving product demand.
in the companion animal market, we believe the growth of pet ownership and adoption rates that spiked during the pandemic is unlikely to continue at the current rate and will eventually stabilize. however, we expect the overall companion animal market to grow at a faster rate than prior to the pandemic. we are well positioned to take advantage of the incremental growth opportunity in this space through our comprehensive sales and support infrastructure and the value we bring to our veterinary customers every day.
in the production animal space, we believe the market is poised to rebound as restaurants eventually reopened and schools returned to in-person learning, which will drive demand for the protein and dairy products our customers provide.
now with that context on our end markets, let me turn to our strategic investment priorities. as we think about leveraging our position across the attractive markets we serve to drive future value creation, we're focused on three key areas. first, we will continue to invest in the core areas of our business that have contributed to our accelerated performance, including investments in our people and service and support organizations. second, our strong performance has enabled us to continue returning cash to our shareholders even during the challenging period caused by the pandemic and we continue to view our dividend as an effective means of delivering value to our shareholders. and third, we are also continuing to evaluate opportunities on how we can best position patterson for sustainable growth. and given our ongoing actions to strengthen our financial position and improve our balance sheet, we have the flexibility to consider strategic investments that will accelerate that growth in value creation.
as we wrap up, i want to again reiterate our enthusiasm about our position in each of our end markets as well as our confidence in our team, our strategies and the essential role we serve for our customers and business partners. we've made tremendous progress over the past several years in moving patterson to a position of strength from our efforts to stabilize the core and build momentum to navigating through covid-19 and to the accelerating performance we continue to deliver. looking ahead, our entire team is aligned around our clear focus to create value for our customers, business partners and shareholders.
that concludes our prepared remarks. and don and i now will be glad to take your questions. operator, please open the line.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from michael cherny of bank of america. your line is open.
michael cherny -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning and thank you so much for taking the questions. maybe to kick-off a little bit, when you think about the consumables growth in the dental market, in the 3% ex-infection prevention -- obviously infection prevention has reposition both pre- and post-covid as well as [indecipherable] during covid. but maybe on that 3% rate, can you just give a little sense on how that's shaping out? what types of products customers are most interested in? and how some of the sales force investments and other investments you've made have contributed to that number outpacing what appears to be most market growth trends that we can see?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, michael, this is mark. thank you for the question. to your point, we're certainly pleased with our overall consumables results. but i think indicative of just the continued momentum and performance that our teams are driving are showing up in the increased results in the revenue gains that we're making in the non-infection control and prevention categories. and i think it's really due just to a number of factors. and i think we had a strong momentum coming into the pandemic and i think we continued to build on that momentum with just an ongoing focus on sales and service execution. our customers are valuing the products and services that we provide. we continue to invest in our field teams and as well in tools to help them be more productive or continued an increased focus on the dso segment to relaunch of our loyalty program.
yeah, i think it's really just a combination of factors and initiatives that we put in place over the past many months and i think, most importantly, just the great collective work of our team. and this decision we made to -- continue to invest in our field sales teams at the onset of the pandemic, i think all of these factors combined have really helped contribute to our momentum and growth, which we certainly believe is outperforming the market.
michael cherny -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks. and [indecipherable] dental, but maybe turning to margins a bit. you had nice year-over-year expansion, although sequential decline. as you think about the contributors to the margin progression whether it's private label, whether it's the pull-through of [indecipherable] dental growth, how do you think about what should be the future runway for margins within the dental segment? and what are some of the other drivers levers you have that can support margins both here and higher [technical issues]?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. don, do you want to start with that?
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so, i think, one of the things you might want to look at, you mentioned the sequential margin progression. i think, if you really look at the year-to-date operating margin at 10.3% to dental, up from 8.7%. i mean, that sort of takes out a lot of the seasonality and other trends you might find quarter-to-quarter. i think that becomes may be a good baseline to look at in terms of where we think margins can go in the future.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think a couple of additional factors that are -- will help drive that. certainly we've spoken about private label. our private label business, pardon me, continues to grow at a faster rate than our dental consumables overall. and certainly private label makes up a large portion of the infection control prevention products. so we view that as a good tailwind both in terms of our revenue performance as well as our margin opportunity, continued focus on our software and technology segment that is certainly very accretive to our margin, the services that we provide to our tech service organization. all of these elements are accretive to our overall dental margins and they continue to be an important focus for our dental team to drive.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
i think the only thing i'd add to was just the progression of our sales results and a return to growth. we really feel like, on both sides of our business, on the dental side that we have the infrastructure in place and the cost base in place to really grow revenue without meaningfully increasing our fixed cost. and so, there is just some natural leveraging that we're just also going to get as we continue to grow our sales in the dental business.
michael cherny -- bank of america -- analyst
excellent. thanks.
operator
your next question comes from erin wright of credit suisse. your line is open.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thanks. given the recent change in the large dso contract, what is your dso strategy now or how has it changed? and how would you characterize the current pricing environment? have you won any smaller regional dso accounts that would potentially offset the heartland contract and how should we think about margins as that heartland contract rolls off here?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks. this is mark. thanks for the question. certainly dsos continue to be a strong area of focus for us both at the regional and national space in dental. and i would just add in the corporate account space in our companion animal business, both represent strong growth opportunities for us. we continue to invest in our field sales and support teams to support the unique needs of our dso and corporate account customers. and we are winning business in this category both at the regional and national level. and so, we're very focused on continuing to drive our results in this segment. and we're pleased with our performance here again across both our dental and companion animal segments.
and i would say, we're also focused on working with those groups and customers that really see the comprehensive value that patterson brings to their operations and their supported practices. so, we remain excited about our progress here. as we said, we're winning new business in this segment and we expect to continue to build out our team and the capabilities to support this segment. look, as we've indicated, the margin profile is different than the private practice area, for example. but we're also making sure that we're building our cost structure that can support this segment that were again being responsible about those types of customers that we work with, to ensure that we can generate a fair return. so, we're pleased with our continued progress in this area.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. great. thanks. and then, in animal health, the consumables number was pretty strong. how should we be thinking about the sustainability of that trend, particularly on the companion animal side? and how we should be thinking about the long-term underlying growth rate of these markets that they normalize on both the companion and livestock side?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. look, i think as we've spoken for several quarters here, just the market dynamics of increased pet adoptions, greater pet ownership and pet owner attention to their pets was a result somewhat of the work-from-home environment. yeah, look, it's continued to contribute to increased veterinary clinic traffic and pet wellness visits. obviously the vet market has remained very resilient throughout covid with higher growth rates pre-covid. and in fact, we're also seeing new clinics opening up to meet some of this increased demand.
so, we do believe we're outpacing the market in the companion animal space. our teams are doing a great job executing and delivering great value to our customers. we're winning new customers. we're increasing our penetration. our share of wallet, if you will, is with our existing accounts. and we're also sending our teams to drive mix improvements and seeing the benefits in some of our higher margin equipment and private label categories. again, both of which are growing faster than our overall companion animal top-line results. so, we do expect [indecipherable] to your question that the current growth rates are likely to stabilize this increase in pet adoption. as we've indicated, we believe it will stabilize. but i think, notably we expect the overall companion market will grow at a faster rate post-pandemic than prior to the pandemic over the long-term. and we feel that our growth and our focus on this area and the positioning that we built -- that will benefit from those tailwinds going forward.
erin wright -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from kevin caliendo of ubs. your line is open.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
thank you. thanks for taking my call. first question, i want to talk a little bit about gross margins -- i see operating margins for both segments improved. i'd love to get even just directionally how the gross margins in both segments are trending? even if we can maybe back out the ppe impact is sort of the core business gross margin trend would be really helpful, i think?
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah, kevin, i mean -- this is don. we have not -- as you know, we haven't reported gross margin by business unit. i would say that overall there has been pretty good stability in both businesses. there has been, over the course of the year, some margin progression in the dental business. and we expect that we're going to be able to hold margins, where we are -- like we mentioned on the prepared remarks, really the gross margin impact this quarter was just simply due to the animal health business growing faster than the dental business, the algebra, if you will. but we're pleased with where we're at with both businesses on the gross margin side. i think, particularly on the dental side, we have a lot of good levers to continue to improve on where we're at right now.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
that's helpful. and just one quick follow-up. i know we're a month into your fiscal fourth quarter. i understand you're not guiding and that's been how the companies acted through covid. but at what point do you think you'll be able to guide? do you think you'll have comfort enough for fiscal '22? do you think you'll be able to provide some kind of guidance top-line or broadly? how are you guys thinking about that?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
i think, right now that's the plan. if you look at the way actually that our -- but we'll see what happens when we get to that point. i think, if you look at the way that our earnings call cadence goes, we report next in mid to late june. so there is going to be a lot of things that happen between now and then. i think we'll dictate what we ultimately decide. obviously we'd love to have that visibility, but we'll know a lot more in late june than we do right now in early march.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks so much.
operator
your next question comes from jeff johnson of baird. your line is open.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
thank you. good morning, guys. don, i want to clarify one thing. did i hear you say that you feel comfortable with year-over-year margin improvement in the fourth quarter? that would imply a little over 100 basis point sequential step-up. so if i heard you correctly on that, what's the driver on that? the seasonal pattern isn't totally clear, revenue tends to fall q2 versus -- or q4 versus q3. so would love to hear kind of what drives that sequential improvement if i heard you correctly on that fourth quarter guide? thanks.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
no, we weren't -- sorry, jeff. i apologize if that's the way it came across, definitely not providing any guidance on q4 at this point. i think, my comments on margin have been more over the longer-term here what we think we can do and what our trends are.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
okay. so you did -- maybe i'll go back to the transcript, but you didn't say anything about feeling comfortable with the year-over-year improvement trend continuing in the fourth quarter?
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
not. i mean, again -- i'm not really referring to that on a quarterly basis, it's more of a longer-term.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
yeah, no, just wanted to make sure. thank you. and then, mark, if i think about last quarter to this quarter, last quarter it was a big kind of 6 -- almost more than 600-basis-point growth in the north american consumables if we excluded the infection control products, ex-infection control here in don's point today, it was closer to 2.5 to 3 points. is there anything to read into that kind of bigger ex-growth in the fiscal second quarter than what we saw here in the third quarter?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. actually i think what i would take away from that is, look, let's not forget the dental market has stabilized at, we'll call it, 80% to 85% of pre-covid patient demand. and in light of that, we grew our non-infection control and prevention products and consumables 3%. so i think we're really proud of the results that our team has delivered, in light of the current market environment. if you go back a little bit to q2, certainly i think we're still in the ramp-up phase in terms of the dental market rebound. but certainly in our fiscal q3, i think we saw that really stabilize again to this 80% to 85% level. so, we're really proud of our performance across our consumables category in q3, again, given all the various factors going on in the environment.
and certainly, as we think going forward, we do expect, as the vaccine administration continues to roll out and accelerate, that some of that pent-up demand of folks who haven't gone back to the -- haven't gone to the dentist for quite some time, we'll go back. it's very safe to go to the dentist. and clearly, the connection between dentistry and oral health and overall health has become more and more clear. so we really view that as a tailwind. and again, back to your original question, we're really pleased in light of the patient demand levels, in light of the current environment for the consumables results both in infection control and non-infection control that the dental team delivered this quarter.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
yeah. understood. thanks, guys.

your next question comes from glen santangelo of guggenheim securities. your line is open.
glen santangelo -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hi, yeah. thanks for the question. hey, mark. i just wanted to unpack this consumer number a little bit. i appreciate the answer to the last question. but what i'm trying to do is, we're all trying to reconcile your results to where do you think the market may be growing at this time. i mean, essentially, i think maybe we all focus a little bit too much on these ada surveys that are quoting the numbers that you would just sort of talking about. but just want to look into all the dental players that have reported thus far, it's hard, we're getting a very inconsistent read on maybe where the market is at this point. so, could you maybe give us your best guess on where you think north american volumes are trending at this point in time? and is it fair to say that your fiscal 3q volumes across the industry were better than 2q?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think, glen, first of all, as we've -- if you build on a number of quarters here, we do believe that we continue to build momentum. we believe we continue to outperform the market and our dental business and our consumables and equipment categories. and we talked about the number of factors that we believe are contributing to that in terms of the investments we've made and the strong execution.
i think, in terms of the market, i think there is a lot of different factors in play. i do think the patient demand data that shared by the ada, i think that, those numbers have stabilized again at that 80% to 85%. again, i would say that's an average. i think you have some segments of the market that are the productivity is beyond that, in some parts of the market, where it's obviously below that.
we also do believe that there is some pent-up demand out in the marketplace. we also believe that some of the acuity levels that we're seeing in the procedures in the dentist office are higher than maybe normal. again, just given the fact that folks who maybe are going back to the dentist for the first time in a while. so i think there is a number of factors in play that -- and also, in light of just the current environment with covid, that would preclude us i think from having a real strong pinpoint on the market growth rates going forward. i think we'll obviously continue to evaluate that. in addition, we see some further stability in the supply chain and pricing of infection control.
so, again, i think there is a variety of factors taking place, i think, difficult for us to predict clearly what the market growth rate will be going forward. but certainly, we believe, a, we continue to outperform the market, our teams are executing well. we believe that there is opportunity for upside here as the patient demand levels increase. and we feel we're positioned quite well to take advantage of that going forward.
glen santangelo -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
yeah, thanks. and maybe just don, one quick follow-up. don, i appreciate, you don't want to give guidance going forward, but as we look out to fiscal '22, were there any sort of larger headwinds or tailwinds that works sort of calling out either [phonetic] on the top line and margin that we should be thinking about as we work on our models?
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think there is nothing that we would really highlight for this call. i think that's a topic. we can get into more in the june call when we give guidance -- if we give guidance. so -- but i don't have anything, that i would draw your attention to right now, in terms of headwinds or tailwinds that i think you need to incorporate in your model.
glen santangelo -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from elizabeth anderson of evercore isi. the line is open.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks so much. so [indecipherable] glen's question, are you -- just in terms of as we think of broadly speaking on the margin ramp, obviously you said, at the higher private label penetration of some of the infection control products, should we be thinking about any other like cost reramps in terms of either the sales compensation or things like that or obviously that also has an underlying offset with the cost-cutting work, that you guys have done throughout the last two years on top of that. so i just want to make sure that we're not adjusting for anything sort of out of sorts there?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
no, elizabeth, maybe a couple of comments, and don can certainly add. i think there -- where we think about it remain strong opportunities for us to expand our margins over time for a number of things that we've discussed, you mentioned private label, that's certainly a good example. the continued growth of our software and new services business, which is very accretive to our margins of other services that we provide again are accretive to our margins. i think we're also certainly there is a quite a bit of learnings through the covid situation that we've been in and our ability to run and operate the business in just an overall lower cost structure environment.
don indicated some of the additional leverage that we get just from continuing to drive the top line. and certainly also one example we haven't spoken much of today is just our continued focus on working with those manufacturers in our animal health segment, that really see the value that patterson provides across the supply chain, and our ability to work with our preferred manufacturing partners that are accretive to our overall margin category as well. so, i think, those are some of the key factors and some of the examples that we think give us some optimism again in our ability to continue to expand our margins over time.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
that makes sense [indecipherable] and then, also i think sort of move-out past [indecipherable] pandemic era. how do you think about capital deployment in terms of potentially tuck-in acquisitions or other types of investments? have you sort of viewed broadly speaking, also with m&as idea of going further into certain product categories, where you may end-up competing with some of your manufacturing partners versus not?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. great question. and certainly i think our financial performance has created improved flexibility for us from a balance sheet standpoint. and really it's been in a position to consider strategic investments that will help us accelerate our growth and value creation. and this is exciting for us in terms of how we can help, be additive to our results. i think we're focusing on a number of opportunities really across both of our business segments. and without specific examples, i think, areas that are going to just continue to strengthen our value proposition and just to enhance and expand on the services that we currently provide, opportunities for us to build scale in our core business through potential tuck-in acquisitions ways that we can expand our opportunity in margin accretive product areas.
and so, i would say that we want to focus on those areas where we believe we have a strong right to win. and i think, we'll be very strategic about where we invest for growth and value creation. and i think it will be within a purview of where we are confident in our ability to successfully execute those types of deals.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from jonathan block of stifel. your line is open.
jonathan block -- stifel -- analyst
thanks guys. two pretty quick ones for me. but, don, i'm just curious, just think sort of high level view of things. your thoughts on opex that maybe you initially perceived as temporary cause, sort of really more, call it, morph into permanent savings -- longer term. any opportunities on the sales force, if you want to comment there? and then i just got a quick follow-up.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think definitely, jon, there is definite opportunity. i think that we have seen -- we have learned a lot of things through the pandemic. i think, again, we talk about this a lot, but really think that we've set a new baseline in a way for our cost structure. we think we can grow our business from here and really just leverage what we have. there's certainly going to be some cost to come back, but there is a lot of things. and i would highlight things like t&e, facilities costs, other types of activities that we've generally been engaged in that we don't think we need to have nearly at the level we've been in the past. and so, well, i think there is just a lot of opportunity there. there is a new baseline. and again, as we continue to ramp our revenue, this is a great opportunity -- a great opportunity for us to leverage our p&l and our profit margin.
jonathan block -- stifel -- analyst
got it. perfect. helpful. and then, just curious, any dental cadence to call out between winter and the spring or summer. and i want to be clear, not asking for long-term on details, but just wondering if you want to opine about the bolus of patients on the sidelines and your thoughts about them coming back in, call it, a pretty pronounced fashion in a short period of time, post-vaccination, maybe tied over the eda. the 80% to 85% of metrics that we all sort of lean on in a way, are you able to overshoot that in a short period of time in spring or summer if we continue to have good news on the vaccination product? thanks guys.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, john, thanks. obviously difficult to predict or difficulty to predict well, right, just given the ongoing uncertainty. but, look, we're very encouraged and hopeful by the -- it seems to be accelerating administration of the vaccine. i think that's good news for everybody and opening up our economy. and i think we'll continue to give people comfort. and for those folks who have decided that typically go to the dentist but have decided for whatever reason not to go to the dentist, say, over the past year, we do believe as i said, there is pent-up demand there. i think the timing of that is obviously difficult to predict. i think we would expect it to be more gradual, as we also see the administration of the vaccine being gradual over the coming months.
and obviously new information that we shared yesterday in terms of the estimated timing. so we see it as a gradual -- or return to the dental office for those patients who have not perhaps gone over the past 12 months. and we think that could all be positive in terms of tailwinds for the dental industry and certainly for patterson in the months ahead. but i would say, more specifically we do see it as a gradual ramp.
jonathan block -- stifel -- analyst
got it. thanks, mark.

your next question comes from kevin kedra of g. research. your line is open.
kevin kedra -- g.research -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the questions. you mentioned that your equipment business a little bit better than you guys were expecting for the quarter. we heard from one of your competitors about potentially some centers looking to push purchases into calendar 2021. i was wondering if you can just talk about kind of the monthly cadence, particularly in january and february, if you saw any shift in sort of buying consistent with a push to buy equipment in the 2021 year?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, kevin. thanks. as i mentioned earlier, our numbers in the quarter certainly did exceed our internal expectations. and we are also encouraged by the funnel of equipment opportunities. our field teams are building and executing on in the coming months. so, we're also continuing to see our dental customers even in light of the current environment, invest in their practices. and we believe that patterson, frankly, has a unique advantage to help our customers through the entire product life cycle, especially when new products and innovation is launched in the market.
yeah, i think, in terms of the potential dynamic with regard to the calendar year, that's something really i would comment on at this point, hard to tell. well, i think, learn more about that in the months ahead. but in general, we're very pleased with the continued progress our team is making in this area. we believe this is a really important part of our value proposition and our competitive advantage. and we believe that really this complete equipment and technology life cycle that patterson supports our customers with -- continues to be a strong differentiator for us.
so, as our dental customers and certainly as our companion animal customers for that matter, continue to invest in their practices, continue to purchase more equipment and technology. we think we're well positioned to take advantage of that, and we're excited that our customers see the value that we can bring in that area.
kevin kedra -- g.research -- analyst
and a little bit of a more of a bigger picture question, a lesson made about the 85% patient traffic volumes, and what happens when that comes back? if we go pre-pandemic, the dental market have been growing, trailing gdp for several years it seems the growth rate. and we are -- volumes are 80% -- 85% per patient traffic. and yet it seems like the growth rate, excluding ppe, and that's going to be too different than where we were pre-pandemic. so, coming out of covid, do you anticipate that we could see a return of the dental market growing at that sort of gdp rate or possibly above that? has there been a fundamental shift that finally made break this out of that trend we had for several years and once dental seem to be trailing the growth rates of the overall economy?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a good question, and i think, a real important question as we continue to emerge from the pandemic. i think, obviously difficult to predict, but certainly, i think there are some indicators that would suggest the opportunity for improved growth rates in the dental segment are there. i think one is just the ongoing continued use of infection control and prevention products. we do think that that will continue to be the new standard of care that will drive growth.
and i would say, we also believe that this idea that oral health being connected to overall health is really an idea who's become much more apparent during the past 12 months. and i think people are finding that connection. i think, the healthcare industry is finding that connection as well. i think we believe that can also be a strong driver of demand over time. so i think, long-term, we're optimistic about the growth potential in the dental markets, where we're very pleased with our positioning and the momentum we gain there. and we think we can continue to take advantage of that.
and i think, kevin, time will tell in terms of exactly what that growth rate looks like in a post-covid environment. but we think there are some indicators that would suggest it will be positive.

your next question comes from john kreger of william blair. your line is open.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
hi. thanks very much. hi, mark. how do you feel about your -- the performance of your specialty portfolio within dental versus more kind of general and restorative?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
well, i wouldn't say that we specifically call out a specialty category in terms of our consumables and we don't break that out necessarily in that manner. so we're certainly very pleased with our consumables results overall. and i think we shared the breakdown between kind of the infection control, the non-infection control, which is where some of those products that you mentioned would fall in. and i would say, where we continue to believe, we're outperforming the market in those areas. and our consumables area continue to believe the great work of our team and the investments we've made to support our team are driving that. so, specifically, as i said, we don't really call out the specialty category. but overall, we're very pleased with our consumables results and our continued momentum there.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
thanks. i guess, i was getting -- as you have a little bit more ability to deploy capital, is it reasonable to think you might have try to push a little bit more aggressively into some of the specialty categories or are you sort of [technical issues] the portfolio as it stands now?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
okay. well, thank you. i apologize if i misunderstood your question. i think that certainly would be an area that we would be looking at, as potential opportunities, as we think about adjacent markets or product categories or segments that perhaps our presence is -- we can have a larger presence than that we do today. that would be an example of that area. but i think to the earlier question, i think, we want to make sure that we stay -- i'll stay within the zone that where we are confident in our ability to execute well, and we have the right to win, and so we're going to be very strategic about where we invest. but certainly looking at accretive product areas or product categories where we can improve our presence in our market position, that would be one of the areas that we'd be looking at.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
great. thanks. and then, as a follow-up, it doesn't get a lot of attention but can you just talk about how your animal health business is performing relative to what you're seeing in the us? and would you be interested in maybe pushing beyond the uk in animal health?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
well, thanks. we're certainly pleased with our overall animal health business and in particular companion animal obviously had a very strong quarter both in the us and globally. and i think we viewed our platform in the uk as being just that, potentially a platform to where we could grow over time. and again, as we think about where we may place some bets and invest, given our improved balance sheet flexibility, that certainly is on our list as well. although, i would say that we think there is a lot of opportunities here in north america to continue to build out our portfolio both in the dental and the animal health segments.
so, if there is not any further follow-up, john, i think that concludes the time that we have today. and i just want to thank all of you again for your time and your continued interest in patterson. we look forward to updating you again on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 year-end earnings call and hope everyone is well and healthy and safe. and we'll speak with you soon. thank you.

i would now like to turn the call over to mr. john wright, vice president of investor relations. you may begin, sir.
john m. wright -- vice president, investor relations

now, i'd like to hand the call over to mark walchirk.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, john, and welcome, everyone, to patterson's fiscal 2021 fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. we have a lot to discuss on today's call. so i wanted to provide an overview of what we plan to cover. first, i will walk through the highlights of the year across our businesses, provide some commentary on the performance in each of our segments, and share our perspective on the end market trends that we anticipate will drive our momentum in fiscal 2022. next, i'll turn it over to don to give a more detailed commentary on the fourth quarter and full 2021 fiscal year financial results, as well as the key assumptions and inputs that informed the fiscal 2022 guidance we announced this morning. and finally we'll take your questions.
as outlined in our press release this morning, patterson delivered very strong performance during our 2021 fiscal year, which ended april 24, 2021. first of all, i want to sincerely thank and recognize our entire patterson team for successfully navigating the historic challenges posed by the covid-19 pandemic. i'm incredibly proud of how our team supported our customers, our industries and our communities during this challenging period, while at the same time executing our strategy and delivering great results. a year ago, we faced significant declines in demand across our end markets, many dental practices were required to close, pet owners were forced to delay non-essential services and supply chains in the beef and swine markets were heavily disrupted.
through our commitment to our purpose, vision and values, our patterson team showed the strength of our differentiated value proposition, which proved critical to our success. throughout the year, we stayed true to our guiding principles of protecting employee health and safety, delivering for our customers when they needed us most and doing our part to help reduce the spread of the virus in our communities. we also made important and sometimes difficult decisions about managing our costs and our balance sheet as we navigated the pandemic to help ensure we would emerge an even stronger patterson.
beyond the commitment of our people and sound strategy execution, our performance in fiscal 2021 reflects the fundamental strength and essential nature of the dental and animal health markets. it also reflects patterson's enterprisewide focus over the last several years to strengthen our core business operations around sales execution, operational excellence, effective mix management, expense discipline and working capital improvement. our ongoing improvement in these areas enabled patterson to deliver strong top and bottom line growth and value to our customers and shareholders throughout the fiscal year.
in summary, we delivered full year fiscal 2021 internal sales growth of about 8% compared to fiscal 2020 and grew our fourth quarter internal sales by 24%. fiscal 2021 dental segment internal sales increased approximately 10% over the prior year and fiscal 2021 animal health segment internal sales increased nearly 8% over the prior year. for the full fiscal 2021 year, we achieve adjusted earnings of $1.91 per diluted share, an increase of 23% over fiscal 2020, reflecting the strength of our ongoing initiatives to deliver improved performance. i'm proud of our expanding team and patterson's fiscal 2021 results and with that i'll briefly touch on the drivers of those results in each of our key business segments, starting with dental.
fiscal 2020 was another strong year for our dental business, particularly given the unprecedented disruption within the market. as the dental market transitioned from lockdown to recovery, patterson's competitive value proposition was on full display, from our comprehensive and innovative portfolio of products and services, local and national customer support and sophisticated software solutions, we believe patterson is providing a differentiated customer experience that is helping our customers, recover quickly and drive success in their practices. in addition to sourcing and reliably delivering critical infection control products, our ability to deliver patterson's broader consumables portfolio enabled us to facilitate the reopening of our customers' practices and help them create a safe environment for their patients.
we believe we continue to outperform the market in consumables and we are pleased with our momentum in this category. while a significant portion of our 15% consumables growth for fiscal 2021 was from the sale of infection control products, we delivered approximately 6% year-over-year sales growth in non-infection control consumables products. we believe this strong mid-single-digit growth is due to the continued investments we've made in our field, sales and support teams, which is driving improved execution and market share gains. during the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, we also continued to see increasing demand for our expanding and highly profitable private label portfolio of products, which once again outpaced the growth of the broader consumable category.
many of our private label products also happen to be in the infection control category, which served as an incremental tailwind for us to continue to drive top line growth and margin improvement. our ability to deliver strong private label growth in consumables is a testament to our continued focus on this initiative and our investment in expanding our portfolio over the past several years, and we're pleased to see this strategic initiative continue to drive results. on the equipment side, patterson generated nearly 8% sales growth in fiscal 2021. as offices reopened and patient traffic increased throughout the fiscal year, dentists invested in their practices and took advantage of patterson's comprehensive value proposition.
our team collaborated with our manufacturing partners to develop creative financing strategies, education initiatives and online events for dental customers. we continue to be the partner of choice for new equipment, software and technology innovation. throughout the pandemic, our extensive network of local field service technicians and our national support teams in our patterson technology center worked together to deliver the unmatched expertise and service our customers expect from patterson. our ability to support our customers throughout the entire life cycle of their equipment and technology investments continues to be an important differentiator for patterson.
as a result, we believe we continue to grow ahead of the market in both core equipment and high-tech categories, proof that dentists continue to choose patterson when investing in their practices to provide better oral healthcare. as part of that effort, we have also been focused on selling our higher margin software and e-services products. patterson currently offers three comprehensive and growing practice management platforms to help our customers with everything from revenue cycle management to practice analytics and insights to patient communication. looking forward, we are confident the dental market continues to present attractive growth opportunities for several reasons.
first, we expect to see patient demand levels will continue to increase as progress around vaccine administration will help alleviate any remaining pent-up demand and drive patient traffic back to pre-pandemic levels. second, we expect dentists will continue investing in the latest technologies and practice management software to build and modernize their practices. third, we expect demand for infection control products to remain above pre-pandemic levels over the long-term as dentists and their patients embrace this new standard of care. and finally, we are encouraged by the heightened awareness that oral health has a direct link to the patient's overall health.
i want to again acknowledge and thank the entire dental team for their performance and commitment to serving our customers. turning now to animal health; as i mentioned earlier, our animal health segment achieved full year internal sales growth of about 8% year-over-year led by internal sales growth of nearly 17% in our companion animal business during fiscal 2021. in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter alone, overall animal health internal sales grew about 14% year-over-year, driven by companion animal internal sales growth of 30%. across both companion and production, our efforts have enabled us to outpace our end markets and grow our share. on the companion side, the rise in pet ownership and adoptions during the pandemic drove increased spending, veterinary clinic traffic and pet wellness visits. our field sales team executed well on this opportunity contributing to our strong top line results.
our deep existing relationships with veterinarians and comprehensive offering, positioned us well to support their growth, not only by providing a broad array of consumable products but also services, equipment and the latest technologies. our expanding portfolio of private label products also performed well, driving improved sales mix while deepening our relationships with our customers. as veterinary practices welcomed an influx of new pet owners mid-pandemic, our practice management software, branded mobile app development services and prescription home delivery services enable them to scale and improve their customer experience.
for example, we leveraged our epethealth technology program to send alerts to pet owners with reminders about their vaccine schedules, wellness visits and other pet health milestones that drove vet clinic traffic, increased demand for supplies and helped pet owners take great care of their pets. we're proud of our deep value proposition for veterinarians and how patterson continues to be a trusted and indispensable partner to help them succeed. given the attractive dynamics in the companion animal market, patterson leveraged our strengthened balance sheet to acquire miller vet holdings, a multiregional veterinary distributor. we completed the transaction earlier this month.
we believe miller vet is a strong cultural fit with patterson animal health with complementary market positions in the midwest, mid-atlantic and southeast. this transaction is expected to expand our core sales reach, drive synergies and more broadly demonstrates patterson's focus on making strategic investments to deliver profitable growth and shareholder value. we are excited to welcome the talented miller vet team to patterson and to build on our legacy of providing exceptional customer service. we believe our continued strong performance and investment in the companion animal space, positions us well for the year ahead.
while new pet ownership and adoption growth rates will likely stabilize in fiscal '22, there is now a larger population of pet owners, and we expect the normalized long-term growth rate of the companion animal segment to be higher than pre-pandemic levels. on the production animal side, our team executed well to drive operational improvements and deliver value to our customers. although production animal internal sales in fiscal 2021 were down approximately 1%, we are pleased with their performance given the significant pandemic-related challenges we faced over the past year.
our production animal team did an excellent job managing through these historic covid-19 related challenges and provided our customers with highly specialized service and delivery models to support herd health and strengthen the quality of the food supply. looking forward to fiscal 2022, we expect several key factors will enable us to return our production animal business performance back to historical growth levels. first, is the recovery of the swine market, which is expected to continue improving in the near term as our customers rebuild their herds and ramp up more significantly in the second half of the 2022 fiscal year.
second is the general reopening of the economy, including restaurants and schools, which we anticipate will create increased demand for protein and dairy products. and finally, our differentiated value proposition and strong market position give us confidence we can return our production animal business to growth in fiscal '22. to sum it up, patterson delivered strong fiscal 2021 results marked by outstanding execution in the face of significant uncertainty and challenging end market dynamics. and i want to, again commend our teams for their sustained focus on executing our strategy and serving as the indispensable partner our customers depend on for their business success. we are confident in patterson's strategic positioning in each of our end markets and our ability to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to don to talk about our fiscal 2021 full year and fourth quarter performance in detail and speak to the key assumptions and drivers of the financial guidance we announced this morning.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
thank you, mark and good morning everyone. in my prepared remarks this morning, i will first cover the financial results for both our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, which ended on april 24, 2021 and our full fiscal year. due to the significant impact of covid-19, particularly in the months of march and april of our fiscal 2020, our year-over-year comparisons for our fourth quarter results may be difficult to interpret. so, i will provide some context around these comparisons. second, i will discuss the financial guidance we issued for fiscal 2022 and provide additional context and assumptions that may be useful to you to assist in your financial models. so, let's begin by covering the results for fiscal 2021.
consolidated reporting sales for patterson companies in our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter were $1.56 billion, an increase of 21.4% versus the fourth quarter one year ago. internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation and changes in product selling relationships, increased 23.5% compared to the same period last year. as mark already mentioned, we believe our performance in the fourth quarter is the result of strong sales execution and above market growth in both of our business segments. for additional context, our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter internal sales growth was 11.3% above our fourth quarter of 2019, our last fourth quarter that was not impacted by the covid-19 pandemic.
for the full fiscal year 2021, consolidated report and sales for patterson companies were $5.91 billion, an increase of 7.7% versus the same period one year ago. internal sales increased 8.2% compared to the same period last year. our fourth quarter fiscal 2021 adjusted gross margin was 19.4%. during the period, we recorded two significant adjustments in our dental segments that negatively impacted our gross profit. the first was $11 million of covid-related inventory adjustments to account for higher amounts of certain infection control inventory where prices have fallen as the impact of the pandemic has tempered in recent months. the second was our year-end lifo adjustment which negatively impacted our gross profit by $12 million in our dental segment.
the significant lifo adjustment was almost entirely due to the covid-related pricing dynamics and variability in our infection control products during the year. taken together, these adjustments negatively impacted our gross margin and operating margin by nearly 150 basis points in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. for the full fiscal year 2021, which included the inventory adjustments i just described, our adjusted gross margin was 20.4%. adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 were 16.4%, as we continue to benefit from ongoing expense discipline and leveraging our cost structure over higher sales volumes.
for the full fiscal year 2021, adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 16.1%, compared to 17.6% in fiscal 2020. as a reminder, our fiscal year 2021, operating expenses benefited by approximately $0.15 per share from salary reductions and furlough activities in the first quarter of the fiscal year. these specific pandemic-related actions favorably impacted our adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales and operating profit margin for the full year by 40 basis points. in the fiscal fourth quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 3.1%. as i previously mentioned, our operating margin in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by nearly 150 basis points, as a result of covid-related inventory adjustments.
for the full fiscal year, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 4.2%. we expect to drive continued operating margin improvement through our efforts on expense discipline, mix management and ongoing expense leveraging, as we continue to grow the top line. our adjusted tax rate for the fiscal fourth quarter was 21% and for the full year was 22.6%. reported net income attributable to patterson companies, inc. for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $28.8 million, or $0.30 per diluted share. this compares to a reported net loss attributable to patterson companies, inc. of $608.6 million, or $6.44 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.
as you recall, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we booked a goodwill impairment charge related to our animal health segment. adjusted net income attributable to patterson companies, inc. in the fiscal fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $0.38 per diluted share. as a reminder, adjusted net income excludes deal amortization, integration and business restructuring expenses, legal reserve costs, accelerated debt costs, discrete tax matters, investment gain or loss and goodwill impairment, along with the related tax effect with these items. this compares to $41.1 million or $0.43 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.
the after tax impact of the covid-related inventory adjustments for certain infection control products and lifo was approximately $18.2 million, or $0.19 per share -- diluted share, an impact in both the reported net income and the adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. now, let's turn to our business segments, starting with our dental business. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, internal sales for our dental business increased 49.1% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. as you recall, the dental segment sales performance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was severely impacted by the ada recommending that dental offices shut down and perform only emergency dental care for approximately half of that quarter.
for some additional context, dental internal sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 are up nearly 10% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. our fourth quarter sales performance was driven by stronger-than-forecast growth in our consumables, equipment and software and value-added service categories. for the full fiscal year, internal sales for our dental business were up 10.4% over fiscal 2020. fourth quarter internal sales of consumable dental supplies were up 53.1% versus the fourth quarter of the prior year. this included growth in infection control products and non-infection control products. for the full year, internal sales of consumable dental supplies were up 14.9% versus fiscal 2020.
internal sales of equipment in the fiscal fourth quarter increased 63% versus the same period a year ago. for the full year, internal sales of equipment were up 7.6% versus fiscal 2020. finally, internal sales of software and value-added services increased 12.5% in the fiscal fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. adjusted operating margins in dental were 5% in the fiscal fourth quarter. the covid-related inventory adjustments that i previously outlined, negatively impacted our operating margin in the dental segment by approximately 380 basis points in the quarter. adjusted operating margins in dental for the full fiscal year were 8.9%, a 20 basis point improvement over fiscal 2020.
now let's move on to our animal health segment. during the fiscal fourth quarter, internal sales for our animal health business were up 13.8% compared to the same period a year ago. increased pet adoptions and the increased attention to pets have positively impacted the companion animal market and our companion animal team delivered outstanding sales growth in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 of 29.6% compared to the same period in fiscal 2020. for the full year, internal sales growth in our animal health business was up 7.7% compared to fiscal year 2020. our animal health team continued to successfully drive higher sales growth with vendor partners who reward us for our value-added approach to both our companion and production animal customers.
and our team also delivered improved product mix with stronger sales of private label products, equipment and software. adjusted operating margins in our animal health segment were 4.4% in the fiscal fourth quarter, a slight decrease of 10 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year. adjusted operating margins in this segment for the full year were 3.5%. now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. during the full year of fiscal 2021, we used $730.5 million in cash from operating activities. we also collected deferred purchase price receivables of $834 million during the year, which is included in the investing activities section of the cash flow statement.
to fully understand our free cash flow, the total of these two amounts represents a generation of cash for the full fiscal year of $103.5 million. free cash flow, which we have explained and calculated in the table within our press release, decreased $148.9 million during fiscal 2021 compared to the same period one year ago. the year-over-year decrease is primarily due to elevated levels of accounts payable at the beginning of the fiscal year due to covid-19 as we carefully managed our cash. as the economy recovered our accounts receivable, accounts payable and working capital returned to non-pandemic levels. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we generated $69.1 million of free cash flow. turning to capital allocation, we continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders.
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. during fiscal 2021, patterson returned $75.2 million in cash dividend to our shareholders. our board continues to view our dividend as an important component of returning value to our shareholders and the current dividend yield provides a meaningful baseline return to shareholders as we continue focusing on our plans to drive improved performance in the business. let me conclude with some comments on our outlook for fiscal 2022. this morning, we issued gaap earnings guidance of $1.61 to $1.76 per diluted share and adjusted earnings guidance of $1.90 to $2.05 per diluted share.
this represents the first time we've given earnings guidance since the occurrence of the pandemic due to the uncertainty surrounding its impact on our business and end markets. while we have greater clarity on the impact of the pandemic and recovery, some uncertainties still exist. as a result, we have broadened our earnings guidance range to $0.15. for modeling purposes, let me highlight some of the factors that should be considered as you interpret our guidance. first, for our 2022 adjusted eps guidance, we are modeling mid-single-digit revenue growth and operating margin expansion for both business units and the total business.
second, our fiscal 2021 adjusted eps of $1.91 benefited from approximately $0.15 of operating expense savings related to salary reductions and work furloughs during the first quarter of the fiscal year that will not repeat during the first quarter of fiscal 2022. third, as we outlined earlier, we recorded a lifo adjustment of approximately $0.09 per share during the fourth quarter in our dental segment, that was almost entirely due to the covid-related pricing dynamics and variability in our infection control products during the year. we do not expect this dynamic to repeat in fiscal 2022. finally, here's our perspective on how we are modeling the infection control category in fiscal 2022.
as i previously mentioned, we recorded an inventory adjustment of approximately $0.08 per share related to certain infection control products, while this negatively impacted our gross profit on these products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. for the full year, we earned $0.09 per share of additional profit compared to fiscal 2020 on infection control products after accounting for the fourth quarter inventory adjustment. as we look to fiscal 2022, we have modeled the gross profit impact from sales of infection control products to be flat on a year-over-year basis as moderating sales are offset by lower inventory adjustments.
the net impact of salary savings and the lifo adjustment represents approximately $0.06 per share that we do not expect to repeat in fiscal 2022. if you remove this one-time $0.06 per share benefit from our fiscal 2021 adjusted eps performance, our fiscal 2022 adjusted eps expectation of $1.90 to $2.05 implies 7% year-over-year growth at the mid-point and 11% year-over-year growth at the top of the range. this also implies a three-year compounded growth rate of 11% at the midpoint and 15% at the top end of the guidance range from our fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per share of $1.55.
and now, i will turn the call back over to mark for some additional comments.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, don. at the end of this unprecedented year, we can stay with confidence that patterson has emerged from the pandemic even stronger than we entered it. we are optimistic about patterson's long-term position in each of our end markets, and have the utmost confidence in our team, our strategy and the essential role we serve for our customers and business partners. our results reflect our strong business momentum and the meaningful progress we've made over the past several years in moving patterson to a position of strength.
as fiscal 2022 gets under way and business conditions in our end markets continue to recover, we are focused on investing in the core areas of our business to accelerate our performance, return cash to our shareholders through an attractive dividend and leverage our strengthened balance sheet to evaluate opportunities for strategic investment to accelerate our growth and value creation. while the pandemic is certainly not over, we're all encouraged and hopeful that the positive trends will continue to improve. and i can assure you the patterson team will continue living our values and maintaining our focus on creating value for our customers, business partners and shareholders.
that concludes our prepared remarks. and don and i will now be glad to take your questions. operator, please open the line.

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of michael cherny from bofa. your line is open.
michael cherny -- bofa securities, inc. -- analyst
good morning. thanks for all the details, especially on thinking about the 2022 trajectory. if i could dive in a little bit further on that, as you think about what you've learned from the past year and, obviously, the moving pieces around infection prevention and some other areas. has anything changed about how you should think through the pathway forward for segment margins in particular dental segment margin, i know it's important for both. but just curious given what you've accomplished pre-covid some of the lead pieces dynamics and revenue demand on cost rationalization during covid, how should we think about the medium-term trajectory for margins on a go forward basis?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, michael this is mark, thank you, and i'll make a couple comments and then turn it over don to add any additional color. i think first of all, we're certainly very encouraged by the continued recovery in the dental segment. and we view the dental market as very attractive. we are at or near pre-pandemic growth rates. we certainly expect to be there during this calendar year. dentists continue investing in their practices. we talked about infection control products, while obviously, a lot of variability in that during fiscal 2021. we see the supply chain stabilizing, and we expect that to be a positive for us going forward.
so all positive factors in terms of the end market demand rates. and in terms of margin, we continue to focus on the areas that we've been focused on. our higher margin products and services in the software and technology category really bring great value through our tech service team and increasing the productivity of that group. our focus on private label products, which i think, as we indicated continue to grow faster than our overall consumables. so a number of elements to drive that margin improvement objective that i know don noted in his comments.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah. and i think i would just add that with the increasing sales, we continue to get good expense leveraging as we grow in the top line. so even with some of the costs that are going to come back into the dental p&l, some of the t&e, some of the things that were lower during the pandemic. i think we still feel like we're in a good position to expand the margins in the dental business.
michael cherny -- bofa securities, inc. -- analyst
understood. and then i wanted to dive back into some of the comments you made around your growth relative to the market. i believe you said across dental, you're growing faster in consumables, growing faster than equipment. as you think about the why behind that, can you maybe parse out a bit how you're doing in terms of your thoughts on where share gain is coming from versus the dynamics of what you're seeing essentially on a same-store growth within your existing customer base?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think we believe the investments that we've been making in the business and in our dental field sales and support organizations over the past several years have been paying off and continue to pay off. we've kept our full sales team in place at the onset of the pandemic. we were generating good momentum a year ago or more at this time. we continue to push hard on supporting our field sales and support teams and ultimately so they could support their customers. our dental team built a variety of programs and services to help our customers quickly recover from the pandemic. our dental customers continue to invest in their practices. and i think people see patterson really as the partner of choice given our broad equipment lifecycle ecosystem and all the various wraparound services that we provide there. so, i think its michael, a combination of a variety of factors that we've been focused on over the past several years that are helping drive that momentum and we believe the share gains in the dental segment.
michael cherny -- bofa securities, inc. -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of erin wright from credit suisse. your line is open.
erin wright -- credit suisse securities (usa) llc -- analyst
great. thanks. my first one is on animal health. can you give us a sense of what guidance now assumes across the animal health sector on an internal basis? and you mentioned that we should exit the pandemic at a higher underlying run rate, particularly in companion animal. what does that mean or what does that look like in terms of the long-term growth rate now for the animal health segment in your view?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, erin, thanks. i don't think we're going to comment specifically on the exact long-term growth rate. but let me give you a little bit of color as it relates to how we're thinking about both the companion and the production segment throughout the course of this fiscal year, and we think in the 'post-pandemic environment'. certainly, the market growth change that we've seen in companion animal due to the increased pet adoption we expect will moderate, but still represents an overall increase in growth rates from pre-pandemic levels.
look more pets, more visits and higher demand for companion animal products and services and we believe we're very well-positioned to continue to take advantage of that increased demand and we believe our recent growth rates in this segment are a testament to that. as we shift to production, i think as we indicated, we are seeing the early signs of the recovery in the production animal segment from an end market demand standpoint.
obviously, if the economy continues to reopen, schools open, restaurants open, etc, we are seeing increased demand and expect increased demand for our beef and swine products in particular. and i think as we indicated, we expect the production animals segment to get back to pre-pandemic growth rates toward the back half of our fiscal year. so, hopefully, that provides a little bit of additional color, but we're very encouraged by the progress that we're seeing in both of those end markets. and obviously, also very encouraged by the work our teams are doing to drive value for our customers in those areas.
erin wright -- credit suisse securities (usa) llc -- analyst
okay, great. and then just one on dental. there seem to be some continuing consolidation across the dsos. do you see that having a meaningful impact in 2022 or what's embedded in your guidance on that front? and we, obviously, hear about the larger dso dynamics, but what's the traction you're seeing kind of with smaller regional dsos? and can you give us a strategy update on the dso front? thanks.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. thanks erin. we don't obviously comment on specific customers in the space generally. we're very pleased with the work our teams across both our dental and, frankly, our animal health segments are doing in terms of the dso and corporate account arena, both at the regional and national level. this area continues to be a focus for us. we continue to invest in our teams, again, both in the dental and animal health space.
and we continue to pursue the right type of customer that sees the value in the products and services that patterson provides both at the regional and national level. and we're focused with, again, working with those groups and those customers that really see the comprehensive value proposition. we believe we're winning business in this space. it's helping contribute to our growth, and we're excited about our progress here, again, across both dental and animal health.
erin wright -- credit suisse securities (usa) llc -- analyst
okay. thank you.

we have a question from jeff johnson from baird. your line is open.
jeffrey johnson -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
thank you. good morning, guys. don, i think you mentioned the 10% dental growth in the quarter relative to two years ago, the fiscal q4, '19. we had consumables and maybe you could just cross-check this for me or let me know if my math is right, consumables in the dental segment probably up about 13% versus two-year ago levels. one, is that correct? and two, within that 10% and 13% those growth rates, is there any way to give us some insight on to what the infection control products added versus the non-infection control. i think you've done that the last few quarters and maybe this would be the last quarter where it matters year-over-year, but any insight there would be helpful. thanks.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah, jeff, your math is right on the 13%. i think we did give some color on the consumables growth for f '21 at 9% for the year and 6% for the -- for all other consumables year-over-year.
jeffrey johnson -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
yeah. is there any way to give that for the quarter or i can try to back out the past three quarters' comments, i guess, but maybe being a little lazy. but if you could give it to us for the quarter, that would be helpful.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think if you kind of do the math on the quarter, you get to covid-related growth in the q4 of about 8%.
jeffrey johnson -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thanks. and then, mark, maybe i'd be interested to hear on the dental equipment side. we just started hearing in the last week or two about maybe some supply constraints, both on tech and i think even on some of the basic equipment, whether that's due to port and shipping container issues, things like that. i don't think the issue is significant at this point. but kind of what are you seeing on both the supply and demand side? and on that supply side, does any of that factor into your guidance at this point? thanks.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, jeff, thanks. i would say, we're seeing very modest -- some constraints, excuse me, from a supply chain standpoint. i would say it's not an acute problem as of yet. obviously, we're monitoring it closely. we are really pleased with our equipment performance during fiscal '21 growth but, i believe, 8% year-over-year, which did exceed our expectations. and we talked about the patterson equipment and technology ecosystem, which we believe is a competitive advantage for us. we do have a strong funnel of opportunities in the equipment category, and we continue to work closely with our manufacturers to stay abreast of any potential supply issues that might exist. but at this point, i would say those are certainly moderate at this point.
jeffrey johnson -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
got it. thank you.

your next question is from jason bednar with piper sandler. your line is open.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking our questions. and mark, i wanted to start with the guide. i know there's a lot of cross currents out there with the market and with your business in both dental and animal health. but, i guess, as we think through all those elements, i wanted to just hear how you're thinking about the predictability of the top line in dental and animal health? and then as we're all looking at kind of maybe the risk of inflationary impacts across the cost structures of companies, just love to hear on maybe how that's factored into your guide here for the year?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yes, jason, thanks. i think in terms of the predictability of kind of the top line, i think as don indicated, we are building in mid-single-digit top line growth across both of our business segments overall for fy '22. i think i shared some of the end market perspective that we have across really the three categories, dental, companion and production. and while there are some unique elements within each. the dental market, we do see patient demand at or near pre-pandemic levels. we expect certainly that to continue to grow back to pre-pandemic levels during this calendar year.
dentists are investing in their practices and both in terms of the different types of levels of acuity that goes on in the practices, we're seeing good spending there as well. so we're very encouraged by the recovery and we expect the full recovery of the dental segment. companion, obviously, the increased pet adoption has driven significant tailwinds from the demand side there. as we indicated, we do expect those to moderate. but ultimately, the long-term growth rate there in the companion animal segment, we believe, will be higher than pre-pandemic levels.
and finally the recovery, we're encouraged in the production animal space by what we're seeing with the reopening of the economy and the recovery and the stability of the supply chain that was very disruptive earlier this year. and so again, we're expecting in the second half of our fiscal year to return to normal pre-pandemic growth rates in production as well. so really encouraged by the three customer segments that we serve. and frankly, the value that we bring to our customers that we expect to take advantage of both from the top line and obviously, driving bottom line results as well.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then the risk of inflationary just how that maybe is factored in guidance?
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah. so jason, we've been -- we've built a little bit of that into the numbers that we've laid out today. i think that, obviously, this is an area we're watching carefully. so more to come as the year progresses.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. all right. great. and then maybe a little bit of a bigger picture question, but on the margin side. by historical and competitive standards, it was just -- it would seem like there's still quite a bit of margin opportunity for patterson. but i think it's just be helpful to hear, mark, how you and don are envisioning maybe the next few years unfolding, not just this year?
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah, jason. so yeah, we would agree with the general sentiment that you're outlining, i think we feel like margin expansion is definitely a part of our story. we feel like there's a lot of opportunity there. we wouldn't obviously -- we've given some guidance today that we expect it to expand during the year, year-over-year. but probably wouldn't lay out anything further than that in terms of our expectations over the next couple of years.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. understood. thanks guys.

we have a question from kevin caliendo with ubs. your line is open.
kevin caliendo -- ubs securities llc -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my call. so just a couple of modeling cleanup questions. first, is there any reason to think that cadence for earnings would not look like they might have pre-pandemic at this point or how are you thinking about the progression for the fiscal year? anything first half weighted, second half weighted? any sort of color around cadence would be really helpful.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah. sorry, go ahead.
kevin caliendo -- ubs securities llc -- analyst
no, go ahead.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think if you look back to fiscal 2020 and kind of looked at the first half, second half split, that would probably be a good way of thinking about fiscal '22's cadence during the year.
kevin caliendo -- ubs securities llc -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. also, in terms of your margin expectations and the growth of margins, are we looking at that on a year-over-year basis, meaning maybe not every quarter is going to grow. obviously, the fourth margins are a lot different. so when you talk about margin expansion, is there -- is it sort of, ok, at the end of fiscal 2022, we're going to see margin expansion over the end of fiscal '21 in both segments or how should we think about that trajectory? i know you've kind of been asked this question, but any more color around that would be really helpful.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
no, i think you're thinking about it right. it's going to be a year-over-year story. there could be some variability in the quarters and particularly with some of the comps but on a year-over-year basis, we expect there to be margin expansion in both businesses.
kevin caliendo -- ubs securities llc -- analyst
all right. and one last one really quick, if i can. can you talk about your strategy around specialty dental, whether it's implants or aligners or anything like that? any exploration into those markets or expanding your capabilities in those markets?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, kevin, it's mark. i mean, as we've indicated over the last couple of quarters, certainly, our financial performance has created improved flexibility for us to think about those types of strategic investments that can help accelerate our growth and value creation. i think we talked about some of the categories that and the types of areas that we would focus in, whether that's building scale in our core business, expanding our presence in more margin-accretive categories.
and certainly, enhancing or expanding the products and services that we provide, looking at adjacencies that we're not in today, where there may be good growth opportunities, specialty would be a good example of that. so we're looking at a broad array of different types of opportunities from a business development standpoint. and we're obviously in a position now where we can make some investments to again accelerate that growth and value creation and those are the kinds of things that we're looking at pursuing.
kevin caliendo -- ubs securities llc -- analyst

your next question is from nathan rich from goldman sachs. your line is open
nathan rich -- goldman sachs & co. llc -- analyst
good morning. thanks for the question. i wanted to ask around the pricing trends that you're seeing in the ppe and infection control products. and do you feel like we're getting closer to a point of stabilization in pricing? and then specifically related to the covid inventory adjustment in the quarter, do you see that more as one-time in nature or is there still uncertainty in the market just given how pricing is trending?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, nathan, i'll take the first part, don can take the second. i think to your question, we are seeing pricing much more stable, certainly than it was a couple of quarters ago. i wouldn't say the supply chain is completely stable or back to pre-pandemic levels of stability around infection control products, but certainly stabilizing, and we expect that to continue, obviously, assuming the current trends around the pandemic can continue in the positive direction as well.
so we do expect pricing to continue to stabilize the supply chain and product availability to continue to stabilize, and obviously, our customers really determining what their go-forward approach is with regard to infection control and their practices. but certainly, as we indicated, we do expect that to be a positive part of the growth opportunity going forward. and we continue to ensure that we have the highest quality of infection control products for our customers as well. and so this has been a challenging period in that area, but certainly, we're seeing it much more stable and expect that to continue.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah, nathan. and i think adding on to mark's comments, the stability in the pricing and the market really has put us in a position where i do believe that the inventory adjustments we recorded in the fourth quarter really one-time in nature, and we're not going to be repeating that as we go forward.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs & co. llc -- analyst
okay, great. and then just a quick follow-up, don, on the cadence of dental revenue that we should expect in fiscal 2022, i think you said mid-single-digit revenue growth for the full year. there's still an easy comparison in 1q kind of comparing to the pandemic last year. i guess the mid-single-digit revenue guidance would imply flat to maybe low single-digit growth over the second to fourth quarters of next year. obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces because the ppe and infection control business is also factored into that. so just any more details on how you're thinking about sales in the dental segment over the course of fiscal 2022?
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah. and the guidance really was mid-single digits for the entire company. and you're right, there's a bit of a bolus here in q1 in terms of growth rate. but we'd expect it to be relatively consistent throughout the rest of the year in terms of growth rates for the company as a whole.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs & co. llc -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you.

your next question is from glen santangelo from guggenheim. your line is open.
glen santangelo -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my question. hey, don, just to follow-up on some of the guidance you gave, or some of the details around the guidance. i think you kind of suggested in your prepared remarks that the $1.90 to $2.05 was about 7% to 11% growth off of what you're considering to be sort of the base fiscal 2021 number. and so i'm just trying to reconcile kind of what you reported on an adjusted basis for the year to get to that base number, which seems like it's somewhere between $1.75 and $1.80. and i know there was the salary expense savings that was going to repeat. and there was, i think, $0.09 of infection control that wasn't going to repeat. is there anything else kind of reconciling those adjusted earnings this year back to this sort of base fiscal 2021 number that you think is the good jump-off point for fiscal '22?
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah. no, glen, you have it right. so we finished at $1.91 of adjusted eps. and then the net of the two items you mentioned is a $0.06 headwind this year. so that really would translate to a jumping off point, if you will, of $1.85. and my comments were that the guidance implies 7% growth at the midpoint, and 11% growth at the top end from the $1.85. and then i think an important data point that i outlined at the end was just that guidance also implies 11% cagr at the midpoint and 15% cagr at the top end from the f '20 eps of $1.55.
glen santangelo -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst
right. okay. all right. that's super helpful. sorry, i didn't hear that correctly then. and so when we're sort of modeling fiscal '22, i mean, not to put words in your mouth, but it kind of sounds like we should see continued organic growth in both segments, perhaps decelerating to more normalized levels in the back half of the year and sort of steady sort of margin expansion in both segments year-over-year throughout the four quarters of fiscal '22. i'm just not sure i have all those pieces correct.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
no, that's a fair characterization of how we look at it.
glen santangelo -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst

thanks guys. good morning. a couple of quick ones, both maybe model related. but the animal health growth in the quarter was really strong. it was up 14% [phonetic]. i think you said companion animal was up 30%. so the higher-margin division is arguably growing 2 times. and then mark, i even think you called that positive mix shift within some of the line items. but the oms were flat to down, actually think they were down 10 bps. can we just sort of lay out for us why you're seeing some of that very slight but still margin compression off of a -- arguably a mid-teens internal number?
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
and then you're talking in the animal health space?
jonathan block -- stifel, nicolaus & co., inc. -- analyst
that question was all specific to animal health.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah, i think if you look just over the course of the year, margins were relatively consistent. i think the year-over-year piece is a little hard to calibrate just given the q4 over q4 dynamics. but we believe that -- and just some of the pandemic-related impacts that happened during fiscal '20 and then throughout part of fiscal '21. i think the important point on the animal health space is that we think going forward, in particular with this kind of growth that we have a good opportunity to continue leveraging that op profit into fiscal '22.
jonathan block -- stifel, nicolaus & co., inc. -- analyst
okay. got it. and then it sort of follows up in a couple of recent questions, but the mid-single-digit growth in both end markets, 7% at the midpoint, i sort of got to go with the midpoint. so i'm not sure of the tax rate, it seems to imply very slight op margin expansion. maybe a couple of questions, is the formula to get there ongoing gross margin compressions and then some of the opex leverage that we've seen that you guys have done a very good job with. and if that's the case, i mean, maybe the follow-up would be the 5% and the 7% rev versus eps at the midpoint, why not a little bit more leverage, don. i thought previously you talked about your ability to add a lot of the call it additional revenue without onboarding incremental investments post pandemic? thanks guys.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah. and that's true i think that, what we want to start the year in a position where, like i said, we're viewing this as 7% midpoint growth 11% at the top-end, i think, you want to probably focus your eyes on that, and just the -- the mid -- mid-single-digit sales growth with good margin expansion. i think the formula, we don't believe there's a lot of gross margin compression. we think some of the things that we've outlined, really show up in the gross margin. and so as we move forward, it's really a combination of stable to improving gross margin and continued opex leverage as we expand the sales.
jonathan block -- stifel, nicolaus & co., inc. -- analyst
perfect. thanks for your time guys.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
we have time for one more question. yeah. thank you.
operator
and your last question is from john kreger from william blair. your line is open.
john kreger -- william blair & co. llc -- analyst
livestock to return to growth as fiscal 2022 plays out. and that makes.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
hey, john.
john kreger -- william blair & co. llc -- analyst
yeah.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
hey, i'm sorry to interrupt. we missed the first part of your question. so i apologize for the interruption. can you repeat it, please?
john kreger -- william blair & co. llc -- analyst
yeah. just, can you expand a little bit about what you see as the -- kind of, longer term normalized growth outlook for your livestock business? i get that it should recover as we move through fiscal '22, but once we're, sort of, fully beyond that, curious what you think that business can do longer term.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. john, i think, we believe back to pre-pandemic levels that's a low single-digit growth business going forward. that's where we view it at this point. certainly continued good strong demand, global protein. but again, i would say, low single digits.
john kreger -- william blair & co. llc -- analyst
great. thanks. and then, one last one; you talked, i think, about dentists sort of investing in their practice as being one of the things that you expect will drive '22, can you just elaborate on that? where are they investing? what sort of equipment demand are you seeing to be particularly good?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the -- we were certainly pleasantly surprised, i think, a year ago at this time. we did not expect our equipment business to do as well as it did, frankly, and we did not expect dentists to make the type of investments during the pandemic that they did. and i think that just speaks to, really, the strength of the end market and our customers really believing in the continued opportunity for them to drive great patient care and for them to drive success in their practices. so we're seeing the investments really across the board in the core equipment categories, digital, software, e-services. and again, i think, really just speaks to the strength that we see from the dental market and the industry overall in investing for a long term success and we feel like we're very well positioned to take advantage of that.
well, i think -- sorry, operator. this is mark. thank you, again, everyone, for your time today, your continued interest and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. thank you.

mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john and welcome everyone to patterson's fiscal 2022 first quarter conference call. patterson delivered very strong performance during our first quarter, which ended on july 31st, 2021. i'm proud of our results and the great work of our team, not just over the past several months, but over the past several years that has helped put patterson in the position of strength we are in today. so before we dive into the specifics of our first quarter, i wanted to provide some brief context on the momentum we have been generating over the past several years. first, we continue to drive a clear strategy focused on five key initiatives, improved sales execution, operational excellence, effective mix management, expense discipline and working capital improvement.
we've also made targeted investments to deepen our value proposition, build our culture and assemble an experienced leadership team, all centered around our focus on the customer and the execution of our strategic plan. these efforts have proved successful. during fiscal 2020 and 2021, we executed our turnaround, stabilized our core business, returned to growth, improved our margin and earnings performance and strengthened our balance sheet. and i'm especially proud of our team's ability to effectively manage through the significant disruption we experienced over the past 18 months throughout the pandemic, while continuing to build momentum. that momentum continued during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, highlighted by a number of key performance metrics. we grew internal sales by 21% over the prior year and 14% over the pre-pandemic period two years ago. this performance was driven by effective sales and service execution across both of our business segments and across all key product categories. our dental segment internal sales increased 30% year-over-year and increased 12% compared to the pre-pandemic period two years ago. our animal health segment internal sales increased 17% year-over-year and increased 16%, again compared to the pre-pandemic period two years ago.
for the quarter, we generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.43, an increase of 30% over the prior year. as a result of our strong start to the year, we are raising the lower end of our adjusted eps guidance range and now expect fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $1.95 to $2.05 per diluted share. patterson's 30% growth in adjusted earnings per share is a reflection of our team's efforts during the first quarter and over the past several years. in fact, over the past 10 quarters, our quarterly year-over-year adjusted eps growth has averaged 19%. as we look ahead, i'm confident in our ability to leverage the combined strength of our team, our strategy and the essential role we serve for our customers to continue driving long-term growth and shareholder value.
with that overview, i'll touch now on the key drivers of our results in each of our two business segments starting with dental. as we already mentioned, our dental segment had a strong first quarter. in addition to solid execution by our field sales, service and support teams, the ongoing recovery of the dental market also had a positive impact on our first quarter results. our dental team continues to gain share in the consumables category. total consumable sales grew 34% during the first quarter compared to the prior year and increased 14% when compared to the pre-pandemic period of two years ago. and i want to call out the fact that our consumables performance in our first quarter was driven by year-over-year growth of both non-infection control and infection control products. this performance is a testament to the strength of our core consumables business and the continued demand for ppe products.
on the equipment side, patterson achieved 28% internal sales growth during the first quarter, compared to the first quarter of last year. our equipment category has also grown 15% when compared to the pre-pandemic period a few years ago. as a reminder, our equipment performance can vary from quarter-to-quarter, particularly following quarters where patterson has successfully promoted and sold new products. however, our dental team has consistently driven equipment growth over the long-term. in fact, over the last eight quarters, our quarterly year-over-year internal sales growth for dental equipment has averaged 9%. we've spoken a lot about the momentum of our dental consumables business in recent quarters, so i'd like to spend a moment discussing patterson's comprehensive equipment and technology value proposition and how it is a key driver of our performance.
when customers are looking to invest in their practices, they want a partner they can trust with the expertise and support they need long after the initial purchase and patterson has earned that trust. a key differentiator is our unparalleled customer service and support infrastructure, highlighted by two key areas. first, our highly skilled team at the patterson technology center delivers unmatched expertise for our customers around the clock. when a customer has a problem with their equipment or technology, our team is a phone call away to get the practice back up and running. and when an onsite service call is required, our local dental branch network of service technicians has the skill and expertise to fix whatever problem may arise. our service and support infrastructure is second to none in the marketplace, all focused on helping our customers run their practices efficiently and productively, so they can do what they do best, which is provide great oral healthcare to their patients. put simply, our comprehensive equipment and technology ecosystem makes patterson an essential partner to the day-to-day operations of our customers, create deep customer relationships and positions patterson as the partner of choice for dentists looking to invest in and modernize their practices.
let me transition for a minute now to our view on the state of the dental market in north america. first, we believe patient traffic has generally returned to pre-pandemic levels for both hygiene appointments and restorative procedures. second, we expect dentists will continue investing in the latest technologies and practice management software to build and modernize their practices and drive improved patient care. and finally, we are encouraged by the increasing dialog around the direct linkage between the patient's oral health and overall health. we believe this mouth body health connection will also help drive long-term demand for dental services. as evidenced by our performance in the dental business during the first quarter, we are confident about our position in the market and our ability to benefit from these positive trends going forward.
turning now to our animal health segment. as i mentioned earlier, our animal health segment also had a strong first quarter, achieving internal sales growth of 17% year-over-year, led by internal sales growth of 23% in our companion animal business with strong performance across both the us and the uk and internal sales growth of 8% in our production animal business. across both companion and production, our differentiated value proposition particularly around equipment and technology which grew 49% year-over-year enabled patterson to outpace the growth of our end markets and capture additional share. our consumables category also performed well across the animal health business, driven by our expanding portfolio of private label products, which continue to over index on growth within our own portfolio and also outperform the broader animal health consumables market. on the companion side, pet adoptions during the pandemic have increased the number of pets in the pet health ecosystem, driving increased veterinary clinic traffic and pet spending. these market dynamics will serve as long-term tailwinds for our business even as we expect the rate of new pet adoptions to stabilize. our topline performance during the first quarter reflects these supportive trends. similar to our dental segment, patterson's equipment and technology value proposition in our animal health segment has also positioned us well to drive growth in this category and improve our mix.
a significant driver of our animal health equipment growth is increasing number of clinic and animal hospitals being built as our veterinarian customers work to meet the growing demand for their services. patterson is building a reputation and indispensable partner of choice for those seeking to open a new clinic or hospital and we work to provide our veterinarian customers with resources they need from day one. as part of our established education platform, patterson veterinary university, we offer a comprehensive learning course called guiding practice success. this educational offering helps our customers develop the skill and business knowledge they need to start their own independent vet practices. enrollment in our guiding practice success program has been growing steadily over the past several quarters, creating the demand pipeline for the value-added services we provide around practice design, equipment installation, technology training and repair services. for these veterinarians, our team has the expertise, the products and the capabilities they need to successfully get their new practices off the ground. working alongside veterinarians during the critical months of opening their new practice also lays the foundation for a meaningful long-term partnership.
there are two other important items to note regarding our companion animal business. first, as we announced today, we monetized a portion of our investment in vetsource during the quarter, resulting in an investment gain. we are pleased with the value we were able to capture while remaining a shareholder in vetsource. and most importantly, as part of this transaction, we've expanded our commercial relationship with vetsource to help enable our customers to participate in the evolving trends in the companion market. second, i also want to mention that patterson is already benefiting from our recent acquisition of miller vet holdings. miller vet's complementary relationships in midwest, mid-atlantic and southeast markets helped us win new business during the quarter. we are right on track with our integration plans and continue to welcome the former miller team into the patterson family. looking ahead, while the companion animal market growth rate is expected to moderate over the coming quarters as we lapse a mid-pandemic pet adoption boom, we believe patterson's sustained market momentum and ecosystem of products, services and support, position us well to continue driving long-term growth in this market.
on the production animal side, patterson executed well in a market that is recovering more quickly than we had anticipated, growing internal sales over 8% year-over-year. at the industry level, swine herds are rebuilding quickly, us dairy herd sizes are continuing a nearly year-long growth streak and beef cattle herds are working to catch up to growing demand. exports across all species are running above the five-year historical average and as we anticipated, the expanded reopening of restaurants and schools is also driving increased demand for protein dairy products. this rebound from what was an incredibly challenging period for our production animal customers is very encouraging and has given patterson an opportunity to fully display our value proposition in this market. patterson was there to support better herd health with customized delivery services and products during the onset of the pandemic and we are well positioned to support our customers as they ramp back up with a full array of consumables, technology and software. one example is our micro machine for installations that are increasing as our feed additive technology platform is adopted by even more cattle feedlot customers, driving additional market share growth for our production animal business. we also continue to expand partnerships and deepen our relationships with manufacturers that best recognize patterson's value proposition, helping to embed patterson more deeply within our customer's businesses, drive share gains for our partners and at the same time enhance our profitability. as we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2022, we continue to work toward returning our production animal business performance to historical growth levels, building on the speed of the recovery of the swine market and the improved consumer demand for protein and dairy.
in summary, we're very pleased with patterson's overall performance during the first quarter, the strength of our end markets and our position within those markets. our ongoing focus on deepening our value proposition to serve our customers is delivering results and driving value for all of our stakeholders. and with that, i'll turn the call over to don to share more details about our fiscal 2022 first quarter performance.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
thank you, mark and good morning everyone. in my prepared remarks this morning, i will cover the financial results for our first quarter of fiscal 2022, which ended on july 31st, 2021. as we stated in our press release this morning, our first quarter contained an extra week of sales and a table in our press release breaks out the impact of that extra selling week and our reported categories for both of our business segments. in addition due to the significant impact of covid-19 in the prior fiscal year, our year-over-year comparisons for our first quarter are difficult to interpret. as a result, in my remarks, i will also refer to comparisons to the pre-pandemic period of the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as a more helpful way to understand our business performance as we managed through the pandemic within our respective markets. so let's begin by covering the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2022. consolidated reported sales for patterson companies in our fiscal 2022 first quarter were $1.61 billion, an increase of 29.6% versus the first quarter one year ago. internal sales which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation, changes in product selling relationships, contributions from recent acquisitions and the impact of the extra selling week increased 21.1% compared to the same period last year. as mark already mentioned, we believe our performance in the first quarter is the result of strong sales execution and above market growth in both of our business segments. for additional context, our fiscal 2022 first quarter internal sales growth was 13.9% above our first quarter of 2020, which is the comparable period prior to the covid-19 pandemic. this comparison back to q1 of 2020 before the pandemic also shows strong topline growth and execution by our respective teams in both our dental and animal health business segments.
our first quarter fiscal 2022 adjusted gross margin was 20.2%, down 20 basis points compared to the prior year. adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 were 16.7% and up only 10 basis points compared to one year ago. let me remind you that in the first quarter of last year, our operating expenses included the salary and furlough actions that we took to help mitigate the initial impact of the covid-19 pandemic. these specific pandemic related actions favorably impacted our adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales and operating profit margin in q1 of last year by 160 basis points. for additional context, our operating expenses this quarter are 170 basis points lower than the first quarter of fiscal 2020, as we continue to benefit from ongoing expense discipline and leveraging our cost structure over higher sales volumes. in the fiscal 2022 first quarter, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 3.6% and down 20 basis points compared to q1 of last year. again in first quarter of last year, our operating margin was aided by the salaries and furlough savings i just mentioned. we remain focused on driving continued operating expense margin improvement through our efforts on expense discipline, mix management and ongoing expense leveraging as we keep growing the topline. our operating margin this quarter was right in line with our budget and our forecast for the year. while these results are only after quarter of fiscal year and there can be timing impacts in any given quarter, we still intend to deliver operating margin expansion in both of our business segments in our total business for fiscal 2022.
our adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 22.2%. reported net income attributable to patterson companies inc. for the first quarter was $34.0 million or $0.35 per diluted share. this compares to reported net income in the first quarter of last year of $24.4 million or $0.25 per diluted share and a year-over-year percentage increase in reported net income of 39.3%. adjusted net income attributable to patterson companies inc. in the first quarter was $42.1 million or $0.43 per diluted share. as a reminder, adjusted net income excludes gains on investments, inventory donation charges, deal amortization, legal reserves and integration and business restructuring expenses along with the related tax effect of these items. this compares to $31.5 million or $0.33 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and represents a 33.8% year-over-year increase in adjusted net income. this increase is the result of our strong revenue growth and effective sales execution that we delivered across all product categories in both of our business segments.
let me explain a few additional items within our adjusted results in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. as mark mentioned within his comments on our companion animal business, we took the opportunity to monetize part of our equity investment in vetsource, a commercial partner and a leading home delivery provider for veterinarians in the companion animal space. this part of our equity stake had a carrying value of $25.2 million and was sold for $56.8 million. we also recorded a pre-tax gain of $56.8 million to reflect the increase in value of the remaining portion of our equity stake in vetsource. most importantly, we also enhanced our commercial relationship with vetsource to be more productive and profitable as we continue to partner with them to offer home delivery technology to our veterinarian customers. during the first fiscal quarter, we also committed to donate certain personal protective equipment products to charitable organizations to assist with covid-19 recovery efforts. as a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $49.2 million to cost of sales primarily within the dental segment. these charges are driven by the intent of management to not sell this inventory and instead direct it to charitable organizations.
now let's turn to our business segments starting with our dental business. in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, internal sales for our dental business increased 29.7% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. as you recall in the comparable period one year ago, dental offices were reopening their practices after being shut down due to the initial impact of covid-19. for some additional context on our performance, it is helpful to look back two years ago to comparable period before the impact of the global pandemic. dental internal sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 are up 11.6% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. these numbers reflect our strong sales momentum in the dental market and we believe we are outperforming the market across all product categories.
internal sales of dental consumables grew 34.4% in the first fiscal quarter compared to one year ago. as mark mentioned, we grew consumables year-over-year in the non-infection control category and also grew sales year-over-year in the infection control category. if we compare the dentals consumables performance to the pre-pandemic period of the first quarter of 2020, internal sales of dental consumables in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 13.7%. in addition, it is important to note that when excluding the impact of infection control products, our consumable sales of non-infection control products grew 6.3% over the two-year comparison period. we consider our sales of dental consumables to be strong and ahead of the overall dental consumables market, reflecting the high level of commitment and execution of our team. internal sales of dental equipment in software grew 27.8% compared to one year ago. our performance in the equipment categories in the quarter was broad based with double-digit year-over-year percentage increases across all equipment product categories, core equipment, 2d and 3d digital imaging and cad/cam. when you look at our dental equipment performance compared to the pre-pandemic period of the first quarter of fiscal 2020, sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 15.1% over that period. adjusted operating margins in dental were 7.9% in the fiscal first quarter. similar to our overall company results, adjusted operating margins in the first quarter of last year for the dental segment included a significant benefit from the salary savings and furloughs. a more helpful comparison is back to the first quarter of 2020 and our adjusted operating margins in dental are up 50 basis points in that timeframe. again, our margin performance this quarter is in line with our forecast and our intention to drive operating margin improvement for the fiscal year.
now let's move on to our animal health segment. in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, internal sales for our animal health business increased 16.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2021. internal sales for our companion animal business increased 23% compared to the first quarter of last year and internal sales in our production animal business grew 8.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year. as you recall on the comparable period one year ago, vet clinic traffic was initially impacted by covid-19, but then pet adoptions began to drive vet clinic visits and increased pet spending. in our production animal business a year ago, market demand was strong at the very beginning of the pandemic and then was negatively impacted by covid-19 outbreaks at processing plants. for some additional context on our performance, let's also look back two years ago to the comparable period before the impact of the pandemic. animal health internal sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 were up 16.2%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. adjusted operating margins in our animal health segment were 3.5% in the fiscal first quarter, an increase of 30 basis points from the prior year, even with the unfavorable comparison to the salary savings and furloughs last year. and our team also delivered improved product mix with stronger sales of private label products, equipment and software.
now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we used $313.4 million in cash from operating activities. we also collected deferred purchase price receivables of $315.2 million during the quarter, which is included in the investing activity section of the cash flow statement. to fully understand our free cash flow, the total of these two amounts led to [phonetic] generation of cash for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 $1.8 million. free cash flow which we have explained and calculated in the table within our press release was slightly negative in the fiscal first quarter and improved by $90.9 million compared to the same period one year ago. the year-over-year improvement is the result of increased collection of deferred purchase price receivables and our working capital returning to more normalized levels after the impact of the pandemic one year ago.
turning now to capital allocation. in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. the dividend paid in the quarter totaled $25.1 million of cash returned to our shareholders. our board continues to view our dividend as an important component of our capital allocation strategy as we continue returning cash for our shareholders.
let me conclude with some comments on our outlook for fiscal 2022. today we are updating our gaap earnings guidance from our prior guidance range of $1.61 to $1.76 per diluted share to a guidance range of $1.64 to $1.74 per diluted share. we are also updating our adjusted earnings guidance from our prior range of $1.90 to $2.05 per diluted share to a guidance range for fiscal 2022 of $1.95 to $2.05 per diluted share. while it is only the conclusion of our first quarter of fiscal 2022, we are pleased with our performance to date and the continued momentum and trends we are seeing in our business in our respective end markets.
now i will turn the call back over to mark for some additional comments.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, don. let me add a few brief comments before we open it up for q&a. first i want to again thank our entire patterson team for their continued focus and commitment. our more than 7,500 employees live by the central tenets described in our purpose, vision and values every day and thanks to their hard work, we are earning our position as an indispensable partner to our customers and business partners. in fact, i had the opportunity to engage with many of our team members at our recent sales meetings and i can tell you our teams are energized and remain focused and passionate about supporting our customers. second, i want to reinforce our optimism about patterson's long-term position in each of our end markets and the strength of those end markets. as we detailed today, we believe the dental market has returned to pre-pandemic demand levels and dentists are continuing to invest in the latest technologies to build and modernize their practices. the companion animal market remains very healthy and well positioned to benefit from the long-term tailwinds of increased pet ownership and pet spending and the production animal market is recovering faster than we expected. and finally, as we look ahead, we're focused on continuing to invest in the core areas of our business that are accelerating our performance, including investments in our people and service and support organizations, returning cash to our shareholders through an attractive dividend and leveraging our strength in balance sheet to evaluate opportunities for strategic investment to help further accelerate our growth and value creation.
that concludes our prepared remarks and don and i will now be glad to take your questions. operator, please open the line.

your first question comes from the line of john kreger from william blair. your line is open, please ask your question.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks very much and thanks for all the detail. mark, i think you made a comment at the beginning that there is a growing kind of understanding about the link between oral health and overall health. can you just comment on some of the proposals in washington to expand medicare coverage to dental and maybe more broadly our view is dental insurance coverage has been pretty weak over the last several years. are you seeing any trend there to maybe more favorable coverage across employer plans? thanks.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, john, thanks for the question. with regard to the potential legislation that's taking place and the discussions around that. first of all, we're very supportive of expanding access to oral care to a broader part of the population and really making sure everyone has the opportunity to go to the dentist and we certainly believe that oral healthcare is a really crucial part of the overall health of the patient. but it's also important that any legislation would include reimbursement rates that take into account the quality of care, the broad range of services that dentist provide and obviously dentists -- the industry need to be appropriately reimbursed for those services. so, we'll continue to closely monitor the legislation and hopefully good balance will be forged between those two areas. with regard to the second part of your question, we certainly are very encouraged by the dialog that i think is heightening around just the mouth body connection and the importance of oral health to overall health. and i won't pretend to know the specific scientific facts here, but certainly it's documented and clear that dentists can really identify oral health issues that can turn into broader total health issues. and so i think the connectivity between the dentist and medical areas is an important dialog that's being enhanced. and i think over time this is just a great opportunity to improve the overall health of the patient and certainly drive additional demand for dental services.

great, thanks. that's helpful. and one quick follow-up, you gave us an update on how you sort of restructured your relationship with vetsource, it sounds like. what's your longer-term view about migration among pet owner spending to other channels, is that speeding up or slowing down?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think it's absolutely stabilizing. through the onset of the pandemic i think it did speed up a bit certainly, i think it's stabilized. we continue to view the veterinarian really to be at the center of pet care and just with all the positive tailwinds, now we've talked about more pets, more pet spending, more demand for pet care services, we think the vet channel has great growth opportunities in it. we certainly also recognize the evolving trends that are taking place and continue to benefit from those macro trends through our relationship with vetsource that we spoke of earlier and really again focusing on helping our -- helping enable our customers to take advantage of these evolving trends. so, certainly the vast majority of pet care we expect will continue to be in the vet channel, we continue to support the vet channel implicitly and we're also helping enable our vet customers to take advantage of some of these evolving trends as well.
john kreger -- william blair -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of michael cherny from bank of america. your line is open, please ask your question.
michael cherny -- bank of america -- analyst
good morning. can you guys hear me ok?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we can hear you.
michael cherny -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, hope it stays that way. mark, i want to dive a little bit more into your commentary around dental equipment. clearly there has been a bit of a mixed pipeline i would say throughout covid in terms of where dentists want to start purchasing although it seems like things are coming back pretty nicely. when you talk about the monetization you're seeing in dental offices, are there any areas of product concentration or any themes you're seeing that overlays what drove the strong results especially when compared to the pre-pandemic levels?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, michael, thanks and look, i think, first of all -- first off, we're certainly pleased and optimistic with our customers and how they continue to invest in their practices during the past year. and as we indicated, we certainly believe we have a unique advantage to help our customers through the entire product lifecycle and in particular with new and innovative products are launched in the market, i think don also spoke to the fact that our results this quarter from an equipment standpoint were really strong across all of the categories. so, i think that's an important point to make as well. and i think we just have a unique capability with regard to how we sell, how we service, how we support equipment and technology purchases, investments that our customers make in. and as again well, certainly on a quarterly basis, equipment numbers can be -- maybe a bit lumpy, but the fact that our teams have delivered average quarterly growth of 9% over the past eight quarters i think is a testament to the value proposition that we spoke of and our leadership in this category and the great work in execution of our teams.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
i think the only thing i would add is that the dental office is really -- we're seeing, they seem to be very focused on investing in areas where they can increase their productivity as patient volumes are increased here.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
absolutely.
michael cherny -- bank of america -- analyst
perfect. and then just want to talk about again to some of the balance sheet optionality. you talked about the miller deal being -- it's starting off well which is great to hear, clearly you've got some motivation out of the vetsource partial sale. mark in the past, you've talked about looking at outside opportunities there is potential to bolster growth over time. how is that landscape shaping out and especially now as we move back toward normalized dental volumes, has anything else emerged in terms of areas where you think making inorganic investments makes even more sense?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we're excited about being in a position frankly because of our financial performance, michael, to really consider those types of strategic investments that will drive and accelerate our growth and value creation. and we're taking certainly a thoughtful approach as we think about deploying our capital both from a strategic and financial standpoint. as we've indicated over the past i think several quarters, that strategic rationale is really focused on pursuing opportunities that strengthen our value proposition, that build and expand our presence in margin accretive product and service areas that build scale in our core business, obviously, the miller vet deal being a prime example of that. so really our intent is to again be thoughtful about how we deploy our capital, but we certainly believe that there are opportunities there across both of our business segments and again focused on driving greater value for our customers, accelerating our growth and profitability and obviously ultimately creating shareholder value.
michael cherny -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thank you.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of jeff johnson from baird. your line is open, please ask your question.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
thank you. good morning, guys. mark, maybe just go back vetsource, i just want to understand the rationale for selling part of the equity stake there. i mean, we've seen that as one maybe more strategically sound investment on the animal health side or strategically important go-forward investment on the animal health side. so why choose to maybe reduce the stake in that here? [phonetic] and then don as a follow-up to that, just on the cash flow side, even with the receivable sales this quarter, free cash flow is a little bit negative, obviously, you get the benefit of the extra selling week in there and i think we all probably agree to extend levels on travel and t&e and things like that is not back to normalized level. so how do we think about free cash flow for the rest of the year, i know you don't guide there, but your receivable level is also down to levels that we haven't seen in 10 years. so i don't know how much more can be factored off there, so just kind of help us put all together kind of the sale of vetsource, the cash you got from that, was that a driving force and then how to think about free cash flow throughout the year? thanks.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah, jeff, maybe i'll start with the free cash flow. i think if you look at our history, q1 is typically our lightest quarter. there are certain inventory investments we make in q1 that kind of look to, kind of ramp for the higher volume in q2 through q4. so i think if you look back, this would be in line with our historical precedence, so i would just call the q1 cash flow timing. i think if you look for the year we're once again as i've said i think, we expect free cash flow to really move with our earnings growth. and so i think you'll see that as the year progresses.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah and jeff, this is mark. i think with regard to your vetsource question i think around the timing, certainly an opportunity presented itself and we're very pleased with the outcome. we were able to monetize a portion of our investment while at the same time maintain an equity stake and also strengthen our commercial relationship. so nothing has changed in terms of our ability to support our customers with this important service and really just we view in as a win-win for patterson and our teams will continue to represent the technology in the market and work closely with vetsource going forward to benefit our joint customers.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
all right, that's helpful, thanks. and then just last one i could ask maybe on dental equipment just we continue to hear about some supply constraints i think especially on the basic equipment side and especially with one manufacturer you do business with, i think one or two others that you have lesser exposure to. but just kind of what's the state of supply out there heading into the last few months here of the calendar year anyway and how to think about those supply constraints and how they might or might not impact the next quarter or two for you. thanks.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, jeff, certainly we do note and expect some longer than normal lead times in the near-term that's near-term and as you indicated in particular, the core equipment category. we do view this as a near-term issue and certainly working closely with our manufacturer partners to minimize the disruption and keep our customers informed. but it should also be noted that our funnel is strong and the situation that we're dealing with here in the near-term is not only related to supply chain issues, but also due to the strong demand for these products. so i think that's an important point to note as well.
jeff johnson -- baird -- analyst
helpful. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of jason bednar from piper sandler. your line is open, please ask your question.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning. congrats on a nice start to fiscal '22 here guys. on dental i'll start there, i mean mark or don, you mentioned growth in infection control and non-infection control products, which is a real good resolve especially accounting for the first full quarter impact from the heartland shift, but first sorry if i missed it, wondering if you do want to quantify these year-over-year growth rates at all for us and clarify whether these are including or excluding the extra selling week. and then second, mark, it would be good to get your view on where you see performance of each of these categories as we move forward and now that we've returned to pre-pandemic levels and then i have a follow up [indecipherable].
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, jason, thank you. i think with regard to this overall category, the infection control supply chain actually is continuing to stabilize as our pricing and demand levels. our customers' use of infection control products in terms of kind of the standard of care in the office has also stabilized and we do expect to be pretty consistent going forward. and so looking ahead, assuming no significant change to covid dynamics, we expect continued strong demand for ppe, but should also note, we faced some, as you know, some very difficult comps over the next couple of quarters due to the huge demand increase we saw last year. so we continue to focus on sourcing ppe products and really the expansion of our private label portfolio in these categories as a key element to improve our mix and profitability. and then one additional point, our non-ppe has continued to grow and build momentum, which gives us confidence in the overall nature of our consumables business including both ppe and non-ppe products.
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah, maybe to clarify just on the growth rate, so dental consumables were up 34% year-over-year, 2% on non-infection and 32% on infection control and those exclude the extra selling week. sorry, 2% on non-infection and -- 32% on non-infection, 2% on infection. and if you go back two years that the -- over the two-year period, the consumables are up 14% with non-infection up 6% and infection up 7%.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. super helpful. thank you very much for all that. and then in animal health, i mean it seems like there are several tailwinds right now on the production animal market with herd size expanding as you called out and demand rising as consumers turn to restaurants and kids get back to in-person learning. where do you think people are going to be when the market settles and then can you talk about maybe investments you're making today ahead of where you think these market shifts push the production in animal market?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
well again, jason, thanks, i mean again strong execution by our team, i think testament to the team's efforts here. we were there during the real start days in the midst of covid to support our customers obviously across all of our segments, but in production animals as you asked and really help them navigate through some really challenging times. and obviously we're there now to support them as their businesses are ramping back up. so we certainly are pleased with the bounce back here in the production animal space, generally good trends that we see across the beef, the swine and the dairy categories. and obviously to your point and i think the point we've been making for a number of quarters as restaurants reopen and schools get back to in-person learning, we would just expect the demand trends in our production animal business to be positive going forward.
jason bednar -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. thanks so much. congrats again.

your next question comes from the line of jon block from stifel. your line is open, please ask your question.
jon block -- stifel -- analyst
thanks, guys. good morning. two questions. i guess the first one is dental trends and i get -- we don't want to sort of get into the day-to-day, week-to-week cadence, but i mean you guys actually have a very interesting look into sort of what's going on out there maybe some covid headwind that the sort of covid headwind that abate at the beginning of the quarter part i mean and picked up with delta more recently as we think about july and august. so mark or don, can you just maybe give us a look into how trends proceeded throughout fiscal 1q specific to dental and if you're willing to provide some color even more recently into the month of august and then i just got a separate follow-up. thanks.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
okay. jon, i know certainly maybe i'll start here, i mean i think as we indicated, we believe the dental industry is generally back to pre-pandemic levels both in terms of hygiene and restorative treatments and procedures, i think that's important to note. our customers continue to show confidence in their practices by the investments they're making, which suggest that they are expecting continued demand, strong demand trends. clearly, it's safe to go back to the dentist if you haven't been. and we obviously remain very encouraged as we spoke about the heightened awareness around the connection between oral health and overall health. so all these factors give us confidence in the long-term prospects for the health of the market. we have not seen any specific covid related slowdown overall, perhaps a pocket here or there. we're not anticipating any broad industry shutdown that we saw 18 months or so ago. and so we're really optimistic about the bounce back frankly in the dental industry the fact that we believe we're generally back to pre-pandemic levels of demand. our customers like i said are investing in their practices and we're optimistic about the macro trends there.
jon block -- stifel -- analyst
thank you, that's great color. thanks, mark. and i totally shift gears for the second, don, and this one is for you, just the change in rev rec i guess the gross to net that you called out in the release, it seems most prominent or more specific to the animal health consumables. just some color there. what is that, is that buy-sell agency, does that continue for the balance of the year maybe if you can just talk through that please?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, hi -- it's buy-sell agency and i think some miller vet, i think if you look at -- that should continue through the balance of the year as well.
jon block -- stifel -- analyst
okay, fair enough. thanks, guys.
operator
your next question comes from the line of elizabeth anderson from evercore. your line is open, please ask your question.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks so much. i would say without the changing dynamics in the dental end market should continue to smooth out hopefully as we go forward, but i was just wondering, given that it seems like the consumables and dental is growing above the market average despite sort of maybe your guys having less maybe some of the specialty products versus some. and i was just wondering, could you talk a little bit more about where you're seeing that outsized growth in sort of the core dental consumable business? that would be helpful. thank you.
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, elizabeth, this is mark. thank you. look in terms of our dental performance, our teams simply continue to execute well on our strategy. i think at the core it's about our people who are laser focused on being there for our customers and providing the comprehensive set of products, services, technology support to help our customers manage and run successful practices and that's a core part of our approach. i think also our decision early on in the pandemic to keep our teams fully staffed continues to pay off. we were there for our customers every step of the way throughout the pandemic, our teams provided valuable insights and resources to help our customers navigate through obviously a very challenging period. and so i think that those investments, that focus is paying off. i spoke earlier about the opportunity to engage with some of our field sales teams at our recent sales meetings. and i think our teams are energized and excited to continue to build on that momentum, again all centered around helping our customers succeed and it's certainly not focused on one specific segment of the market or one geography. i think our teams are doing well across the board whether it's in private practice, the dso market, regional dsos, etc. again, the teams are executing well and we're pleased with the performance so far.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore -- analyst
okay, that's super helpful. and then if you could give us any commentary on the dso market as we sort of pull out of hopefully the pandemic, where are you seeing the most activity, was there any change in sort of what they're interested in purchasing and any other competitive dynamics there?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
well, as i indicated, we're really pleased with the progress we're making on the dso space as well. it continues to be an area of focus for us. we've spoken i think over some period of time about the investments that we're making to build out our teams in our support infrastructure there, both at the regional dso and national dso level. like we've indicated, we're focused on working with those groups and customers that see the value proposition that patterson can bring to the table to help support their operations and their supported practices. so we continue to be pleased with our progress here. we're winning business in this segment. we continue to expect to invest and build out our team and our capabilities to support this segment, again with a real strong focus on working with those dsos who find a good fit with our value proposition and where obviously both parties can benefit.
elizabeth anderson -- evercore -- analyst
okay. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of nathan rich from goldman sachs. your line is open, please ask your question.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good morning. thanks for the question. maybe just starting with a follow-up on the revenue outlook. don. i guess if we look at the impact of the extra week, i think it added about $110 million to revenue, i guess if we adjust that out of the first quarter revenue base, is that $1.5 billion or so the right kind of jumping-off point as we think about how to trend revenue sequentially in 2q and over the balance of the year. i was just kind of going back to your comments around the end market seem more normalized, should we think about kind of 2q sequential growth off of 1q kind of in line with what has been historically which i think has been in the 6% range or so?
don zurbay -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think that i think in general terms are giving too much sort of guidance i guess i would say that your map seems pretty reasonable on all of that and that would be a good way to think about the way that year may rollout from q1 into q2 and q3 and q4.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, great. and then a follow-up on gross margins. can you help us think about how you're expecting the trend, i think they are still running below sort of the pre-pandemic rate, obviously a lot of change with respect to the mix of the business and waiting the infection control. but as we think about kind of the trajectory from here, how should we think about gross margin trending over the balance of the year nd have you seen any impact from inflation in freight cost or labor that would maybe factor into the gross margin numbers?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, so on the inflation question, i mean there has been some, but nothing that significant. i think that if you look at the trending of the gross margins throughout the year, typically the first quarter ends up being again with -- as with a lot of things our most challenging quarter and volumes are generally at the lowest. we did have the benefit of the extra week, so that was helpful. but i think if you look at how it may trend for the rest of the year, we expect there to be some increase in gross margin as you look to the rest of the fiscal year.
nathan rich -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great, thanks very much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of kevin caliendo from ubs. your line is open, please ask your question.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
great, thanks. so little bit of a follow-up to nathan's first question, if we had an extra week in 1q, where -- do you lose those days in any of the other quarters, should we contemplate calendar impacts in 2q 3q, 4q?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
no, it's a 53-week year versus a 52-week year.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
got it. so you're penciling again a little bit of an extra benefit of the share. okay, that's helpful. so to that end, if we're -- if we think about the beat in the quarter and the idea that production is maybe doing a little bit better than that had expected and everything else seems to be at least in line is when you think about your guidance range for the year and understanding that you just raised it, it's only the first quarter. should we say that that was really driven by the production beat or is it just the operations in the quarter, how should we think about where the business now is versus expectations that you set several months ago back in june, like what's changed [speech overlap]
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
so we started the year with a $0.15 range and what we did this quarter is we moved it to $0.10 range and basically took off the bottom $0.05 of the range. i think the way to read that is and we're at the end of the first quarter, we feel very confident about where the business is headed. we had a very good quarter. and i think it's really just an expression of the confidence we have in the year and the trajectory of the business and more to come as we get further into the year.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and one last one, the ppe donation, can we assume that this would sort of put an end to the ppe write-downs and donations and the like, do you feel comfortable that you are in a good spot with that from here. and i guess we are just trying to understand sort of is there further risk to ppe, i don't know i'm sure prices are down from where you bought it, that's why it happened. are you seeing enough stability there and enough understanding of supply demands that will limit your risk to do this going forward?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
well, obviously, it's been a pretty dynamic situation, but i think that as we sit here today, we feel good about where our inventory is and where our ppe kind of overall inventory sits in relation to demand for the rest of the year.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
can you -- just one quick follow-up to that. can you talk a little bit about what the prices were of the acquired ppe versus where they are now even just generally?
mark walchirk -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we haven't really gotten into that detail. obviously, the -- it varies widely depending on which type of ppe you're talking about. so there's been a lot of dynamics, it would be hard to really quantify it in any kind of macro sense.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
got it, ok. thank you.
