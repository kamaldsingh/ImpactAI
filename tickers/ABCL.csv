thank you. [operator instructions]. and the first question comes from the line of tiago fauth of credit suisse. your line is now open.
you may ask a question.
tiago fauth -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank for taking the question. congrats on the progress. so just a couple of questions for me on the business development context here. so you've added another 19 programs under contract, which, again, combined with your q1 results, kind of puts you well ahead -- well, at least, for our modeling.
but i'm curious if you can provide any comments on the actual pipeline and what does it look in terms of leads. is this space a new base that is actually sustainable over the remainder of the year? and similar question then from new program starts. again, you went from two in the first quarter to six and you provided some comments around that area, but is this increase also something that is sustainable as you grow the programs under contract portfolio? thanks.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, tiago. carl here, and i'll take those questions. so first, with respect to the addition of 19 programs under contract and whether or not that's sustainable. our view is that every indication is that there is very strong demand for our offering.
and we have only just begun to really build out the commercial force. when we launched into the year, the strategy was to build out capacity and to start to build up the business development team. the addition of neil has been a great boost there, as well as other senior members that we've brought on to the team recently. that, combined with a growing recognition of our leading position in the industry, and the expansion of our technology base, particularly the training platform and the orthomab platform, i think, are all strong tailwinds for the future.
i'll just temper that by saying that we do expect there to be variability from quarter to quarter, and we are taking a long view on the commercial enterprise. and in the long view, we do expect strong growth, driven by business development and by expanded technology. in terms of the execution, there was, i think, a healthy uptick from two starts in the last quarter to six starts this quarter. as discussed last time, that will also be variable from quarter to quarter.
but generally, as the business development pipeline fills up and as we start to build out the capacity, we do expect that trend to be positive. although i wouldn't say that will necessarily be so from quarter to quarter.
tiago fauth -- credit suisse -- analyst
perfect. now, i understood. congrats again on the progress.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, tiago.
operator
thank you. we have the next question, comes from the line of gal munda of berenberg. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
gal munda -- berenberg -- analyst
yes. hi. thanks for taking my questions. the first one just kind of expands on what we were just talking about and thinking about existing capacity that you have.
i guess the 19 pucs in the quarter is pretty impressive. but how do we think about the capacity, what could be doable if your commercial team really ramps up to where you want it to be, say, in a year or so?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, gal. carl here, and i'll take that one again. but first of all, i think it's important to stress that the program starts are currently not bottleneck by capacity. there's delay between putting programs under contract and getting a work plan in place and having the reagents and the kick-off meeting that are needed for us to count that as a start.
and so because of that, there is often work that is done for some time in assembling all of that material to begin that happens prior to us reporting out a program start. also, we have the capacity today to do significantly more programs. of course, when we don't have those starts ongoing, we also have a very heavy investment on platform development, and we have the ability to shift that back and forth, if needed. but given the investments that we've made, as well as the improvements in technology and efficiency that comes with the data science, we don't anticipate a pinch on capacity and execution, although, of course, we need to keep our foot on the gas to make sure that remains the case.
gal munda -- berenberg -- analyst
ok. perfect. and then just kind of thinking strategically right now, the way you think -- the way you've been engaging. obviously, you have downward -- downstream participation with all your new programs under contract.
but just when you engage with partners, what do you tend to prefer these days? thinking something along the lines of also equity investments and the way you're thinking about equity participation or potentially a smaller less developed partner who has a big upside, i guess, because of that. or how do you balance that with kind of your flagship pharma customers when you're kind of thinking about taking new programs?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
yes. i would not say that we have a preferred customer profile or a preferred business model. what we focus on is finding the perfect match between the partners' needs, the technology, and the structure of the deal that we're putting in place. and what we're looking for there is to find high-quality partners that are working on great science.
to date, we have managed to secure what i consider to be an elite group of partners that have the wherewithal to develop drugs or that have very innovative ideas at the early stage of the process and are needing the technology to move that forward. this quarter, a great example of that is the deal that we announced with eqrx, where we've taken a different deal structure. and one where, in addition to providing value in the technology, we have now created an option for us to deepen our position in these programs with the ability to invest at various stages. so that's one example of us being flexible in deal-making in a way that aligns interest and creates maximum value for our shareholders.
gal munda -- berenberg -- analyst
thank you. thanks, carl. appreciate it. have a great rest of the day.
operator
thank you. next question we have from the line of stephen willey of stifel. your line is now open. you may ask your question.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions. congratulations on the progress. i guess maybe just an initial question on business mix.
so i guess when you look at the programs under contract, which you have vast participation, i think you said there's 115 of them. i see that there's 24 that's within global pharma. and just kind of wondering if that 20% or so distribution is in line with where you want the mix of business to be. and i guess is it a little bit more challenging to win some of that business on the big pharma side, just given the fact that there may be some internal infrastructure on the workflow side or maybe just some inertia or i guess, anything that you can speak to on that front.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
sure. thanks for the question. i think where i'd start with that one is that abcellera has a platform that we've built over the last 10 years that is both able to solve problems that have traditionally been out of reach and also is exceptionally versatile, and i believe that's reflected in the diversity of our portfolio. so if you look at our portfolio and the programs, we've got everything from the small private companies to the large pharmaceutical companies.
we're working on pretty much every indication for which antibodies are being developed. we are doing programs that are connecting into a whole range of modalities, including classic antibodies and next-generation molecules. so in many ways, there's a lot of diversification in that portfolio, and that is a key part of our strategy. on the flip side, all of those programs have something in common, and it is that we have conviction in the science, we have conviction and faith in the leadership teams.
the deal with eqrx being a terrific example of seasoned drug developers that are taking a very innovative commercial approach to developing drugs. and of course, all of those programs have also in common that they're being driven on best-in-class technology, and that is the value that we're bringing to the partnerships.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and then i guess, when you look at the mix of targets, i guess, whether it's challenging or a bit more conventional. is there a correlation there between, i guess, targets that are deemed to be difficult and the business mix, i.e., is --
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
absolutely.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and on the one who's lobbying even more difficult targets?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
that's correct. i mean it's not a hard rule. but as you might expect, the large and highly enabled groups are the ones that have spent a decade or more building up their own technologies, their own teams and expertise and capacity. and so there will be many programs that they have for which they believe they have the tools in-house to prosecute those.
our objective in the long run is to be able to show increases in speed and efficiency that can help us to better capture that market and to provide value to those customers in those target classes. but those large and enabled groups also have a big roster of programs that have either been worked on ineffectively or have been put on the shelf because they're generally deemed to be intractable. we are laser-focused on the investments to push back that frontier of technology and unlock those target spaces. in many cases, a good example being gpcrs and ion channels.
we have had success, i believe we are at the front of the pack. but the work is not yet done. so this is an effort that's going to persist in the coming years. and over time, i believe we're going to be able to help those groups to move forward therapeutics into areas that have been neglected, not for reasons of a lack of targets or clinical validation, but rather for technology limitations.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on getting three more candidates in the clinic.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
you bet. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. we have the next question, comes from the line of gary nachman of bmo capital. your line is now open. you may ask a question.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. first, on the three new molecules into the clinic, that was certainly good to see. the 1404, we should see that data this summer.
but when can we start to see some clinical data for the two new novarock molecules? and what sort of milestones does that trigger, if you give us just order of magnitude?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, gary. so first of all, the two novarock assets are at the very beginning of clinical development, one having just entered phase 1, i believe, and the other one with an approved ind application. so we typically structure deals to get milestones at the initiation of the various phases of clinical development, so phase 1, 2, and 3. phase 1 data normally doesn't take that long.
phase 2 trials are longer depending on the indication and the clinical design, of course, enrollment. it's worth highlighting that novarock, of course, is the driver of those programs. and these are programs that we acquired through the acquisition of trianni. so they will be taking the lead in reporting out any data that comes from those development efforts.
for us, it's a terrific endorsement of the trianni platform. and i hope and believe a foreshadowing of what we can expect to come over the coming months and years from that platform as it's put in the hands of partners and also used extensively in our technology stack.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and just to clarify, so when you show that for 012 that you're looking at three therapeutic areas, that's three separate programs. correct? so that's what you talked about earlier, you could have a single molecule doing several different programs.
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
no. i think what i mentioned in the -- this is andrew speaking, gary, what i mentioned is that we can have one program or abcellera discovery program that can yield multiple molecules that make it to the clinic. so the example there was the covid program, which counts as one program and one program start in our capital metrics, but it had yielded two molecules that have made it to the clinic. so bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab.
in the case of the novarock assets, they're going after specific indications. and i think you can find the details of exactly how those clinical trials are getting set up publicly.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then on -- go ahead. yes, please.
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
yes. i just was going to point out that we made that second metric for these molecules in the clinic where they're using licensed technology. and we did the trianni acquisition, which is we've been working out very well. it's a beautiful addition to the technology stack.
we're able to integrate it immediately into our business development activities. and in addition, we are able to generate revenues from the licenses, as we've seen like well over 20 million in the first half of the year. and when we bought the company, it came with a portfolio of previous licenses that have been licensed out, of which novarock is one. and there are over 20 of those licenses, which have downstream milestones and royalties, which we would expect to see hitting these metrics into the future.
but just as a reminder that those 20 or so licenses are not included in the programs because -- that we have in our other key metrics. those are exclusively our own abcellera-derived antibody discovery programs. but when they -- when those licensees have molecules that hit the clinic, we will count them in this other metric. it's one of the reasons we needed to change the definition of that metric.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. and then just you highlighted the eqrx and the tachyon, your recent partnerships with this sort of new deal structure with more downstream potential value. so i'm curious for those types of partnerships and deals, how long were those in the work? like, does it take a while to get those types of deals done? and then that's also sort of playing into the cadence that you're talking about for new programs for the rest of the year.
i'm just wondering if covid, that could cause any delays to some programs just in terms of being able to communicate with potential partners. that color would be helpful.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
it's hard to put a hard number on what is the representative sales cycle. there's quite a range. it depends on the firm and it depends on whether or not you come into any difficulty in negotiating the contract. typically, from first engagement to a signed term sheet is anywhere from a month to three months.
and from that term sheet to a contract can be a couple of months to much, much longer if you run into some contractual difficulties. it is important, and we do have a strong funnel. so we maintain that activity. and so you need to keep working on this, but there is a robust business development pipeline and we're in good shape for the future.

carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, tryn, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. it's my pleasure to provide an update of the second quarter of 2021, in which we continue to execute on our long-term strategy for growth. first, we closed the quarter with nearly $800 million in cash and over $60 million in accounts receivables and accrued accounts receivable. in addition to our strong liquidity position, we maintained our forward momentum showing strong growth in our core business across key performance indicators, including: 19 new programs under contract, bringing our total number of programs to 138; six new program starts, bringing the total number of starts to 60; and three new molecules that have entered into the clinic, bringing the total number of molecules in the clinic to four.
two of those molecules are from our covid-19 program with eli lilly, which continues to be both a proof point for our technology capabilities and business model and a source of nondilutive funding. unfortunately, and despite vaccine rollout, we are seeing a strong uptick in covid-19 cases globally with well over 100,000 cases reported daily in the u.s. alone. our first covid-19 therapeutic antibody is bamlanivimab.
bamlanivimab administered together with etesevimab was paused in june because at the time, the beta and gamma variants, which are resistant to this combination were prevalent in the u.s. today, the most prevalent variant, both in the u.s. and globally, is the delta variant. preclinical data demonstrate that bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together retain neutralization activity against the delta variant, as well as other variants currently in circulation in many countries.
i note that there is an existing supply of bamlanivimab and etesevimab that we believe could be used effectively to help patients today, both in the u.s. and around the world. our second therapeutic antibody for covid-19, 1404, which is now known as bebtelovimab, is currently in phase 2 clinical testing with eli lilly. preclinical results posted to a preprint server in june demonstrate that bebtelovimab is an exceptionally potent antibody that binds to a highly conserved region of the spike protein.
the data also show that bebtelovimab is effective against all variants of concern and of interest, including the alpha, beta, gamma, epsilon, iota, kappa, and delta variants. bebtelovimab is being evaluated alone and in the three-way combination together with bamlanivimab and etesevimab. as indicated in our last quarterly call, we expect top-line data from these trials this summer. we look forward to clinical results from eli lilly on the use of bebtelovimab and believe it has strong potential to be an effective tool in the long-term fight against covid-19.
as previously noted on earnings calls, our work in covid-19 represents only one program in our portfolio. in total, we have 138 programs under contract with 33 different partners. these programs span nearly every indication for its therapeutic antibodies and associated modalities are used. of the 138 programs in our portfolio, we know the therapeutic areas for 95 of them with the remainder attributable to slots into which targets have yet to be elected.
these programs target indications in oncology, pain, nerve regeneration, infectious disease, autoimmune disease, allergic inflammation, ophthalmology, women's health, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders. beyond therapeutic areas, our portfolio includes a range of different target types. about 28% of the targets our partners have selected fall into the difficult or challenging area and may well be considered intractable using legacy technologies. these include multipath transmembrane protein targets, high homology targets, peptide mhc complex targets, and others.
in pursuing therapies against their targets, our partners are looking to leverage the next generation of antibody modalities. each of these brings its own specific and demanding requirements, making diversity and data analytics critical. today, we are working with our partners on programs that cover the full range of target modalities, including iggs, igms, and igas; bispecific antibodies, leveraging our proprietary orthomab technology; single-chain antibodies; car-t cell therapies; radioisotope conjugates; and cns-delivered antibodies. the value our capabilities provide to partners is reflected in our deal structures, which include downstream participation that directly increases with the challenge of finding the right antibody for the target.
while the majority of our programs with downstream participation are with partners that are publicly listed companies, mostly in the large cap and mid-cap bracket, we also work selectively with much earlier stage ventures. most of these programs are with companies considered biotech. but for a significant number of programs, we are working with a range of global pharma partners. during this work, we aim to create long-term shareholder value, building a large and diversified portfolio of royalty and other downstream positions in the next generation of antibody-based therapies.
and we are seeing that our portfolio captures strong diversification across therapeutic areas, modalities and partner types. within the total portfolio, we have started work on 60 programs. currently, once we deliver candidates and the associated data packages to our partners, they take on the late-stage preclinical development that ultimately leads to an ind application. this process typically takes two to four years, depending on the program and depending on the experience and resources of our partners.
as previously discussed, we plan to greatly accelerate the time line to ind application down to one year through forward integration, adding cmc and gmp manufacturing capabilities to our tech stack. this quarter, we secured a site for our new 130,000 square foot antibody manufacturing facility. when complete, this facility will allow us to provide our partners with a full and integrated solution that goes from target right through to ind submission. turning to business development.
our pipeline continues to be strong, showing strong demand for our partnership business and adding more deals with different types of companies. of the 35 programs under contract that were added in the first half of this year, all programs include downstream participation typically achieved through clinical development milestones, commercial development milestones, and royalties. over the past year, the general trend has been increasing royalty positions, reflecting additional technology capabilities, an expanded scope of work, and our recognized leading position in the market. this also encompasses partnerships with equity or equity-like positions as a way for us to capture yet more value.
what i'm excited about this quarter is that we announced two new deals, one with tachyon and one with eqrx, that represent a further amplification of our business model, through which we have the option to invest in the subsequent stages of preclinical, clinical, and commercial development for a greater share of the assets. we believe that these deal structures have the potential to create more long-term value for our shareholders, providing the option to deepen our position in select programs, and in turn, yielding economics similar to an internal pipeline while still staying true to our business model of being a technology enabler for the industry. today, our approach is to capture downstream value can generally be grouped in three broad categories. first, royalties and milestones where milestone payments are earned at various points of clinical and commercial progress and royalties that are typically but not exclusively in the low to mid-single-digit range.
second, discovery partnerships with equity or equity-like participation, which has been a feature within the last year of deals that include invetx, abdera, and angios. and third, deals that include an option to invest, as mentioned, which are similar to those we've announced with partners, tachyon and eqrx. within our portfolio of 138 programs under contract, we have an equity or equity-like position in about two dozen programs, and we have almost a dozen programs where we have the option to invest in the molecules we discover. in the future, we may expand our deal types further as we explore new ways to capture the value of our partnership model.
to lead our bd efforts and the expansion of our commercial team, we recently welcomed industry veteran, neil berkley as chief business officer. neil brings more than 20 years of strategic planning and corporate and business development expertise across a wide range of transactions and therapeutic indications. we are excited to have him join our leadership team. before handing off to andrew to discuss the financial results, i'd like to reemphasize how our efforts today support our long-term vision for making drug discovery faster, more efficient, and more cost-effective.
first, we believe our technology can solve discovery problems and unlock new opportunity for therapeutic antibody development and that this will be a source of continued growth within the industry. second, our strategy emphasizes technology integration at scale. this is not just state-of-the-art technologies and ip, but also the assembly of a world-class team of scientists, data systems, facilities, equipment, and processes into a high-performing haul that is a critical advantage to achieving compounding returns and to creating a long-term competitive advantage. third, we are leveraging vertical integration as a central theme to accelerate and also to have control over the entire preclinical process.
and fourth, we're continuing to invest in technological differentiation to broaden our reach across the industry. examples of this include our bispecific and humanized rodent technologies, as well as internal efforts that we believe in time will unlock high-value target spaces that are currently out of reach. in the long run, our goal is to replace the legacy technologies of today and the traditional models of doing business and to help the industry continue its growth and become more efficient. we believe that we have already established a world-leading technology position, which we are now bringing to the market at scale and that we have created a new technology curve that will lead to continual improvement, not just now but for decades to come.
and with that, i'll turn it over to andrew booth, our cfo, to provide an overview of our second-quarter 2021 financials.
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
thanks, carl. let me start by highlighting our key business metrics. we ended the first half of 2021 with 138 programs under contract with 33 different partners. that's an 82% increase in programs under contract as compared to the end of q2 in 2020.
we continue to see the combined positive impact of investments in our business development team and the increasing awareness of our platform on our business development activity. in the quarter, we added tachyon and eqrx, as well as two other new undisclosed partners to our partnership portfolio. as is the case for all new programs under contract after 2018, the 19 new programs in q2 include downstream participation for abcellera. reflecting the substantial value we bring to both tachyon and eqrx programs, we have negotiated the ability to deepen our position in the participation of the success of the molecules we discover.
we are doing this through options to invest in the molecules for a greater share of the resulting product sales. also in the quarter, we started six more programs to take us to 60 cumulative starts, eight of which occurred during the first half of 2021. we continue to build capacity and to engage with many partners on preparations for their program starts. we expect a robust number of program starts in the second half of 2021 as a part of this generally accelerating trend.
and while starts will always be somewhat irregular, the increase in programs under contract is a leading indicator of the longer-term trajectory expected for program starts. starting this quarter, we will share with you our new business metric, molecules in the clinic. molecules in the clinic represent the number of unique molecules for which an ind or equipment application has been approved based on an antibody that was discovered by us or by a partner using licensed stem cell and technology. we view this metric as an indication of our near and midterm potential revenue from downstream milestone fees and royalty payments in the longer term.
in q2, three more molecules have followed bamlanivimab to reach the clinic, taking us to a total of four. carl has already talked about bebtelovimab, reaching phase 2, the second antibody from our covid antibody program with lilly. the other two, nbl-012, which recently reached phase 1, and nbl-015 with an approved ind, are molecules which novarock discovered using the trianni flagship mouse under license. we congratulate the team at novarock on achieving these important milestones and wish them well in their quest to help patients suffering from inflammatory diseases and those suffering from gastric cancer.
as you can see, the change in metric from our former reporting of discovery programs in the clinic was required to reflect two new dynamics. first, one program can yield multiple molecules as is the case for the single covid-19 antibody discovery program with lilly having produced both bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab. second, as a part of an acquisition, we may come to own stakes in molecules for which the company is also entitled to milestone payments and royalties, although the discovery was not performed as an abcellera program. this is the case for several trianni humanized rodent license agreements like the one with novarock.
we believe that this updated metric together with the additional list of molecules will give you a better understanding of abcellera's clinically advanced downstream portfolio, a portfolio that already includes over a dozen other preclinical assets resulting from abcellera discovery programs that have downstream participation for the company. turning to revenue. revenue in the quarter was nearly $28 million, 2.5 times what it was in q2 of 2020. we earned over $20 million in royalties from lilly's sales of bamlanivimab in combination with etesevimab that were not present in the second quarter of 2020.
a reminder that directly attributable to the royalty revenue we earned from lilly's sales of bamlanivimab were approximately $3.5 million in royalty fees payable to the nih. as discussed on our last earnings call, we expected royalty revenues in q2 to be well below where they were in q1. as per lilly's recent guidance, the outlook for royalties from lilly's sales of existing covid products for the remainder of 2021 is likely diminished. nevertheless, we believe there is potential for sustained revenue from covid products, including bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab for three key reasons.
first, covid is unfortunately, but apparently on the trajectory to become endemic. second, bamlanivimab, together with etesevimab, has neutralization activity against the majority of variants, including and in particular, against the now dominant delta variant. and third, bebtelovimab has been shown in preclinical studies to be highly potent and effective against variants of concern, including the delta variant. as previously noted, we view all royalties from covid products as a nondilutive source of funding for the company and importantly, as a proof point of what happens when one of the many programs in our portfolio is successful.
in our trianni platform and acquisition, which we completed in 2020, it continued to contribute directly to our top line, generating milestone payments of $1 million and licensing fees of approximately $300,000 in the quarter. that brings the total revenue from the trianni platform in the first half of the year to over $20 million. the primary benefit of the trianni platform, of course, lies in enhancing the technology stack of our discovery programs, and we continue to invest and develop the next generation of animals internally to expand those capabilities. and we're pleased to see the licensees succeed with the trianni flagship most in their own programs.
lastly, we earned research fees of approximately $5 million in the quarter, which are attributable to the range of discovery programs we worked on for our partners. this is a $3 million less than in the second quarter of 2020 where we received substantial fees from our paid covid-related work with darpa and with lilly. looking at operating expenses. our research and development spend in the quarter was $15 million, a nearly $6 million increase over the previous year.
we expect that our investments into r&d will continue to grow as we keep expanding our r&d team's capabilities and capacity. this allows us to deliver on our partner programs, as well as to enhance our technology stack organically. in sales and marketing, expenses for the quarter were just over $1 million, a nearly threefold increase from the same quarter in 2020. this reflects the ongoing growth of our business development team, capabilities, reach, and capacity to connect with the strong global demand that we continue to see.
general and administration expenses for the quarter were roughly $11 million, compared to nearly 2 million in the second quarter of 2020. almost $5 million of this increase are related to higher noncash stock-based compensation, bringing us in line with other publicly listed companies. the increase is otherwise driven by the need to support a much larger business and the associated legal and corporate requirements of it being a publicly listed company, as well as ongoing investments to protect our intellectual property. for the second quarter, we are reporting a net loss of approximately $2 million, compared with nearly $7 million profit in the second quarter of 2020.
in terms of earnings per share, this works out to a loss of $0.01 per share on both a basic and diluted basis. this approximately breakeven result is the net effect of, on the one hand, our ongoing investments to expand and enhance our discovery program and to grow our diversified portfolio of long-term stakes in the next generation of antibody drugs. and on the other hand, the early success enjoyed by our first molecules in the market. looking at the entire first half of the year, we have generated revenue of $230 million and a net income of over $150 million.
that equates to an earnings per share of $0.42 on a basic and $0.36 on a diluted basis year to date. turning to cash flows. operating activities for the first six months of 2021 contributed almost $267 million, which includes the collection of the accrued accounts receivable balance from december 2020 and the strong first-quarter royalties earned from bamlanivimab. on the investing activity side, the first half of the year shows a $33 million land purchase for our gmp facility in vancouver.
note that half of this investment will be reimbursed from our government of canada sif funding, making the net investment approximately $17 million once the claim has been received. the roughly $21 million of cash flow to equity investees in the first half included investments for construction financing of our facilities. this cash funding will be returned to us upon completion of construction and on the subsequent more market takeout financing, earning us low single-digit interest in the interim. we finished the quarter with almost $793 million of cash and cash equivalents and nearly $65 million of accounts receivable and accrued accounts receivable.
in the first half of the year, we've built this strong liquidity position that allows us to execute our strategy and continue to build capacity, expand the platform, and pursue business and corporate development initiatives. and with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. operator?

thank you, sir. [operator instructions] your first question is from gal munda with berenberg capital. your line is open.
gal munda -- berenberg bank -- analyst
yeah. hi. thanks for taking my questions the first one, i just like to ask around the program starts and the new packs in the quarter, obviously, a very, very strong performance. is there any sort of common element to those either parts and program starts that you're seeing between different types of customers, maybe split between the larger pharma customers or partners, sorry, or more biotech? how did you see the digital trends in that?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
sure, gal. this is carl. i'm happy to take that one. thanks for the question.
so first, with respect to additional pucks in the quarter, those were largely attributable to the two partnerships that we mentioned, both being multiyear multi-target deals with everest and with moderna. in terms of program starts, one of the things that we're very pleased with is the increasing diversity of different partners that are represented in program starts. and so that is a good mix of early stage of large companies and of the sort of mid-cap or mid- to small-cap biotech companies. i'll just add that from a business development perspective, we are seeing a lot of inbound from a mix of customers.
as i mentioned, the bispecific capabilities are definitely driving some of that. and in terms of performance, we have now added 55 new programs under contract in the first quarter. pardon me, we've added 52 programs under contract in the first three months, part nine months, let me try that one more time. we have added 52 programs under contract in the last nine months.
that is exceedingly, but that is very strong and has exceeded our expectations for the year. and so we're feeling great about the business development. and really, as we mentioned, are now turning our attention toward room execution.
gal munda -- berenberg bank -- analyst
perfect. and then just as a follow-up. when i think about the new molecule in the clinic that you reported from embedded. in terms of -- that was based on your relationship back from a couple of years ago, right? so is that how you see most of these relationships are playing out starting the program and then a couple of years in starting to kind of to the -- in terms of the timing, that seems to be pretty short time line, but just any comments on that and whether that's something that could continue more of as we exit this year?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
that's a great question. so this is the first program to come out of the inditex collaboration. as we mentioned, it comes from a program that was initiated in 2019. so we are very pleased with the speed of that work, particularly given that at the time of initiating invetx was still just a company that was in the early stages of being formed.
as a general trend, we believe that our investments in technology and also the partners that we are now making collaborations with and the types of programs that we're working on have the potential to result in increasingly fast time lines from initiation to programs in the clinic. of course, it's going to take some time to bear that out. but it is a trend that we are certainly keeping our eye on and one that we think is reinforcing our business thesis, which is that investments in technology and capacity and partnerships can help shorten that time from ideas to clinical testing.
gal munda -- berenberg bank -- analyst
yeah. thank you.
operator
your next question is from the line of stephen willey with stifel. your line is open.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. was just wondering if you can maybe expand upon the cd3 work that you're doing? it sounds like you're developing your own in-house panel of novel cd3 targeting antibodies. i know that there's a lot of interest in the drug development space around trying to find some attenuated cd3 binders that maybe aren't as aggressive on the crs side as some of the current piece of redirecting bispecifics right now.
and so would just be interested in terms of how you're functionally characterizing these in-house? and when do you think these might be ready to pair up with the orthomab platform?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, steve. carl here. so first, i think a lot of your comments certainly resonate. as i mentioned, we see a lot of interest from companies big and small, that are looking to get into this space with bispecific antibodies that can redirect t cells.
it's one of the areas, i think, that is showing terrific promise, but also one of the areas where the technological hurdles are much higher than in other cases. so that's an opportunity for us. we are an enabler through technology. the ortho map platform solves a big chunk of that by being -- by allowing you to pair antibodies and produce molecules that can be expressed well and are developable in a standard manufacturing process.
with the t-cell redirection, as you mentioned, there's now good evidence that the success of molecules depends very much not only on the properties of the cd3 engager but also on how that particular cd3 engager has been paired with the binding partner, which, of course, depends on the target. and so there is a requirement of generating a large panel of cd3. so do you have the starting substrate to test those combinations, something that we have initiated. it's not yet done, but we feel confident in our capabilities to deliver on that.
and in parallel, we are building internal capabilities to express those advice-specifics and do the functional characterization so that we will have a full workflow that can start really just at the name of the target and can move that through to generating binders for the target panel cd3s and functional data that can help to assess which of those pairs and with cd3 molecule is best suited for that application. so that's the goal. there's a lot of work to do there. we've indicated that we hope to share progress on that in the new year.
and i'll just emphasize that we do see this as an area where abcellera is extremely well-positioned to help companies more effectively bring therapies to patients and one where we are devoting significant resources to make sure that we do that as quickly as possible.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. interesting. and then just on the moderna collaboration. i know maybe it seems a little bit nontraditional relative to some of your other partnerships whereby there's a deliverable that you're providing, but moderna still has to do a little bit of reverse engineering to turn it into a therapeutic.
so can you maybe comment as to whether or not the economics of the per program moderna collaboration are consistent with, i guess, the base case economics that you're extracting across all these different partnerships?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
yes. great question, steve. so first, on the moderna collaboration in general, moderna obviously is a company with tremendous resources right now and also world-class capabilities rna therapeutics. there is an opportunity to use rna to deliver antibodies.
and we are very pleased that they have selected us to be their discovery engine, recognizing that to attempt to build that internally would cause undue delays and ultimately result in working with technologies that are not where they need to be to prosecute those programs. in terms of the business terms, or maybe i'll back up a second. you mentioned that they still have work to do. at this point, when we hand off candidates.
right now, it is always -- or it is currently in our partner's hands to do the manufacturing toward the final therapeutic. now most often, that is done through the traditional path, which is to generate a cell line and then to bring that through the regular gmp manufacturing process. in this case, the manufacturing instead is just the manufacture of the rna and then the rna is delivered to the patient. so conceptually, while the path is different, conceptually, i don't think it's distinct from our more difficult collaborations.
and directly to the business terms, obviously, we're not disclosing details, but the terms are in line with our recent partnerships. and i'd say as a general trend over the last couple of years, we are seeing our deal value go up in recognition of the platform and increasing demand that we're seeing from partners.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. 
operator
and your next question is from the line of puneet souda with svb leerink. your line is open.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
yeah. hi, carl. thanks for taking the questions. so first on covid and quick -- two quick ones, if i could, on the products and the pipeline and partnerships.
so on the 400,000 doses, that's really great to see in the fourth quarter for you and the rest in 2022. but as you saw, there was a strong data from pfizer on antivirals and prior to that with mark. with that in mind, what's your expectation for bamlanivimab in 2022, i mean, obviously, there's been a lot of discussion around this among the investors. so i just wanted to get your thoughts as to what -- how you're thinking about this.
and i also wanted to just confirm that you're fully expecting the u.s. orders, the current -- at least the fourth quarter and the first quarter wants to come through.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, puneet. let me start by reiterating something that i think we've been consistent on through all the calls. we got involved with covid-19 because we found ourselves with a technology that was needed and going to respond quickly. we are very proud of the work that we've done with our partner, eli lilly, in bringing now two molecules into the clinic and one faminemumab and bamlanivimab with etesevimab that have had a major impact in helping patients with covid-19 over the past 12-plus months.
in the near term, we have -- or in recent times, we have seen bamlanivimab and etesevimab shipping out in the u.s. and with the recent order, we are -- given the recent order, we would expect that that would result in additional revenues, as we mentioned, in q4 and q1 of next year. those revenues, we view as upside and as nondilutive financing that help us to reinvest in our core business which is taking a much broader view of antibody therapeutics, investing for the long run to be able to help move ideas into molecules if we test in the clinic. -- for hundreds of different programs over the coming years.
so that's where our focus is. now in terms of the recent results on small molecules, both from merck and pfizer, i think both are impressive. the pfizer result, if it stands, i think is very impressive and good news for the world. and certainly, one would expect that that would take some fraction certainly of the therapeutic applications i still believe that there are patients that cannot easily be protected from vaccines and that antibodies would provide a prophylactic application that would be important for those patients.
i also think that there is a scenario where antibodies would be chosen in place of small molecules, even in the therapeutic application. but of course, no one really has a clear view of how that's going to play out. if it -- if our molecules continue to be used, that will be great. we'll be happy to have helped with the covid-19 problem.
and of course, the revenue will help us to double down the business. but as andrew said, the results of covid-19 is not something we view as integral to our business.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful. on the biospecific program, i mean, you briefly mentioned about that that's obviously gaining traction for you. wondering with the new contract adds in the quarter, that was '17 contract that was obviously strong since the time of ipo.
could you parse out for us at this point in time, what is the primary component primary driver among the sort of the tech stack and overall services and turnaround times and overall partnership that you're offering that continues to bring increasingly more partners to you today. if you could sort of parse that out? and is there a differentiating factor today, technology-wise service-wise, that's bringing -- continues to bring increasingly more partners to you.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, puneet, for the question. it's one that's very difficult to answer directly because the needs of every partner from a technology perspective are going to depend very much upon the application, the modality of the targets that they're going after. there is a trend that we definitely see happening. and one that i feel is a real tailwind for abcellera.
we're certainly seeing that the provision of technology or capabilities in discovery and development. we feel it's bifurcating into two classes. there are groups that are running sort of fee-for-service low-cost solutions that are fragmented. and then there are companies like ourselves, and in fact, i think we're unique in this capacity that are investing in technology and bringing it together in a fully integrated workflow.
when there are partners out there who are experienced in drug development and recognize the value of having the very best molecules, they're coming to us, and that's where we want to play. we want to work with people that appreciate technology, capabilities, speed, service, infrastructure, and know-how as ways to help them meet their goals of bringing therapies to patients more quickly.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
ok. and just last one, if i could -- can you just at least maybe size the market for us there? or i know you can't provide the indication, but maybe just help us understand, is this more of a proof of the platform again? or could this be more of a meaningful royalty of the product was to get to market? just wanted to clarify that.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
great question again, puneet. so first of all, animal health is a relatively new application of biologics. it's one that in recent years has taken off much faster than i think people had expected. so there is clearly a need and a market opportunity for taking some of the innovations that have been applied over the years in human health and applying them to companion animals.
with respect to the first program that's moving forward, we are very pleased about that program, and we think it's a significant but any program that moves into the clinic is not one that we would see as being a main driver of our business. that's not how our business works. our business is much more about providing solutions that over time, build a large and diversified portfolio so that we can, in the long run, generate returns that are exceeding what is typical in the industry, but not be tied to any particular program and therefore, not taking on the binary risk.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it, guys. thank you.
operator
and your last question is from denis reznik with bmo. your line is open.
denis reznik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thank you for taking my question. just a couple for me.
so you guys have obviously had a very successful 2020, 2021 in terms of new program starts, programs under contract, and all the other key metrics. can you talk a little bit about the vision for 2022 and what we should expect to see the same run rate in key metric growth or maybe a little like tapering as we move forward? and just a quick one. if you could provide some more context on what kind of ramp-up we can see you guys do upon the completion of the cmc and gmp manufacturing facilities.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, dennis. there's a few questions in there, so i'll try to make sure i get all of them, but feel free to redirect if i miss one of the points. so as we look at 2022, i don't think there are going to be any surprises. we have two been investing in the platform in infrastructure and in building our workforce to build capacity to execute on the partnership business.
and hand-in-hand in that, we've been making investments on our business development team to make sure that we're bringing in the programs under contract that are the leading indicators of the work that ultimately translates into starts. at this point, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we built a robust book of business, and we are now working closely with partners to make sure we've got the reagents. we've got the work plan set and we're starting to see an uptick as a steady rhythm of starts in this quarter. and that trend, while it may go up and down with some variability from quarter to quarter, we expect to be growing if average over some reasonable period off into the future.
so next year is going to be a year of execution of continuing to build our business development team and on focusing on moving programs as quickly as possible through our stacks that our partners can get them into late age preclinical development and ultimately to the clinic. in terms of the cmc and gmp manufacturing project. as i mentioned, that is a big project and our top priority in r&d and platform development. it includes translational science, building cmc capabilities, and building a new facility for gmp manufacturing.
that project is currently on track. it is scheduled to be live in the first half of 2024. once live, i expect there'll be some ramp-up in terms of building the workforce and the capacity but the facility is designed to be able to handle north of 30 programs per year. and so that's how we see that.
and of course, that's a project that will be at version one in 2024, and we'll continue to make investments to integrated with the front end of the stack with an objective of shrinking the time from initiation of a program to ind filing.
denis reznik -- bmo capital markets -- analyst

carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thank you, tryn, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. it's my pleasure to provide an update for the third quarter of 2021. we continue to focus on our long-term business objectives, and we've made strong progress executing across the organization. we closed the quarter with nearly $800 million in liquidity, including over $750 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and over $40 million in accounts and accrued receivables.
in addition to our strong financial position, we posted strong growth across key business metrics, including 17 new programs under contract, bringing our total number of programs to 155, nine new program starts bringing our total number of starts to 69 and one new molecule that has entered the clinic, bringing our total number of molecules in the clinic to five. first, to frame the results from this quarter, it is important to stress our strategy and how we believe this will drive long-term value for patients, for our partners, and for our shareholders. there are no shortcuts in building a truly great company. we are focused on building something of substance, something that will endure and something that hasn't existed before.
we are building a vertically integrated technology staff that covers all steps in preclinical antibody discovery and development. what makes us different is that we are replacing the legacy approaches that have their roots in the 1980s with an interlocking chain of modern technologies, including microfluidics, genomics, single-cell analysis, protein engineering, computational methods, and artificial intelligence. these technologies are held together by software engineering and hyperscale data science that provides and that we believe we'll continue to provide increasing gains in efficiency and scalability across our workflow. along with our investments in infrastructure and high-performance workforces, we believe our technology allows us to respond to any discovery challenge across the industry and to deliver candidates more quickly and with higher probability of success.
we believe that we have already established best-in-world capabilities across this critical part of the drug development workflow. and we continue to expand our technology. now forward integrating with investments in translational science, cmc, and gmp manufacturing. we expect these capabilities to be in place in the first half of 2024.
this will allow us to go from a drug target to delivering the dna sequence of lead antibody, the data needed to support an investigational new drug application filing, and the drug substance that supports clinical testing in phase i and phase ii. by putting all these capabilities together, we believe we can help our partners bring drugs to patients faster and with greater probability of success. in the long run, our bold vision is to be recognized as the industry's premier drug discovery engine to have built the platform with capacity to deliver lead antibodies for over 100-plus discovery programs per year and to be supporting dozens of these through ind filing each year. all of this done in half the time that it currently takes.
building on our technology foundation, our business generates multiple sources of value for shareholders. these include upfront payments for tech assets, research payments for executing on programs, licensing fees and milestones, and royalties associated with clinical and commercial success of the molecule that we discovered. this year, we have expanded our deal structures to add new ways to capture value, including taking equity stakes and building the option to invest and deepen our participation in molecules that have come from our platform. through this business model, we are building a large and diversified portfolio of stakes in the next generation of antibody-based therapies.
by picking great partners, by member gene technology advantages, and by working broadly across different indications and modalities, we believe we can generate long-term value and superior returns, while at the same time, not assuming the binary risk that is normally associated with drug development. today, we have built a portfolio of 155 programs under contract and 131 of these have downstream participation. we're working on indications that span oncology, pain, neurodegeneration infectious disease, autoimmune disease, allergic inflammation, ophthalmology, women's health, and cardiovascular disease. through our programs, we deliver antibodies to be developed for the full range of therapeutic modalities.
this includes iggs, igms and igas, bispecific antibodies, single-chain antibodies, car t cell therapies, radioisotope conjugates, and cns delivered antibodies. finally, the power of our platform has attracted partnerships across the spectrum of drug development companies. this includes the most enabled companies like lilly, gilead, and regeneron fast-moving biotech, such as eqrx, kanai, and igm; and also innovative emerging biotechs, such as impurico, angios, and cation. we continue to see strong and accelerated demand across our partnership business.
in the third quarter, we added another 17 new programs under contract. over the first nine months of the year, we have now added 52 programs under contract as compared to 34 that were added over the same period in 2020. -- while the number of programs under contract will vary from quarter to quarter, we have now built up a robust book of work that we expect will translate into a steadily growing rhythm of annual program starts, which is when the work on each program actually begins. we will increasingly be focusing on program starts as a primary metric in building our portfolio and also as a reflection of our growing capacity to execute.
in the third quarter, we started nine programs, bringing our total program starts to -- this quarter, we also added two new multi-target partnerships that bring important and unique dimensions to our growing portfolio of programs, including opening up new geographic markets and pioneering new therapeutic modalities. our most recent partnership, which is what everest medicines, represent our first engagement with a company focused on developing drugs in asia. everest is a late-stage clinical development company whose leadership has a proven track record in the rapid development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics. this partnership is already off to a great start and has the potential to bring multiple molecules into the clinic with accelerated time lines.
we look forward to working with them on 10 targets across multiple indications, starting first with oncology. we are also excited about a new collaboration with moderna to advance their portfolio of rna-based medicines. this partnership will address six different targets. over the past year, the massive impact of rna vaccine has solidified rna as an important and proven modality.
outside of vaccines, there are many other opportunities for rna-based medicines, including antibodies. through our collaboration with moderna, we are pairing a seller's discovery engine with moderna's industry-leading platform to pioneer a new way of delivering antibodies. we use our platform to find antibodies and provide modern with a data package that includes the dna sequence that encodes these antibodies. moderna will then use the technology, deliver these themes to the patient in the form of an rna module so the patient's own body can make the ad body and combat the disease.
this bypasses the conventional manufacturing process that is used mix standard antibiotics. in addition, in the potential to significantly accelerate the path toward clinical development, rna delivery also provides opportunities to use antibodies in ways that would be difficult or impractical with conventional manufacturing methods. this is yet another example of what seller can work through partnerships to unlock innovation and accelerate the development of new types of antibody-based medicines. it also highlights the importance of continued investment in our platform to open up new opportunities in drug development.
an opportunity of particularly high value is the space of gpcr and ion channel proteins. these targets play key roles in cellular function and include many well-validated targets for a broad range of indications, cancer, inflammation, pain, obesity, fibrosis, and more. while these drug targets are widely regarded as a large and untapped opportunity for therapeutic antibodies, they have proven largely intractable using existing technologies. for context, more than 50% of approved small molecule drugs are against gpcrs and ion channels.
in many instances, small molecule development has been hampered by poor specificity and off-target toxicity. something antibodies are ideally suited to remedy. despite this recognized opportunity and despite intense work across the industry, there are only two approved antibodies against gpcr. and to date, no antibodies against i have even made it into clinical development.
there are many challenges in tackling these targets, and we have an overarching technology development program to systematically address each of them. one of the most important is that many of these targets are extremely difficult to produce, which is the first step in discovery. in september, we acquired tetragenetics, a boston-based company that solves the production challenge and is able to provide the critical reagents that is sufficient quantities of highly pure gpcr and ion channel proteins. these proteins are used at every step of the discovery workflow to immunize, screen, characterize and engineer therapeutic antibodies.
we are integrating petrogenetics into our tech staff to provide an optimized source of proteins for our antibody discovery efforts and to solve a key challenge in pursuing these highly sought after but difficult to access drug targets. on that note, i'd like to extend a warm welcome to paul [indiscernible] and the rest of the talented team at kemper genetics. another example of an inorganic technology acquisition that we have made and which is now unlocking new opportunities and creating value is our acquisition of the ortho map bispecific platform last year. bispecific antibodies are the fastest-growing subset of antibodies in development.
they represent a major growth driver within the $140 billion antibody therapeutics market. despite early success, -- there are numerous technical challenges for successful development of bispecifics. these include challenges in discovery, challenges in selection of appropriate binding pairs, and challenges in protein engineering and manufacturing. ortho map is a clinically validated platform which addresses the protein engineering and manufacturing challenges that have hampered the development of bispecifics.
this platform uses advanced computational and experimental protein engineering methods to create igg-like bispecific antibodies from any two starting antibody sequences. the resulting bispecifics are made using standard production and purification techniques. orthomab also supports a variety of multi-specific formats that can be tailored to the target biology and to the desired mechanism of action. by integrating orthomab into our existing technology stack, we can provide our partners with a rapid and complete solution for generating tailored, stable, and developable bispecific antibodies.
due to the flexibility and differentiation of the orthomab, orthomab platform, we're seeing inbound interest from many partners. to date, over a dozen programs under contract now include the use or the option to use our bispecific technology. and we are regularly starting discovery on bispecific antibody programs. we view orthomab as an important focus for our business development and one that is also being supported by high-value r&d to expand our platform.
for example, -- we see a large and growing market opportunity in the use of bispecifics for t-cell redirection in oncology, specifically through cd3 receptor engagement on t cells, finding anti-cd3 antibodies with great properties, including appropriate affinity and epitope recognition is critical to the success of this plaza therapeutics and depends upon antibody in use and the targets that are being addressed. cd3 is an into difficult target. as a result, there are limited options available for companies company entering this space. in response to this need, this quarter, we initiated an internal effort to generate a proprietary panel of fully human cd3 antibodies.
we plan to make these available alongside our orthomab platform. by adding new abcellera owned cd3 antibodies it and pairing that with our discovery capabilities and hydro foot assays for functional assessment. we aim to provide a complete and high-value solution for drug developers wanting to develop the next generation of five t cell engagers. we anticipate having results to share with you on this project next year.
in addition to solving the hardest problems, our business model also addresses another critical impediment that impacts the entire industry. today, many drug developers are not able to access the technology, the expertise, the facilities, or the people that they need to quickly advance their therapeutic programs. by bringing our solutions to market in a partnership model, we are working to close that gap. this is particularly powerful when launching new companies where access to our platform can dramatically accelerate discovery by removing the need to build internal capabilities.
in these cases, our full saas solution provides even more value. and as a result, we have had the opportunity to evolve our deal structures beyond royalties and milestones to capture that value. this now includes equity and equity-like participation and options to invest in molecules that we discover. our collaboration with invetx is one of the first examples about taking an equity position in a collaboration partner.
invetx is developing biotherapeutics for animal health and as one of the founding partners, we have been their discovery engine since inception. we initiated the first program in 2019, and this quarter, invetx advanced the first molecule from this collaboration, ivx01 into the clinic. ibx-01 is a canine-specific antibody treatment for an undisclosed chronic indication in dogs. this is the first program as part of a broad collaboration that includes multiple programs over multiple years.
the use of biologics for the improvement of health and longevity of companion animals represent a new and growing subset of biologics. we look forward to continuing to launch programs with our partner, invetx. summing up, this quarter, we have continued to make excellent progress across our core business. we remain focused on our three top priorities, which included first building and executing on our partnership business to expand our diversified portfolio of royalty streams.
next, forward integration of the platform and scaling of our teams and facilities to support all antibody discovery activities up to an ind submission. and finally, investing in data science to further our technological differentiation and to increase the speed and the scalability of our tech stack. and with that, i'll hand over to andrew booth, our cfo, to provide an overview of our third quarter 2021 financials. andrew? 
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
thanks, carl. i'll start by highlighting our key business metrics. we ended the third quarter of 2021 with 155 programs under contract with 35 unique partners. that's a 65% increase in programs under contract as compared to the end of q3 and 2020.
we continue to see the combined positive impact of our investments in our business development team and the increasing awareness of our platform on our business development activities. in the quarter, we added moderna and everest to our partnership portfolio. the programs with both of these partners include downstream participation in the form of milestones and royalties on net sales. also in the quarter, we started nine new programs to take us to a cumulative number of 69 program starts, of which were started in the first nine months of 2021.
we continue to build capacity and to engage with many partners on preparations for their program starts. we also continue to expect a robust number of program starts as part of this generally increasing trend. while starts will always be some irregular as you expect the increase in programs under contract is a leading indicator of the long-term trajectory expected for program starts. last quarter, we introduced a new business metric molecules in the click, which represent the number of unique molecules for which ind or equivalent application has been approved based on an antibody that was discovered by us or by a partner using less and step cellular technology.
we are pleased to report progress on this metric as we view as an indication of our near and midterm potential revenue from downstream milestone fees and royalty payments in the longer term. in q3, one new molecule reached the clinic pay us to a total of five. carl has already noted that this molecule, ivx-01, is the result of our first program in a collaboration with index. we congratulate team for reaching this important milestone and look forward to progress on this and other program in the future.
as an update on our first molecule to reach clinic, as noted in our previous earnings call, u.s. shipments of bamlanivimab with lilly's etesevimab were paused in june because at the time, beta and gamma variants were resistant to this combination, that were resistant to this combination were present in the united states. on september 2, u.s. shipments of bamlanivimab, together with etesevimab, resumed.
since then, the u.s. government has distributed over 400,000 doses of bamlanivimab with etesevimab, which is on average over 50,000 doses per week. these shipments to the u.s. states were made from existing federal government supplies.
in the u.s., the u.s. government has also recently ordered an additional over 600,000 doses of bamlanivimab with etesevimab from lilly, at least 400,000 of which are expected to be delivered in q4 and with the balance in january of 2022. additionally, in september, the european commission entered into a framework agreement with lilly under which european countries may purchase up to 220,000 doses of bamlanivimab in combination with etesevimab. the momentum we have so far achieved with a number of partners, number of programs under contract, program starts, and molecules in the clinic at the end of q3 has far outperformed our expectations from one year ago for the entire year of 2021.
these will be key drivers of growth in the business and of shareholder value over the longer term. looking at revenue. revenue in the quarter was $5.5 million. we earned our revenue predominantly from research fees, which accounted for $5.1 million.
this is an increase from the same quarter last year and reflects activity with a diverse set of partners across a range of programs. as program starts increase, we would expect this trend of revenue from research fees over an increasingly diversified set of customers to continue to grow. as expected, we are reporting limited royalty revenues in this quarter, up about $200,000 from the shipments of etesevimab, which had been paused in the united states in june. when use of bamlanivimab with etesevimab resumed, the u.s.
government was in to draw on their existing supply bamlanivimab. this did not trigger new orders of bamlanivimab to lilly or royalties to us in the quarter. the recent u.s. government order, which i discussed earlier, is in line with our belief that as covid-19 becomes endemic there is a potential for revenue from covid-19 products, which we view as an upside and not integral to our long-term bid strategy.
milestone revenue naturally occurs irregularly, and no revenue-linked milestone events occurred in q3 of 2021. the milestone revenue in q3 of 2020 was related to milestones achieved by bamlanivimab last year. finally, we earned approximately $200,000 in the quarter in license fees from our treaty platform. turning to operating expenses.
our research and development spend for the quarter was $18 million, a $10 million increase over the previous year. this reflects our ongoing investments into r&d, which will continue to grow as we keep expanding our r&d team's capabilities and capacity. this allows us to deliver our partner programs with nine starts achieved in this quarter, as well as to enhance our technology stack organically. in sales and marketing, expenses for the quarter were just over $1 million, doubling from the same quarter in 2020.
this reflects the ongoing growth of our business development team, capabilities, reach, and capacity to connect with the strong demand that we continue to see both inbound and outbound. general and administration expenses for the quarter were roughly $11 million, compared to $3 million in the second quarter of 2020. $3 million of this increase were related to higher noncash stock-based compensation expenses bringing us in line with publicly listed companies. the increase is otherwise driven by the need to support a much larger business and the associated legal and corporate development requirements of being a publicly listed company, as well as the ongoing investments to protect our intellectual property.
for the third quarter, we are reporting a net loss of roughly $21 million, compared to an approximately $3 million loss in the third quarter of 2020. in terms of earnings per share, this work fell to a loss of $0.08 per share on both a basic and diluted basis. this result reflects our ongoing investment to expand and enhance our discovery platform and to grow our diversified portfolio of long-term stakes in the next generation of antibody drugs while running discovery efforts for our partners. looking at the first nine months of the year, we've generated revenues of $236 million and net income of over $93 million.
that equates to an earnings per share of $0.34 on a basic and $0.29 on a diluted basis year to date. looking at cash flows. operating activities for the first nine months of 2021 contributed over $261 million, which includes the collection of the previous accounts receivable balance from december 2020 and strong royalties earned from bamlanivimab in the first half of the year. on the investing activity side, the first nine months of the year show a $49 million investment in property, plant, and equipment, including the land purchase of our future gmp facility in vancouver.
the remainder was predominantly related to our tetra genetics acquisition and to construction financing of our facilities, which has been partially offset by funding received from the government of canada's strategic innovation fund. as part of our treasury strategy, we invested approximately $240 million in short-term marketable securities during the quarter. we finished the quarter with almost $800 million in short-term liquidity, including $754 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and about $44 million in accounts receivable and accrued accounts receivable. given the recently announced purchase agreements for covid antibodies from lilly and the associated royalty due to abcellera, we see the potential for our liquidity position to further improve in the near term.
in summary, we continue to be in a very strong liquidity position that allows us to execute on our strategy and continue to build capacity to expand the platform and to pursue business and corporate development initiatives. we believe that we have sufficient liquidity for well beyond the next two years. and with that, we'll be happy to take your questions, and i'll turn it back to the operator.

ladies and gentlemen, please standby. your conference will resume when the speakers reconnect. one moment, please.
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
hello. this is andrew booth speaking. it looks like we had some technical difficulties and dropped the line. i understand where we left off, and i'll just continue on the business update.
so looking ahead, we expect the majority of 2022 revenue to still be derived from royalties on covid antibodies. lilly continued to ship bamlanivimab into early 2022 and entered into a purchase agreement with the u.s. government to supply up to 600,000 doses of bebtelovimab for at least $720 million no later than march 31. with an option of an additional 500,000 doses for delivery no later than july 31.
as a reminder, under our agreement with lilly for any covid-19 products developed, we are eligible to receive royalties in the low to mid-teens for aggregate sales below $125 million and mid-teens to mid-20s on aggregate sales above $125 million. we continue to view covid royalties as a nondilutive source of funding to support our investments in capacity and platform capabilities, including investments into forward integration. turning to operating expenses. our research and development expenses for the year were approximately $62 million, a $33 million increase over the previous year, $10 million of which relate to noncash stock-based compensation.
the overall increase reflects our ongoing investments into r&d, which we will continue to grow as we expand our r&d team's capabilities and capacity. this allows us to deliver our partner programs, as well as enhance our technology stack organically. in sales and marketing, expenses for the year were approximately $7 million, nearly doubling from 2020. this reflects the ongoing growth of our business development team's capabilities and reach.
general and administration expenses for the year were approximately $42 million, compared to approximately $12 million in 2020. almost $12 million of this increase were related to higher noncash stock-based compensation expenses, bringing us in line with publicly listed companies. the increase is otherwise driven by the need to support a much larger business and the associated legal and corporate requirements of being a publicly listed company, as well as ongoing investments to protect our intellectual property. we are reporting earnings of over $153 million for 2021, compared to approximately $119 million in 2020.
in terms of earnings per share, this works out to an earnings of $0.56 per share on a basic and $0.48 on a diluted basis for the year. this result reflects the receipt of royalties on bamlanivimab and our ongoing investments to expand and enhance our discovery platform and to grow our diversified portfolio of long-term stakes in the next generation of antibody drugs while running discovery efforts for our partners. looking at cash flows. operating activities for 2021 contributed $245 million to cash flow, which includes the collection of accrued accounts receivable balance from december 2020 and the strong royalties earned from bamlanivimab in the first half of the year.
on the investing activity side, the year shows a $58 million investment in plant, property and equipment, including the land purchase of our future gmp facility in vancouver. the remainder was predominantly related to our tetragenetics acquisition and financing of the construction of our facilities, partially offset by funding received from the government of canada's strategic innovation fund. as a part of our treasury strategy, we also invested almost $250 million in short-term marketable securities during the year. the $25 million of restricted cash at year-end relate to entering into a participation agreement with a segregated accounts company for our d&o insurance.
as a result, we finished the year with over $720 million of unrestricted cash, equivalents, and marketable securities, an approximately 22% increase from december of 2020. given the recently announced purchase agreement for covid antibodies from lilly and the associated royalties due to abcellera, we see the potential to further build our cash balance in the near term. in summary, we continue to be in a very strong liquidity position that allows us to execute our strategy, continue to build capacity and expand the platform. we believe that we have sufficient liquidity for well beyond the next two years.
and with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. operator?
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and please limit your questions to one and one follow-up. thank you. we have your first question from stephen willey with stifel.
your line is open.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah, good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really good year.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, steve.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
was just wondering if -- so i know that you guys are really emphasizing new program starts this year and working through, i guess, not the backlog, but the large amount of programs or the contract that you currently have. how should we think about the pace of those new program starts throughout the course of 2022? and is that pace rate limited at all on the capacity front? or is it really just a bandwidth issue at this point?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, steve. carl here, and i'll take a first crack at that and then maybe hand over to andrew if there's anything he wants to add. so first of all, the shift in focus from programs under contract or program starts is something that we did mention on the last call, and we're reinforcing that. the situation basically is that we came into the start of 2021 looking to build our book of work and make sure we had a good fit and good demand for our technology and offering.
and the business development through 2021, i would say, vastly exceeded what was our expectation. as a result, as mentioned, we've got 70 or more programs that are currently under contract. that's not all for this year. that includes multi-target agreements that go two or three years out that have yet to be started.
and with that in mind, we are fully confident that we have put to rest any question we will be able to find high-value work to apply our platform and our technology, too. so for that reason, we're now focusing on higher-value, perhaps more strategic, more selective business development activities. and thus, are sort of pointing people away from programs under contract as the metric to program starts. now program starts.
we exited the year doing nine program starts in the last quarter. that was a big uptick from the start. that reflects increases in efficiency in the process, as well as the investments in equipment and people and technology to build our capacity. we anticipate coming into 2022 at that pace, and i do expect that we're going to have strong growth in program starts over the course of 2022.
but i want to also emphasize that capacity is not just the number of programs that you start. it also reflects how much work you're doing per program. and one of our big drives this year and in the next couple of years is a move toward forward integration, where we're starting to take programs much further, ultimately, once we're fully enabled all the way to ind filing. so there'll be a much larger growth in capacity in terms of work and of course, our participation in those programs then will be reflected in program starts, but we do believe that's going to go up. 
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then, i guess, just with the current liquidity position. obviously, a good time to be liquid given the fact that valuations kind of across the board seem to be down.
and just curious if because of that, you think about maybe prioritizing additional technology acquisitions given the state of the current market? or is it just going to be kind of continued opportunism on that front? thanks.
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
hey, steve, great question. and yes, we're -- obviously, we're in a great liquidity position with our cash balance of full book of receivables and then looking into the first quarter, additional expected sales of bebtelovimab into the future, the first couple of quarters. and of course, we aren't calling any sort of revenue number because if there's one thing we've learned in the last couple of years, it's that covid-19 can be quite volatile. but we would point out that there is a possibility that bebtelovimab could be part of a long-term solution toward covid.
but of course, that's in lilly's hands. we're quite comfortable with that cash balance to continue the investment we have in forward integration and the expansion of the team. and with -- if it comes to, as we have done in the past, any opportunities on m&a that fit within the technology stack or fit within the strategy of the company, we will have the cash balance to execute on those. so that puts us in a good position to be -- keep our eye on. 
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. and i might just layer on to that, that as mentioned, the big push on the platform is likely going to be organic. it's the move toward forward integration. i echo everything andrew said about looking for opportunities.
but of course, m&a strategy and in particular, as it pertains to technology, it needs to be opportunistic, so it's really about finding the right fit.
operator
we have your next question from tiago fauth with credit suisse. your line is open.
tiago fauth -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question. so one that we get pretty often is related to programs going into clinic. and i understand you guys have limited visibility on that. but given the cumulative number of program starts and several of those a few years back, i was wondering if you have a sense of additional programs perhaps going into clinic throughout 2022? and perhaps my follow-up is a little bigger picture than that.
and again, you alluded to that in the prepared remarks. you have executed ahead of expectation [inaudible] most of the operating metrics. that seems to be overlooked by thestreet. and i think a part of that is the nature of the contracts where you have the back-end economics.
so -- and i know that's not the best question to answer, but what could perhaps change the perception of a lot of the investors? is it more about just getting more -- a bigger portfolio, a more diversified portfolio, and more programs and success in terms of operational progress, in terms of the stuff that you can actually control, what do you think can actually, at some point, be received more positively by the street? and how do you see that dynamic in light of your current capital position, a few years to execute on that? thanks.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, tiago. carl here. i think there was maybe a couple of questions woven together there. if i don't cover both or more, please let me know, and i'll address anything i miss.
so the first question was about our expectation or visibility on program starts. as you know, we do not have complete information about the status of all the programs that are in the portfolio. it's a large portfolio, and it is in our partner's hands. and of course, when we do know that things are moving forward, we typically are not at liberty to communicate on that.
so that is a challenge. we have been investing in building up quite a strong alliance management capability within the company that allows us to build relationships and have a better insight and better communication to know where those programs are. so we expect to have more predictability as things move forward. and also, we are investing in the forward integration.
and a big part of that is that we will then be intimately involved in fact, controlling and driving the advancement of programs further along the pipeline, ultimately, all the way to ind. and that, of course, is being done because we believe the integration of our front end with the back end can make a dramatic change to the speed at which we can get there. it also has the advantage that we are in control and have good visibility to where those all are. we expect that when we do that we will be doing that full suite of work for programs where we have a deeper participation.
and so those are things that are going to be most meaningful for abcellera. but of course, that's out in the future. i'll maybe just add one more thing that as mentioned in my prepared remarks, given that we have added increasingly more programs year-over-year and given that the terms are getting better and better, the general trend that we expect is that we're going to see an increasing frequency or rate of programs entering the clinic and that those programs will become more and more meaningful for abcellera as that matures. i think that is the thing ultimately that is going to be best perceived.
the other proxies, of course, are the repeat business, the validation in the market and i think also importantly, our ability to start to bring some of our own science forward for you to see so that people get an understanding not only of the performance of this technology in covid, which has attracted a lot of attention, but how it's also opening up all these other areas. and so -- that's going to be a bit of a conversation over the next little while, but it's one that we're excited to have.
you bet.
tiago fauth -- credit suisse -- analyst
perfect. i think you covered it all. appreciate it.
operator
well, you have your next question from gary nachman with bmo capital markets. your line is open.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, guys. good afternoon. carl, what does the pipeline look like for these higher-value partnerships that you're looking at? and do those take longer to materialize in general? i'm curious like what the cadence for these might be if you're being more selective with partnerships now going forward to generate more value? and then also, how much more work needs to be done on this forward integration? you said it's somewhere down the road in the future, but i'm curious, i mean, is this like one to two years away, three to five years away. and how much do you need to invest behind that? just talk about some of the things that you're thinking about doing or in the process of doing in order to get there? thank you.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, gary. so first, maybe a comment on the business development pipeline. at any given time, we have conversations ongoing with tens of companies. and as you know, this includes some very large vertically integrated biopharma, sort of the top 10 names that you would recognize and also to more innovative companies.
so that is -- that's always the state of things. we are -- we have been selective in partnerships. we had multiple examples last year where we decided to back away from opportunities. we've also had examples, particularly in the last part of 2021, where there was demand for multiyear contracts with larger numbers of program slots than we ultimately were willing to commit to.
so that dynamic has already happened. this year, we're excited about the business development pipeline. we've made really big strides in recruiting that function, bringing in originally neil berkley as the chief business officer and then now having expanded that to a bigger team. so you have to give that time to mature.
and of course, closing the deal is not something that is very predictable. it depends very much upon the negotiation and exactly what is the complexity of that particular transaction. your other question was on the forward integration. on that front, i would think of it not as something that is either done or not done, but rather a continuous evolution toward having the full capabilities to take something right from an email that tells us what is the target and what is the specification of the drug right through to the ind filing.
this year, what is coming online is the translational science part. this goes from the final lead and starts to generate the data, the biological data that supports the ind package. we're working on two or three programs already right now on that front. the longer-term objective includes the cmc capability and the gmp manufacturing.
andrew mentioned that we recently purchased land for the gmp facilities. so this is a greenfield project that needs to be built. we are still anticipating that we'll have that up and running by 2024. of course, we'll be looking to start to line up the projects that will go into that ahead of time.
and so it's not too early to start thinking about that function as part of business development. 
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
and gary, just to add to that, you also asked -- i just wanted to remind you that we do have a participation from the government of canada in order to fund those endeavors. you asked about the expense of it. and the government of canada is contributing about $125 million toward our efforts of building out the building, the equipment, facilities, and the team's processes and getting those up and running in that time frame that carl mentioned. 
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah. so, thanks for reminding of that. and i guess also, just with all the cash that you're generating from both bmab antibodies, are you able to accelerate this process, carl, that you were just talking about? are there, i don't know, third parties maybe that you could bring in-house that have more of these capabilities? just maybe we can have more of an appreciation of deploying that capital that you're generating from the covid antibodies to then push this whole business model to the next level.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
great question, gary. we are looking at several options for how we could put that capital to work. always keeping an eye on the long term and the need to make sure we stay in a strong liquidity position, particularly given where the markets are today. but if things continue the way that they look.
and if bebtelovimab has an impact as big as we think that it might, it opens up new options. i probably shouldn't say much more beyond that. in terms of accelerating the forward integration project, there are definitely things that we can do. and i think one of the biggest things is starting to accelerate the hiring, particularly in the translational science and the cmc side.
there is a timeline associated with construction and certification of facilities that i don't see a big opportunity to really move by deployment of capital. one of the things i will highlight here is that when we thought about this, the option was always on the table to go and buy a group that was already doing manufacturing. we elected not to do that because we do believe that it is absolutely mission-critical that this be right next to the facility and that there's seamless integration between the front-end discovery, the translational science right through to the manufacturing. it's through that integration that we believe we can get some major speed advances.
and in drug development, if you can get a leg up in speed, that is very valuable and it's something that touches every program. so it's an ambitious goal, but it's one -- and you have to build it from scratch, you have to build it right. and we decided that in the interest of long-term value, it's something that we need to do organically. so that's currently how we see it, gary.
operator
we have your next question from puneet souda with svb leerink. your line is open.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
yeah. hi, carl, andrew. thanks for taking the question. carl, andrew, so maybe just a clarification.
i know you're emphasizing program starts here. but on the contract adds, i just want to make sure there was only one contract added in the quarter. if that's correct. and in the past, you have had sort of a mid-teens type of a number of contract adds.
and so just thinking about that for 2022, i know you're emphasizing program starts, but how should we think about contract adds in 2022. should we have anything in that sort of line? and just asking that because ultimately, it is about probabilities of success, so getting the programs into the funnel is important. so i just want to get sort of a high level of context on that. and i have a follow-up.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
sure. so first, i can confirm that in q4, we closed a single deal that included a single target. that is with a mid-cap biotech company, and we're not at liberty to say much more beyond that, except that it's a program that we view as being potentially of high value. of course, there's risk associated with all these things.
in terms of the addition of programs under contract, maybe what i would turn to is what are we actually trying to do at the company? there's two things we're doing. one is we're investing in platform capabilities, to make sure that we extend and double down on our competitive position there. and the place where we play is between the identification of the target right through ultimately to the filing of an ind, a big effort right now on moving forward there. the second thing that we're doing is we're using that capability to build a portfolio of stakes in programs and we are not dogmatic about the way in which we're looking to build that portfolio.
so we have done the traditional deals that i talked about today, we've done different types of deals. what is most important is that we maximize probability of success, our stake in that program and make sure that we're also keeping an eye on it being diversified appropriately. so at this point, given the work that we have lined up, it's not really material in my mind, whether we add additional programs under contract in the next quarter or not, though we do believe the business still in the pipeline is strong, and we expect to do that. what's most important is when you actually start to work because that is when they start to contribute to the portfolio.
at this point, we've got no concerns whatsoever that we have the opportunities to continue to have a pace of program starts, and to deploy those programs starts on the most important programs is our no. 1 priority now.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it. and then on the selective process that you talked about with high-value programs. i just want to understand a bit, i mean, given your experience with the covid antibodies and also a number of other projects, at this point in time, i mean, how do you overall parse out these sort of these opportunities? do you look at the royalty percentage as a big factor in deciding that? or is it the indication -- or is it where the scientific team's strength is or any other set of sort of metrics that you parse through in order to decide whether this is a high-value program fit for abcellera versus not? thank you for that.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so as mentioned in my prepared remarks, i think that one should not look at adding value to the portfolio along a single dimension. it very much depends, of course, on volume, you want to add more programs. you also want those programs to be with the highest-quality partners on opportunities in terms of the target and the commercial opportunity that we judge to be most attractive.
and then, of course, it matters what is our economic participation in those programs. and that is a combination of what value do we bring to the partner and what are their alternatives and what are the -- what's the nature of the negotiation. so the business development team looks at every opportunity, and we assess those in terms of what we believe is the total value added to the portfolio. and that includes work that's done by the scientific diligence teams.
it includes our scientific teams. it includes the negotiations. it includes the commercial analysis. it's very much like being an investor from that perspective.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
ok. super. thanks, carl.

we have your last question from antonia borovina with bloom burton. your line is open.
antonia borovina -- bloom burton -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. so just another follow-up regarding your forward integration work. so i'm just wondering, do you expect you'll have after that work is done some room to raise your typical royalty rate? or do you think that 5% is kind of the maximum limit that the market will bear, given the competitive environment? and then i have a follow-up as well.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
yeah. so first of all, 5% is absolutely not the limit. we have, in fact, done a quarter of our deals that are north of 5% in recent times. so there's a range, and it depends on the nature of the interaction and how much work we're doing, how much value we're bringing.
we are focused on bringing more and more value to therapeutic antibody discovery and development. that is why we're making the investments in forward integration. it's also why we make investments in the platform generally while adding new technologies such as the orthomab platform or cms [inaudible] and some of the other technologies that we are either building organically or that we have acquired. if we connect with the right partner that has a great idea, the innovation, we can take our capabilities with theirs and we've made the pie bigger.
that allows us to create value through that partnership. and then the discussion is how best to split that so that both parties come away enriched from the engagement and can better meet their goals. if we are doing the work that goes all the way from discovery right through to carrying a lot of load into an ind filing, we would, of course, expect to have a much deeper participation than if we're doing the discovery and handing off candidates or leads as some of our early work has done. so we expect that that forward integration will be used primarily with programs where we have a much deeper participation than is our typical deals.
and that is -- that is in part because we're doing more work and also, of course, because we believe with technology, we can make that much faster and give that program a competitive advantage. 
antonia borovina -- bloom burton -- analyst
ok. thanks. and then just given the current downturn in the public markets and then that potentially spilling over into the private market, do you think that will have a meaningful impact on your ability to track new partners, either positively or negatively?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
yeah, that's a great question. i could probably make arguments that went both ways. i think our initial interactions have shown that it's perhaps more of an opportunity than a headwind. and one of the reasons i'd say that, particularly for private companies is when you are starting out and you're looking at a path where you need to build capabilities, it is much more capital efficient in terms of cash to work with abcellera.
you save yourself a lot of time, a lot of runway and the investment that it would otherwise take to put that in place. and then, of course, we can help them in that way, accelerate those programs. and in doing that, have created value for them and take a deeper position in those programs that, of course, is paid out primarily on success. and because we build the portfolio, we're able to look at those transactions in a rational way, whereas a smaller company really needs to preserve cash early on in its lifetime and even more so when the markets get more difficult, which may well transfer from what's happened in the public markets and into the private markets.
antonia borovina -- bloom burton -- analyst

carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, tryn, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. it's my pleasure to provide an update on our business and a recap of 2021. abcellera had a banner first year as a publicly listed company. executing on our long-term strategy by growing our portfolio, deepening our platform to unlock new modalities, and expanding our deal structures to add new ways to capture value.
we ended 2021 with over $720 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and approximately $70 million in receivables net of payables. we added 53 new programs under contract with nine new partners, bringing our cumulative total of programs under contract to 156 with a total of 36 partners. we ramped up our discovery capacity and started to work on 26 new drug discovery programs, bringing our total number of program starts to 78. finally, we saw four molecules we discovered enter the clinic, bringing our total number to five new molecules in the clinic for indications in oncology, infectious disease, animal health and immunology, dermatology, and gastrointestinal disease.
building on our momentum from 2021, we are now well-positioned to continue executing on our growth strategy. abcellera is building a technology company that drives innovation in antibody therapeutics which currently represents an estimated $170 billion market opportunity. based on historical compounded annual growth of over 10% for the last three decades, this market is expected to reach over $350 billion by 2030. our strategy for growth in this market is to become the de facto technology leader in the early part of drug development.
ultimately covering all the activities that lie between target discovery and clinical testing. our work begins once the fundamental science has been done and the drug target has been identified. starting from the indication and requirements of a drug target and therapeutic candidate, we use our technology stack to deliver antibodies with optimal drug-like properties. we deliver lead drug candidates and data packages to our partners, and they then bring these antibodies forward through late-stage preclinical and clinical development.
our technology gives our partners a competitive advantage in advancing their programs. in exchange, we take a stake in these programs, allowing us to build a large and diversified portfolio in the next generation of antibody therapies. over the long run, we believe this strategy will provide superior returns and value to our shareholders. while avoiding the large capital outlays for clinical development and the extreme binary risk that is normally associated with biotech.
in 2021, we had a record year in business development, adding another 53 programs under contract with nine new partners. this underscores a strong market fit for our business model. our partners span the full range of drug developers from early stage biotech to mid-cap publicly traded biotech to large vertically integrated biopharmaceutical companies. enabled partners come to us to find antibodies with superior drug properties or to advance programs that have proven refractory to traditional workflows.
for smaller biotech companies, our technology does more than just level the playing field. it allows them to advance their programs with a technology advantage while saving time and capital that would otherwise be needed to assemble or build internal capabilities. collaborating with diverse partners allows us to open up new modalities and targets. for example, our deal with moderna opens up a new modality of rna-based antibody therapies.
another strong area of growth is in bispecific antibodies, which is enabled using our orthomab platform. in total, we now have 156 programs under contract, of which 131 have downstream participation. approximately half of our programs under contract have yet to begin the discovery phase. as a result, we entered 2022 with a full book of work.
specifically, we now have over 70 programs under contract that are yet to be started. we are, therefore, in a position to be increasingly selective in our deal making and expect to be shifting our business development focus toward strategic partnerships, where we have the potential for even deeper participation in the molecules that we discover. to maintain future flexibility in our business and deal terms, we also intend to limit the number of programs under contract that are associated with new multiyear agreements. as indicated during our last business update, we will now be focusing on program starts rather than programs under contract as a key metric for the growth of our portfolio.
in 2021, we started 26 programs, bringing the cumulative number of program starts to 78. today, we are excited to share additional details about our portfolio. we think of our portfolio as a financial asset, where diversification can be effectively used to achieve strong growth, but at the same time, mitigating risk. the wide applicability of antibodies and the breadth of our platform allow us to diversify our portfolio across antibody modalities, partnerships, and therapeutic areas.
as illustrated, our programs are diversified in indications that now include oncology, immunology, neurology, infectious disease, ophthalmology, and beyond. for the 65 human health programs where we already know the therapeutic application, oncology represents just over half of our portfolio and has been a growth area over the past year. we expect this trend to continue in 2022, broadly reflecting the activity in the sector. in all of our partnerships, the large majority of the deal value is tied to the success of the molecules that we discovered.
we achieved this through a variety of deal structures, the most frequent of which includes upfront and research payments, followed by clinical and commercial milestones and royalties on net sales. the timing and the relative value of these payments is illustrated on this slide, which presents an example of one of our programs in case that it is successful in bringing a new therapy to the market. this example hypothetically assumes a typical timeline of 10 years from program start to market approval, modest total upfront fees, aggregate milestones of over $90 million, peak sales of $1.7 billion per year, and a 5% royalty on net sales. what's important to note is that for a successful program, by far the largest fraction of the value for abcellera is associated with the royalties.
these typically occur 10 years after the program has started. for molecules that reach the clinic, royalties represent approximately 90% of the total value. milestones are the second most valuable portion of the deal and represent approximately 7% of the total value. milestone payments begin when a molecule reaches the clinic, approximately three to four years after a program starts.
milestones then continue to progress at higher payments until a drug candidate reaches market approval and achieves certain sales levels. finally, upfront and research payments are the smallest portion of the deal and are recognized as the seller completes its work. commonly, these payments are between $1 million and $3 million and represent approximately 1% or less of the total value of a successful drug development program. our covid-19 program with eli lilly is a real-world and time-compressed example of the value associated with our business model.
over the period between march 2020 and december 31, 2021, we received $526 million in royalties, representing over 90% of the program value to date. structuring deals that emphasize value and royalties also aligns our success with the delivery of therapies that make a difference for patients. in this particular case, bamlanivimab, used either alone or together with other antibodies, has been used to help more than 1 million patients. we estimate that this has saved more than 1,000 -- 100,000 hospitalizations and more than 40,000 lives.
this is but one example of what can happen when a program is successful. however, this example is atypical due both to the timelines associated with pandemic response and our larger royalty position, which reflects both the high value placed on speed and the fact that we had initiated our covid-19 response independently as part of our internal technology development efforts. moreover, it is also important to realize that any particular drug development program is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor and that the large majority of programs are expected to fail to result in approved therapies. this is why it is so important to build a large and diversified portfolio as we have been doing.
in addition to the number of program starts in our portfolio, main drivers of value are the probability of success, the speed of a program advancing, and our economic participation in each program. because of this, we make platform investments and business development decisions that seek to optimize these combined factors. we carefully evaluate each program to identify the highest-value opportunities, considering the scientific hypothesis, the commercial potential, and the capabilities of our partners. to build capacity, we continue to invest in the expansion of our facilities and our workforce.
importantly, we are leveraging modern automation, data science software solutions, and computation that we believe will yield continuous improvements in speed, efficiency, and success rates across our programs. as already mentioned, this includes investment in a multiyear project of forward integration, which includes translational science, cmc, and gmp manufacturing. we believe that seamless integration of these capabilities with our upstream technologies will allow us to greatly accelerate the path from program start to the start of clinical development. as we build our business, expand our technology and increase the value we bring to our partners, we expect that our economic participation in each program will increase.
these next few slides confirm that this has been the case over the past few years. this graph shows the progression of our royalty rates from early in our business between 2015 and 2019 to more recently between 2020 and 2021. the box and whisker plot indicate the inter 2 quartiles and the fifth and 95th percentile for deals done within each period. as shown, the mean royalty value from our earlier deals was 2.5% and has now increased to 4.3%, with a quarter of deals having a royalty rate above 5%.
at the top end, royalty rates reached over 8% while very few programs now have rates below 2.5%. we note that the distribution of royalties shown here are firm numbers that are not subject to buyout clauses. in addition to strong growth in the number and size of our royalty position, as shown on this slide, we have also accumulated a large value of potential milestone payments. the aggregate value of potential milestone payments for our portfolio of programs currently under contract is $4.6 billion, of which more than half of this is associated with commercial success.
i would like to emphasize that this is the maximum potential value and has not been adjusted for the probability of success. as i said previously, the large majority of programs do not succeed in becoming approved products; and therefore, we would expect to recognize only a fraction of this total value. in addition to milestones and royalties, which have been typical of how we achieve downstream participation in our early years, as we provide more value to partners, we are now adding deal structures to capture that value. this is particularly true when engaging with early stage firms.
these deals include equity or equity-like stakes in new companies, as well as options to co-invest in program development to obtain a progressively larger effective ownership position. these should be viewed as a subset of potentially higher-value programs and are part of balancing our portfolio in terms of indication risk, partner type, and deal structure. at this point, the large majority of our programs are preclinical, reflecting the stage of our business and the higher concentration of new programs in the past few years. as our portfolio matures, we expect to see an increasing pace of molecules entering the clinic and an increasing average stake in these clinical assets.
as mentioned, in 2021, we saw four new molecules enter the clinic. recently, one of these molecules bebtelovimab received emergency use authorization from the u.s. fda. bebtelovimab is our second covid-19 antibody to receive emergency use authorization and is the culmination of a two-pronged strategy that we executed in response to the pandemic.
in march of 2020, at the start of the covid-19 pandemic, we made a conscious decision to first prioritize speed in getting therapies out to patients. this resulted in the discovery of bamlanivimab, the first covid-19 antibody to reach the clinic and the first to receive emergency use authorization by the fda. because we anticipated that resistant strains would emerge, we didn't stop. we continued our screening efforts and built up a collection of several thousand diverse candidate antibodies.
in early 2021, responding to the emergence of new variants, we began to search this library to find a next-generation solution. this time, prioritizing maximum possible potency and breadth of neutralization. this effort resulted in the discovery and now the emergency use authorization of bebtelovimab. bebtelovimab neutralizes every known variant of concern.
and to our knowledge, it is by far the most potent antibody in development against the omicron variant and the ba.2 subvariant. this graph shows our laboratory measurements of the potency of various antibodies that are in development, either as monotherapies or as part of a cocktail of two antibodies. for each antibody, the potency against omicron is quantified by the ic50 value, which refers to the concentration of antibody that is needed to achieve a 50% neutralization of a fixed amount of pseudotype virus. lower numbers are good and indicate a more potent antibody.
this data shows that bebtelovimab is at least 50 times more potent against omicron than other antibodies we tested and have either been authorized or are in late-stage development. moreover, the three most potent antibodies against omicron -- moreover, for the most -- excuse me, moreover, for the three most potent antibodies against omicron, we believe that only bebtelovimab maintains full effectiveness against the ba.2 subvariant, which is thought to be more infective and is rapidly growing in prevalence. the high potency of bebtelovimab allows for full effectiveness at a dose of only 175 milligrams, which can be delivered by iv push in less than a minute as compared to a 30-minute infusion with some other antibody therapies. furthermore, we believe that bebtelovimab's potency and breadth give it the potential for development as a prophylactic to protect against covid-19 infection in high-risk populations.
the discovery of two authorized therapeutic antibodies within a year of each other demonstrates the power of our platform and its potential to quickly generate best-in-class therapeutics for our partners across other indications. i would like to emphasize that we are not a covid-19 company. in fact, infectious disease represents a small fraction, approximately 5% of abcellera's portfolio. in 2022, we will continue to drive innovative science that we believe will enhance the power of our platform to open up new target spaces and enable next-generation antibody therapies.
we anticipate a number of exciting updates this year that are in part the result of successful integration of the acquisitions that we have made over the past couple of years. for instance, we have made substantial progress in enhancing technologies for the discovery of antibodies against gpcrs and ion channels, including integration of the tetragenetics platform, which we acquired in 2021. we look forward to updating you on those advancements in future business updates. in our last update, you'll recall that we discussed how the combination of our discovery, bispecific and computational platforms can be used to create next-generation t-cell engagers based on cd3.
here, we are leveraging our trianni platform to generate fully human antibodies for t-cells and tumor targets and combining them to create bispecific using our orthomab protein-engineering platform. that's an effort that is just underway, and we are pleased to be sharing data about that program at the upcoming american association for cancer research or aacr meeting in april. summing up, we've made tremendous progress in 2021. we are now moving into 2022 with a full head of steam.
despite the challenges of operating in the pandemic, we posted a record year in growing our business and have expanded our operations now to include over 400 people working in locations across the globe. since our last earnings call, we've also strengthened our leadership team with the appointment of neil aubuchon as chief commercial officer, and dr. andrew lo as independent director. and with that, i'll hand over to andrew booth, our cfo, to provide an overview of our 2021 financials.
andrew?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
thanks, carl. i'm pleased to highlight the progress we've made on our key business metrics, beginning with our program starts. we started 26 new programs in 2021, of which nine were in the fourth quarter to take us to a cumulative number of 78 program starts. while starts will continue to be somewhat irregular, we expect a generally increasing trend year-over-year as we have seen throughout this past year.
we ended 2021 with 156 programs under contract with 36 unique partners. that is a 51% increase in programs under contract as compared to 2020. as we noted previously, programs under contract has been a leading indicator of the long-term trajectory expected for program starts. also in 2021, our partners advanced four more molecules into the clinic, bringing our total molecules in the clinic to five at year-end.
we view the growing list of molecules in the clinic as specific examples of our near and midterm potential revenue from downstream milestone fees and royalty payments in the longer term. the recent eua of bebtelovimab and the concurrent u.s. government purchase order do, of course, imply meaningful near-term royalty potential. the momentum we achieved with the number of partners, programs under contract, program starts, and molecules in the clinic this year has far outperformed our expectations from one year ago.
these will be key drivers of growth in the business and of shareholder value in the years ahead. turning to revenue. revenue in the year was $375 million. revenues for 2021 were dominated by the $327 million of royalties we earned from shipments of bamlanivimab during the year.
we realized $8 million in milestone fees in 2021, $7 million of which relate to the commercial milestones from the sale of bamlanivimab. we recognized $21 million of licensing fees in revenue in 2021, mostly attributable to one large trianni licensing agreement in the first quarter. finally, research fees connected to our work on a great many programs with a wide range of partners in 2021 were $19 million. that is similar to the $20 million we recognized in 2020, a year that includes significant fees for our work with our partner darpa.
looking ahead, we expect the majority of 2022 revenue still to be derived from royalties on covid antibodies. lilly continued to ship bamlanivimab into early 2022 and entered into a purchase agreement with the u.s. government to supply up to 600,000 doses of bebtelovimab for at least $720 million no later than march 31, 2022, with an option of an additional $500 [technical difficulty]

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from tiago fauth with credit suisse. tiago, your line is now open.
tiago fauth -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress. so perhaps just using the empirico experience as a comparison model, so you actually have the option to co-develop some of these drugs. i'm assuming that's mostly going to be on the financial side to keep your ownership and not necessarily a potential pivot to developing internal drugs.
but i guess the broader question is that, that seemed like a pretty unique structure and a pretty unique deal. is that something that you see as you alluded to potentially becoming a little bit more selective in higher probability or higher quality partners or targets to the extent that it is possible? is that a trend that you see for the near future and how do you balance that out relatively to getting a larger book of business, a more diversified book of business? is that an actual trade-off or how do you see the universe of potential opportunities there in terms of quality, volume and capital allocation in your tax and even co-investment with your partners? i know it's a pretty broad question, but that would be helpful. thanks.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
great. i will address that, tiago. thanks for joining the call today, carl hansen, here. so first, just to be clear, we would not characterize this as co-development.
what we have is an option to co-fund on a program-by-program basis and on a staged basis various programs. so that allows us to put capital to work for programs where we have conviction in the indication and where we are confident in the qualities of the molecules that have come through. and of course, we have done the work in discovering those or well positioned to make that assessment. that option we see as another way to add value in deals.
it is not the only way that we will do business. really, our main strategy is to be the company that makes long-term investments that allow for rapid discovery at high quality and to do that at scale. and we are not dogmatic about the way that we will do deals to capture value on that. the one consistent theme is that we are looking not to take or two big bets on single assets, but to diversify across a large number of assets, which of course we have done.
and to shift this quarter is to given that we have a strong book of work from 2021 that we are still working on. we are now looking for opportunities that we believe could meaningfully move the business. but we are not looking for those at the exclusion of our base business in doing discovery deals, which is still something that we are working on and we are excited about.
operator
our next question comes from puneet souda with svb securities. puneet, your line is now open.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
yes. hi, carl and andrew. thanks for taking the question. so, just following up on that, i mean, at a high level, has there been any shift toward exploring optionality to invest into your own development separately, or otherwise, despite the, obviously, the focus on helping your partners grow and scaling up the business?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
carl here. so i'm happy to take that one as well. again, our strategy is to build a competitive advantage on all the steps that sit between target identification and go all the way through to, but not including clinical development. that's where we believe technology can make a difference, to increase speed and quality and to open up new target opportunities.
so it is not our intention to pivot and to work on internal programs. but we do have long range r&d efforts underway to abcellera of which the cd3 work is a prime example, where we have seen a need, and we have taken initiatives to solve that need. and in the process of proving that out, we will need to validate that across a variety of different, target antigens and tumor antigens. when we do that, our plans for that are absolutely to partner those as soon as possible.
and that scenario, of doing r&d that leads to assets that could be partnered is not at all different from what we've done in the past. in fact, that's exactly what we did with covid-19. so it is the nature of this r&d that you need to work on real things. and when you work on real things, you have the possibility to anticipate needs from partners, for the benefit of both sides.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
on the new program starts maybe this is for andrew, appreciate that your focus on new programs starts worse with contract ads. but as i look at it, last two quarters, you had nine program starts and then only six this quarter. maybe just help us understand is this a capacity or is it just first quarter seasonality or any other reason why we're seeing fewer programs starts despite your focus on new program starts largely? and is their capacity or any other thing that's getting the expansion in the numbers here?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
great question, puneet. as we've already said the program starts on a quarter to quarter basis will be slightly irregular. and the real metric to watch is going to the longer term trend of these programs starts. and that's why in the prepared remarks, i commented on the trailing 12 months growth over the previous period.
it will be irregular and you have to also remember that in each of these programs, we are doing more and more work on each of the programs that we start, which is actually an increase in the capacity that we have within the organization and the capabilities. so, we will continue to see this irregularity in going forward and that should be expected. i think what really is to be watched is that longer term trend as well as the sense of how much more we're doing on a per program basis.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
and then just last one, carl, this for you on â  yes. sorry. go ahead.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
i was going to layer on top of that, that if you look out over the next two, three years, as i mentioned, we are making heavy investments in forward integration. so work on translational science, cmc, gmp manufacturing, we are starting to take programs forward on the frontend of that right now. and so you can expect that in terms of capacity building, that dimension of doing work for program, i suspect is at least as big as is the volume metric that is reflected in program starts. so that's important to keep in mind.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
and then carl, given the current cash position and the cash generation that's ongoing with the bebtelovimab and the covid antibodies, appreciate that is unpredictable and that can completely change, but when you look at the overall market today, multiples have continued to contract and both the therapeutics and broadly across healthcare. has that changed your view or the lens or how you're looking at the opportunities at this point in time?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
i interpret that question as being one about inorganic editions of the technology class. yes, we have a history of that. and we always survey the landscape to look for technologies that either would expand or improve our existing platform. that said, at this point, we believe we have assembled the best frontend in the industry.
and the path now to complete this right up to ind is going to be primarily focused on organic growth in translational science, cmc and gmp. so we are certainly open to opportunities. but at this point, it's very much an internal facing efforts to complete this project that we started a decade ago. and given the capital and given that this is mostly about execution and team building, we believe completing that now is inevitable.
operator
our next question comes from stephen willey with stifel. stephen, your line is now open.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
just going back to the empirico arrangement. can you just remind us what are the inflection points, that allow you to make these investment decisions? i know, you're saying that it's staged, which is kind of curious if you can maybe speak to some of the triggers, which allow you to then make these decisions?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
stephen, i can take that one. it's without disclosing too much, there are go-no-go stages in the early discovery, and don't-go-no-go stages trigger an option on our part to continue to fund the work. the first of those would be in funding to an ind filing. and then there would be stages at various breakpoints in clinical development which would line up with, phase 1, 2, 3 type activities.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. so the take was human and perhaps across the seven potential targets that are covered under the deal that you may have, i guess, a different ownership position in each of these assets, depending upon your view of the opportunity?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
that's exactly right. we would look at -- go ahead, andrew.
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
yes. i was going to say that's exactly the right way to think about it, stephen. so â and this is very similar to other deals, similar deals we've done, where, as you would imagine, the more you invest along the greater ownership position that you take, if it's a partner who chooses to advance that molecule where we have not invested, then it's sort of a pre-agreed terms on the percentage ownership position that we would have, depending on how long we have funded for.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
and i guess maybe just given some of the attrition that we've seen in the therapeutic space, specifically against among those kind of smaller cap development stage biotechs, just wondering if you've seen any kind of impact on the business development front. and i guess whether or not you think that the model that you guys provide to a potential company is more attractive in a liquidity constraint environment than perhaps it is when things are better.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks steve. carl here. so obviously it's been trying times in the market. as mentioned on the comments, our business is in terrific shape.
so we are strong and we are executing on our strategy, that's not the case broadly. that said, recently we have seen a strong uptick in activity and business development discussions. i believe a good part of that is a response to the data that was presented at aacr on cd3 work. it's probably too early to know exactly how market conditions are going to impact all partners, but i would agree with you that, our model provides a way for companies to continue advancing programs, to do that more quickly and more capital efficiently while preserving their resources.
so we typically structure our deals with value sharing based on success in clinical development and ultimately in the approval of therapies and that lines up well with companies that are not -- that are cautious about building internal capabilities and taking on the complexity and cost of distributed outsourcing. so, we think that could well be a tailwind, but i think it's still a bit early to tell.
operator
thank you, stephen. our next question comes from gaurav capital markets. gaurav, your line is now open.
unknown speaker -- gaurav capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions and for the time. just two for me. so when looking at new product opportunities, are you only entertaining deals at entitled southern to downstream participation, or are you still open to let's a new non-downstream payment deal?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
thanks, gaurav. andrew here. no. when we really only look exclusively at business development opportunities that have downstream participation, so that has been the case for some time.
i guess there are some with the gates foundation or delta where we have managed to make applications for grant funding, which are really investments in the platform and capabilities. and sometimes those deals we would do on a case-by-case basis, but it's a very different dynamic in that grant funding environment than it is when you are doing discovery on actually a commercial, potentially commercial molecule and all of those deals have downstream participation.
unknown speaker -- gaurav capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks. and then, if you are looking more long-term, right. what level are you looking to continue diversifying the modality exposure? do you expect a broader focus on the calling antibodies to continue to dominate the pipeline including from new products as well? or do you eventually envision abcellera having a more modality-balanced pipeline, as it seems like you guys are continuing to explore new modalities that they see fit?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
carl here. i can take that one. so, we are squarely focused on therapeutic antibodies defined quite broadly. so that would include monoclonal bispecifics other modalities that include antibodies as part of the composition of matter.
looking forward, we expect that main drivers of this sector are going to be discoveries in biology that are amenable to antibody therapies in a variety of different ways. it's also going to be new modalities that allow you to use antibodies to get novel mechanisms of action. within that class, we're very bullish on the future of five specifics and are making big investments on that capability. and third is going to be about being able to unlock target space where there are large numbers of well validated targets that represent a giant market opportunity, but where the industry has struggled mightily over the past couple of decades to find molecules that are suitable for development.
we have a long-term research effort on that front, looking particularly at gpcrs and ion channels. those are tough problems, but we're making good progress and we aim to be a major enabler for that part of the sector.
operator
our next question comes from gary nachman with bmo capital markets. gary, your line is now open.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
so for the six molecules in the clinic, what's the earliest that we might hear about some clinical data from the non-lilly b-mab molecules? you added one in the first quarter through trianni. could you be on pace to put a few molecules in the clinic every year from your different partnerships? and when could those other four generate good revenue for you, whether it's in terms of hitting certain milestones, or ultimately getting to market but that's probably still away?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
gary, good to hear from you. yes. exactly right. this is why we focus on the portfolio.
of course, we have a large portfolio. that is, we would expect consistently molecules from that portfolio would start to hit the clinic. of course, we also expect some attrition in that portfolio. that's just the nature of drug development.
with regards to those molecules that are the six that we show, of course, two of them are the covid related molecules. so we've seen the progress of those. and we don't have a lot of visibility on individual programs. and actually, we've designed the portfolio strategy to move away from looking at programs like things on a program by program basis.
so, i think we would hope that more molecules would enter the clinic in the coming year, and, of course, the years to come. and we will start to see that as a more-steady stream. and then we will be watching the progress of those molecules as they advance through the clinic. they'll certainly be some milestone revenue and i would think that there will be some material milestone revenue in the coming years.
but remember, these molecules right now, aside from the covid molecules are in phase 1. so they're still very early in the clinical development. and they'll mature over the coming like three to five years. and as they progress through, we've got millions and millions of dollar milestones every time a molecule would advance through clinical development.
and we would expect to see that and recognize as it happens.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
and then carl, regarding the panel of cd3 antibodies. can you have multiple partnerships for different types of cancers? how soon can you potentially partner those? are there any real gating factors? and then, would you potentially keep some of these for yourself? i mean, sounds like from what you said earlier that you probably going to partner out all these antibodies. so i'm just curious if there's even a possibility that you might keep some of these when you're on development on.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
so first, we do not have plans to in the foreseeable future move into clinical development with these. so it is really about building technologies that enable this class and therapeutics. the underlying hypothesis here is that it is not true that a single or a small number of cd3 antibodies are optimal for any given tumor antigen or class. to me that is, on its face, very likely to be true, it hasn't yet been proven, largely because people have been restricted in the diversity that they have.
so we have taken the initiative to build in a very short time, what i believe is the biggest panel in the industry. and we now are going to do work internally, combining those with a variety of different tumor antigens, to prove that the potency and t cell activation is dependent upon the appropriate combination of cd3 and the tumor binder. and it's not something that you can solve with just one arm. so that work i feel we need to do to validate and get people to understand that paradigm of thinking about this class.
in terms of partnering, we're already getting a ton of interest. so we've had, i'd say almost twice the business development activity in the last month than is typical. and most of that has been driven by companies that are in the oncology space, that haven't been able to secure technologies to get a good position in what looks to be one of the most exciting classes of therapeutics. and they see this as an opportunity to get ahead.
and we exist as an organization to help people more quickly and effectively develop better drugs. so that's what we're focused on right now.

our next question comes from do kim with piper sandler. do, your line is now open.
do kim -- piper sandler -- analyst
i just have one. i know you can't say much about the empirico collaboration program that the first one that you completed discovery. but i was hoping that you could talk about maybe how challenging it would be to get antibodies to this first gpcr target using conventional means and how you were able to get your process through?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, do. so yes, we're very excited about that program. so it's difficult to say for any given target, how difficult it would be with one technology or another. what i can say is that in this case, if the gpcr target, which is widely viewed as one of the most difficult classes, probably next to ion channels.
what is particularly impressive about this one is that we went from initiation of this to generation have a very large panel of antibodies and many highly potent functional antibodies that have moved into in vivo testing, at a speed that i believe is unprecedented for this class. so we are very excited about the quality and diversity of this program of molecules that have been developed in this program, but also on the speed. and i see this has a proof point, yet another proof point for our main thesis that if you spend the time to really build the engine, if you work on the technology to increase performance and generate speed, you can turn ideas into therapeutic candidates much faster than has conventionally been done in the industry. that's something that we showed before on bamlanivimab, we showed it best-in-class molecule with bebtelovimab.
we have generated what i think is the largest panelist cd3 in the space of six months. and the first program was empirico shows us also succeeding on gpcr targets. so our goal is to keep performing and layering on that evidence, demonstrating that we have got a technology that is really moving the needle therapeutic antibodies.

our next question comes from antonia borovina with bloom burton. antonia, your line is now open.
antonia borovina -- bloom burton -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. most of them have been answered, so just a couple. so i know that you are very limited with what you can discuss regarding the trianni partner program advancing into the clinic.
but just wondering if you could remind us of the typical deal structure for the trianni partnerships and how they compare to the rest of your pipeline? and then if you could just give us an update on what you are forecasting for your cash runway? thanks.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
yes. thanks. thanks, antonia. good to hear from you.
on the trianni licenses, these molecules are or these agreements for things that were negotiated by trianni when it was under different ownership. we are typically seeing low single-digit royalty amounts on these, and milestones that are typical of our own programs. but the royalty rates are significantly lower, i would say, than the typical program. and as we outlined in the 10-k, on our full year results for 2021, we showed what those average royalty rates are for our internal programs and the programs that we have under contract.
for the cash runway, as we noticed here, we have a very healthy cash balance, and we indicated in the remarks that even with the big investment that we are making in facilities and team and expanding the team in all this work that we are doing, advancing the platform and technology, we have sufficient runway for at least the next three years, even given that very large investment that we are planning to make in the platform.

carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks tryn and thank you, everyone for joining us today. it's my pleasure to provide an update in our business for the first quarter of 2022. given the current market environment more than ever, a strong balance sheet is critical. we ended the quarter with over $780 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
as a result, we are ideally positioned to continue executing on our long-term strategy. our strategy is to invest aggressively in our technologies, workforce and infrastructure to establish the dominant competitive advantage in the invention and creation of therapeutic antibodies. and then to use this capability to build a large and diversified portfolio that is going long in the next generation of antibody drugs. our investments are focused on three priorities; first, building technology and infrastructure to create a centralized engine for the discovery and development of antibody therapeutics at scale; second, executing on partner programs to build a diversified portfolio of stakes in next generation therapeutic antibodies; and third, technology development to unlock new target classes into enable new modalities.
for the past 10 years, abcellera has been laser focused on this one thing, reinventing and rebuilding a new frontend for therapeutic antibody industry. starting from a clean slate, we've replaced legacy platforms with new workflows that take full advantage of modern technologies from biology, engineering, and computation. our vision is to establish a centralized discovery engine that integrates all steps from drug targets to ind at greater speed, the highest quality, and at much greater scale than it's ever been achieved before. this strategy will only work if it is done at scale.
after a decade of work, we believe it is now inevitable that we will achieve our vision. and we also believe that there is no other company that will be able to catch up. we estimate that by the end of 2022, we will have invested more than $0.5 dollars in building our capabilities. and we expect to have more than doubled this before the end of 2025.
these investments which have been made in our technology, our workforce and our infrastructure, have given us a definitive technology advantage and we've established a new technology curve that we believe is now accelerating. we expect our technology advantage will continue to grow as we fully integrate our capabilities. this quarter, our teams achieved major milestones in the development and integration of high throughput workflows for mid- to late-stage preclinical lead assessment and development. these capabilities are now being deployed to accelerate meet optimization and ind enabling studies with our partners.
we're also investing in our infrastructure to scale our business and our r&d efforts. this past quarter we brought online three new facilities with lab and office space including facilities in sydney, australia; the uk; and vancouver, canada. with future expansion in our gmp facility, we expect to have more than 650,000 square feet of state-of-the-art facilities in place by the end of 2025. in the business of innovation, the most important factor for success is a high performance workforce.
we continue to invest in building and training our team, which has roughly doubled since this time, last year. importantly, over two-thirds of our r&d team is building, integrating and scaling our technologies to extend our competitive advantage, with the other third focused on partner programs. unlike conventional biotech companies, we have made software development, a pillar of our technology strategy. as of now, we have over 25% of our r&d team dedicated to software development, data science and machine learning.
we believe the seamless integration of experimental capabilities with software development and data science is essential to achieving scale and to mastering the complexity of antibody discovery. our second area of focus is building our portfolio. today, we have 158 programs under contract, with 133 that have downstream participation. these programs address indications that span a broad range of therapeutic areas, including oncology, neurology and immunology.
as noted in our last earnings call, our success in business development last year has entering 2022 with a strong book of work. accordingly, this year, we anticipate fewer multi-year, multi-target agreements and we are prioritizing deals with greater downstream participation or that we view as having greater strategic value. in line with this, we have recently announced the expansion of our existing partnership within empirico, a company that is using complication and human genetics data to identify and validate new drug targets. in addition to increasing the number of targets from five to seven, this new agreement provides abcellera with the option on a program-by-program basis to co-invest in preclinical and clinical development in exchange for a greater ownership stake in each program.
these new terms will apply to a first program that was started under the original agreement. this program, which is against an undisclosed gpcr target has produced several potent functional antibodies and has now advanced in vivo studies. going from start to in vivo studies and under 12 months on a difficult target exemplifies the speed of our technologies. it also shows how partnering with abcellera can level the plain field for smaller companies.
similar to our previous announcements with eqrx, this deal structure has the potential to create a series of programs in which we have a greater ownership position, which could be up to 50%. these types of deals are aligned with our long-term strategy to build a portfolio that is diversified across indications, partner type, modality and deal structure. we believe this diversification can be effectively used to achieve strong economic returns, while at the same time avoiding the binary risk that is typically associated with biotech. moving on, i would now like to highlight swift progress that we have made in applying our technology to unlock next generation modalities.
specifically, i'm excited to update you on our progress in building a panel of cd3-binding antibodies for next generation t-cell engagers. we first announced this effort in november of last year. for those unfamiliar with the modality, t-cell engagers are a class of new cancer treatments designed to help the immune system recognize and kill cancer. they can be used alone or in combination of other cancer treatments, such as checkpoint inhibitors.
t-cell engages are bispecific antibodies that simultaneously bind to cd3, a receptor on t-cells and a specific tumor antigen. the success of these therapies is critically dependent on finding the right cd three antibodies. however, because cd3 in notoriously difficult target, there have been very few antibodies available, forcing drug developers to reuse the same suboptimal cd3 antibodies. this challenge is compounded by the fact that, technology for manufacturing bispecifics is also not widely available, forcing drug developers to further compromise on the design of their therapies.
to solve these problems, we applied our technology to build what we believe is now the largest panel of diverse, high quality, fully human cd3 antibodies available. we recently presented this work at the annual meeting of the american association for cancer research. this panel includes hundreds of unique antibodies has a broad range of functional activity and covers a large diversity of binding sites. we believe it opens the door to fine tuning t-cell activation in a way that is specific to each tumor antigens.
that should enable the design of therapies that achieved the correct therapeutic window and has the potential to extend the use of t-cell engagers to a broader range of cancers, including solid tumors. we are now actively working to demonstrate this application with a number of different tumor antigens. following aacr meeting, we have seen strong interest in partners and we are exploring opportunities to bring these forward with our programs, pardon me, are exploring opportunities to bring these forward into their programs. and with that, i'll hand off to andrew booth, our cfo, to provide an overview of our first quarter 2022 financials.
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
thanks, carl. i'm pleased to highlight the progress we've made on our key business metrics beginning with our program starts. we started six new programs in the first quarter of 2022. taking this to a cumulative number of 84 programs starts.
and while the rate of starts will continue to be somewhat irregular, we expect that generally increasing trend year over year as we have seen in the recent past. this is particularly true for the last year, we've started 30 programs in the trailing 12 months ended march 31, 2022 compared to seven programs and the trailing 12 months ended march 31, 2021. we ended the quarter with two new programs under contract with 36 unique partners. that is a 33% increase in programs under contract as compared to the end of q1 in 2021.
as we noted on a previous earnings call, with our total of 158 programs under contract, we have a strong look of work. our business development focuses on the high quality programs that are a complement to our existing partnerships and where we have a strong economic position for abcellera. as we have indicated previously, total programs under contract is a leading indicator of the longer term trajectory expected for program starts. also in q1 2022, our partners advanced one more molecule into the clinic, bringing our total molecules in the clinic to sixth at the end of the first quarter.
we view this growing list of molecules in the clinic as specific examples of our near and midterm potential revenue from downstream milestone fees and royalty payments in the longer term. the emergency use authorization of bamlanivimab and the current u.s. government purchase order in the first quarter contributed meaningfully to our q1 results. as mentioned on the prior slide, in the first quarter, we also had another molecule receive ind approval from the fda.
this molecule is from our trianni licensing activity, and at the request of our partner, more details about this molecule are not available at this time. however, we would expect to be able to provide additional details on the future call as the molecule advances into clinical trials. we expect to see continued strong growth in these key drivers of the business and of shareholder value in the years ahead. turning to revenue.
revenue in the quarter was $317 million. the revenues were dominated by the $307 million of royalties we earn from shipments bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab during the first three months of the year. research fees connected to our work on many programs, so the wide range of partners in q1 2022 were $9 million, a meaningfully increase from the same quarter last year. this quarter licensing fees were minimal and we have no new milestone payments.
looking ahead, we expect the majority of total 2022 revenue to be derived from royalties on covid antibodies, really sold and shipped 600,000 doses of bamlanivimab to the u.s. government in the first quarter. the u.s. government retains an option to purchase a further 500,000 doses, which if the option were exercised would be shipped by july 31.
lilly has stated that the exercise of this option by the u.s. government and any other future sales of bamlanivimab are uncertain, and they are currently guiding to know are only limited further covid antibody revenue. as a reminder, under our agreement with lilly for any covid-19 products developed, we are eligible to receive royalties in the low- to mid-teens for aggregate sales below $125 million and mid teens to mid 20s on aggregate sales above $125 million. in the first quarter, lilly's sales of bamlanivimab far exceeded $125 million so that any future sales of the product are eligible for the same higher royalty rate that we had been earning on bebtelovimab.
we continue to view covid royalties as a no non--dilutive source of funding to support our investments and capacity and platform capabilities, including investments into forward integration. turning to operating expenses. our research and development expenses for the quarter were approximately $26 million, a $14 million increase over the previous year. the overall increase reflects our ongoing investments in r&d, which will continue to grow as we expand our r&d team's capabilities and capacity.
this allows us to deliver our partner programs as well as to enhance our technology stack organically. in sales and marketing, expenses for the quarter were approximately $2 million. in the same quarter in 2021, we had a non-recurring expense of nearly $1 million. this masks the growth of our business development team, capabilities, and reach, and explains the small reduction compared to q1 in 2021.
general and administration expenses for the quarter were approximately $14 million, compared to approximately seven million in q1 2021. about $4 million of this increase were related to hire non-cash stock based compensation expenses. the increase is otherwise driven by the need to support the growth of the business. we are reporting earnings of over $168 million for q1 2022 compared to approximately $117 million in q1 of 2021.
in terms of earnings per share, this works out to an earnings of $0.59 per share on a basic and $0.54 on a diluted basis for the quarter. this result reflects the recognition of royalties on bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab and our ongoing investments to expand and enhance our discovery platform and to grow our diversified portfolio of long-term stakes in the next generation of antibody drugs, while running discovery efforts for our partners. looking at cash flows. operating cash flows, operating activities for the quarter contributed $100 million to cash flow, which includes the collection of the accrued accounts receivable balance from december 2021 that included royalties earned from bamlanivimab in the last quarter of 2021.
the royalties from q1 sales of bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab are reflected in our acute accrued receivables balance of $326 million as of march 31. on the investing activity side, the quarter shows total investments of $26 million largely related to investments in property, plant and equipment. as a part of our treasury strategy, we continue to keep about $240 million invested in short-term marketable securities. as a result, we finished the quarter with over $780 million of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
in summary, we remain in an increasingly strong liquidity position that allows us to execute on our strategy, continue to build capacity and to expand the platform. we believe that we have sufficient liquidity for well beyond the next three years. and with that, we'll be happy to take any questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from tiago fauth of credit suisse. your line is open. please go ahead.
tiago fauth -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks for the question and congrats on all the progress. so just wanted to know little bit more detail on the versant ventures deal. it's very interesting again, the value proposition for early stage innovators not having to build out some capacities.
it's a little bit more obvious and accepted. but i think that's a community relative to potential value add to larger biopharmaceutical companies. so any way you can give more context how that transaction came about? i mean talking about a portfolio of companies, different modalities potentially. so is this something that you can actually replicate across other venture capital firms.
is this something that is worth pursuing more aggressively perhaps at this stage of the existence? so curious about your thoughts there. thank you.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, tiago, for the question. carl hansen here. let me start by saying this is a segment of the market that we have been excited about for some time. and i think as per your comments, we see a huge opportunity to use investments in technology centrally along with a partnering business model to allow for the best ideas and the best science to compete on a level playing field and not be held back because of the capital requirements or the operational friction in moving a molecule from an idea through to something that can actually be used in the clinic and hopefully get forward to help treat patients.
if you'll indulge me an analogy that i like a lot, if you think about the semiconductor industry, where we're at a point now where two innovators with a good idea in a garage can very quickly move that forward and advance it and bring it to the marketplace. and they're able to do that because they can leverage a huge amount of infrastructure that is the foundation on which they can build their innovation. so they focus only on what is unique and essential to their business. the current state of biotech is not like that.
in biotech, if you have an idea, you need to get right down to the ground level and start to put in place the labs and hire the people, and you're doing that ultimately to bring a single asset forward. and that is incredibly wasteful and it actually holds back innovation to the detriment of those innovators of investors of the biotech community and ultimately, patients. so we think we can solve that by a combination of investments in technology and the business model. now a challenge with this is that if you look at the number of opportunities, there are a huge number of ideas out there and innovators and scientists and being able to efficiently connect with the very best and have them supported by experienced entrepreneurs and venture capital firms that can bring the people and the operations and the capital to turn those into viable businesses is a very important thing.
so this engagement with two top tier firms with versant and with atlas is very much about that. it's a win-win interaction, where we help them to be more competitive to people that are looking for venture capital investment. we help them to get their ideas off the start line faster and more efficiently. and in turn, we benefit by connecting with science that's already been vetted and with teams that know how to build companies that ultimately create value and bring molecules to the clinic.
tiago fauth -- credit suisse -- analyst
that makes sense. thanks for taking the question.
operator
next in the queue today, we have a question from gaurav goparaju of berenberg capital markets. please go ahead.
unknown speaker -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
this is ronald. i'm asking from the desk of gaurav. i just had a few questions regarding the royalties from the covid antibody, as they're reaching their government in, do you know -- can you tell us like what the next thing is on your radar in terms of pipeline commercialization? and do you know -- are you having an internal calculation of what your commercial royalties will be outside of just the percentage that you have?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, ronald, it's andrew here. thanks for the question. actually, you may have seen a couple of weeks ago, lilly announced just before their earnings that moving from the u.s.
government purchase orders of bebtelovimab, they are now selling bebtelovimab directly to states in order to make sure that, that product can get through to patients that are needing the covid antibodies in those states. so we'll no longer be going through the government purchase order mechanism. and i think we'd see this very positively as a way for the supply chain to kind of simplify and maybe be a little bit more the standard way of delivering those products and supply chain to patients that lilly is familiar with. so i think that is a positive move in terms of getting bebtelovimab, which is the last man standing in terms of its effectiveness against covid ultimately to the patients that are in need.
unknown speaker -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
ok, thank you for that. just one last question. you're sitting on -- you had over $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities. do you have any short-term plans for that?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
yeah, i would say we have long-term plans for the $1 billion we have in cash. and it's not lost of us, of course, the great position we're in to have such a strong balance sheet, especially as we are investing heavily in the capability building of the company and of the platform. as we've seen in the past, we have consistently been great stewards of capital in growing that investment. and we saw doubling typically our investment in r&d and in sales and marketing year over year.
and q2 was much the same, growing almost 100% over the same period in 2021. in addition, of course, we have very ambitious plans with our investment in the vertical integration through translational sciences, cmc and gmp manufacturing. so that is -- those are the investments in the short -- the immediate and mid and long term that we are pursuing in order to put that capital to work.
unknown speaker -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
awesome. thank you so much, and congratulations on a great quarter. thank you for taking my question.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president

operator
the next question comes from puneet souda of svb securities. your line is open.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
yeah. hi, carl, andrew. thanks for taking the question. so a couple from my end.
just wanted to understand the first a bit about the pre-partner programs. andrew, maybe you can -- can you qualify maybe an expense for these -- for pre-partner programs and sort of what sort of investment that they require? and maybe just give us a -- give us a sense of what -- despite the early days, what sort of investment that you expect here? and duration of that? and then how broad are these pre-partner programs are going to be across sort of the different therapeutic categories or whatnot? and then ultimately, this is something that is routinely done by your clients, not necessarily abcellera. so just wondering what is the long-term objective here? is this something that you would want to develop a molecule or a drug that you would want to develop yourself?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, puneet, good to hear from you. i'll take the first part of that question regarding the expense, and then i'll pass it over to carl to talk about the breadth of the -- what we'll be working on. so of course, as carl mentioned in his remarks, the emphasis here is on technology development, and those are the efforts that we're spending in our r&d.
i did mention that two-thirds of our efforts and our expense in r&d is on capability and platform building and that these sort of pre-partnered assets are the benefits that result from having to work on real things to make sure that your technology development is actually achieving ultimately the goals that you're aiming to prove out in terms of speed of being able to find antibodies, being able to find antibodies that previously had been intractable and also making those investments to prevent smaller companies from having to rebuild the wheel and be more competitive. so in terms of the added expense, i think those expenditures in r&d are already included in kind of our base business model, and that's just a -- this benefit of having assets pop out of those investments are just something that we are benefiting from these investments. and in terms of the breadth and depth of that, i'll let carl comment on that.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
sure. yes, so maybe i'll just back up to a higher level here and revisit what is the strategy, and where we see the pre-partner programs coming from. so we have set out to be the company that invest in technologies that allow for us to do discovery at greater speed and higher quality at greater scale that's been done before. and another very important dimension is to push back the frontier of what's possible and open up new opportunities for new modalities and new target classes.
so in order to do that, that means that we are launching on to technology development efforts, where we're trying to solve big, hard problems to have the potential not to bring one asset forward, but to open up entire classes. so right now, the two areas that we're focused on are in t cell engagers, where if we can demonstrate, and we believe we're on track to do that, that the combination of orthomab and cd3 can generate quickly t cell engagers with better properties, more suited for therapeutic development. there are dozens of potential targets that can be connected with. similarly, on the difficult target space ion channels and gpcrs, if you went to google and you did a quick search, you would quickly come up with dozens of targets that have the potential to be first-in-class blockbuster therapies that address severe and unmet medical needs.
so that's what the big prize is. now when you're working on that, you need to work on real problems, and as we make progress against the technology hurdles, you will have, through that work, develop assets that are valuable and that need to be brought forward into development. our strategy is to be focused on the technology and the capability building and then to do that by partnering before those costs get large with companies that are better positioned, frankly by clinical development and commercial development. so i know when that happens, that everyone will be focused on the assets and they'll be very excited about that.
for us, what's most exciting is that once you've done it once, it's likely you're going to be able to do it again and again and again. so the three things that we really want to get out of this is, first, open up these new therapeutic opportunities. second, prove to people, again, and we have done this before, that our investments in technology are having an roi and allowing us to succeed, where others have failed. and third, of course, bring forward assets that i believe our partners will be excited to take on, and they will see it as though we have opened up opportunities and anticipated needs.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful. and in terms of the metrics around these pre-partner programs and the data releases, how should we think about that? and then maybe just on the bispecific data, what conferences sort of you're targeting there? and then just i have one more follow-up.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
sure. so in terms of data release and metrics, so we're currently not included in anything related to pre-partnered programs or this technology development effort in program starts. we -- one of the advantages of doing this work is that we will have the data, and we're not nearly as constrained as we normally are in terms of confidentiality in sharing this with the public and having people have a sense of what is possible with the platform. so as these programs advance and they get to the point, where we believe we've made a meaningful advance toward the end goal of actually developing the therapeutic, then we will bring those forward on quarterly calls, at scientific presentations, wherever -- or perhaps in publications, wherever it's appropriate.
it's difficult -- i know you're going to ask me, it's difficult to predict the timing of that because these are difficult problems we're trying to solve. that said, we're excited by the progress we're making, both on the t cell front and on the difficult targets. and we are hopeful that we'll have all things -- if things line up well, we'll have meaningful results to share within the next 12 months or so. in terms of the t cell engager work, we are looking to present this at some conferences in the relatively near future.
thus far, we don't have confirmation. so i'll have to wait before i can share that detail with you.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
ok. and then last one, if i could. if you don't mind, if i could just squeeze in one last one around. we get a lot of questions from investors around small biotech exposure that the companies have.
obviously, you have a number of vc projects and early stage projects. can you maybe just give us a sense of what's the exposure here for contracts? or what's the exposure for small early stage biotech that you have versus the larger biopharma within your contract -- total contracts. obviously, you have a number of vc projects ongoing, too. so it seems like that could -- that number could increase.
thanks so much.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
sure. yes. i'm pretty i'm happy to answer that. i think on a previous call, i don't remember which one, we did present some details of our portfolio in terms of programs under contract.
within that presentation, there was a breakdown in terms of deals with biotech or with partners, we would characterize as large pharma. roughly a quarter to a third of programs under contract are with the large integrated pharma companies, which, of course, means, let's say, 60% to 75% are with biotech companies. that pool of biotech companies spans the gamut from companies that are right out of the gate. companies like the ones we are working with already with these venture capital groups, but up to more mature publicly traded small mid-cap biotech companies.
incidentally, that breakdown is largely in line with what we believe to be the distribution of program starts across the sector. and the same could be said about indication. so we seem to have a portfolio that is broadly reflecting the sector. thus far, we don't see a trend of it tipping, but of course, that could change over time.
puneet souda -- svb leerink -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions.
operator
our next question comes from stephen willey of stifel. your line is open. please go ahead.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress. maybe just following up on the bispecific side.
maybe just curious if you can speak to whether or not these two known tumor antigens that you've initiated work on? are these geared toward hematological or solid tumors? and i guess, if the latter, do you feel like valency is also going to be kind of incorporated into the interrogative process here to try to minimize crs and maybe improve safety tolerability and just off-target exposure?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, steve. carl here. i'm happy to take that. so the first two programs we've initiated are not directed toward hematology, they are toward solid tumors.
we see that as the big challenge and the big prize. and honestly, where the biggest unmet need is right now. in terms of thinking about valency, we are using the orthomab platform. this is a platform that allows us to use our cd3 panel and binders on the tumor antigens in a variety of different formats, including one by one, it looks like an igg, two by one, two by two.
so we are investigating that. that said, we also believe and we've got evidence thus far from the characterization we've done that a lot of the effects that you are -- that you are alluding to, can be achieved if you've got the right binder, the right affinity, the right epitope. so we would see format as one of the ways that you can change the functional properties of the bispecific, but it's not the only one. and given the breadth of cd3 and the flexibility of the platform, we've got a lot of options at our disposal to look at.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and i'm not sure what you can say regarding this transition of bebtelovimab from government purchasing to more of a lilly led distribution channel. but do we know anything about kind of where they currently are with manufacturing capacity? and just whether or not they've indicated whether to you or i guess in any public forum, as to whether or not they intend to keep manufacturing here and kind of the on mode.
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, steve, it's andrew here. so we don't have a lot of extra details about this. this is probably much better a question for lilly.
what we can point people toward, and i mentioned it in my prepared remarks is the hhs data that we see, which gets updated on a weekly basis, over the last number of weeks, quite consistently has been averaging doses administrative of 4,000 doses per day. so we would imagine that, that would continue, but we -- that's the public data that we have to work from. so i think from a manufacturing standpoint, we don't have any insight, but i would point to the fact that due to bebtelovimab's potency, it's quite a low dose that is required. so the manufacturing effort is not too onerous, which i think it's still 175 milligrams per dose.
so hopefully, that would mean that the manufacturing capacity that they have would stretch a long way in terms of benefiting a lot of patients out there, who are still contracting covid, as you know.
stephen willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
understood. thanks for taking the question.
operator
our next question comes from gary nachman of bmo capital markets. your line is open.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks. good afternoon. so the six new programs under contract with two new partners, atlas and one undisclosed, and then also the versant deal.
just talk about the economics with those new partnerships if these are higher value arrangements. i'm assuming they are and how you set them up? and i'm curious if there are a lot more vc deals out there to come. how big is that universe for you?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, gary, good to hear from you. so yes, the six programs under contract, well, with atlas and then undisclosed partner, but as you point out, with versant another eight programs that was in the press release and as well in the prepared remarks. i think that we don't disclose, of course, the economic terms of any of our partnerships.
so i think the last time and what we will do, i think, consistently on an annualized basis is kind of in aggregate, show what the terms are from the previous year, and we did that most recently in our 10-k. we do see we're adding quite a bit of value, and we're being quite judicious about the programs we are bringing out under contract. and i think thus far in 2022, we're behaving quite consistent to our previous strategy of how we've articulated that. i do think that there is a good market to go to where our offering will be quite attractive to these venture capital funds.
and i think carl may have a few more words to say about how attractive and the prospects we see there.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
yes. hi, gary. carl here. first, maybe just a comment on sort of the big picture.
if you look over the last decade or perhaps a bit more, one of the things that has become very apparent is that the large majority of new programs or new therapeutics are actually originating in biotech. so biotech is a rich source of innovation. one of the reasons is that it is distributed, there's lots of ideas, lots of things that are being attempted. the other side of that is that our research shows that if you looked at the total number of therapeutic antibody starts administered in any given year, roughly 50% of that comes from relatively small biotech companies.
so that's a big part of the market. of course, it's important that you're able to find the best programs and also assemble the teams around it, and that's why this engagement with versant and atlas and other like firms. i think there's potential. there is synergistic and has the potential to really create some value, not just for us for the investors and for the companies.
the last thing i'll say is that starting companies in the antibody space historically has a goal to do. and one of the reasons is that the complexity of doing the discovery of characterizing of doing the development work and ultimately manufacturing, a therapeutic antibody presents a very formidable hurdle for a new company. internally, we've done some analysis, and you can quickly convince yourself that when you have to rebuild all of that, even if it is a good idea, could mean that it would stand up to the same probabilities of success that have traditionally been seeing in the industry, it may not be a viable investment opportunity. when instead, you take that idea and you connect it with infrastructure and capability and expertise that is already in place, you shorten the time lines and you reduce the capital needs and you make that opportunity now a viable investment.
so from that perspective, it is our hope and it is our belief that this type of deal can actually expand the universe of companies and ideas that people have been and hopefully make it through to be therapeutics.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, great. it's helpful. and then, carl, just on the six molecules in the clinic, anything more you can say on those that the types of studies being run therapeutic areas, when we might see some clinical data? any sense on that? and then i have one more?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
no, gary. obviously, the molecules that are in the clinic are under -- are being driven by our partners. and so we would -- we refer you to them to get updates and when you expect to have the results from various trials. many of these are still quite early.
so i think we're a ways off before they get to the pivotal trial.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then andrew, i appreciate your comments before just on bebtelovimab and lilly strategy. but i mean, should we assume -- it's obviously hard for us to model this going forward as it is for you right now, we could look at the average number of doses per day. but assuming also, there'll be a pricing benefit when they go through the commercial channel, is that a reasonable assumption?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think as you point out, gary, it's tough for us to model as well. so trust me, we're quite sympathetic to that. we view it, of course, as upside and non-dilutive funding to allow us to continue our investment as we, i think, have said quite consistently. on the pricing, previously, the government purchase orders were at about $1,800 a dose for the -- for bebtelovimab.
we noticed in the recent release that the new pricing is at $2,100 a dose for how doses are going out under this new commercial arrangement through -- with eli lilly selling directly to states. so that's just another data point that we've also seen in the publicly available information.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, that's very helpful. thank you.
operator
our next question today comes from do kim of piper sandler. please go ahead.
do kim -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. so i just want to go back to carl's comment on the current biotech market environment, having potential tailwinds to abcellera. but as you look at your partnered programs that are past discovery and in preclinical studies, have you observed any slowdown or pause in development of these programs by the partner.
we're seeing small-cap biotech looking to cut cost or reduce cost, having to just slow down the development of preclinical programs. i'm just wondering if you're seeing the same.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
hi, do. carl here. with the caveat that, of course, we're relatively early in this current market. i'd say that we haven't seen any indication of that whatsoever.
and i don't think that i really anticipate that for a few reasons. one is, by and large, we have managed to partner with very high quality firms. and even in a bear market, the high quality firms are going to be able to access capital and make sure that they are moving their programs forward. for the smaller companies, biotech, the last thing that you compromise is the one asset that you're moving forward.
so people prioritize these. and thus far, we've seen no indication that's going to be an issue. of course, even if that does happen, and as a general comment, if there are smaller companies that are moving forward with assets that are promising, but the companies are required for some reason to slow down operations, it's typical that those will be picked up by larger companies in the space. and so in biotech, good, high quality assets ultimately find their way to the bigger companies that are well positioned to do the late stage trials in the commercial development.
do kim -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and a question on the vc partnerships? i know you can't say much about the deal economics, but was getting equity in the start-up companies, the vc-backed biotechs ever are on the table. is this something that you guys look for? i imagine that it could be a potential option for these start-ups with just low starting capital?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
we have done some deals in the past with early stage companies, where we do have an equity position. we haven't disclosed all of the -- all the terms associated with these particular deals. but i feel safe to say it's not an equity-based deal. it's more like our standard discovery agreement.
and that doesn't mean that, that we might not be open to that in some special cases, but it's not our line of business to be building equity positions. we're much more focused on building a portfolio of royalty positions and stakes in the actual molecules.
do kim -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok, thank you. thanks for taking my questions.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from antonia borovina of bloom burton. please go ahead.
antonia borovina -- bloom burton -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. my first question is just related to your program starts, and i know that you mentioned before that those can be lumpy and quite variable from quarter to quarter, but the last two quarters, they have been a bit lighter than we were anticipating. so i just want to clarify that, that's just a timing thing and that there weren't any delays or capacity constraints that impacted the number of programs you could start in the second quarter? and also whether you're anticipating an acceleration in program starts in the second half of the year?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
hey, antonia. it's andrew here. good question. certainly, the reason that we indicate and the reason i presented in my prepared remarks, the trailing 12 months is because as you point out, this is expected to be somewhat irregular or lumpy.
we have not had any issues related to our capacity in terms of addressing program starts whatsoever. so i think we are seeing great benefits from our increases in investments on the capacity and capabilities of the team. remember as well on that -- in that same -- along that same theme, every program that we do -- we tend to take on more and more work as we add capabilities on behalf of our partners. we also reflect that in our -- where we see that in the capability and capacity that we're building.
we're -- this is not indicative of a slowdown, i think, i would say, for the second quarter, but we do expect the irregularity of this and why we will probably continue to state it on a trailing 12-month basis rather than on a trailing six months or certainly a quarter over quarter.
antonia borovina -- bloom burton -- analyst
ok, thanks. and then if i could just one follow-up. i wanted to clarify regarding your bite platform. have you made this platform available to potential partners yet? or have you primarily focused on proving it out with your pre-partnered program?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
carl here. i'll take that one. so i think you're referring to our bispecific t cell engager platform, which is related to bites, but it's not a bite platform. i just wanted to make sure we're clear on that.
so we have -- we launched this in november. that was starting from ground zero. to date, we have built up the cd3 panel. we have conducted a series, i'd say, a comprehensive set of experiments to characterize that panel and believe it is best in world in many dimensions, including diversity and cross-reactivity functional properties.
what we need to do now is to prove that out against a series of antigens that are of commercial interest and that people are -- will recognize as creating value. so we're doing that internally. at the same time, we have been engaging in business development discussions with a variety of groups to start to access that panel. i'd say those discussions are going very well, and we've seen a great deal of interest.
i've actually been surprised by a lot of interest. but we're still working through those. and it's not -- we don't have a time line for when we might be engaging on having other people access that platform just yet.

we have no further questions in the queue. so i'll hand the call back over to carl hansen for closing remarks.

carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, tryn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. it's my pleasure to provide an update on our business for the second quarter of 2022. abcellera is on rock solid footing. despite what has been a challenging time for biotech, we believe the current market environment is a strong tailwind for our business.
we ended the quarter with over $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and we are fully funded to continue executing on our strategy and building our business. in contrast, the current environment pose serious challenges, there will be competitors, and we, therefore, expect to extend our competitive advantage. at the same time, well-managed biotech companies must continue to drive innovation, while also prioritizing efficiency and capital preservation. this dynamic reinforces the value of our business model, which empowers them to leverage outside expertise, save time, reduce fixed costs and improve their chances of success.
finally, rationalization across the industry is likely to result in a consolidation of talent, which will benefit companies that are positioned for growth. we have continued to attract top tier talent, including new cmc and gmp leaders, and we expect to leverage this trend, as we continue to scale our operations and capabilities. abcellera's purpose is to be a catalyst for the industry by developing technologies that make drug development faster, more efficient and more accessible. there are three foundational steps in drug development.
product ideation is the basic biological research that identifies the target and defines the properties required for a therapeutic. once this is done, the next step is to create therapeutic products. this step of product creation is arguably one of the most complex, regulated and technologically intensive in any sector, and this is also the step that is most critical to get right. and that is because in drug development, unlike any other industry, by far the most time and most money is spent on the third step, which is product testing and validation.
this involves clinical trials that typically take seven years to 10 years and incur costs in the range of $1 billion. once the process begins, you're committed. therefore, if you're going to embark on such an investment of time and capital. it is imperative that you get it right from the start.
we believe product creation is also the step in drug development that has been most neglected and that this is the place, where our technology can drive the most value. our long-term strategy is to build a competitive advantage in antibody product creation and to use this advantage to amass a diversified portfolio of stakes in next-generation antibody products. our business model and investments create significant value in three ways: by making drug development faster by doing things that haven't been done before and by leveling the playing field for partners and expanding the ecosystem of innovators. for example, we believe bringing an antibody treatment for those who need it one year faster than the current industry standard could increase the value of an improved treatment by more than $200 million in net present value.
moreover, being the first to market could result in larger market share in billions of dollars in additional therapy sales. similarly, we estimate that opening up new target space and modalities has the potential to unlock market segments that together represent more than $100 billion in opportunity. and finally, removing the need to reinvent the wheel, lowers the barrier to entry and can help small companies compete more effectively. for innovative biotech companies committed to doing drug development at the highest level, this could save them more than a year and tens of millions of dollars at the earliest stages.
as an example, this quarter, we signed a number of new deals to unlock breakthrough science by collaborating with premier venture capital firms, versant ventures and atlas ventures. both of these teams have proven track records in identifying exceptional science and then translating those breakthroughs into exciting and impactful company. we provide these early stage companies with the ability to start discovery immediately and advance programs without having to build the underlying capabilities, teams and infrastructure. this allows them to focus on their innovative science, operate with enhanced capital efficiency and increase the probability of finding an optimal therapeutic candidate.
in turn, abcellera benefits from these partnerships by connecting with the very best science, fueling the growth of our diverse portfolio of stakes in next-generation antibody therapy. we also believe we can use our technology advantage to do things that have not been done before. specifically, i'm excited to update you on our progress in building a panel of cd3 binding antibodies for next-generation t cell engagers, an effort that we first announced in november of last year. as a quick reminder, t cell engagers are bispecific antibodies that guide the immune system to recognize and kill cancer cells by binding both t cells and tumor cells at the same time.
cd3 is a large protein complex found on the surface of t cells and is recognized as a difficult target. as a result, there's only a small number of cd3-targeting antibodies available, which limits the ability to fine-tune t cell activation. building optimal t cell engagers requires access to a panel of cd3 antibodies that have a broad range of binding properties and the ability to bind to a wide variety of site on the cd3 complex. using our technology, we believe we have built the industry's largest panel of diverse, high quality and fully human cd3 antibodies that is currently available.
we presented our data at aacr earlier this year. as an update to this, we have new data showing that our cd3 panel includes more than 200 unique antibodies that bind broadly across multiple sites on the cd3 complex. our panel also exhibits a broad range of binding affinities, spanning almost three orders of magnitude. as a first demonstration of this panel, we paired different cd3 antibodies with an antibody directed against a model tumor antigen gfr, creating bispecific antibodies for testing.
these proof-of-concept bispecifics showed that they induced a wide range of t cell activation. and importantly, we identified bispecifics that effectively kill tumor cells with either no or very low cytokine release, suggesting these molecules could overcome key hurdles in the clinic. these data indicate that our cd3 panel is capable of constructing antibodies with a wide range of functional activities, which is exactly what is needed to build tunable, optimized therapeutic t cell engagers. as the next step, we are actively working to demonstrate the application of our platform with a number of different tumor targeting arms, where we are optimizing both arms of the bispecific.
to date, we've initiated discovery against two well-known tumor antigens, and we anticipate starting work on two or three more before the end of the year. we will be sharing data from these programs, as they become available and believe that doing this work on real-world problems with high commercial potential is critical both to the development and validation of our t cell engager platform. while the primary objective of this work is technology development, the byproduct of these efforts could be bispecific antibodies with the potential to be advanced as best-in-class cancer therapies. this potential for asset generation, as a benefit of technology development is also present in our work in unlocking difficult target classes, including gpcrs and ion channels.
in either case, for t cell engagers or for difficult targets, our intention is to partner any resulting assets for clinical and commercial development. for that reason, we refer to them as pre-partnered programs, and we will share more information on these as they mature. i would like to highlight that we have previously had assets derived from our technology development efforts. specifically, our work on platform development for rapid pandemic response is what resulted in the covid-19 antibodies, which we subsequently partnered with eli lilly.
in this case, we have spent two years developing our technology specifically for pandemic response prior to the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic, and we initiated our work before entering into a partnership with eli lilly. bamlanivimab was the first antibody to be authorized by the fda, and bebtelovimab continues to be used to combat the virus remains effective against all known variants of concern and is still the most potent covid-19 antibody treatment available. the value of assets that can be generated through technology development efforts is illustrated by the 2.5 million doses that have been delivered to patients thus far, saving tens of thousands of lives. in summary, abcellera is ideally positioned to stay on course and to deliver value for patients, for our partners and for our shareholders.
and with that, i'll hand it over to andrew booth, our cfo, to provide an overview of our second quarter 2022 financials. andrew?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
thanks, carl. i'm pleased to highlight the progress we've made in our key business metrics, beginning with program starts. we started four new programs in the second quarter of 2022, taking us to a cumulative number of 88 program starts. as we've stated previously, we expect the number of starts in the quarter to be somewhat irregular, and we expect the strong underlying number of starts to continue.
this holds true for the last year. we started 28 programs in the 12 months ended june 30, 2022, compared to 12 programs in the trailing 12 months ended june 30, 2021. for clarity, the program starts reported here do not include the discovery efforts initiated by abcellera that may lead to the pre-partnered programs that carl mentioned earlier in the call. we ended the quarter with six new programs under contract, all of which were with two new partners.
that's a 19% increase in programs under contract as compared to the end of q2, 2021. with our total of 164 programs under contract, we continue to have a strong book of work. in addition, we entered into a collaboration with versant ventures to discover therapeutic antibodies for multiple targets selected by versant's portfolio of biotech companies. this collaboration builds on previous work between versant and abcellera, which has already enabled three of the firm's stealth stage company.
our business development focus continues to be on high quality programs that are a complement to our existing partnerships and where abcellera has a strong economic position. consistent with these objectives, we believe that the partnerships that we've entered into in this last quarter are excellent additions to our portfolio. as we've previously indicated, the total number of programs under contract is a leading indicator of the longer-term trajectory expected for program start. as of june 30, 2022, we continue to report six molecules in the clinic.
for our molecules at a commercial stage, a u.s. government purchase order for 150,000 doses of bebtelovimab was received and partially fulfilled by our partner, eli lilly, during june of 2022. this contributed meaningfully to our q2 results. in addition, lilly recently announced that they will begin commercial sales of bebtelovimab to states, hospitals and other healthcare providers starting this month.
we would expect this arrangement to enable the use of the -- use of bebtelovimab in the future. according to u.s. hhs data, bebtelovimab has recently been administered at an average rate of approximately 4,000 doses per day within the united states. as we've stated in the past, we view the growing list of molecules in the clinic as specific examples of our near and midterm potential revenue from downstream milestone fees and royalty payments in the longer term.
we expect to see continued strong growth on these key drivers of the business and of shareholder value in the years ahead. turning to revenue. our revenue in the quarter was $46 million. revenues were driven in large part by the $33 million of royalties we earned from shipments of bebtelovimab at the end of the quarter.
research fees connected to our work on many programs with a wide range of partners in q2, 2022 were approximately $13 million, a meaningful increase from the same quarter last year, reflecting the strength of our core discovery activities. licensing fees were minimal this quarter, and we earned no new milestone payments. looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we expect continued strength in research fees and the majority of total 2022 revenue to be derived from royalties on covid antibodies. lilly sold and shipped over 670,000 doses of bebtelovimab to the u.s.
government in the first half of 2022. we expect this to reach 750,000 doses cumulatively in q3 given the current confirmed orders by the u.s. government. the new arrangement of commercial sales by lilly of bebtelovimab to state hospitals and other healthcare providers starting this month is expected to result in additional royalties to abcellera, and we will be watching that closely as usage normalizes in the coming months and quarters.
as a reminder, under our agreement with lilly, we are entitled to receive royalties in the mid-teens to mid-20s on sales of bebtelovimab. we continue to view covid royalties, as a non-dilutive source of funding to support our investments in capacity and platform capability building, including investments into forward integration. turning to our operating expenses. our research and development expenses for the second quarter were approximately $27 million, a $12 million increase over the previous year.
the overall increase reflects the ongoing investments into r&d, which will continue to grow as we expand our r&d team's capabilities and capacity. this allows us to deliver our partnered programs, as well as to enhance our capabilities organically. of note, approximately two-thirds of our r&d efforts are directed at enhancing capabilities and about one-third relates to partner program execution. in sales and marketing, expenses for the quarter were approximately $3 million compared to $1 million in q2, 2021.
general and administration expenses for the quarter were approximately $14 million compared to approximately $11 million in q2 of 2021. the increase is largely driven by the need to support the growing business. we are reporting a net loss of approximately $7 million for q2, 2022 compared to a loss of approximately $2 million in q2, 2021. in terms of earnings per share, this works out to a loss of $0.02 per share on a basic and diluted basis for the quarter.
this result reflects the recognition of royalties on bebtelovimab, mostly offsetting our ongoing investments to expand and enhance our discovery platform and to grow our diversified portfolio of long-term stakes in the next generation of antibody drugs, while running discovery efforts for our partners. looking at cash flow, operating activities for the first six months of 2022 contributed $373 million to cash. this notably includes the collection of the accrued accounts receivable balance from royalties earned in the last quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. on the investing activity side, the first half of the year shows a total investments of $54 million, largely related to investments in property, plant and equipment, as we continue to build our facility, including those supporting our investments in forward integration into translational sciences, cmc and gmp manufacturing.
as a part of our treasury strategy, we continue to keep approximately $230 million invested in short-term marketable securities. as a result, we finished the quarter with over $1 billion of unrestricted cash, equivalents and marketable securities. in summary, we remain in an increasingly strong liquidity position that allows us to execute on our strategy, including making material investments to build capacity, capabilities and expand the platform. we believe that we have sufficient liquidity for well beyond the next three years, while making these investments.
and with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. operator?

hi. thanks for taking my question. and congrats on the progress. i was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the discovery process that it takes -- that takes for going against a gpcr target.
is it different than your conventional target? and does it have extended discovery timelines? and, specifically, for regeneron, when they take responsibility of the antibody candidate, are they starting at ind-enabling studies at this point?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
great. thanks, do. this is carl hansen. i'll take those two questions in turn.
so, first, your question related to differences in discovery against non-gpcr targets, or more standard targets and gpcrs. and, perhaps, i'll even frame that by expanding the question to talk about ion channels as well, which are both within this effort that we're running. so, gpcrs and ion channels represent a huge class of targets. they are two of the largest target classes.
there are many high-profile targets that are out there that have been well-validated, either through clinical development of small molecules, but where, perhaps, specificity or toxicity had been an issue, or that are well-validated through other mechanisms, and where antibodies are believed to be a very attractive modality to solve some of those challenges. despite that, both historic classes have been notoriously difficult to run discovery against. and the reasons are not just one thing, the reasons are manifold. it includes poor immunogenicity of the targets.
it includes a small epitope or real estate that's available for binding an antibody. and it also includes the need for special capabilities in functional assays and identifying antibodies that are both developable and that have the right functional activity against the target. so, it's not one thing. what is really needed is a latticework of technologies that allow you with high probability to go from a target name through to a molecule that does what it's supposed to do, it's efficacious, and also has the properties to develop it as a drug.
we have been working in this space now for many years. and for just about three years now, i've had a long-range intensive r&d effort to put in place all of those different technologies and leverage abcellera's core platforms to unlock that space. so, once that technology development has been done, the timelines for development of those targets are not different. but, of course, many of these would still be considered some of the hardest in the industry.
and we are still doing work to break those open. with respect to the regeneron collaboration, as mentioned, we worked with regeneron productively on a gpcr target. and we've helped them to overcome the formidable hurdle of finding a candidate that's ready for further development. that molecule is not yet in an ind-enabling study, but our belief and the indication from regeneron is that they are now moving that molecule toward those studies and ultimately toward ind.
do kim -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thank you for all those details. that was very helpful.

the next question comes from the line of puneet souda of svb. please proceed.
unknown speaker -- svb leerink partners -- analyst
hi. you have michael on for puneet. thank you for taking my question. my first question is about the early pipeline.
so, we've been hearing a little bit about increased caution for capital spending by biopharma. i am wondering if that's at all reflected in the program starts for new programs on the contract, or do you think if you're seeing any sort of similar impact on your pipeline? then one quick question about bebtelovimab and the new covid mab. i was wondering if the development timeline for this new mab would be at all similar to bebtelovimab, or the fact that covid kind of have the pandemic state to an extent, if that affects the timeline. thank you.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
michael, this is carl. so, maybe i'll start first by answering your question on bebtelovimab and the new lead that we've identified as a next-generation -- or third-generation molecule for covid-19. so, as you know, we have now applied our platform three times to come up with solutions for covid-19. the first, of course, was bamlanivimab, which was done at tremendous speed in combination with eli lilly.
that was, i believe, and still is a record in speed in developing the therapeutic. the next one was bebtelovimab, where we focused on breadth and potency. and in this case, we have now developed -- or we've now discovered a new antibody that we believe has the potency and breadth to cover the current situation with covid-19 and what is in the foreseeable future. i would expect that the timeline to bring that to the clinic, and then through clinical development, would be similar to what we've done in the past with eli lilly, provided that we are successful in finding a clear regulatory path for that development.
and i do know that there have been conversations between eli lilly and the fda about how that would proceed. i don't know the status of that. but we are ready with that solution if that opening is there. now, moving on to the other part of your question, which, i believe, was related to program starts.
there certainly is, you know, some element of the macro environment that everyone's keeping an eye on. but i will remind you that in the q4 call of last year, we indicated that we were shifting our business development priority from volume from the number of programs and partners that we have secured, to prioritizing the highest value deals. and we expected that we would do fewer deals but do some deals that we have greater participation in and where, as we forward integrate, we are doing more of the work per program. for us, that is one of the ways in which we maximize the overall value of the portfolio.
that is what has been happening over the last couple of quarters. and i did mention some exciting progress on the co-development programs, where we have completely in-house brought these from an email with the target right through to what we expect in 2023 will be a development candidate. and on those programs, as i mentioned, we have currently a 50% ownership stake and an option to co-invest and maintain that ownership stake. so, there are now seven programs in that bucket with four different partners.
and of course, as we apply more effort and do more of the work per program, we expect that the total number of programs were going to be lower. we expect the total value will be higher. and importantly, it's our belief that the timelines to clinical development will be faster and the probability of each program getting to clinical development will also be very significantly improved.
unknown speaker -- svb leerink partners -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from gaurav goparaju of berenberg. please proceed.
gaurav goparaju -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
congrats on the quarter. just two for me. you know, given you announced the regeneron program, you know, entering preclinical studies, should we expect similar announcements on future programs that enter preclinical studies? and then, as a follow-up to that, you know, are you able to disclose how many programs are currently in preclinical studies based on, you know, the answer?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
great question. yes. so, we typically do not make an announcement when programs move toward preclinical studies. in this particular case, we did make an announcement in part because we had not formally announced that deal back in 2020.
and also because of the significant progress with a high-profile partner in moving forward a program against a very difficult target. so, i would consider this the exception, and we will not routinely be giving progress updates on molecules until they reach ind for sure. and, perhaps, earlier on a case-by-case basis.
gaurav goparaju -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
got it. thanks. and then, one more for me. just -- is there any update on the timeline regarding the gmp facility?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
yeah. you remember previously -- hey, gaurav, it's andrew speaking here. previously, we'd indicated that the gmp facility was on track for the end of 2024. i'd say in terms of having the facility up and working on our first batches and qualification batches at the end of 2024, we're still on track for that with the first kind of commercial batches being in 2025.
so, that would be -- so, roughly on schedule of where we were and how we've indicated previously.
gaurav goparaju -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
awesome. appreciate it. cheers, guys.
operator
thank you. next question comes from stephen willey of stifel. please proceed.
steve willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions. with respect to the in-house work that's being done on ion channel and the gpcr side, i understand the regeneron lead candidate was developed via the velocimouse that regeneron has. are you guys using the trianni transgenic platform for the in-house gpcr work?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, steve. carl here. so, yes, the program with regeneron took advantage of velocimouse with our internal work, which is really, you know, intimately connected with long-range r&d efforts on unlocking target space and unlocking new modalities, you know, t cell engagers, as well as gpcr and ion channels. we are using the trianni platform.
we have access to another transgenic platform. and on a case-by-case basis, we also use other sources of diversity, including different animal species, such as camelids, you know, wild-type rats, and other animals, in order to maximize the chance of finding leads that can be developed. of course, if we start with humanized rodents, then the path to a final candidate is shorter. but for many of these targets, the name of the game is getting a molecule over the finish line period because they've been out of reach for a long time.
and so, we don't pull punches on that.
steve willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and i guess maybe just sticking on the in-house development work. i know that you mentioned you'll be presenting some of the cd3 variant data at sitc. and i believe in the abstract, you also talk about how you've identified some -- i don't know if you want to call them leads, but you've identified some candidates, both egfr cd3 targeting.
should we anticipate that there's an opportunity to maybe move one of these forward into, perhaps, ind-enabling studies at some point?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
yes, steve, so the update at sitc, you know, will be later this week. and so, i don't want to steal any thunder from that. some of that work will be showing a further characterization and expansion of the panel. and we believe that that's one of the critical steps to being able to generate optimal therapeutic molecules.
the work that will be presented on egfr, i would characterize as proof of concept. so, we do not intend and do not expect that work to lead to assets. although, of course, you know, we could be surprised. i did mention on a previous call that in order to validate the hypothesis that an improved diversity and quality of cd3 combined with orthomab can lead to therapeutic candidates with a better profile in terms of cell killing and cytokine release, we have initiated some work internally on well-known targets that are focused on solid tumors.
we are not yet at the point to share that data. so, i don't expect sharing that data at sitc. but that -- we will share that as those programs mature.
steve willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and then, just lastly, are you able to say whether or not the new clinical candidate from the undisclosed partner in alzheimer's, if that has downstream economics associated with it?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
yes, it does have downstream economics. thank you.
steve willey -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. great. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. next question comes from gary nachman of bmo. please proceed.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi, guys. good afternoon. first, for the four new programs starts in 3q, to get to 92, is there anything that you're doing differently now versus a couple of years ago in terms of leads to start these programs or how you approach them? and you also had four new starts in the second quarter. is that a good cadence to think about? and then, are you making any further inroads with the vcs after the atlas and versant partnerships that you announced last quarter? that seemed like a, you know, nice initiative for you and maybe a lot of room to run there.
so, i'm curious if you're making any more progress there and if you think we're going to hear about more of those partnerships going forward.
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, gary. it's andrew here. i'll take the first part.
and then, when it comes to the question about the vcs, i'll hand off to carl. so, with the program starts, you know, it's the same definition of what constitutes a program start, as we've always been using. it's quite a rigorous definition. there's always going to be some variability quarter to quarter.
importantly, when you said, ""hey, is there anything we're doing differently?"" i think what's important, and carl mentioned in one of the previous questions, is that in each of the programs, we're doing more and more work. and so, if we use program starts as kind of a measure of both capacity and value that is being generated, we're doing more and more work in each of them. so, it does -- the fewer programs start shouldn't be an indication of less capacity within the company, nor should it be an indication of less value that is being created because we are adding more and more to each of the programs. and as you can see, even in the increase in expenditure for our r&d, that is growing significantly.
and still a similar percentage of it is being spent on the efforts in partnership and program discovery compared to this time last year. so, i think a way to think about the program starts going forward is that the roughly what we've seen in the past year or so will probably be a good indication of what's going to be in the future. we still have a full book of work from the large number of 164 programs under contract, which our partners will continue to call with whatever frequency that they determine is correct. and that's how we'll continue moving going forward.
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
and, perhaps, i'll pick up from there and respond to your question about abcellera's strategy of engaging with high-profile and top vcs to assist in the early stages of company creation and product development. i would agree with you that we see that as an opportunity that has a lot of headroom and also one that really exemplifies our business model and what we think we can do for the industry. so, it's not just about having great scientific insight. that insight needs to be connected with strong technical teams, which we can provide; with the facilities and technology, which we have built in our engine; and also with the management teams and the capital to move those forward to the clinic and then through the clinic to build new companies.
we have, you know, over the last couple years, spent a big effort or put a big effort into completing our process so that we can fully integrate from an email and a specification of a drug target, right through to a value inflection point. and by connecting with the right partners, we believe that allows for company creation with much better economics and much better timelines. we have previously announced a couple other deals. we have also been continuing those conversations with various groups.
and i'm hopeful and i'm confident that you'll see more of that in the future.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. and if i could squeeze in one other follow-up, just on the molecule that's advancing into the clinic for alzheimer's. that sounds pretty exciting.
and you mentioned there's good downstream economics. but anything you can tell us just about that program, maybe at a high level, your discovery efforts with it, if there's something unique about it in terms of the antibody that was discovered, and that's being moved forward? i know it's with an undisclosed partner, but i don't know, just -- it sounds like a nice important program. so, anything more you could say about it. thanks.
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
thanks, gary. we think that it's a very significant announcement, mostly because it adds further weight to validation of the platform that our work is now moving forward. molecules are getting to the clinic for important unmet medical need with a top partner. i don't think that i can go into the details of the program, given that we still haven't identified who the partner is.
and we'd want to wait until that is fully in the open before we say any more about it.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. fair enough. thanks.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from antonia borovina of bloom burton. please proceed.
antonia borovina -- bloom burton -- analyst
hi there. thank you for taking my questions. my first one is just related to your commentary on the program starts and how you're adding more value per program. so, i'm just wondering, can we expect your average royalty rate, which i think average is around 5% now, can we expect that to tick up as you are doing more work per program?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
hey, antonia. it's andrew here. yeah, great question. if you'll remember, we disclosed kind of aggregate royalty rates and how they've moved over time in the 10-k.
from -- in the earlier years up to 2018, they averaged about 2.5%. and in the 2020-2021 timeframe, they went up to 4.2%, i think, was the median royalty. we do see -- you know, as we are doing more work, we do see the value of each of these programs to abcellera increasing. i think, most notably and probably in the extreme, in the co-ownership case where -- that carl mentioned, where we have actually a 50% ownership stake as we start those programs, and then an option to invest in order to maintain that 50% ownership stake going forward, those are, of course, extremely valuable programs and will be accretive to the average royalty rate overall as they're in the portfolio.
so, in those sorts of cases, you know, absolutely, we would expect the overall value and especially in the royalty or equivalent in the program will increase. importantly as well, though it's not included in the program starts number, there's the pre-partner program that carl alluded, where those are wholly owned. but it is still our intention to be partnering those out at the right point in time. and those, once we've -- because we've done more work on them and because we've retired more risk and put in more development on our own steam, we would expect the economics to those to be considerably accretive to the overall portfolio in that 4.2%.
again, in the extreme case, the first pre-partnered program, of course, was the covid molecule. and while the situation was exceptional there, it resulted in a very high royalty, sort of proving out the business model that we've chosen, overall, how to capture value in the success of the molecules that we work on.
antonia borovina -- bloom burton -- analyst
ok. and then, just moving to the regeneron deal, so i believe the deal was focused on four different targets, and one is advancing to preclinical development. so, just wondering if there's still a possibility to advance the other three targets? or was it just this one target that was selected to go forward?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
yes. so the original deal was with four targets, this is just the first one that has moved forward, and the other programs are still live. so, we're hopeful that those will also move forward.
antonia borovina -- bloom burton -- analyst
ok. and then, related to that, we've seen some other big pharmas acquiring technologies to move gpcr drug discovery in-house. so, maybe you could just speak to what was the key selling point for executing this deal with regeneron. was it primarily focused on the speed of the platform? or was it -- were you able to demonstrate that you could identify drug candidates that they couldn't have?
carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
you know, i wouldn't speculate on what was the single, you know, value proposition that resulted in the deal with regeneron. it's a multi-target partnership. and there's a multiplicity of ways in which we see synergy between our capabilities and theirs. and obviously, regeneron is a very well-enabled and sophisticated partner, and one that we're very happy to be working with.
more generally, in the class of gpcrs, and i would put ion channels another difficult targets in there, that tends to be one of the places where we have had the most engagement with the large and well-enabled firms. and typically, it is because these groups have tried or they have experienced with similar target classes and have realized that the existing conventional technologies are not up to the task. and so, the value proposition there is to take a target or a program that is completely stuck, get it unstuck, and help move it toward clinical development in what are often potentially first-in-class, very high value, unmet medical need indications.
antonia borovina -- bloom burton -- analyst
ok. thanks for the color.

carl hansen -- chief executive officer and president
thanks, tryn. and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. it's my pleasure to provide an update on our business for the third quarter of 2022. today, november 8th, marks the 10th anniversary abcellera's incorporation.
we founded abcellera on a bold idea: to deliberately rethink and rebuild the critical product creation step in bringing new antibody therapies to the world. after a decade of company building, we believe we now have the industry's most powerful engine for antibody discovery. along the way, we've grown from six founders in a lab, to a business of nearly 500 people spread across four countries and three continents. we've earned a reputation as a leader in the industry, and i've worked on over 90 different programs and have succeeded where others have failed.
we've also validated our platform, not just once, but twice, in bringing therapies to patients, delivering authorized antibodies, bamlanivimab and bebtelovimab for the covid-19 pandemic in what was arguably the most competitive and time-sensitive drug development effort in history. for a young company, our competitive position is exceptional. we've assembled an outstanding team. we have put in place the core proprietary technologies that we need to execute our strategy.
and we have nearly 600,000 square feet of state-of-the-art facilities that are either operational or under construction. over this 10 year period, we have achieved all of this while building the balance of over $450 million in accumulated earnings and nearly $900 million in total cash equivalents and marketable securities. it is on this solid foundation that we embark on the next decade of accelerating innovation and taking our business to the next level. our business strategy is simple.
first, it is to be the best in the world in bringing antibody therapies from target to the clinic. and second, it is to use this capability with partners to build a large and diversified portfolio of stakes in future antibody drugs. this is fundamentally a win-win strategy. we provide partners with a full solution and a competitive technology advantage in taking their programs to the clinic.
in exchange, we share in the future success of therapies that are ultimately delivered to patients in need. in addition, for our shareholders, this model smooths out the binary risk of biotech investing by providing access to a curated slice of the market that is enriched for its best parts. we assemble our portfolio using deal structures that are tailored to each opportunity and each partner. our programs fall into three categories: first, partner-initiated discovery programs; second, partner-initiated co-development programs; and third, pre-partner programs that arise from our ongoing technology development efforts.
in our most typical discovery partnerships, deals are structured around partner-initiated work and include upfront research fees, clinical milestones, and single-digit royalties on net sales. through these deals, we generate antibody candidates to deliver back to partners for further preclinical development and ind-enabling studies. we know that we are succeeding when molecules we've helped to discover progress through to the clinic. this quarter, we can update you on two partners, bringing abcellera-discovered antibodies closer to patients.
first, an antibody discovered by abcellera for an unnamed partner entered clinical development at the start of the quarter. this phase 1 molecule is indicated for the treatment of alzheimer's disease, which is a huge area of unmet need. second, this quarter, regeneron elected to advance an antibody forward in preclinical development that was discovered as part of our 2020 partnership. this molecule targets an undisclosed g-protein-coupled receptor, or gpcr.
gpcrs are large and valuable class that is widely regarded as one of the most challenging for antibody discovery. success in this program highlights the ability of our discovery technology to address difficult targets and also to move the needle for highly enabled partners like regeneron. last year, we announced a co-development partnership structure that represents a further amplification of our business model, enhancing the potential economics in our portfolio by giving us the option, but not the obligation, to invest in the co-development of molecules in order to retain an up to 50% stake. to date, we have initiated a total of seven programs under the structure with four different partners.
for the most advanced co-development programs, we have discovered high-quality lead candidates that meet program requirements and are undergoing optimization. in 2023, we expect to select final lead candidates for one or more of these programs, positioning them for ind-enabling studies. finally, in the last quarter, we introduced to you our pre-partner programs, which is the third way which we create value. as a reminder, these are wholly owned assets discovered in connection with our high-value technology development work to unlock new areas in drug development.
the two main areas for our pre-partner programs are currently t cell engagers and difficult memory protein targets, specifically gpcrs and ion channels. last quarter, we shared with you the progress we've made over the past year in developing our cd3 t cell engager platform, which offers access to what we believe is now the deepest and most diverse cd3 panel in the industry. in combination with the orthomab platform, this panel offers unprecedented opportunities for t cell engager optimization and continues to attract a high level of interest. we will present new data on the characteristics of this panel at the 2022 annual meeting of the society for immunotherapy of cancer, or sitc, which will be held later this week in boston.
now, moving on to our efforts to unlock gpcrs and ion channels. we believe that continued progress in this area across all partnership models will drive substantial value for our business. to date, our technology development efforts have been applied to roughly a dozen gpcr and ion channel pre-partner program targets. in some cases, this work is still at an early stage.
for other targets, we have made exciting progress. and while technical risk remains, we anticipate sharing data on one or more of these clinical candidates from these programs in 2023. in summary, abcellera is ideally positioned for another decade of success. we will continue on our strategy, investing to become the global leader in antibody product creation.
before i hand over to andrew, i would like to provide an update on bebtelovimab and our covid-19 program. through much of q3, bebtelovimab continues to be the only authorized monoclonal antibody that remained effective against all variants of concern. more recently, two new variants, bq.1 and bq.1.1, have emerged. and our experiments suggest that these variants are likely to be resistant to bebtelovimab.
in response to this, and as part of our continuing collaboration with eli lilly, we have identified a new lead antibody candidate that is highly potent and that we expect will be effective against bq.1, bq.1.1, and all other known variants of concern. we believe this candidate has high potential to address an ongoing medical need both for therapy and prophylaxis in covid 19. if a clear path for clinical development and patient access can be established, together with eli lilly, we stand ready to move these molecules forward quickly as we have done in the past. and with that, i'll now hand it over to andrew booth, our cfo, to provide an overview of our third quarter 2022 financials.
andrew?
andrew booth -- chief financial officer
thanks, carl. i'll start by highlighting our progress made on our key business metrics in the third quarter of 2022 as we continue to see strong momentum in the business. this quarter, we started work on four new discovery programs, taking us to a cumulative total of 92 program starts. overall, we have started work on 23 programs over the trailing 12 months, which represents a quarter of all the programs that we have ever started with partners.
this demonstrates the continued strong growth of our portfolio. all four starts in the quarter include downstream participation. we signed no new programs under contract in the quarter, and we ended the third quarter of 2022 with 164 programs under contract, with 38 unique partners. while the number of starts in any given quarter will be irregular, we expect the trajectory of starts to continue to be strong.
importantly, the numbers included in our key business metrics do not include the pre-partner technology development efforts initiated by abcellera that carl referenced earlier in the call. for our molecules at a clinical stage, we are excited to see another molecule from a discovery partnership reach the clinic, bringing our total number of molecules in the clinic to seven. as carl mentioned earlier, this new molecule was discovered by us in partnership with an undisclosed partner and has entered clinical trials with an indication in alzheimer's disease. we continue to view our growing list of molecules in the clinic as specific examples of our near and midterm potential revenue from downstream milestone fees and long-term royalty payments.
with respect to marketed molecules, lilly announced in q2 that they had begun commercial sales of bebtelovimab to states hospitals and healthcare providers, which subsequently materialized in q3. turning to revenue, revenue in the quarter was approximately $101 million. this was driven in large part by the roughly $93 million of royalties we earned from shipments of bebtelovimab in the quarter from both the 139,000 doses to the u.s. government and from the first commercial sales of approximately 60,000 doses.
while we expect some bebtelovimab sales to continue in q4, future sales are uncertain, given the impact of potentially resistant variants, case counts, and the availability of other treatments. as carl mentioned, the situation with covid remains fluid. we have always viewed these royalties earned from sales of our covid-19 antibodies as a source of nondiluted funding. with or without future royalties from covid antibodies, our strategy is to invest in forward integration and scale our business with world-leading capabilities and antibody discovery and development from target to the clinic.
looking at other revenues, this quarter, we earned $7 million in research fees relating to work on discovering programs, compared to approximately $5 million in q3 of 2021. this increase reflects the growing scale and capabilities of our discovery engine and the underlying robustness of our business. this quarter's revenues also included some small amounts related to milestone payments and licensing fees. turning to operating expenses, our research and development expenses for the third quarter were nearly $27 million, representing a roughly $9 million increase over the same period of the previous year.
