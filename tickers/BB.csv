john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, tim. good afternoon, everybody. today, i'd like to keep the financial and business updates relatively brief because i'd like to spend a little bit more time discussing our recent blackberry ivy announcement. this third fiscal quarter, we continued to build on the momentum from our second quarter, delivering results in line with our outlook we provided. we delivered sequential revenue growth, both in the total software and services sections and as well as bts. we continue to deliver positive eps and positive free cash flow this quarter.
blackberry reported total revenue -- company revenue of $224 million. software and services revenue came in at $168 million, 1-6-8. license was $56 million. gross margin was 70%. earnings per share was positive $0.02. cash generated from operations was $29 million. total ending cash and investments at november 30 was $757 million.
i'll start by -- my business commentary with the software and services group. arr was approximately $475 million. dollar-based net retention rate was 90%. net customer churn reduced to around 1%.
spark is the combination of -- as a reminder, is the combination of our uem and ues, the unified endpoint security offerings. this quarter, we made good progress in both the government and financial services verticals, with customer wins, including u.s. army, u.s. postal service, the irs, the department of energy and department of justice, as well as raymond james financials -- raymond james financial, sorry, citibank, the german bundesbank, the bank of india and the government of rwanda. in addition, we have customer wins in other verticals, including healthcare and manufacturing system.
we continue to see progress in upgrading blackberry uem customer to the full spark suite, i.e., adding our ues suite. example, in the quarter, including deutsche bank, deutsche boerse, convergeone and multiple ministry of the dutch government. significantly during the quarter, we released blackberry cyber suite, our ai-powered cyber suite, which combines our industry-leading epp, edr and mdr product, is further strengthened by the continuous authentication and the mobile threat defense capabilities. this cyber suite is highly competitive against both traditional and the next-gen player in the cybersecurity market. this has been validated by 451 research and other industry experts. cyber suite brings together the best of blackberry and cylance technology.
further, cyber suite will be available in version that integrate with all the major uem offerings, including microsoft intune, vmware's workspace one, mobileiron, as well as ibm maas360. these integrations will allow blackberry to provide additional security to users of our rival uems.
cyber suite has only been in the market for a month, but early interest is strong, both in the new logo and existing customer base, with significant pipeline growth this past quarter. cyber suite, obviously, allows us to give our prospect and customer greater options for increasing their cybersecurity, while protecting their uem investment. as a result of these technology enhancements and positive customer receptivity, we will in turn step up our investment in sales and marketing to compete more aggressively.
before i move to bts, i'd like to highlight the security certifications we have achieved. this quarter, blackberry uem achieved the national security agency, nsa, commercial solutions for classified program approval. this adds to the portfolio of us government certifications we have received for blackberry uem, including the niap certification, the department of defense information network approval product list, which i think we talked about last quarter call, in-apl, or dash inapl. fedramp fips 140-2. no other software vendor in the cybersecurity space has been awarded most security certification by the us government than blackberry. blackberry achieving nsa certification come to the time when most of our major competitors have been identify having vulnerabilities that are being exploited by nation-state hackers. this should give our customer and prospect a higher degree of comfort about the cybersecurity protection they receive from blackberry.
now, moving on to bts. qnx, the largest component of bts, reported sequential revenue growth. qnx remain on track to be back to its normal run rate by early next fiscal year. in the quarter, we have 17 new designs, 1-7 design wins, sorry, six in auto and 11 in generally embedded market. our expansion in the gem continues, which -- with diverse wins, including a controller system for power turbines, a next-generation satellite receiver system, and a rail traffic management system from the seoul to sunan [phonetic] subway.
in auto, we have design wins in full connected cars and electric vehicles. the wins included instrument clusters, a couple of them in domain controller, a handful of them in adas designs, the advanced driver-assist, sorry, the advanced driver-assist. speaking of electric vehicles, we are very pleased to share with you our strong position in the ev market. qnx now has design wins with 19 of the top 25 electric vehicle oems, which together had 61% of the ev market in the first half of this calendar year. we are working hard to recruit the remaining six.
moving on to secure communication, which includes athoc and secusmart. secure communication had a strong quarter. this strength was primarily due to ongoing transition to remote working, we have -- which has been obviously greatly accelerated by the pandemic. athoc has some strategic win this quarter, including the california department of corrections and rehabilitation, or rehab, department of corrections and rehab, as well as the california department of justice. i believe that no one now can claim to power the entire state of california.
other notable renewals and upsell from athoc in the quarter, including the united states army, navy, as well as the air force, as well as the federal aviation administration, faa. we also renewals in the u.s. defense intelligence agency, u.s. department of energy, treasury and agricultural, as well as the fema, federal emergency management agency.
finally, i want to touch on licensing. revenue for the quarter came in at $56 million. as before, the majority of the licensing revenue comes from our ip licensing business.
as i mentioned at the beginning of the call, i'd like to spend some time discussing blackberry ivy, which we are very excited about. modern cars continue to generate huge amount of data. i think you all agree and know. the auto industry is not prepared to capture and create value from the analytics because these data is difficult to collect and interact with, with our very costly integrations. blackberry ivy's mission is to make it easy to gather, securely transport, and analyze these data in a standard and a cost-efficient way across multiple brands and models on a common platform. this will allow the developers' ecosystem to use the data to provide intelligent insights and application on a global scale.
we have entered a -- entered into a multi-year exclusive co-development and co-marketing agreement with aws. this type of agreement is rare. blackberry and aws engineers has been working very closely to jointly build the platform. under the terms of our agreement, blackberry will own all the commercial relationship with customers and will share revenues with aws.
each side contributes the key capabilities required. on the blackberry side, blackberry qnx brings over 20 years of auto industry experience, as well as relationship, as well as a huge footprint of over 175 million cars. we are a trusted leader with a deep knowledge of automotive safety and security software system. aws is the world's largest cloud provider with advanced developer community and outstanding expertise in consumer experience, interfaces, as well as iot. combined, we're able to provide a full end-to-end platform. we expect an ecosystem of apps and services developed on the blackberry ivy platform over time. we will work with aws a proven builder of successful developer communities to help drive the process.
with blackberry ivy, we are creating a recurring revenue data business, recurring revenue model, that is, targeting revenue on a usage, as well as a subscription base. an important difference between blackberry ivy and competitors in this space is that, we allow the oems to own the data and with that, the relationship with their customers. we are already in discussion with some automakers who were granted early access and we have received positive initial feedback. the target is to be in the 2023 auto models -- 2023 year's model, with possibly potentially some professional services prior to it. while it is too early for us to provide a revenue outlook, we are confident that blackberry ivy addresses a very large market opportunity that will greatly increase our asp.
with that, let me turn the call over to steve to provide more details about our financial performance.
steve rai -- chief financial officer
thank you, john. my comments on our financial performance for the first -- sorry, for the fiscal quarter will be in non-gaap terms, unless otherwise noted. please refer to the supplemental table in the press release for the gaap and non-gaap details.
we delivered third quarter non-gaap total company revenue of $224 million and gaap total company revenue of $218 million. third quarter total company gross margin was 70%. our non-gaap gross margin includes software differed revenue acquired but not recognized of $6 million and excludes stock compensation expense of $1 million.
third quarter operating expenses were $142 million. our non-gaap operating expenses exclude $32 million and amortization of acquired intangibles, $11 million in stock compensation expense, $4 million for software deferred commissions expense acquired and $95 million fair value adjustment on the convertible debentures, which is a non-cash accounting adjustment driven by market conditions.
third quarter non-gaap operating income was $14 million and third quarter non-gaap net income was $11 million.
non-gaap earnings per share was $0.02 in the quarter.
our adjusted ebitda was $31 million this quarter, excluding the non-gaap adjustments previously mentioned.
and i will now provide a breakdown of our revenue in the quarter. software and services revenue was $168 million. software product revenue remained in the range of 80% to 85% of the total, with professional services comprising the balance. the proportion of software product revenue that is recurring was approximately 83% due to product mix.
the decrease in arr this quarter similar to the prior quarter is primarily due to bts. we include qnx royalties in our arr metric to give a total company view. we expect to see the impact of covid on arr normalize early next fiscal year as we return to our normal revenue run rate there.
licensing and other revenue was $56 million.
now, moving to our balance sheet and cash flow performance. total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $757 million at november 30, 2020, a decrease of $220 million during the quarter. this is mainly due to the early redemption of the $605 million of convertible debentures and issuance of $365 million of new convertible debentures on september 1. this represented a $240 million reduction in debt financing, partially offset by cash generated in the period. our net cash position increased to $392 million at the end of the quarter. third quarter free cash flow was $27 million and cash generated from operations was $29 million with capital expenditures of $2 million.
that concludes my comments, and i'll now turn the call back to john.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, steve. before i provide our outlook for the remaining of the current fiscal year, i'd like to highlight some noteworthy partnership in addition to the blackberry ivy that we're very excited about. this quarter, we partnered with zoom to provide a blackberry secure version of zoom, which is highly secure way to hold virtual meetings in this new work from anywhere environment. it provides increased protection from corporate data leakage, as well as cyber threats.
in the quarter, verizon launched their business internet secure offering, which includes our blackberry smart av, anti-virus product and cisco umbrella security service. this new product is aimed at verizon large number of small- and medium-size business customers.
during the quarter, we announced the integration of athoc with both microsoft teams and servicenow now platform. teams, as most of you know, is the market leader in collaboration software with over 115, 1-1-5, 115 million daily active user. and the now platform adds 51% of the it service management market. these integrations will further athoc's reach and the ability of enterprise to protect their assets.
i'll now move on to our outlook. we continue to expect total company revenue for the year to be around $950 million, as we indicated last quarter. we expect licensing revenue will finish the fiscal year a little stronger than previously indicated. we expect revenue for bts to continue to grow sequentially in the fourth quarter. and as we talk about, as to return to its normal run rate early next fiscal year. this quarter, we continue to make good progress. we delivered solid financial as per our outlook. we have developed exciting new business model, the recurring revenue model for qnx, as well as partnership, which i outlined, and we delivered industry-leading products as per our road map.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our operator to conduct the q&a session, please. david?

yes. [operator instructions] our first question today will be from daniel chan with td securities. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, dan.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. the -- i don't know if you guys mentioned it or if i missed it, did you provide a metric on the billings growth?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
no. we did not. you didn't missed it. we haven't provided that.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
okay. and then on the arr declining, steve, you talked about how it's declining because of bts. can you just remind us what you're including there from bts and why that's causing it to drop?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
the numbers -- go ahead, steve.
steve rai -- chief financial officer
sure. so, the -- we -- our arr is the total company metric, well, for software and services. the qnx part of it, we include -- it's basically a trailing four quarters that feeds into that metric. so there is a lag affecting it. so it's got that -- with the covid impact that we've been discussing consistently, that's kind of lagged effect, making it back into the metric as we move forward and recover.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
dan?

your next question comes from the line of mike walkley with canaccord genuity. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi. hi, mike.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. thanks. hi, john. thanks for taking my questions and best wishes to everybody on the call for the holiday season and to stay healthy.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. you too.
steve rai -- chief financial officer
you too.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. thank you. just a question for me. just building on ivy, lots of interest and excitement around it. i know you're not sizing it yet because it's early days, john. but as you've shared longer-term about getting to kind of asps into the high-teens to $20 per car. how does this help close the gap if things go really well, how do you see asp per car developing over time?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
as i said, we don't really have all our kind of the revenue laid out yet, because the earliest we will get the revenue, i believe, is the model year 2023. so, we do expect this to help close the gap in a very -- or increase asp in a very big way. it has to do -- a lot to do with, not only to base platform to collect sensor datas and analyze it over the edge and the cloud and oem could then take advantage of all these sensor datas and the combination of those sensor datas to make certain decisions, either real-time or in the long-term, but we're also depending a lot on how many applications could we spin up. so -- and the oem is going to build their application, the tier 1 will build their application using our platform, and so will other third-party. so, if there are more applications, then, obviously, there are more instances that could increase our asp per vehicle. so, we are very hopeful that this, not only have a recurring part of it, but it's also bring us a good chunk of revenue going forward.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. thanks, john. and then just my follow-up question kind of longer term also with blackberry, you guys have launched several new different software security modules. as you look at your sales force, what are they feeding back to you in terms of their ability to land and expand customers? what are they leading with and what are some of the upsell opportunities that they're excited about with these new modules that you've launched over the last several quarters?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, first off on the product side, our cybersecurity suite is a very timely offering to the market because of all the hacks and the vulnerabilities going on right now. we have been invited to more cases nowadays because of the environment and the attention switched to cyber protection and other hacking that's going on out there. so, for example, knock on wood, we haven't been successfully, i guess, intruded yet. that's not to say, this is not a challenge. this is just to say, the state of the affair at this point.
so, on a medium-term, when we -- our sales force are very focused on upgrading all our uem base, which accounts for -- depending on who you listen to, of -- in terms of analysts, industry analysts, it's somewhere between 9% to 12% of the market shares of uem space. so, we are very busy upgrading that. so to sell them the ues on top of the uem. and then very soon and literally we're talking in months, we will release our ues platform on to the competitors' uem, which are intune, mobileiron, airwatch, and ibm maas360. not all at the same time, by the way, sequentially. but we're probably going to start with microsoft first. so, that's another aspect of it.
and the fact that we are -- so that's the -- that part is the cybersecurity play. so that should keep us busy for the next couple of years and give us a lot of opportunities going after the market.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
okay. thanks. and just one last question, i'll pass the line. just on the ues going to other uem platforms, what is the feedback or interest level for that? and is cdc [phonetic] even able to offer those similar capabilities for the mobile market.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
the interest levels are reasonably high. i mean, i don't have a specific quantitative answer to your question. but when i speak to customers and make -- or groups of customers at the same time, they all think that makes sense. it give them an ability to protect their current investment, whoever -- whatever uem that they already invested in. if you are happy and comfortable with, the pros and cons on each of the vendors but they could then use this blackberry security, which we believe is the best of the bunch in terms of technology. and i laid out all the certifications we got from governments. and so, obviously, we have the best technology in protection -- in cyber protection. so that give them the best of both world without having to rip out their investment, which, of course, there is no big hurry to do that, even if they wanted to do it in a long-term. so, this help to add value to what they have and keep the investment, so everybody is happy about, at least at that choice to look at.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. well, best wishes for the year and thanks for taking my questions.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
sure. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of trip chowdhry with global equities research. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, trip. hi, trip.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
hello, john. this is -- this quarter was phenomenal, both from execution point of view and from partnership point of view, two strongest companies, amazon aws and zoom. my question is more on the ivy platform. when do you think the developers can get a hand of three [phonetic] alpha version? so that the excitement in the developers community is very strong and i was hoping that they could start capitalizing the imagination on your platform sometime in 2021. do you think that's reasonable to expect?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
i -- good question. thank you, trip. i know that we will have a beta version be ready in the third quarter next year, third quarter, our quarter, sorry, our quarter, third quarter is a september day. we will have a developer version -- we're hoping to have a developer version before that. so, i would say, be safe to say that about mid-year next year the application provider will be able to lay their hands on that.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
beautiful. and also in terms of some oems -- ev oems, you did not name them. if possible, can you name a few that you think we can keep an eye on as we move forward and see what kind of applications and how they're embracing your platform?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
well, i don't think they will appreciate me naming them. and my -- and so -- but i would say this, the initial groups of company that we have been in contact with and have gotten positive feedback is in a group of about 20 people, 20 different oems. so, obviously, that -- not all 20 will sign up, but i will commit to the following thing. as we are getting customers sign up, we will try to make a public announcement when, obviously, the customer has to agree to it. both amazon and us are very excited and have -- i was very busy in making presentation and getting strong feedback today.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
beautiful. congratulations and all the best.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of paul treiber with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, paul.
steve rai -- chief financial officer
hi, paul.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, john. good evening.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
good evening.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
a couple of follow-up questions. on the amazon relationship, i know you're not giving details on revenue. but could you speak to the details of the partnership itself in terms of the duration of the exclusivity period and then maybe the magnitude of amazon's commitment for co-development and co-marketing? and then also related to that, the agreement allow you to open it up from amazon to other cloud providers at some point in the future?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so, we agreed on multiple number of years that we will be exclusive with using the amazon cloud and developing that product. they will be exclusive with us. they will not market or develop with any other party with the same in the auto sector and in the same area of data platform, analytical platform. so, it's a very broad agreement. it does allow us to open it up for other cloud. but we probably won't do that until this particular one is done. not meaning the exclusive period is done is at least that the product out and presenting to the customer.
it's a co-development and co-marketing agreement, exclusively in both dimension. and as i pointed out, blackberry will hold the commercial relationship, meaning that we will transact the deal with the oem or the tier 1 or the application provider, we'll lean on the help of aws to get the ecosystem up and going with us. they have a lot of engineers assigned to this. if you will, i will refer you to a number of keynote speaker at the aws reinvent conference. it's public information. starting with andy jassy, the ceo and how he describes our relationship with aws, as well as the head of the iot, where he made his keynote. he specifically expands quite a bit of time on how this particular -- this relationship. so you can see that they are very serious. the seriousness, not only come from the cloud side, but it comes from the iot side also at amazon.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
all right. thank you for those details. very interesting. secondly, i'm just -- looking at the transition to work-from-home globally and all the uptake of various cybersecurity and other applications. how do you see blackberry benefiting from that? and then also -- or how high blackberry benefited from that trend? and then could you dovetail that against the net revenue retention in the quarter? what's been driving the net revenue retention? it fell, i think a little bit in the quarter versus it's transitioned to work-from-home?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, i could only tell you that the uem license, we're doing well, in initially of the -- in a covid-19 shutdown, because a lot of our customers wanted to expand their number of licenses to cover everybody to work-from-home and work remotely. as you know, most of our customers are large institutional, in the banking industry, as well as in the government. so the volumes are quite high at that time. now, gradually, it shifted to two other areas. one in the secure voice technology area, i'd say, we work remote from home, both government and all the regulated industry sectors are seriously looking at the secure voice and then the emergency alert systems. now i think it's used to be that are reasonably focused by user -- have recently focused in the government space, but now the -- it's now expanded to a medium to larger enterprise, where they want to be able to reach their employees and other constituents. so, we see very good pick up in those areas that clearly is benefited from the -- unfortunately the pandemic situation, but the pandemic situation drove the realization of secure communications is very important. so there we see a lot.
and then, of course, there is the indirect effect on cyber suite. although, we just released the cyber suite. and as you know, we've been behind an edr, but we believe we all caught up and we ran enough tests to show that. so, you should see some revenue start coming from those areas. so, those are kind of the areas related to the work from remote.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and just reading between the lines, the one you didn't mention was the legacy cylance business. the -- so is that -- should we take...
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
oh, that's part of the cyber suite, sorry. sorry, sorry. sorry, that was a...
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
the net revenue retention, the slight drop there, is that driven from just the older cyber -- the older cylance products made some churn there?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
that number is the total company number. so, it's not just the so-called the older cylance product. it is a combination of all our enterprise products.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. thanks for taking my question.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
your next question comes from the line of todd coupland with cibc. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, todd.
todd coupland -- cibc capital markets -- analyst
hey, there. john, good evening.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
good evening.
todd coupland -- cibc capital markets -- analyst
i just wanted to ask you about the q4 outlook. $950-so million for the year. so, it's a -- i don't know, $20 million or so higher than where street is for the year, according to factset and then you called out ip being higher. so, i'm wondering within that mix, will software and services be up sequentially.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes.
todd coupland -- cibc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and can you sort of characterize...
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
wait, wait. let me -- i always get a trouble with lawyers, when i answer that, it is my expectation and the current model that it is up sequentially.
todd coupland -- cibc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and can you characterize sort of the puts and takes within that? i know there's a few pieces in the bucket there, just expose that little for us on that?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. we believe secure communication will continue to do well. it's a combination of athoc and secusmart. and we believe that uem will be relatively flat. bts will have a sequential up quarter. and those are kind of the major pieces.
todd coupland -- cibc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. okay. and you've talked in the past about sort of covid slowing new customers deciding, and as you are -- for -- i guess, enterprise decisions, just broadly, i know there were some other questions about this earlier. but as you are thinking about the next fiscal year, is there a enough loosening now sort of post the vaccine, etc., where you can start to see some of those enterprise decisions loosen up? can you just talk about your thinking on that for the next year or so?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. our assumption is they will loosen up and we are in the process of building out a new operating plan, or aop, for next year. so, our assumption that it will loosen up and get back to normal.
from the auto sector point of view, we already started seeing that. so, we will start seeing it also on the commercial side. i'm reasonably sure, cybersecurity is, like i said earlier, it's a topic that everybody wants to talk about. and so, we have to kind of double down on that ourselves in terms of reaching the marketplace and we have, along a number of products and channel programs and -- which i didn't put -- but in the interest of time, i didn't put it in my script, but we have a very robust channel program that combined the cylance and blackberry channel program together. so, there are a few things that we're doing we believe will both see the growth and be able to execute for the growth next year.
todd coupland -- cibc capital markets -- analyst
okay. last question, it's -- i guess, it's not really stock specific to certainly my thesis, but just curious, you've seen a few major tech companies come out, and say, back to the office by september, work three days in the office, you can still work from home. have you decided how you're thinking about blackberry from that perspective once that opportunity is there?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
no. we have not decided. september of next year seems really far away. and although we could say, we would have been -- we will be speaking at least another few times before that. so -- but we're open minded. i'm an applicator. i'm an old fashioned guy. i'm an applicator that we should be together, to build a business together, to build a team. in person, that's just me. but i also recognize the fact that there is some reality and there are people who would like the flexibility. so as long as it doesn't lose productivity, i'm willing to try a couple of things.
todd coupland -- cibc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. okay. appreciate your comments. thanks very much.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
absolutely. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of steven li with raymond james. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, steve.
steven li -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you. hey. hey, john. just a clarification first, the $950 million outlook, that's your non-gaap revenue number. correct?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a non-gaap revenue number? yes, correct.
steven li -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and you expect that bts to grow sequentially and you said enterprise software as well to grow a little bit sequentially in q4?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. that's what i said.
steven li -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. all right. and john on ivy, do you see ivy as a bit higher arpu compared to some of the other modules or would you expect it to be in the same range?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
oh, no. in terms of the asp?
steven li -- raymond james -- analyst
yes.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
oh! i'm hoping that is -- i'm hoping it's higher than -- ok. in order to be fair, let me maybe reset here for the following. so, you know that our current module, whether it's hypervisor, adas, clusters, cockpit, ivi ranges anywhere from the low-single-digit dollars to literally high-single-digit or double -- low-double-digit dollars per module. so that's the range. i would expect this to be more toward the higher end of that spectrum. so when i said, oh, no, earlier, i was thinking about ivi. so, this -- compared to ivi, this will be a lot more.
steven li -- raymond james -- analyst
right. okay. and then -- and -- but you will split that with aws?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i will have revenue split with aws. correct.
steven li -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. got it. okay. thanks a lot.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer

john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. thank you, tim. good afternoon, everybody, and thank you all for joining us today. the main headline for this quarter is that we have organized our software and services business around our two biggest market opportunities, namely iot and cybersecurity. in the past few years, we have done a good job in product development. last year, we launched 50 new products and a year before over 30. later, i'll discuss about more about the xdr product that we have launched this quarter, and i will provide you an update on blackberry ivy.
as you all know, at the same time that we are delivering our products, many of you know that we've been investing in our go-to-market as well. we have been in last number of years, especially the last few quarters turned up the noise with our marketing, expanded our channel and partnerships, and invested in more feet on the street.
now, we are pivoting the organization more heavily toward the market by creating two business units, cybersecurity and iot. by aligning the cybersecurity and iot business unit to the main market opportunities, where we drive more focus and accountability, we will also improve our agility, being able to react to the fast-changing needs of the market and even say both of those be used at their own business dynamics. in order to accomplish this, we have recruited a number of new talents especially with deep iot experience. this includes mattias eriksson who joined us from here technologies as the president of the iot business unit. mattias brings over two decades of relevant industry experience and we focused on strategy, operations, and driving growth in the iot business. blackberry president and chief operating officer, tom eacobacci who focused on leading the cybersecurity business unit. tom has deep enterprise software experience and is a perfect person to engineer the growth of this new business.
from a financial reporting perspective, beginning this quarter, we will provide revenue and gross margin by business unit as well as other selected metrics. we believe that this additional color will help investor gain better understanding of the underlying performance of the business units, ultimately driving shareholder value.
so, let me start by reviewing with you, the iot business unit. this business, which is primarily qnx, but also includes ivy, certicom, jarvis, radar had a good strong quarter. revenue came in at $43 million with increasing 48% year-over-year. of course, a year ago, there was the pandemic, a hard hit quarter, gross margin was 84%, iot arr was $86 million. this growth in both revenue and arr was achieved despite the fact that we have global chip shortage. the shortage continues to be a significant factor in the auto market in the near term, and it's no doubt currently impacting the production-driven revenue of qnx. the scale of the impact varies by region and by oem. the impact looks to be greatest in north america and less so in europe and asia. one of our largest customer in north americas has indicated that production in q2 will be impacted, or may be impacted by up to 50% but others are less severe.
generally speaking, q2 appears to be a low point with q3 improving and q4 further slow. the impact also looks to be smaller than that of the pandemic last year. so currently, we don't see a need to change our revenue outlook for the year, but we will continue to assess the impact with our customer, and we'll update you again next quarter. just as a reminder, our iot revenue outlook remains at $180 million to $200 million for the fiscal year.
in contrast to the production-based royalties, however, revenue from design activities, i.e., the developer seats [phonetic] and professional services is strong. unlike q1 of last fiscal year when covid was becoming a major issue, confidence from our oem appears high and we've seen a lot of design activities in progress. we are particularly pleased with two design wins this quarter. first one was with volvo group, who selected qnx autos and hybrid devices that stand for real-time operating system -- sorry, guys, and hypervisor on a whole truck basis, meaning that our technology will power multiple easy use throughout the truck. second, we further strengthen our position in the ev market with a design win with the shanghai-based wm motor. the qnx os, the autos, the qnx os, and hypervisor will power their all-electric w6 suv vehicle.
in total, this quarter we had 28 new design wins with 17 in auto and 11 in the gem, the general embedded market. in auto along those we just mentioned notable design wins also includes bosch and visteon. these design wins [indecipherable] hypervisor, digital cockpits, multiple socket adas platform and high definition maps.
on the gem front, the wide range of application won in the quarter with surgical robotic arm, industrial 3d printers as well as nuclear power station. so design wins such as the volvo demonstrate two key secular trends that qnx business benefits from. the first one is the consolidation of lower compute power easy use toward a fewer number higher power chipset such as the arm version v8 and the x86 64-bit chipsets. it is on these higher power chips that the qnx operates and as this consolidation continues, it gives qnx ever more opportunity in the car.
secondarily, there is a -- the second point, second trend that is. there is a trend of increasing software content per vehicle, particularly in safety-critical system such as adas, gateway and digital cockpits. this is of course where qnx shine with the highest level of safety certification and has a strongest competitive advantage.
our strategy to focus on safety-critical system which we put in place a number of years ago has allowed the business to benefit from these trends, ultimately leading to a higher average revenue per car. this strategy is delivering higher value design wins and [indecipherable] royalty revenue backlog. the backlog metrics is calculated using contracted price and future production volume estimates provided by the customer when the design is awarded. it is important to know that this is a customer's estimate. the backlog increased from $450 million last q1 to $490 million this first quarter. this is a 9% increase year-on-year, despite the pressure on new auto designs over the last 12 months. strategy analytics, a leading independent research firm recently published our qnx software is now embedded in over 195 million vehicles, that is up from a 175 million confirmed a year before.
now for a brief update on progress with ivy. driving the ivy opportunity forward remains one of our key priorities and we're working closely with aws to achieve this. product development remains on track and in line with the roadmap. we remain on target for the early access version to be available in october and for the production versions we start shipping next february. customer discussion and workshops are continuing, and we remain positive about how things are progressing. this quarter an additional five automakers engaged to explore ivy. this means that we are now engaged with almost all of our major qnx customers.
we recently announced the launch of the ivy advisory council, industry leaders on a number of key verticals have signed up including telus, telecommunications, one of the big three telephone company in canada, geico insurance, you see a lot on tv with their commercial, here apps and cerence, which is the voice recognition auto business. development of relevant and exciting new used cases for ivy platform remains a key priority and we believe that the council could greatly assist us with this. delivering rather than maps and experience provide a higher engagement model with both the consumer as well as the enterprise.
last quarter we launched the ivy innovation fund established to invest in start-ups adopting the ivy platform [indecipherable] the market and we have reviewed over 200 prospective customers. we recently announced our first investment in an exciting start-up called electra vehicle. unlike most other start-ups in the battery management space, electra aim to not only analyze activity, but to also actively manage the battery operations using artificial intelligence. vehicle sensor data on ivy will feed their ai-driven platform, dynamically determining factors such as driving behavior and environmental condition to optimize battery performance. in summary, ivy is progressing well and we remain very focused on the various elements to need to make this a strong growth business and success.
now, let me move to our cybersecurity business units. these business units include our spark endpoint security and endpoint management products, uem as well as athoc, the critical event management software and secusmart, secured voice and text product. gaap revenue for the quarter was $107 million. as mentioned during the last earnings call, we now switch to gaap-based revenue only. gross margin was 57%. arr was $364 million, and dollar-based net retention was 94%.
over the last couple of years, the prevailing narrative has been that detection and remediation are the most important part of cybersecurity. however, the founding principle of [indecipherable] and one of our main reasons that we acquired is that prevention is far better than cure and that's why we are market leader in epp. stopping threats before they execute and start doing harm is clearly a better strategy than trying to shut them down afterwards. this quarter we demonstrated strategy clearly with our next generation av product named protect, blocking the darkside ransomware, the lead to actually the cause [phonetic] of the colonial pipeline cyber incidents. in fact, the 2015 version of protect also block most of the variants of the same ransomware, obviously six years ahead of its time.
we do have the most matured ai engine in this space and the ability to block ransomware years ahead of time without the need to update [technical issues]. this show the power of our prevention-first strategy. protect has also shown to prevent other high-profile threats, such as conti ransomware, nobelium, revil and others. in addition to large enterprise customers, this ai-driven automated protection also resonate with small and medium-sized customer that don't have the resources to establish the socs meaning the security operation centers. we see strong sequential growth in smb new business pipeline of around 18%.
in the quarter, we announced two significant new products, both of which are part of the extended detection and response or xdr strategy, kind of the latest evolved market from edr. the first product is blackberry gateway with employee base remotely and not in the office as well as mobile becoming more prevalent, the traditional moat and castle model of network assets is no longer efficient or effective. in fact, vpn users once authenticated [technical issues] to the entire network, including on-prem and all of saas application for the [indecipherable] of their session.
blackberry gateway is a zero trust network access product that uses to finance ai to continuously authenticate network activity. the cloud ai evaluate over 30 risk factors or we name as factors such as downloading behavior, dns, query, time of day etc to determine unusual activity.
the second product released this quarter is optics 3.0. its our latest version of our endpoint detection and response market or namely, edr. with this new version, the ai driven engine remains at both the edge and in the cloud, allowing near real time responses both offline and online. this continues to be a differentiator for us. however, importantly, this new cloud enabled products will allow event data to be stored centrally in a cloud-based data lake. this together with a new search engine and a query language allow threat hunters to gain greater visibility.
switching to the sales front, uem revenue in q1 was [indecipherable], in part due to the work from home ramp-up that we have saw last year but didn't repeat. let me reassure you that the uem remains a important part of our cyber business and we remain fully committed to it.
in the quarter, we continue to secure business of highly regulated customers, maybe start with financial services. and financial services included mitsubishi ufj, bank of china, bank of france, and the union bank of india.
in the government and healthcare sector, we conducted business with the government of canada, the uk nhs health services, university health network, canada, the united states department of energy and department of commerce, the netherlands ministry of general affairs, the australian department of environmental and energy, also the white house communication agency, us department of state, department of treasury, and the united states department of defense. also in government, in the united states federal government, we have increased the number of athoc cloud [indecipherable] users by 6% sequentially.
from a market perspective, this quarter we gained new business through partnership, we recently announced with verizon, vodafone, as well as telus. with microsoft, we have integrated our critical event management product, alert with microsoft teams. further, as we've communicated in the past, our cyber suite our ues platform is on target to integrate with [indecipherable] by the end of august.
this quarter we significantly stepped-up on our sales hiring. the market for high quality talent is competitive. and it has taken a little longer to [technical issues]. but we have currently expect to end q2 with around 23% more sales rep than at the start of the year. this expanded reach will help blackberry to be in more competitive take-offs, where our product [indecipherable]. with the recent increase in sales hiring, many of which started during q2, billings score is slightly to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year, therefore revenue is likely to be at the lower end of our $495 million to $515 million range that we gave last quarter.
moving onto licenses. revenue for the quarter was $24 million, which is better than expected because some business came in early. gross margin was 75%. the negotiation for the sale of a large portion of the patent portfolio are ongoing and good progress has been made. in fact, we have started negotiating the definitive agreement. revenue for q2 is likely to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million for the ip as stated last quarter. so this has not changed. this is due to the monetization activities being limited by ongoing negotiations. in terms of the full year outlook for the licensing business should the sales not complete, we expect revenue to be around $100 million.
let me now hand the call over to steve.
steve rai -- chief financial officer
thanks, john. so, my comments on our financial performance for the fiscal quarter will be in non-gaap terms, unless otherwise noted. please refer to the supplemental table in the press release for the gaap and non-gaap details. as john mentioned earlier, starting this quarter we are no longer adjusting gaap revenue for deferred revenue acquired. this means the gaap and non-gaap revenue will be the same going forward and comparatives have been confirmed accordingly.
we delivered first quarter total company revenue of $174 million. first quarter total company gross margin was 66%. our non-gaap gross margin excludes stock compensation expense of $1 million. first quarter operating expenses were $138 million. our non-gaap operating expenses exclude $32 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, $6 million in stock compensation expense, and a $4 million fair value adjustment on convertible debentures which is a non-cash accounting adjustment, largely driven by market conditions. first quarter non-gaap operating loss was $23 million and the first quarter non-gaap net loss was $27 million. gaap earnings per share was a $0.05 loss in the quarter and our adjusted ebitda was negative $6 million for this quarter, excluding the non-gaap adjustments previously mentioned.
i will now provide a breakdown of our revenue in the quarter. cybersecurity revenue was $107 million and iot revenue was $43 million. software product revenue remained in the range of 80% to 85% of the total with professional services comprising the balance. the recurring portion of software product revenue was approximately 90%. licensing and other revenue as john mentioned was $24 million, this is a little higher than expected as deals came in early. the monetization activity remains limited, while negotiations for the potential ip sale continue.
now, moving to our balance sheet and cash flow performance. total cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $769 million at may 31, 2021, a decrease of $35 million during the quarter. our net cash position decreased to $404 million at the end of the quarter. first quarter free cash flow was negative $35 million, cash generated from operations was negative $33 million, and capital expenditures were $2 million. bear in mind, the first quarter of our fiscal year typically has a higher cash requirement due to payment of annual bonuses and other demands at this time.
that concludes my comments, and i'll now turn the call back to john.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, steve. before the q&a, i'd like to update everybody a few things. although we have organized [indecipherable] the go-to-market lines, there are a number of future high growth opportunities that our blackberry lab is working on, that actually harness the power of entire technology portfolio [indecipherable] our ai ml engine in iot. one good example of this is using cylance in the car. you may or may not remember at ce a couple of years ago we demonstrated an early version of how our persona technology that identifies an appropriate assets for the user behaviors can be applied to drivers of vehicles.
we also demonstrated how our protect epp can be used to protect the connected cars from cyber threats. there are just two of the number of potential use cases that we are currently looking at. the second is our data lake [indecipherable] ever-increasing number of sources allow for greater visibility and determination of the real level of risk across an organization, this is obviously essential to zero trust applications. this applies not only to xtr but also the increasing sensor rich auto environment, autonomous drive and smart cities. this centralization of data insights for our data lake can enable a whole new business model in the future.
the third area is related to the recent us sbom, software bill of materials, the executive orders that aim to secure the software supply chain. this comes in light of the recent incidents including solar wind and the colonial pipeline threat -- intrusions. combining products from our iot products, including our jarvis code scanning tools, our qnx embedded operating system and our certicom cryptology with our prevention first ai-driven cybersecurity product and services means blackberry offers a comprehensive approach to this issue. we have begun working closely with various government [indecipherable] setting bodies.
so, before we open the line for q&a, i'd like to summarize the key messages again. i felt software and services business are our key market opportunity, strengthening our management team in the process. qnx made solid progress this year -- this quarter, sorry. we are pleased with the strong design activities and the pipeline of new design wins, plus our royalty revenue backlog increase year-over-year. we continue to demonstrate real progress of ivy with tangible step [technical issues] such as the launch of the advisory council and then as well as the first investment by the innovation fund. we launched two new important products as for our xdr strategy and the ai-driven prevention first approach continues to be our focus. we are also increasing sales headcounts and pipeline is growing particularly for our new ues products. our main focus is on growing the top line and therefore we continue to increase investment in both our software business unit as we see double-digit billings growth this year. finally, we remain optimistic about the successful conclusion to the negotiation of the patent portfolio itself [phonetic].
and with that, i would like to ask jesse to open the line for q&a, please.

thank you, speakers. participants, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] speakers, our first question is from the line of daniel chan of td securities. your line is now open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, dan
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
hi, john. so, you stated that your qnx royalty revenue backlog increased to $490 million from $450 million last year. over what period of time, do you expect that backlog to be recognized over?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
typically, the highest -- usually four to seven years, and typically its peak at four and then it start moving down toward the end of the life cycle of a car. sometime, it extended more beyond that.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thanks. and then you also talked about the ivy advisory council. can you talk about the level of commitment partners have agreed to as part of this council and whether you plan to include major oems on it?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question. but before i answer that question let me make one more comment on backlog, because i have also got some feedback regarding that our backlog number is very conservative. i would tell you that it is on a conservative side. and we get it from directly from the oem when we win the design win and they gave us the estimate. we also have not included professional services backlog and developer seat backlog. so, in the future, when we have a very solid methodology, so that we just don't kind of do much of the guessing and we get a very grounded set of math, you will see that backlog number to go up and show you all that we are going to include that. but that may take a couple of quarters.
and to go back to answer your question regarding the advisory council. they are there to help us to define used cases, particularly in the vertical that they operate in that the ivy could be of great help and i don't want to exclude any oem but i don't think oem would want to do that. they tend to do it one on one with us directly, because this is obviously value add that they don't want to share. so our proprietary do themselves. i hope that makes sense.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
it does. thank you.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
next question is from the line of mike walkley of canaccord. your line is now open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, mike.
michael walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
hey, john. thanks taking my question. yeah, i was hoping you could update us on blackberry's uem strategy? i know there are some tough big comps because of the pandemic from last year, but at least update us on the strategies, is it still a large piece of your cybersecurity business unit?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a good question. so, let's see, our spark platform just composed of uem and ues and uem is very strategic to us because it is our gateway to a lot of our major customers who completely rely on us on security. so our strategy is continue to expand our footprint in the regulated industry and we're on the more price sensitive and kind of the non-regulated industries, we want to make sure that our ues platform, which is our endpoint security platform also connect to run on it and obviously one of the largest installed base outside of myspace here, outside the regulated is microsoft intune. so this is why that we're excited about the fact that we'll have intune released -- connected release in end of august, i believe, yes -- and end of august.
so basically, the strategy is continue to expand the footprint that we have in the vertical like financial, healthcare, and government. that's very important to us with the uem, with its roadmap. the roadmap is highly geared toward security and certifications and compliance and so forth and then to bring your own device of byod environment and that's still kind of the roadmap of uem focused on. and then the ues is of course expanding on the cybersecurity antiviral stuff. so that's our strategy of how we approach the market.
michael walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
okay. now that's very helpful. and just my follow-up question. just on the gross margin by division, thanks for the updated business metrics. how should we think about growth and trends for the businesses over-time, particularly on the cybersecurity business? where could those gross margins get to over-time as the business ramps and any reason why it might have fallen a bit sequentially?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. i think the best way to answer the question is that, especially cybersecurity, we're trying to go to the enterprise software timeless model. and so we have not deviated from that. so the gross margin ought to be maybe heightened competitive but they have the high volume growth somewhere between 75% to 80%. i think that will be a very good target to shoot for the cyber business.
michael walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
and what might need to happen to maybe get there from where you are today? what would be that timeframe you think?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
timeframe, i think probably a year out. you want me to guess that, like based that on, because if you recall, we actually have a lot of increase of headcount feet on the street this quarter. in fact, our quarter ends in august. in fact, some of them has committed to sign on and is yet to start. and with that, if i give them the time for nine to 12 months, six to nine months getting up to speed and at the same time, cultivating the pipeline to make the sales cycle work, i think about a year out, i should see some good results from this class of incoming team members there.
michael walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. that's helpful. thanks for taking my questions.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
next question is from the line of paul treiber of rbc capital markets. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hey, paul.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi. thanks, and good afternoon. first of all, follow-up question on sales. when you mentioned in the outlook the prepared remarks that you expect bookings, double-digit bookings growth for the year, how should you think about the ramp or the trajectory over the year?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
i actually didn't get. paul, i missed some part of your words.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, bookings growth. how should we think about bookings growth over this coming year? how should we think about the ramp over the year relative to where we are now?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. as i said earlier also, we just recently have a lot of increase of headcounts in sales. so the booking need to be back-ended this year and then continue on for next year, obviously. so i don't know whether that's the question you were asking.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
in the rate of growth there like, where do you kind of -- where do you expect to go to?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. on bookings we do expect it toward the end of the year. we do expect to see a double-digit percentage growth.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. on cybersecurity revenue for this quarter based on the numbers, the historical numbers and gaap numbers did take a step down, i think you mentioned uem. can you just elaborate on what you saw customers doing, i mean i imagine they purchased last year. do they churn off? can you just elaborate on what happened there?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
no, i think it is quite -- in general, it is quite steady and stable. we didn't see the growth that we're hoping for, but it will be forthcoming because we just released the edr products. we talk about cloud version, the latest optics 3.0. we just released all these new products a couple -- a quarter ago, actually a quarter ago. so we are seeing that pipeline being build up and just looking for them to come into being billings and business. so we don't -- i don't see any major movement one way or the other. but if people are interested in edr, i believe that they should be interested more in protect. that's our job to make sure that, that message come across and the benefit of that could be demonstrated and i definitely could demonstrate. one thing you can look at the blackberry, the blackberry-cylance product combo, none of these major viruses, yes, none of these major viruses had actually hit our user base, touchwood. and so any way, that's how we should [indecipherable] our product.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, thank you. i will pass the line.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
sure.

next question is from the line of trip chowdhry of global equities research. your line is now open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, chowdhry.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
thank you. very good execution on the product front.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
two quick questions. first, regarding the battery management system. i was wondering, this is definitely an incremental market for you. there are three parts of the business model the way i look at. there could be a design win [technical issues] production part of it in the software, and there [technical issues] subscription part of the software that is running or managing the batteries. so among these three things, is it all the three components or is it only the software and subscription regarding the battery management software that qnx is running?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, thank you, trip. so first of all, it's a little early for me to answer the question. i have a preference. the preference is a usage-based revenue or a monthly subscription type revenue. that would be my preference. of course, that would have to be in agreement with the oem. so, demonstrating that an ivy, as an ivy use cases is one of the most important thing that we need to do in the next three to six months. there is a demo being put together. it will not be available until probably the end of this calendar year as full engineering team just started working on it. and in the meantime, we'll try to figure out the question, the answer to the question that you posed. again i have a strong presence for this to be either usage based or monthly recurring based.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
wonderful. the second question i have is regarding your exceptional machine learning models you have and definitely currently your cylance machine learning ai models work with only your product. are you exploring or do you think it makes a business sense to open-up your machine learning models to say other oems or to other isvs and then such poor connection or charge per like an apis, because your product which is gateway security, i think that is very normal and again, that's another incremental revenue opportunity you can get over period of time. so i was just thinking you know since you have the best training models available, just licensing them or any other business model that can give more revenues for you, your thoughts on that we really appreciate and again, very good execution on the product front.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. we haven't thought about licensing those models to other application. maybe i'll say that. however we are licensing that -- well, licensing is a wrong word, sorry. we are embedding the lightweight agent in iot devices including like medical equipment and industrial equipment and some of those other technology we have like the mobile threat detection and prevention also uses the model. so it's being used in a different way. from a business perspective, we didn't think about the licensing where i could explore that but we are more focused on doing embedding in endpoints.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
very good. thank you very much, john.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
sure, trip. thank you.
operator
next question is from the line of paul steep of scotia capital. your line is now open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, paul.
paul steep -- scotia capital inc. -- analyst
hi, john. can you maybe either just on maybe for both you and steve. i'll just make it one question. you can first up as you like here. can you give us some context around the cost base, obviously disclosed last quarter that you had 3,497 employees globally. and then earlier in this call, you talked about increasing the number of reps by 23% at the end of q2. so i'm just trying to square up how we want to think about your cost base maybe going forward whether you've just incrementally shifted resources or is this like net new ads that we shall be thinking that are temporarily going to get added and then [indecipherable] productivity as you pointed out earlier?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. we have not done any major or even minor reduction in force. we have moved some resources around more of a functional investment reasons, not for reduction of people. so it's probably best for you to think about it as incremental.
paul steep -- scotia capital inc. -- analyst
that's helpful. maybe just the last one as well. in terms of new cybersecurity products, obviously, you're talking about given the team time to ramp up, but maybe talk to us a little bit about what you're seeing from inbound client interest because you've launched -- a significant number of products been on a bit of a role here in terms of new product launches. that's it. thanks.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
i assuming you're talking about the cyber side?
paul steep -- scotia capital inc. -- analyst
yeah. sorry, cyber.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
okay. right. probably most of the conversation center around the protect product. i would say if i think about in the larger opportunities and sites that we have, one, the key winning product it is the protect. so this is why you heard me say a number of times on this call today and we're going try to double down on the protect side because this is a differentiator for us. and in addition to that, the ai-ml model that we have could be embedded and embedded without having to be updated, it's been valid for a very long time. so that's probably the largest opportunities when you think of our large installations. and now, what we're trying to do is to position the xdr product we talk about the new one for gateway, and that provide a zero trust architecture. so enterprise, especially like government, was extremely interested in that -- those two areas.
paul steep -- scotia capital inc. -- analyst
thank you.

john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
thank you. thank you, tim. good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining the call today. one correction, i think all the number -- all the revenue number we use will be gaap based, correct?
tim foote -- investor relations
yes.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
you said non-gaap numbers. it is actually -- the revenue number we'll refer to, all gaap based number. okay.
starting with our headlines. this quarter, the business performed well with revenue for all the three business segments, beating expectations. the cyber security business unit delivered strong sequential billings and revenue growth. the iot business unit performed better than expected with strong design-related activities, partially offset -- offsetting the impact of the global chip shortage on production royalties. licensing revenue reflects the restriction on monetization activity from the ongoing patent sale negotiations, which i will talk about more in detail shortly. licensing and other revenue came in slightly stronger than expected.
this quarter blackberry generated positive operating cash flow. following the strengthening of our iot leadership team in q1, we have appointed john giamatteo to lead our cyber security business unit, beginning or commencing november -- october 4, sorry, commencing october 4, which is a couple of weeks from now. john was previously the mcafee president and chief revenue officer, running the enterprise and consumer cyber security businesses. this new appointment completes the refocus of our software business, into two business units, i'll cover this in more detail later. excuse me.
i'll start my review with the iot business unit. revenue came in at $40 million, which is better than expected primarily due to ongoing strength in the design activities area. gross margin remained strong at 83%. iot arr increased to $89 million. as you are all aware, the auto industry experienced some significant headwinds in q2 due to the global semiconductor chip shortage. this impacted production volume, particularly in north america. for instance, a major customers of ours reported 700,000 large units of production in calendar q2. production-based royalty are historically the largest single component of our qnx revenue. however, a significant portion of revenue is also generated from design activities, prior to the vehicle entering production. this part of the business remains very vibrant, and we continue to generate strong development seat and professional services revenues. as a result, total iot revenue in the quarter was better than expected. furthermore, these design wins will translate into future production-based royalties.
as we look ahead to the rest of the year, we continue to see the headwind for our vehicle production. the problem is future has shifted from surprise of wafers to more of a back-end assembly and testing issues, largely due to the spike in covid cases in asia, as well as some of the accidents going on in asia, like some of their plants had fire for example. feedback from oem about the impact on production volumes in the second half is somewhat mix and constantly evolving. for example, daimler recently indicated they're expecting a lessening impact by q4, excuse me, sorry. and volkswagen, on the other hand, see challenges persisting into 2023.
in terms of outlook, we continue to see the past quarter as the low point, but significant headwinds are expected to continue into q4 and -- q3 and q4 and perhaps even beyond that, albeit with a sequentially decreasing impact. the impact of the chip shortage on qnx royalty revenue is expected to be buffer somewhat by ongoing strength in design activities. we are comfortable with the current iot revenue consensus, meaning the full year revenue outlook remains unchanged.
as mentioned, despite of the supply chain issue qnx continue to win new design at a very solid pace. in the quarter, we had 23 new design wins, with seven in auto and 16 in the general embedded market, we call it, gem. because of our market presence and leading technology, we are a trusted go-to supplier and market leader in auto. furthermore, we're delighted to announce that we now have design wins with 24 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle automakers, as measured by volume. having been selected, most recently by daimler as part of their design -- as part of their ev design. this is up from the 23 of 25 we had last quarter. these 24 oems, between them represent 82% of global ev market -- production, sorry, 82% of global ev production. this demonstrate a leading position we have in this very fast growing part of the auto industry.
i'd like to expand on a couple of design wins to get investors more colors as to why qnx was chosen, and why we are the industry leader. the first design, which was a automotive tier 1, that is building full digital cockpit and gateway solution for a chinese ev oem. you see the qnx real-time operating system and hypervisor. qnx technology is well known and trusted in china, in the chinese automotive industry given its reputation for safety and security. qnx was chosen above software as a solution from both domestic and multinational -- and as well as multinational competitors. production is expected in 2022, which is next year and run for around five years. the second is a leading japanese industrial robotics manufacturer that's also happen do be a new logo to a blackberry. the customer select qnx for an autonomous 3d robot warehousing system ahead of the leading competitors. qnx was chosen for its functional safety credentials. production is expected to start this year and continue for five years. other notable design wins this quarter in auto included instrument, cluster and adas systems. in a gem space, design wins including medical diagnostic, industrial process control and thermal control system for a power plant.
i'm going to shift to jarvis. during the quarter, we launched jarvis 2.0. this is a saas version of our software composition analytics tool, which was previously offer as a bespoke service engagement. jarvis 2.0, which include a market-leading binary code scanner is an important part of how blackberry can assist customers to achieve compliance with the recent sbom executive order, secure bill of material -- software bill of materials, sorry, software bill of materials executive orders, mandated by the biden administration.
moving to a brief update on ivy. we are pleased with the ongoing progress being made. both blackberry and aws has significant resources allocated to project, and our timelines remains on track. we are on schedule to release an early access version of the production in october, in the product side. we are scheduled to release an early access version of the product in october that will enable further engagement with oems, and also allow demonstration at ces in january. this version will be available to certain ecosystem partners to begin actively building application on ivy. and speaking of applications, for ivy to be embraced by automakers we recognized that it is important to demonstrate ivy value to them.
following on from a ai-driven battery management apps that we announced last quarter, we announced another application that we will be built on ivy. this new application enable in-vehicle payments and is being delivered through a partnership with car iq, a california-based start-up. the application will use direct access to the sensor data and the edge compute, two of the ivy's key differentiators to produce a unique digital fingerprint for their vehicle. this will allow authentication of payments for items such as, fuels, tolls, parking services, etc., without a need of a free credit cards or other traditional payment methods. this opens up the possibility for oem to participate in a new revenue streams, and it's another of the many potential applications that ivy will enable. in summary, ivy continues to progress nicely.
now let me turn to cyber security. this quarter, the business unit delivered strong sequential billings and revenue growth. revenue was $120 million. gross margin came in at 59%. arr was $364 million. dollar-based net retention was 95%. as we mentioned earlier, john giamatteo will be joining blackberry to lead the cyber security business unit, taking over from tom eacobacci, who was the acting general manager. john brings with him many years of cyber security industry experience. during his six years as president and chief revenue officer at mcafee, he delivered both double-digit growth and margin expansion for the enterprise, the smb, as well as the consumer divisions. john will build on the progress that has been made in recent quarters with the cyber security business unit go-to-market engine, and will also direct old product development, and business unit strategy. tom eacobacci has decided to pursue other opportunities, and will leave blackberry at the end of october. the addition of john to the team completes the split of the software and services business into two market focus business unit. both iot and cybers are targeted with driving growth and with it shareholder value. the two business units will report directly to me.
as mentioned, this was a good quarter. although, it's still work for team to do, there's a few outstanding area that i feel that i'd like to share with you about. this quarter we saw further growth in pipeline for our cyber security product, especially for the new logo customers. pipeline grew strongly for blackberry gateway, as zero trust network access product launched last quarter. to help realize this increased pipeline, investment in our direct sales force, in particularly the hiring of quota-carrying sales head continues. we're also making further progress in the channel as illustrated by a 32% sequential growth in the channel billings this quarter. new partner program has also helped significantly increase both channel driven pipeline generation and a new logo billings, mainly in the north americas arena.
we also have seen robust growth in business through managed service -- managed security service providers or mssps. you may recall that during the q2 earnings call a year ago, we targeted using mnsp -- mssps, sorry, to quickly scale our guarded managed service offering. today one of these partners, i'm happy to report, manage more than 100,000 endpoints using blackberry cyber products.
i'd like to take a closer look at some wins during the quarter that demonstrate why customer chose -- are choosing blackberry for their cyber security needs. the first customer is one of the top 10 automakers in the world. this customer select our protect epp and optics edr solution, following a competitive bake off in which we went head-to-head with crowdstrike and carbon black. the customer selected blackberry due to our near 100% malware detection rate, our lightweight engine and flexible deployment options, both in the cloud as well as the stand-alone factory network. the second is a fortune 100 financial services company. blackberry displace microsoft defender with protect and optics. the company selected us, particularly, for our performance on macos. the third is where we have continued success within the australian state government agencies. this quarter, we saw protect offtakes in our threatzero consulting services into a number of agency displacing predominantly legacy incumbents that included trend micro and symantec. the customer chose blackberry for our next-generation prevention for its technology.
on the industry recognition front, se labs, a leading independent research firm based in london, has performed rigorous set of tests on our epp and edr products, protect and optics. this breach test differ from their quarterly endpoint test, rather than simply loading no malware onto an endpoint, which typically masking an ability of traditional signature-based vendors to prevent zero-day threats that breach test in includes instead of [indecipherable] real-time, real-world hacking tactics. they have probably comprehensive techniques to evade our defense, and concluded that protect and optics provide compete prevention, complete detection, as well as zero false positive. a link to the full report could be found on our investor relations webpage. this third-party validation of our product, not just our edp -- epp, but also our edr demonstrate how we have successfully closed the product gap to competitors with recent product launches.
the market is now recognizing some of the unique differentiated abilities of our cyber products, one of which is a maturity of our ai engine. as in the previous quarters, we are seeing new malware and ransomware hitting the headline on an almost daily basis. our ai engine, the most mature in the industry continues to provide zero-day prevention against the host of these threats. in the quarter, our product successfully brought new profile ransomware, such as hive, lockbit, ragnar locker, and many more before they could do any damages. blackberry cylance ai engine is firmly focused on preventing our customers on being breached, whereas some of the leading competitors instead focus on showing customer all the ways that system -- on a different ways that their system could be accessed.
on the uem front, we will continue to invest in our roadmap delivering enhancements that add most value to customers. we recently announced that the enterprise can now benefit from blackberry leading security, while enjoying a seamless and native user experience with microsoft 365 productivity apps. this is enabled by additional integration between blackberry uem and microsoft 365, primarily through the azure active directory conditional access. this is part of the latest version of the uem new series, which was released this month, earlier this month that is. new series also provide zero-day support for android 12 and ios 15.
this past quarter, we secured important new year renewals with government agencies, such as irs, the department of homeland security, the us marine corps, the us army corps of engineers, the uk ministry of defense, the us -- united states air force, as well as leading enterprise such as general dynamics and mariner [phonetic]. we also won a number of new logos such as, french national institute for criminal research and the tel aviv stock exchange.
with continued growth in pipeline, couple of investment in our direct and channel sales, the outlook of the cyber security business unit is for sequential billings growth for the remaining of the fiscal year. this is expected to lead to modest sequential revenue growth due to the subscription model. the full year outlook remains, as before, at the lower end of $495 million to $515 million range.
turning now to licensing. as i mentioned earlier, negotiation to sell the portion of the patent portfolio related to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking, are ongoing. and we have made significant progress since our last earnings call, including preliminary agreement of many of the key items -- of the key terms of the deal. we expect to execute definitive agreement this quarter. closing the transaction will be subject to a normal regulatory review. normal -- naturally, given this backdrop, we will continue to eliminate monetization activities for the remaining of the fiscal year, therefore, revenue for both q3 and q4 is expected to be similar to q2, which is at $10 million per quarter. while we expect the sales to conclude essentially, the process has taken longer than we expected or anticipated. should it not conclude this quarter, we have other options, including additional interested parties. we will update investors on the material -- on any of the material developments in a timely manners.
so let me now hand over to steve to further review the financials. steve?
steve rai -- chief financial officer
thank you, john. my comments on our financial performance for the second quarter will be in non-gaap terms, unless otherwise noted. please refer to the supplemental table in the press release for the gaap and non-gaap details.
we delivered second quarter total company revenue of $175 million. second quarter total company gross margin was 65%. our non-gaap gross margin excludes stock compensation expense of $1 million. second quarter operating expenses were $143 million. our non-gaap operating expenses exclude $32 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, $11 million in stock compensation expense, and $67 million fair value adjustment on the convertible debentures, which is a non-cash accounting adjustment from the large swings, driven by market and trading conditions.
the second quarter non-gaap operating loss was $30 million, and the second quarter non-gaap net loss was $33 million. non-gaap earnings per share was a $0.06 loss in the quarter. our adjusted ebitda was negative $14 million this quarter, excluding the non-gaap adjustments previously mentioned, as we continue to invest in both our cyber and iot businesses to drive top line growth.
i will now provide a breakdown of our revenue in the quarter. cyber security revenue was $120 million, and iot revenue was $40 million. software product revenue remained in the range of 80% to 85% of the total, with professional services comprising the balance. the recurring portion of software product revenue was approximately 80%. licensing and other revenue was $15 million. as john mentioned, our ip monetization activities remained limited, while negotiations for the potential sale continues.
now moving to our balance sheet and cash flow performance. total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $772 million as at august 31, 2021, an increase of $3 million during the quarter. our net cash position increased to $407 million. second quarter free cash flow was $10 million. cash generated from operations was $12 million, and capital expenditures were $2 million.
that concludes my comments. i'll now turn it back to john.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, steve. before we move to q&a, i'd like to summarize this past quarter. i'm pleased with how the business performed, beating revenue expectations for all the businesses and delivered positive cash flow. the structure of the two market focused business, cyber business unit is already delivering results and we're adding additional relevant industry experience. we are encouraged by the growth in cyber security pipeline and continue to invest in sales technology. qnx design activities remains very strong, and we are very -- weathering the impact of the chip shortage as well. we are now also making good progress with ivy.
and with that i'd like, actually, the operator to open the line for q&a, please.

and we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question today will be from mike walkley with canaccord. your line is open.
mike walkley -- canaccord -- analyst
great.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
hi, mike.
mike walkley -- canaccord -- analyst
thanks. hi, john. how are you doing?
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
very good.
mike walkley -- canaccord -- analyst
thanks for all the updates and the guidance. i guess my first question for you is, your guidance arguably implies an aggressive second half outlook, just to reach the full year guidance. can you walk us through what needs to go right for you to achieve that guidance for stronger second half?
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. thank you. thank you for the question. so there are some assumptions that let me break it down a little bit. licensing, of course, we already explained. so i don't have to go much detail of that. i think we're going to have $10 million a quarter for the next two quarters, the second half that is. each of the quarter. and it had something to do with the fact that we are not going to monetize, or push on the monetization effort and licensing effort, while we're going through this negotiation on selling the portion of the patents that is on those areas of business that we no longer actively involved with. regarding iot, the only wildcard, so to speak, is the chip shortage and the impact of that. from all the indicators, all the ups and downs and give and take, and we spoke to a lot of them, the oems that north america seems to be getting better in q3, q4, as compared to q2. good -- a good example will be ford believe they could -- they are improving and gm also is, although they're going to shut down a couple of factories in q3. but i think from by magnitude, it's improving versus the first half of the year. so north america, you see it going back, improving the situation. europe, however, still had about 10% to 15% impact of the production, and so is asia pacific. so, net of all that, if we are in that range, without any dramatic departure then the numbers that we expected in the second half still holds. and a big part of that, of course is, we are winning some very strong design wins that that bring us more developer seats revenue and then as well as professional services revenue. so i'm pretty comfortable with that.
on cyber, it really is a function of one thing. i mean, i got two consideration in there. one thing, the major part is, we have a lot of salespeople join us in the last couple of, two quarters, three quarters. we have a pretty young pipeline. the activities in the pipeline has been very strong in the last quarter and two. so putting that together, it's actually a good thing, except that it might take time to ramp up. and so the rate of conversion of the pipeline with a newer sales force, it's the only wildcard. and it is something that we have to manage very carefully. but the good news there is, even if it takes longer, these things -- these businesses don't tend to go away. so we're -- so that's the assumptions that we made in our forecast. the other one is, in q4, we've got a couple of large government deals with some of the government, especially in north america. some of those needs to come to fruition. and then we sort of -- and then we expect them to. so those are the basis of our forecast. yes. second half seems to be a bigger number, a stronger number than q -- the first half. that's correct.
mike walkley -- canaccord -- analyst
great. thank you. and just my follow-up question. congrats on adding john giamatteo to the team. is he going to run kind of the same playbook that was getting put in place for all the team? or do you expect further changes with the rotation in such key position, and does that impact your guidance thoughts at all.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
it's slightly early to tell, but i'm dying to hear his experience of growth. because he was being able to grow both the consumer business and enterprise business at mcafee, when he was running the -- where he was the president in mcafee and the cro. so i'm sure he will make some changes. i'm doubtful that everything will remain exactly the same. on the other hand, the investment that we made in channel, the investment we made in pipeline, the investment we make in partners, and the engineering, and the investment we make in hiring more sales reps. and we have a -- a couple of quarters ago, we hired a pretty good professional services. i'm sure that he will take full advantage of those.
mike walkley -- canaccord -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
all right. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from daniel chan with td securities. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
hey, daniel.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
hey, john.
steve rai -- chief financial officer
hi, dan.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
you mentioned earlier that, typically your qnx revenue has a higher mix of royalty versus development. should we expect a higher mix of development for the next couple of years as electronics and software development become ramped up at a lot of these oems?
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
i think you should expect, probably for this year, and i think -- i don't think in the future years it will continue to be the same. the reason i say this is because remember, i should be seeing some of the production revenue coming from adas assuming the supply shortages issue, it started to improve. i mean it had to improve over time. as a huge industry, and semiconductor -- for the whole semiconductor industry, auto is not really that big, it's not 100%. obviously, it's probably like more or like 15% of the market. so we will address that. and so i expect that our royalty rate to go back into some kind of growth, especially with all the design wins that we had in the last couple of, two years, three years.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. can you remind us how you sell these development seats? is it more like a perpetual license, or is there a recurring proportion to that as well?
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
it's more like a perpetual license. it's selling seats.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
okay. and do you kind of get like a 20% maintenance?
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. we get upgrade and maintenance on it. yes.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
okay. one more if i may, cyber security arr was flat sequentially, while you've been saying that the pipeline has been growing. just wondering when we're going to start seeing that metric start to pick up. whether there is some seasonality built into [indecipherable].
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
yeah. that's a good question. i asked that question also and they always give me the product mix answer, that some of them we took earlier upfront because the rev rec policy. i expect for this full sales -- and i've said it in the past by the way, so it's very consistent. this year or next year is where i would see -- we are -- i'm going to see some -- hoping to see some strong growth of all the investment we have made, the pipeline growing into new sales and so forth.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
okay, thank you.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
sure.
operator
your next question comes from paul treiber with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
hi, there.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, john. first question on the patent sale, i know you can't say much just given you're in the middle of negotiations. but in your statement, you mentioned that the negotiations are going well. but then you also indicated that if it doesn't close, you have other options. just could you bridge between those two statements, because they're actually quite far apart from a tone perspective.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
that's a good one. i'm glad you caught it. yes, it is going well. i fully expect to finish this this quarter. but i'm tired of waiting. i know a lot of our investors are too. it is -- i'm not blaming anything on anybody, and may be we have too many lawyers assigned to this, sorry, lawyers, i doubted you. but the key is -- it's a complex and it's big portfolio. it is rightfully so that they have done a lot of due diligence, and those things are now completed by the way, all the due diligence are completed. and then we have a lot of time span on definitive agreement negotiation. and then by and large, with the exception of one or two items, we're done with that. and then we have the purchase agreement. and so it just for me, it's been since last christmas. it's coming up, the next christmas. so, i basically kind of draw the line in the sand and say, i can just stop licensing the business to either move on one direction or the other. and then there are other interested parties in calling. and so we are not entertaining them because, as you recall during a period of time, not long in the past, we were in exclusive discussion with these people. so i can't really entertain a third-party. so my only point is, if you want to put percentage, waiting percentage, i put 80%, 20%. i put 80%, we get it done this quarter. does that help?
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, that's very helpful. i wasn't going to ask for percentage, but i'm glad you threw it out. switching back to the business, in regards to 24 out of 25 ev oems, how do we think about the magnitude or size of these wins? like you find like ev is the -- the asp is higher than a gasoline vehicle, is that what you're seeing, generally?
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
no. usually to asp ties to functionality. if you look at functionality like idi, it's usually low single digit dollars for royalty, but if you look at adas and clusters, they are usually high single-digit pushing into double-digit per car. so it's not gasoline versus electric vehicle. and so the electric vehicle have one advantage, which is where -- which is in a more component of highly complex ecus. when you have highly complex ecu, it does two things for us. number one, because we have the highest certification in security and safety, when you have a high complex ecu, like a compute engine in the car, they tend to go after that most secure and most safe production -- product. so we have an actual advantage to win it. that's number one. number two, they used to -- they tend to use very complex algorithm and that will help us sometimes selling more than even one copy for a ecu. so -- and when you sell these complex ecus, and with adas or clusters, or hypervisor, typically the asp is on a higher end. so it's really more function that drive asp versus ev or gas.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then one follow-up. it seems like blackberry qnx has good traction in chinese ev market. could you speak to, like there is a pricing for that market. does it materially different than other oems, or other geographies for qnx?
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
no, no material difference. so there's also other things you need to be aware that a lot of those chinese players actually had design center in the united states. so the market price is the market price, because they all -- a lot of them are all in the us. but of course, we have a chinese team and then deal with the customers over there, and the factories over there and so forth. but they're not materially different.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay, thank you. i'll pass the line.

your next question comes from todd coupland with cibc. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
hello there.
todd coupland -- cibc -- analyst
hey there, john. nice to talk to you. i'll follow-up on the ev line of questioning. so that 25th oem, which you don't have, your role is bringing out new vehicles, many new vehicles that are selling well at lower prices, etc. what are the chances, if you're getting into that oem?
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
my team promised me, through up and down they're working it. and so i'm hopeful that i -- the fact that they typically like to do compete vertical integrations, it still require work from us. but we're working it.
todd coupland -- cibc -- analyst
yeah, ok. and then also on the patent sale, there has been press articles that in the trade press that you more or less sort of settled on a price, and it was really the complexity of all the participants in a, i guess, a buyer's group, if you will. any comments on whether that is indeed correct, and it really is these details with the various parties that has yet to get worked out. thanks a lot.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
i can't comment on ongoing negotiation, because it doesn't help me or whoever. i would say to you that that we have settled on the price. and that i would agree -- i would confirm. everything else, i can't really comment on.
todd coupland -- cibc -- analyst
okay, all right. that's great. appreciate the color. thanks a lot.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
absolutely, absolutely.
operator
your next question comes from paul steep with scotia. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
hi, there.
paul steep -- scotia -- analyst
hi, john. so two quick ones. the first one, maybe talk to us about how you're thinking about monetizing ivy and how those thoughts have evolved. and then i'll toss it my quick follow-ups.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
i'm sorry, how they monetize ivy? oh, ivy. okay. well, there is -- it's a work in progress, but i have a lot of ideas. first of all, i wanted something that are usage base and recurring base. and that's the revenue model. and if you look at what ivy really is, it's a collateral sensor data, the ability to analyze that push you on the edge, put it on the cloud. apply ai to it, and feed it back to the oem or application providers. and one of the reason why we spend so much time on the application side, a quarter ago, we have a intelligent battery management systems for performance and for managing anything regarding to -- related to a battery and the usage of it. and this past quarter, we turned our attention to have an application that turn your vehicle into a wallet basically. and it's a huge market for those of you who follow this because the fleet cars -- especially the trucks and the amazon delivery trucks or the fedex, or us ups, or cargoes, the commercial trucks, they -- if we do equipped [phonetic] with ivy, there are tons of sensing data between security and productivity, and the ability to not having to use of third-party to do payment and so forth, are all very positive and cost effective solution from the truck owner, and a truck runners. they also, as i mentioned earlier, the oem has always also find -- try to find ways to enrich their source of revenue after they sold the car. and this will -- this could ivy may be able to facilitate some of these applications. so that's kind of where i'm very focused on to create usage base, whether it is app base or functional base use cases. and in some cases i could share with the third parties that could share with banks. i could share the revenue with oems. and these are all possibility. so that's how we focus on monetizing ivy.
paul steep -- scotia -- analyst
great. thanks. steve, two quick follow-ups, i guess, for yourself, or steve. first one would just relate to your commentary, but continuing to invest in sales force. should we think of the numbers that you've sort of added this quarter and aggregate dollars sort of reflective throughout the remainder of the year? and then the other sort of clarification, not asking you about a pending transaction, but if the patent business didn't exist at the blackberry, how should we think about stranded cost in the sg&a line? or is it effectively pure profit that we just see maybe move off, if that business was not to be there. thank you.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
that's great. that's very good question. i need to get clarification. the first question -- what was it? could you repeat your first question?
paul steep -- scotia -- analyst
yeah. you've talked about adding more sales headcount, i'm just sort of looking at the pacing of what you've done in terms of investments. is that already sort of in the envelope, or you're thinking about stepping on the gas a lot harder than your ev, as you continue to win deals?
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
right, right. i -- we have made a -- thanks for the quick question. so, as you all know me, this -- i've been here for seven years, and i always been focused on making money, running a profitable business. and so, on the other hand, in the last year, i recognized that the business needs investment to step on the gas, we used to work. and so for the time being, and we had done that in the last two quarters, to three quarters. but for the time being, i'm not going to be so focus on loss versus profit as far as it's manageable, meaning that it's not going to be a wages, and it's not to [indecipherable] lot of my cash, burning along my cash, then we are going to step on the gas and continue hiring and continue to increase. and the idea is, since we now have the products and we could generate a pipeline, if i could close the pipeline with more feet on the streets [phonetic] and channel partners, and so forth, we will may [phonetic] grow the business and then that will then create a profit that i needed to offset a very profitable source of revenue, which was licensing. so, and licensing, as you all know, i'm not getting an evaluation of the licensing. that is the recognition of my stock price, and partly because this is a lumpy, and a lot of you have expressed that you actually don't know how to measure, valued at and you don't know how to think about the growth part of it. so that's all fair. so i believe that while we could -- while we have very fresh set of portfolios with good average life span in the portfolio that we should monetize at one time, take that proceeds to step on the gas and then invest into the cyber business, which we know there is a high growth. and we know we caught up in the product gap. and then also -- and hence grow iot and invest in ivy, which is the future revenue source, which could be significant. and we have a big partner in amazon there. so those are all, i believe, our positive value creation for blackberry.
paul steep -- scotia -- analyst
that helps. thank you.
john chen -- executive chairman & chief executive officer
sure.

and with that, i'll turn the call over to john.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, tim. good afternoon, everybody. thanks for joining the call today. i'm pleased to report that this quarter we delivered solid sequential billings and revenue growth in both our iot and cyber business unit, and at these expectations. i'm also pleased that despite on our ongoing investment to grow the top line, eps came in much better than expected.
let me start my review with the iot business unit. revenue was $43 million, representing a 34% year-over-year growth, although noting that last year was heavily impacted by the pandemic. gross margin was 81% and iot arr increased to $91 million. this is now the third consecutive quarter in which arr has increased. this was a very positive quarter for qnx, driven by continued strength and design wins activities. we achieved record quarterly revenue from development seats license and as well as associated professional services. in fact, demand is so strong right now that we're expanding our professional services team by hiring additional heads into qnx. in addition to the near-term revenue benefit, these strong design wins serves as a positive leading indicator of the longer term health of the qnx business overall. once completed, obviously, these designs will move into production and generate royalty revenue in future quarters.
in terms of production-based royalty this quarter, we saw a modest increase compared to q2. while we expect the auto industry supply chain issues to remain a meaningful headwind to vehicle production volumes through the end of this fiscal year and as well into 2022, we see the impact on qnx gradually lessening, including an improvement in q3 versus -- in q4 versus q3.
i will now provide additional colors around the design wins in the quarter. the continued strength we are experiencing is further evidence of our leadership position in auto. we are certainly not taking this position for granted and continue to invest in all aspects of the business. in the quarter, we had a major win with bmw. bmw entered a multi-year agreement with us to develop new level 2 and 2 plus autonomous drive system on qnx for makes and models across the entire bmw group. autonomous drive is the clearest example of safety critical software application in a car, which as you know is the most defensible attributes of qnx. bmw selected qnx because of our deep expertise and strong track records in safety, reliability, as well as security. in addition to licensing our technology, we will be providing a professional services team to support bmw in the aggressive development timeline.
other auto wins include a major new design for our acoustic middleware, one of our higher asp products. we also had a number of adas, advanced driver assist, sorry, adas, gateways and digital cockpit design was with leading oem and tier 1. in q3, we had 11 -- a total of 11 new auto design wins and 13 wins in the general embedded market. gem, the general embedded market, wins included a number of medical applications, such as a infectious disease diagnostic platform, as well as the next generation robotic surgical arm. we also had wins in industrial applications as well as aviation, including an engine simulator with the leading aerospace company. with any luck we'll also be able to share details of further significant auto design wins with you all at the ces in january.
a word on product development. during the quarter, google, qualcomm and blackberry, three of the leaders in the autonomous digital cockpit announced a collaboration to build a chipset that allows blackberry's hypervisor to seamlessly integrate with android automotive. we are already seeing the results securing the first design wins for this technology with a major european oem in the quarter.
previously, to develop a digital cockpit with an android automotive infotainment system running alongside safety critical application on a single chip will require hundreds of hours of extra developer time for building custom integrations. this collaboration takes care of this for the customers, saving them both costs and time to market as well as delivering a higher quality product. the auto industry continues to move toward consolidation, particularly consolidating the digital cockpits with this -- consolidating digital cockpits. with this position, qnx is even strong -- will be even more strong in their space, given the safety requirements. this provides the potential to win additional designs that will improve overall hypervisor and our rtos, our qnx operating system.
turning to the q4 outlook for the iot business. the strength we have seen in design activities is expected to continue into q4. and we anticipate a slight easing and supply chain headwinds. as a result, our outlook is for further sequential revenue growth and for q4 revenue to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million, returning to the pre-pandemic run rate. we feel very good about the iot business right now, but investors should keep in mind the auto industry production headwinds.
i will now provide a brief update on ivy. we released the early access version of ivy in october as we have previously targeted. this version has been released to a small number of ecosystem partners and will form the basis of our product demonstration at ces in january. this quarter, our co-development partner, aws announced the launch of a complementary product for ivy, called aws iot fleetwise. while ivy is called an off take and can work with any major cloud provider, aws iot fleetwise is a micro service that allows ivy insights to be efficiently and intelligently uploaded to the aws cloud, where they could support cloud side applications.
another significant development for ivy is bosch, the world's largest auto tier 1 supplier, announced that their new software integration platform will support ivy. this platform is built on qnx rtos and hypervisor, showing the potential for upselling ivy and future design to the large and growing qnx installed base. our main focus for ivy right now is on securing poc, proof-of-concept, and we are hopeful that we can announce some in the near future. overall, we're pleased with the progress we made.
let me now move to the cyber side of business. this quarter we delivered sequential billings and revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter. revenue was $128 million, gross margin was 59%. arr was $358 million, dollar based net retention was 95%. we saw continuous growth in pipeline for unified endpoint security products, and particularly our managed service offering, guard.
we're very excited about how our products performed in head-to-head take off against other next-gen competitor this quarter. when we factor a poc, our technology performs well. as illustrated by competetive wins against crowdstrike and sentinelone, as well as other older signature based players like microsoft, mcafee and symantec. among these wins was another top 10 global automaker, building on the win of the top 10 oem we told you about last quarter. other notable competitive wins include an international banking group, a leading european financial services firm and a global marketing agency. in addition to success with larger companies, we're seeing a lot of interest from small and medium sized business too. and this will continue to be an area of focus for us as the market opportunity is large.
our automated protect and guard managed service offerings really resonate with small and medium sized companies that don't have a large security infrastructure. poc often involves customer performing vigorous testing of our products against the competitors' one and the success we are having in illustrating our competitive advantage. let me highlight a few of those key ones.
the first is our focus on prevention, with customer testing demonstrating that we stop threats through the execution. this contrasts to the edr approach that aims to remediate threats after the fact. the second is artificial intelligence, whereas for other ai is relatively new and even an optional feature, our cylance ai engine is central to our technology. it is the most mature in the market, having learned from the analysis of trillions of files and literally identify over 20 billion characteristics. the third advantage we have is our epp works both, offline and online, our protection. endpoints are protected 24x7 and don't rely on cloud connection, which is of course cloud connection could be very expensive. fourth, we protect mobile. nobody in this space knows mobile as better than blackberry. i hope you agree with that, and is rapidly becoming one of the largest threats surfaces. these four attributes differentiate blackberry security offerings from the competitor.
i'm sure you all heard about the major security incidence known as log4shell, which caesar has classified at the maximum level 10 for severity. this relates to major vulnerabilities in the apache log4j java library, extensively used by the industry. let me provide you with an update from a blackberry perspective. this is obviously a rapidly evolving situation. and unlike many software companies who are still struggling to understand the impact, we track and categorize our product portfolio, open source software content. this means that we're able to very quickly identify which of our product uses this library and create mitigation and release patches as the threats evolve. we can confirm that none of our core products, namely protect, optics, uem, qnx, rtos and hypervisor, none of those products are negatively impacted by these vulnerabilities. furthermore, our suite of cyber products, particularly our protect, epp and guard managed service can help customers prevent malware and ransomware that bad actors could try to execute using these vulnerabilities.
now for a brief update on key partnerships. in recent quarters, we have released a number of new products and announced partnerships that expand our extended detection and response offering, or xdr. in the quarter, we were excited to announce partnership with okta and mimecast as well as stellar cyber and xm cyber. and then a significant xdr partnership is with exabeam, the leading next-gen siem provider. this partnership allows us to greatly improve both contacts and visibility of threats by adding telemetry data on hundreds of network integration to our guard managed xdr our service. managed xdr is a strong market opportunity, given the complexity of managing threat across the network.
finally, we are pleased that during the quarter, se labs, an independent leading -- a leading independent cybersecurity research firm, ranked blackberry as the best new endpoint protection solution of 2021. a few words on customer wins. across the business units, our key vertical this quarter were government, banking and insurance. in government, we closed business with some of the world's leading governments and government agencies, including the us navy, who became a new secuvoice customer. the department of homeland security, the dutch government, the us department of education, which was -- happened to be a new logo wins for our athoc, the spacing of key competitors, as well as scottish government, us central command, the federal aviation authority, faa and the irs just to name a few.
moving to the outlook for the cyber business. we expect continued sequential building growth in and for q4 revenue to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million. as previously indicated, i think i said it last quarter, closing certain large government deals in q4 will be important.
moving on to licensing. as you know, we have been in negotiations regarding the sale of our non-core portion of our ip patent portfolio. this process is taking much longer than we had hoped. and trust me, i share the frustration about the time line. negotiations are very close to a conclusion, and we are literally down to the last few important items now. both parties are working hard to get this finished, and we expect to reach a definitive agreement very soon. we will provide shareholders an update on progress in january. in the quarter, licensing revenue was $13 million and gross margin was 54%. this beats expectation for the quarter. should this sale reach a definitive agreement in january, we will suspend monetization activity and therefore, expect q4 revenue to be close to zero. however, if not, then we'll continue to expect revenue to be around the $10 million mark for the quarter.
i'll now hand over to steve to provide additional colors on the financials.
steve rai -- chief financial officer
thank you, john. my comments on our financial performance for the third quarter will be in non-gaap terms unless otherwise noted. please refer to the supplemental table in the press release for the gaap and non-gaap details. we delivered third quarter total company revenue of $184 million. third quarter total company gross margin was 64%. our non-gaap gross margin excludes stock compensation expense of $1 million. and our third quarter operating expenses were $142 million.
our non-gaap operating expenses exclude $29 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, $5million in stock compensation expense and a $110 million fair value gain on the convertible debentures. given our ongoing investment toward driving topline growth in our core iot and cyber businesses, the third quarter non-gaap operating loss was $24 million, and the third quarter non-gaap net loss was $1 million.
we recorded a non-operating gain of $25 million as a result of gains realized in two legacy venture investment funds that make up the majority of the long-term investment balance on our balance sheet. related to this gain, these underlying -- the investments underlying these funds represent a passive interest we had, which were sold and we received a distribution -- cash distribution of approximately $35 million during the quarter. non-gaap earnings per share was breakeven in the quarter. our adjusted ebitda was negative $8 million this quarter, excluding the non-gaap adjustments previously mentioned.
i will now provide a breakdown of our revenue in the quarter. cybersecurity revenue was $128 million, and iot revenue was $43 million. software product revenue remained in the range of 80% to 85% of the total, with professional services comprising the balance. the recurring portion of software product revenue remained at approximately 80%. licensing and other revenue was $13 million, given the limitations to our monetization activities due to the potential ip portfolio sale.
now moving to our balance sheet and cash flow performance. total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $772 million as at november 30, 2021, remaining consistent during the quarter. our net cash position remained at $407 million. again, given our investment in our core software businesses, third quarter free cash flow was negative $21 million, cash used by operations was $19 million, and capital expenditures were $2 million.
that concludes my comments, and i'll now turn it back to john.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, steve. before i move to the q&a, let me summarize the key points for the quarter. we are pleased with how our new organization structure is executing right now. we saw strength in design activities for our qnx business, achieving a record quarter for design-related revenue, and it looks like it will continue. macro supply chain headwinds are still impacting vehicle production, but we see an improvement picture, heading into q4. we made good progress with ivy, including releasing the early access version of the product.
on the cyber side, we again seek the sequential growth in billings and revenue including more head-to-head wins against our key competitors. the ongoing log4shell incident is a great example of the huge cyber market opportunity and also showcase our capabilities. while others are struggling to identify the impact on their products from open source call, we are responding rapidly and effectively. overall, blackberry delivered a solid progress -- we delivered solid progress, beating both revenue and earnings expectations for the quarter.
so charlie, please start the process of q&a.

operator
sure. no problem, sir. and we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question from today will be from daniel chan with td securities. please go ahead.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, dan.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
hi, guys. hi, john. can you provide any color on the cybersecurity arr? it looks like it declined to $358 million from $364 million quarter-on-quarter. just wondering if there's any churn and which products may have been affected and maybe any products are showing outside strength?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, we have a positive surprise with a higher revenue came in more than we expected from secusmart product. so, that has principally drove the numbers that you saw.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
okay. and then, the guidance that you provided for next quarter, what are the puts and takes in that guidance? thank you.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, let me just break it into two pieces, iot versus cyber. in the iot side, touchwood, i think we're all feeling pretty good about it. as i said, we're going to get back to pre-pandemic level. design wins are good. that brings -- we have a good pipeline for professional -- backlog of professional services to help the customers to deploy our technology as well as the developer seat. and as i said earlier, the royalty, we expect to uptick a little bit from q3. so, that kind of composed the math for the guidance between $50 million to $55 million. i feel ok about that. i don't want to jinx it, but looks ok. on the cyber side, it relies on a number of deals that are quite big from the government side from a revenue perspective because of the fact that we expect these to close a little later in the quarter. so, the revenue contribution will not be as big as it is, obviously, in the beginning of the quarter, but the buildings will look fine.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
thanks, john. happy holidays.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
sure, dan.
operator
your next question comes from the line of trip chowdhry with global equities research. please go ahead.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hello. hi.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
hello. thank you. very good execution on the quarter. few things i would be interested is related to ivy platform. you had the early access program almost now for two months. any specific data points you would like to share maybe in terms of download applications of partners, any reaction? and then, i have a follow-up question.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
okay. so yeah, we, of course, release it to the application partners and a handful of oems car manufacturer. the feedback was very positive. as i said earlier, we're going to use that as a basis of our demonstration or -- and our talk at ces at our booth. and we're also going to digitize and stream that -- those sessions. i'll talk a little bit about that later. so, positive response, lots to do, a lot of activities going on. the application, as you know, we have announced a few applications. i hope -- i can't promise every single one of them you will see at our booth, but we have the battery management systems, we have a car, the wallet. we have other rideshare applications. so, i don't know whether every single one of them will make it to our booth, but i expect quite a number of them will.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
and...
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
and you'll also see a cockpit, by the way -- sorry trip. you also will see a cockpit that we collaborate with amazon or aws.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
beautiful. then also, if we look at the new generation ev players and also the old guard of automobile players, there seem to be now getting on the bandwagon of over-the-air updates. i was wondering, does your platform, whether it's ivy or qnx, provide over-the-air updates just out of the box?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. qnx has an option on ota. of course, ivy has got the ota. the physical link is a simple thing, and we do have it. and the more important thing that i talked about earlier about the new aws -- the new amazon release is called fleetwise, allow a logical link between the edge of the car to the cloud. and we're taking advantage of that micro surface. so, yes, we do both -- it's obviously both ways from the cloud to the car and the vice versa. so, from data and cold, we do have ota capabilities already existed.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
all right. good. so looking forward to seeing an announcement [indecipherable].
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
great. thank you, trip. thanks.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of mike walkley with canaccord. please go ahead.
daniel -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
this is actually daniel [phonetic] on for mike. thanks for taking our questions. so yeah, i guess with john giamatteo joining your cybersecurity unit last quarter, just wanted to see how the productivity of your investments in your quota-carrying sales reps are trending in this area of your business? and how should we think about maybe some of the sustained investments as we move into '23?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
good question. john joined us, and the exciting part of that is that john has enormous experience in the cybersecurity market. he ran a $3 billion business as president of cro of mcafee before. and so, he's very relevant, and he brings in a lot of relationship particularly with customers and partners. so, that's very good. and he knows how to make salespeople successful in the cyber world. so, i don't know how to describe productivity, but i could tell you one data point that today we have 10% more quota carrier, or what we call the direct quote carrier. we have 10% more direct quota carrier than a year ago -- or the beginning of the year, sorry, than the beginning of the year. we did the math that way, so. and the productivity we will start seeing that. as a lot of them are new because we recently hired them, we will see those coming in the next few quarters. if you think about a sales cycle, let's say, two to maybe three quarters, call it three, i should be seeing some results in either the second quarter or the third quarter next year.
daniel -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
okay. great. thanks for the details, john. and i yeah, just as a follow-up. so, you noted you saw further pipeline growth within cybersecurity and you also expect sequential billings growth in q4. when should we expect this to start showing up in arr?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
next year, i hope. so, i feel pretty good about mathematically that we're looking for a good arr growth next year.
daniel -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
okay. great. thanks for the details.

paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
within iot, i mean, it seems like you're quite upbeat on the design win-related revenue, like developer seats and professional services. what's the typical gap like in duration between professional services work and when it goes into production? and then also, is there a ratio like for every dollar of professional services and design sort of developer seats to ultimate the royalty revenue that you may see?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
no, there's no -- there's really no direct ratio. it's really -- some oem wants a very aggressive development schedules. so, they use to -- in that case, they will ask us to provide some expertise. and, of course, we -- under the professional service program. and then they will typically buy a higher number of developer seats because they have -- they want to put more engineers on it in parallel. some want to do it a little bit more sequentially.
i would tell you that if you asked our folks that we're seeing the former -- the people are more aggressive, the time line than not because whether you're an autonomous vehicle design or whether you're in the electric vehicle design or the combination of both, competition is heating up in the auto industry, as you all know. so, time to market is important to them, unlike the kind of the old rule of thumb that a new model come out in the last 10 years. and usually, it takes five to seven years to get the new model out from conception to production. i think, those are very much collapsed partly because by players like tesla of the world and a lot of the chinese players. their development cycle and sales cycle are a lot shorter of the manufacturing cycle. so, there isn't really a -- you buy more developer seats and therefore, you have a long, bigger production royalty. i don't think there's a real constant factor or relationship there.
now typically, as i said, we see a developer -- a win and then a developer seat licenses as well as professional service. usually, you add about three years down, you start seeing production. nowadays, i have seen numbers that are a little bit off -- plans, i shouldn't say numbers. plans are a little bit more aggressive than that. but a typical cycle will be three to five years from win to seeing the royalty start growing. and once the royalty starts growing, usually lasts in excess of seven years.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. thank you. that's helpful. just one follow-up question, sales and marketing, i was under the impression that you're planning to ramp it up more significantly, it's been flat this past quarter. how should we think about sales and marketing spending from here?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. sales and marketing will definitely ramp up. i could tell you john giamatteo on cyber side. we don't do as much of marketing in qnx or iot because especially in the auto space and some of the gem vertical, we are already a reasonably known name and known entity. so, we don't need to do as much. on cyber, as you know, we need to do quite a bit, so. and john g is very focused on it. so, you would see that going -- building up and going up quite a bit, in fact.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
and we have no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the call back over to john chen, executive chair and ceo of blackberry for closing remarks.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, charlie. okay. thank you, everybody. and as we mentioned, we're participating at ces in las vegas in january. the focus will be on iot business and how it addresses the benefit from the key trend in edge computing. no doubt, a key highlight will be the demonstration of our ivy technology, including illustrating how ivy use edge computing to create insight for sensor data, both hardware and software-defined sensor. we will be hosting a hybrid in-person and live stream demonstration of the ivy technology followed by an investor q&a session with mattias eriksson, the president of the blackberry iot group, at 8 am. pacific on thursday, january the 6. we'll be releasing more details about this shortly. i'd like to wrap up by wishing all of you -- thank you for joining us and wishing all of you and investors and everyone on the call here happy holidays and a safe and successful new year. thank you very much.

john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
thank you, tim. we have to change the intro of the script now. tim has just made vice president. congratulations.
tim foote -- investor relations
thank you, john.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining the call. let me start today with the iot business unit. i am pleased to report that we recorded the first $50 million-plus quarter since the start of the pandemic, despite the ongoing challenges for the auto industry. revenue for the quarter came in at $52 million, which is 21% sequential increase and 37% year-over-year growth.
gross margin also increased to 85% and iot arr increased for the fourth consecutive quarter to $93 million, which is up 11% year over year. in addition to seeing a modest increase in production-based royalty, we set another new record for quarterly revenue from design activities. these revenues come from development seats and professional services used by the customers to design our qnx software into vehicles and other iot end points. this change not only delivered near-term revenue, but also points to long-term business volume once the design enters into production.
in addition, we have a good line of sight to upcoming professional services backlog from confirmed design wins and are hiring additional heads to meet the demand. we also have good visibility into the pipeline for potential new design wins in fy '23. in terms of royalty, as i said earlier, we saw some improvement in volume this quarter. however, the challenges for production remain.
major oems have indicated continuous supply chain headwinds, particular chip shortages, although they expected the situation to largely improve as the year progresses. the conflict in ukraine has added a further disruption to an already challenging environment for the auto industry, and we will continue to monitor that impact. you may recall that over the last few years, we have seen a significant increase in the proportion of the qnx business from safety critical foundation software, such as adas, advanced driver assist, digital cockpits, and autonomous drive. this now constitute the largest part of the total business overtaking infotainment.
this strategy to focus on functional safety plays to qnx's strength and is validated by both the market trends toward ecu consolidation, as well as software-defined vehicle. we also see significant growth in safety critical design opportunities in our pipeline. gross margin in the quarter improved from 81% to 85%. this is largely driven by the improvement in production royalties.
royalties are due when the vehicle is shipped and there is a little cost for us at this stage of the design life cycle, meaning they have a high gross margin. let me now turn to the new design wins we secured in the quarter. this was a record quarter in terms of the number of new design wins. we recorded 17, 1-7.
17 new auto designs and 28 wins in the general embedded market. adas registered the most wins in the quarter, followed by digital cockpits and instrument customers. once again, we won business with leading automakers and tier one suppliers, including hyundai, nio, bosch, vizion, denso. and this is a special for tim, skyships, for the new gordon murry t50 hypercar.
i just read it. i see the picture of that, i should say. tim showed me the picture.
tim foote -- investor relations
it was a good picture.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
he was quite impressed with that. in gem, we recorded wins in multiple verticals, including defense and aerospace, industry -- industrial that is, as well as medical, our strongest gem segment. like in auto, we have the highest level of functional safety certification for medical, and we're seeing increased momentum there. design wins this quarter includes analytic devices for use in medical labs, as well as for surgical robots.
let me now turn to ivy. at ces in january, we demonstrated a product running with live data on auto-grade hardware. this demonstration formed the basis of many constructive meetings with oem, and as a result, we have multiple additional requests to start proof-of-concept, or we call it poc trials. we currently have more requests than we can handle, which is a nice problem to have.
the first poc is with a chinese ev automaker, electric vehicle, pateo, a leading chinese tier one supplier. the plan is to integrate ivy into the digital cockpit. the expectation is for successful pocs to lead to design wins, i.e. a commitment from customers to design ivy into vehicles.
the ces demonstration also allow us to showcase two of our many potential applications as ivy can enable. cariq in-vehicle payment and electra's ai-driven battery management application were both very well received by oems and are included in the ivy pocs. ivy product development remains on track. and last month, we released the latest version of the product that is poc-ready.
let me now move to the cybersecurity side of the business. this was the third consecutive quarter of sequential billings growth. billings not only grew double digits versus q3, but they also increased year over year. cyber revenue was $122 million, gross margin improved by 200 basis points to 61%, arr was $347 million, and dollar-based net retention was 91%.
market conditions for our cyber and security products are positive. this is in part because of the ongoing heightened level of cyber threats. our guard-managed xtl cybersecurity team, in line with other leaders in the space, has seen a significant increase in threats in recent weeks. in particular, wiper malware that aims to take the victims service offline is at an unprecedented level.
some of the most prominent example of this currently identified across the industry, including the hermeticwiper that has been seen in the cyber-attac in ukraine, latvia and elsewhere. logs have shown that our product -- our protect product, protect epp, has been blocking this malware at blackberry's customers' sites before it could execute. the same is also true for whispergate, another leading example of the wiper malware that has targeted ukrainian government, as well as ukrainian nonprofit and it organizations. in fiscal year '22, we released 48 new products.
among the cybersecurity products, pipeline growth is strongest for the following three: gateway zero trust network assets or ztna, guard-managed service and persona behavioral analytics. on the marketing front, we're going to leverage the strength of the cylance brand for our cylance products. the brand still resonated strongly with customer and across the industry. investors have said that hearing how our cyber products are competing -- how in the field is helpful.
so let me provide you with a couple of recent wins -- recent examples of wins. the first is with a leading publicly traded medical supplies conglomerate based in the united states. the customer, like many others, was struggling to serve a 24/7 security operations centers and held a competitive tender process between blackberry, crowdstrike and arctic wolf. they bought more than 10,000 license of our guard-managed service due to blackberry performance and security credentials.
the second is with a leading manufacturer based in asia that selected blackberry over crowdstrike's, fortinet and carbon black. following a detailed poc, they selected blackberry because of our product's strong performance, uncovering multiple threats during the trial. legacy signature-based vendors still account for a significant portion of the overall market, especially with smb customers. this was always an area of focus for cylance.
an example of the recent wins there was with logistic company that held a bake-off to replace their current mcafee and microsoft defender solution. after a vigorous assessment that included mcafee, symantec and crowdstrike, they bought approximately 2,000 -- three-year license for our guard advance product because we detected a number of threats that other didn't and, as well as providing a higher level of customer services. let me also provide you with an update on talent acquisition. building on the progress we made last year in ramping the sales force, we have been successful in adding further industry experience to the cybersecurity expertise we already have at blackberry.
this quarter, we not only recruited sales leaders from direct rivals, but product development leaders also. cyber is a hot market for talent right now. so we're really pleased of our ability to attract and retain high-quality people. as stated earlier, arr came in at $347 million.
this is a decrease of $11 million compared to a prior quarter and was driven by two key factors. the first factor was that in january, we ceased operation for legacy blackberry mobile devices. this move allows us to save significant infrastructure costs going forward. however, revenue for the enhancing sim-based licensing or we call esbl, are also ended as a result.
the second factor impacting arr was the churn in smaller uem customers. recently, we have seen a trend toward some less feature rich uem products being sold by some of our competitors as part of the bundles or enterprise license agreement. blackberry uem on the other hand is a premium product that offers a very high level of security. we've seen some smaller, more price-sensitive customers chose to use the ""free"" uem product that's come with a bundle to save incremental costs at the expense of security.
however, these customers represent a relatively small portion of our uem base. it is also important to note that our leading security profile continues to resonate strongly with our large core customer base of the largest bank and government agencies. to reinforce this point, this quarter, we secured uem renewal with the u.s. air force, the u.s.
department of defense, the u.s. national grid, as well as a number of international governments including poland ministry of foreign affairs, northern ireland department of finance and personnel, along with swedish and italian governments, just to name a few. among the major bank this quarter, we renewed with deutsche bank, along with well-known american, canadian and indian banks, two major swiss banks, including the swiss national bank and a global credit card company. we also recently renewed for three years with global law firm, white & case.
as a law firm, they handle confidential data on the continuous basis, and they felt that none of our competitors met their security needs better than blackberry. during the quarter, we also successfully upsold cylance cybersecurity product to this and other uem customers. it is likely that we will continue to see some headwinds for uem in the near term, but we are taking steps to minimize that impact. this includes looking at ways to bundle blackberry uem with other partners' products that appeal to the mid-market, as well as continue to develop new features that our customers valued.
stay tuned for future updates on this. before i wrap up my comments on cybersecurity, i'd like to share that going forward we will start to provide quarterly billings information for our cyber business as part of our ongoing reporting. we believe that this will be well received by shareholders and help them more clearly see the progress that the business will be making. moving on to licensing.
on january 31st, this year, we announced that we entered into an agreement for the sale of the legacy portion of our patent portfolio. the sales price is $600 million with $450 million being due at the close and the remaining $150 million due in installments. i'm pleased to report that the transaction has successfully cleared a regulatory review stage, having received approval from the canadian government investment review division, on march 22, as well as the u.s. hsr approval, the antitrust approval that is, shortly before that.
completion of the remaining closing condition including financing is targeted for the end of this quarter. following the sale of the legacy portion of the ip portfolio, we will still retain all patents related to our core iot and cyber software businesses. we will, of course, keep the door open for future monetization, but revenue is likely to be minimal in the near term. upon the closure of the deal, we expect a reduction in the operating costs required to maintain our ip portfolio.
also, our cash position will be strengthened, enabling us to further invest for growth in our core markets, i.e., the qnx, ivy as well as cyber. we will invest both, organically and inorganically. in the quarter, licensing revenue was $11 million, beating expectation. gross margin came in at 55%.
i'd like -- i'll now hand over to steve to provide additional color on the financials. steve?
steve rai -- chief financial officer
thank you, john. as usual, my comments on our financial performance this past quarter will be in non-gaap terms, unless otherwise noted. and also, please refer to the supplemental table in the press release for the gaap and non-gaap details. total company revenue for the quarter was $185 million.
fourth quarter total company gross margin was 68%. our non-gaap gross margin excludes stock compensation expense of $1 million. fourth quarter operating expenses were $117 million. our non-gaap operating expenses exclude $22 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, $4 million in stock compensation expense, a $165 million fair value gain on the convertible debentures.
as john mentioned, we are continuing to invest in our core iot and cyber businesses, including headcount growth and new product development to drive top line growth. the planned investment is sizable. we expect to increase headcount by approximately 250 people across both of our core business units this fiscal year. this quarter, non-gaap operating profit was $8 million and non-gaap net profit was $6 million.
our basic gaap earnings per share was $0.25, while non-gaap earnings per share was $0.01 in the quarter. our adjusted ebitda was positive $20 million excluding the non-gaap adjustments previously mentioned. i will now provide a breakdown of our revenue in the quarter. cybersecurity revenue was $122 million, and iot revenue was $52 million.
software product revenue remained in the range of 80% to 85% of the total, with professional services making up the balance. the recurring portion of software product revenue remained at approximately 80%. licensing and other revenue was $11 million, given the ongoing limitations to monetization activity, prior to closing the sale of the transaction that john referred to. i'll now move to our balance and cash flow performance.
total cash, cash equivalents and investments remained consistent at $770 million as at february 28, 2022. our net cash position remained at $405 million. despite the ongoing investment in the business, we generated positive free cash flow of $8 million. cash generated from operations was $10 million and capital expenditures were $2 million.
that concludes my comments, and i'll now turn the call back to john.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
thank you, steve. let me provide the outlook for the new fiscal year. licensing revenue is expected to be minimal, excluding anything related to the patent sale. for the cyber business, we expect to deliver billings growth between 8% to 12% this fiscal year, mainly as a result of increased traction from our security products.
in fact, we expect to see higher billings in all four quarters when compared to the same quarter in the prior year. however, we model revenue for the year in total to be broadly flat year-over-year, factoring in the time for billings growth to convert to revenue. despite having delivered three consecutive quarters of billings growth of cyber, we're not satisfied with our results, particularly in arr. we feel, however, positive about the trajectory of this business for a number of reasons.
first is the cyber market is strong and demand appears to get stronger. second, following our recent product enhancement, the performance of our product is being recognized. a good proxy for this is winning awards in independent testing, example, including receiving the maximum aaa rating in the se lab's recent enterprise advanced security test. third is that we have increased the number of sales reps since the start of our fiscal year, and we'll continue to step up and expand hiring.
our plan is to recruit more than 100 additional cyber go-to-market professionals in the coming fiscal year. fourth, we continue to record head-to-head wins against our competitors. now, switch to the iot business. for the iot business, we expect to see continued strong growth despite the ongoing headwind for the auto industry.
we expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million, representing a 12% to 18% growth year over year. despite the macro environment for the auto industry, we based our confidence on the following factors. first, the visibility of the backlog of professional services from design wins already awarded. second, the strong pipeline of potential new design wins this coming year.
and thirdly, the upward trend in the royalty asp in the new designs. we see a fairly even distribution of revenue across the four quarters. before we move to q&a, let me quickly summarize the key points for the quarter. the iot business is executing well despite industry-level challenges, and we're encouraged by the line of sight we have for the years to come.
ivy continues to execute well with both, a new product release and strong demand for poc trials in the quarter. our cybersecurity business is tracking in the right direction, once again, delivering solid building growth and recording some encouraged head-to-head wins. and the sale of our noncore ip patent portfolio is progressing. despite our ongoing investment in the business, we generated positive operating cash flow and net profit this quarter.
that concludes my remarks. brent, could you please open the line for q&a?

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of daniel chan with td securities. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
hi, dan.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
hey, john. another strong quarter of strong general embedded wins. it's been a few quarters now where you've seen more general embedded wins than auto. what is -- how does the lifetime revenue stream look for some of these programs with respect to production royalties versus designs? because i assume that some of these new wins in general embedded have lower volumes than what you typically see in an auto space.
so can you just remind us how the revenue streams are structured for the general embedded space?
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
yes. you're talking about general embedded or you're talking about auto?
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
gem, general embedded.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
generally embedded. generally embedded, you see the production being a lot sooner on average, probably a couple of years out versus six or seven, or five or six years. and typically, not as big in terms of dollar on the asp, or it is a big organization like a hospital or medical devices, then the volume isn't as big as the car industry. but it's still very, very healthy.
now, general embedded vertical, i think we -- i mentioned medical, that's a really good field. we're winning a lot. we have good momentum in there and because of the safety certification. there are other general embedded markets that are really not as economically exciting.
that's a fair way to say. so we use -- we tend to stay away from those.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks. and then, on the headcount increase, i think you mentioned you guys are budgeting for an increase of 250 people this year. just wondering where that's going.
i think you mentioned 100 going toward cybersecurity sales professionals, where are the rest going?
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
to iot. the iot, a lot of them -- i mean, of course, the sales personnel, but also, we have a lot of backlog in professional services. so we need to fulfill those backlogs and get the revenue.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
your next question comes from trip chowdhry with global equity research. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
hi, trip. hello, trip.
trip chowdhry -- global equity research -- analyst
hi, john. another very strong quarter on cylance. a very quick question. i was wondering, like if you could put some more color to it.
like what kind of activity was, say, before the ukraine war and while we are in the war, you're getting a lot of interest in cylance. where is that interest coming from? is it from u.s.-based companies or european-based companies or the whole world? just provide us some anecdotal comments what you are hearing? i would appreciate that. and again, a very good quarter.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
thank you. so the cybersecurity world is -- there are a lot of more threats and attack. and we see demand growing -- raw demand growing. like everybody else in the market have seen, the raw demand is really going very fast.
there are also a replacement market for the older generation signature-based companies like mcafee and symantec and microsoft. so you can see the second generation, the ai/ml-based companies, like ourselves and some of the names, key names in the industry. we could do a lot of -- a good success rate in replacing legacy implementation. so that's the second one.
cylance is particularly strong in the mid-market, small, medium business mid-market. and i think we're seeing our activity picked up quite nicely, partly because of the guard software that we released, probably by now, it's about a year. and so, we could see that trend up continuously every quarter. and so, the number is starting to become meaningful.
so those are probably the drivers of what is happening. and then, last but not least, remember, we've been hiring aggressively for over a year now in the sales headcount. and so, it's starting to pay off in some area. and last but not least, we've been able to attract some very strong industry talent from the cyber world.
and particularly under john giamatteo because he came from mcafee and so he knows how to recruit a lot of these people. and not only individuals, but also channel partners. so things are starting to come together. still have ways to go but starting to come together.
trip chowdhry -- global equity research -- analyst
i just have one observation, which is -- i just wanted to share with you. ivy platform, providing machine learning, ai-driven battery management system, none of that system, which is ai-driven for bms, battery management system exist anywhere, not even the biggest ev manufacturer has that. i think this is very unique to your ivy platform. keep it up.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
ok. thank you. thank you much.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from paul treiber with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
hi, paul.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, john. thanks very much and good afternoon. just a question on go-to-market strategy in cyber. and it's just -- you mentioned uem is obviously strong in large enterprise, but then cylance is strong in smb.
how do you bridge those two businesses from a go-to-market perspective, because the customer base is -- your competitive advantages within each seem quite divergent?
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
that's a great question. so we now have three go-to-market teams that is coordinated under -- by region under one senior management, and so -- because of john g. and so, the three market -- go-to-market team are the -- think about it, strategic accounts, which are the large government, as well as banks, regulated industry, the smb market and the channel team. so our objective of the first team is to secure our base business in the strategic accounts and then upsell them into -- with technology that could apply to that uem base, for example, zero trust technology, which is -- the gateway is probably the most talk about right now, particularly the u.s.
government. the new biden administration budget has specific money allocated for zero trust, and they want every agency and every armed forces to do that, to be able to implement zero trust as part of the overall cybersecurity protection. so we have that business, and we're already in many of those institutions. so the upsell of cylance product into that space is a key of growth.
the second, smb, two approaches. one approach is through the guard services, the managed service, which smb typically needs that kind of help for either augment their resources or replace their resources because they can't hire fast enough. and so, that left with the cylance product, and then we upsell uem into it as more bundled oriented. and then, of course, the channel, typically all cyber.
and there's some good channel partners that's going to come online. i'm not at liberty to talk about it right now, but in 90 days, i will. i will. so that's the kind of how we go in with each different type of category of customers.
i hope that answered your question.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes. that was helpful. and i can't wait for the announcement in 90 days. just a second question, just on the sale of the patent portfolio.
to the extent that you can, can you just walk through some of the assumptions in terms of like the longer-term outlook that went into that arriving at that price? because one of the things that investors look at as you look at the revenue in that segment, in the previous year, it was quite a large number. how do we put the sale price in context to the previous revenue that you generated in that segment?
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
oh, ok. so i would say, there's still a lot of potential for this noncore set of patents. but two things obviously you know. one is, time is ticking down in the validity of the portfolio.
although we have a very young -- we typically have, even with the noncore, somewhere around eight to 10 years type average lifetime with the patent still remaining. but the -- if you notice that -- which you pointed out, the last couple of years -- or the last few years, we have some good success. but those are with very big names. and so, now, we need to go -- the business needs to go cultivate pipeline for the smaller name, which typically takes a little longer time, a lot more back and forth.
big name does too, but big names have big numbers. so in a way that the low-hanging fruit, we already approached. and so, i think the numbers we have done in market test the numbers, we think it's very fair to both sides.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks for that explanation.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
there are no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the call back over to john chen, executive chair and ceo of blackberry for closing remarks.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
thank you. i'm pleased to announce that -- by the way, i'm pleased to announce that on may 18, we'll be hosting a hybrid in-person and virtual analyst day from san ramon, california. and some of the questions asked earlier regarding our go-to-market will be addressed by john giamatteo and mattias eriksson, the two bu presidents. and i will strongly suggest you don't miss it.
in the case of mattias, we're also going to prepare to annually talk about backlog that will be during that call -- that meeting also. so i really encourage investors to join us and hear about key developments of our product and strategy, as well as financial focused sessions that will provide additional color on the iot and cyber business. more detail will be -- will follow in due course, so please stay tuned. thank you for joining the call today, everyone, and have a good evening.
i hope to see you in person soon.

john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
thank you, tim. we have to change the intro of the script now. tim has just made vice president. congratulations.
tim foote -- investor relations
thank you, john.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining the call. let me start today with the iot business unit. i am pleased to report that we recorded the first $50 million-plus quarter since the start of the pandemic, despite the ongoing challenges for the auto industry. revenue for the quarter came in at $52 million, which is 21% sequential increase and 37% year-over-year growth.
gross margin also increased to 85% and iot arr increased for the fourth consecutive quarter to $93 million, which is up 11% year over year. in addition to seeing a modest increase in production-based royalty, we set another new record for quarterly revenue from design activities. these revenues come from development seats and professional services used by the customers to design our qnx software into vehicles and other iot end points. this change not only delivered near-term revenue, but also points to long-term business volume once the design enters into production.
in addition, we have a good line of sight to upcoming professional services backlog from confirmed design wins and are hiring additional heads to meet the demand. we also have good visibility into the pipeline for potential new design wins in fy '23. in terms of royalty, as i said earlier, we saw some improvement in volume this quarter. however, the challenges for production remain.
major oems have indicated continuous supply chain headwinds, particular chip shortages, although they expected the situation to largely improve as the year progresses. the conflict in ukraine has added a further disruption to an already challenging environment for the auto industry, and we will continue to monitor that impact. you may recall that over the last few years, we have seen a significant increase in the proportion of the qnx business from safety critical foundation software, such as adas, advanced driver assist, digital cockpits, and autonomous drive. this now constitute the largest part of the total business overtaking infotainment.
this strategy to focus on functional safety plays to qnx's strength and is validated by both the market trends toward ecu consolidation, as well as software-defined vehicle. we also see significant growth in safety critical design opportunities in our pipeline. gross margin in the quarter improved from 81% to 85%. this is largely driven by the improvement in production royalties.
royalties are due when the vehicle is shipped and there is a little cost for us at this stage of the design life cycle, meaning they have a high gross margin. let me now turn to the new design wins we secured in the quarter. this was a record quarter in terms of the number of new design wins. we recorded 17, 1-7.
17 new auto designs and 28 wins in the general embedded market. adas registered the most wins in the quarter, followed by digital cockpits and instrument customers. once again, we won business with leading automakers and tier one suppliers, including hyundai, nio, bosch, vizion, denso. and this is a special for tim, skyships, for the new gordon murry t50 hypercar.
i just read it. i see the picture of that, i should say. tim showed me the picture.
tim foote -- investor relations
it was a good picture.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
he was quite impressed with that. in gem, we recorded wins in multiple verticals, including defense and aerospace, industry -- industrial that is, as well as medical, our strongest gem segment. like in auto, we have the highest level of functional safety certification for medical, and we're seeing increased momentum there. design wins this quarter includes analytic devices for use in medical labs, as well as for surgical robots.
let me now turn to ivy. at ces in january, we demonstrated a product running with live data on auto-grade hardware. this demonstration formed the basis of many constructive meetings with oem, and as a result, we have multiple additional requests to start proof-of-concept, or we call it poc trials. we currently have more requests than we can handle, which is a nice problem to have.
the first poc is with a chinese ev automaker, electric vehicle, pateo, a leading chinese tier one supplier. the plan is to integrate ivy into the digital cockpit. the expectation is for successful pocs to lead to design wins, i.e. a commitment from customers to design ivy into vehicles.
the ces demonstration also allow us to showcase two of our many potential applications as ivy can enable. cariq in-vehicle payment and electra's ai-driven battery management application were both very well received by oems and are included in the ivy pocs. ivy product development remains on track. and last month, we released the latest version of the product that is poc-ready.
let me now move to the cybersecurity side of the business. this was the third consecutive quarter of sequential billings growth. billings not only grew double digits versus q3, but they also increased year over year. cyber revenue was $122 million, gross margin improved by 200 basis points to 61%, arr was $347 million, and dollar-based net retention was 91%.
market conditions for our cyber and security products are positive. this is in part because of the ongoing heightened level of cyber threats. our guard-managed xtl cybersecurity team, in line with other leaders in the space, has seen a significant increase in threats in recent weeks. in particular, wiper malware that aims to take the victims service offline is at an unprecedented level.
some of the most prominent example of this currently identified across the industry, including the hermeticwiper that has been seen in the cyber-attac in ukraine, latvia and elsewhere. logs have shown that our product -- our protect product, protect epp, has been blocking this malware at blackberry's customers' sites before it could execute. the same is also true for whispergate, another leading example of the wiper malware that has targeted ukrainian government, as well as ukrainian nonprofit and it organizations. in fiscal year '22, we released 48 new products.
among the cybersecurity products, pipeline growth is strongest for the following three: gateway zero trust network assets or ztna, guard-managed service and persona behavioral analytics. on the marketing front, we're going to leverage the strength of the cylance brand for our cylance products. the brand still resonated strongly with customer and across the industry. investors have said that hearing how our cyber products are competing -- how in the field is helpful.
so let me provide you with a couple of recent wins -- recent examples of wins. the first is with a leading publicly traded medical supplies conglomerate based in the united states. the customer, like many others, was struggling to serve a 24/7 security operations centers and held a competitive tender process between blackberry, crowdstrike and arctic wolf. they bought more than 10,000 license of our guard-managed service due to blackberry performance and security credentials.
the second is with a leading manufacturer based in asia that selected blackberry over crowdstrike's, fortinet and carbon black. following a detailed poc, they selected blackberry because of our product's strong performance, uncovering multiple threats during the trial. legacy signature-based vendors still account for a significant portion of the overall market, especially with smb customers. this was always an area of focus for cylance.
an example of the recent wins there was with logistic company that held a bake-off to replace their current mcafee and microsoft defender solution. after a vigorous assessment that included mcafee, symantec and crowdstrike, they bought approximately 2,000 -- three-year license for our guard advance product because we detected a number of threats that other didn't and, as well as providing a higher level of customer services. let me also provide you with an update on talent acquisition. building on the progress we made last year in ramping the sales force, we have been successful in adding further industry experience to the cybersecurity expertise we already have at blackberry.
this quarter, we not only recruited sales leaders from direct rivals, but product development leaders also. cyber is a hot market for talent right now. so we're really pleased of our ability to attract and retain high-quality people. as stated earlier, arr came in at $347 million.
this is a decrease of $11 million compared to a prior quarter and was driven by two key factors. the first factor was that in january, we ceased operation for legacy blackberry mobile devices. this move allows us to save significant infrastructure costs going forward. however, revenue for the enhancing sim-based licensing or we call esbl, are also ended as a result.
the second factor impacting arr was the churn in smaller uem customers. recently, we have seen a trend toward some less feature rich uem products being sold by some of our competitors as part of the bundles or enterprise license agreement. blackberry uem on the other hand is a premium product that offers a very high level of security. we've seen some smaller, more price-sensitive customers chose to use the ""free"" uem product that's come with a bundle to save incremental costs at the expense of security.
however, these customers represent a relatively small portion of our uem base. it is also important to note that our leading security profile continues to resonate strongly with our large core customer base of the largest bank and government agencies. to reinforce this point, this quarter, we secured uem renewal with the u.s. air force, the u.s.
department of defense, the u.s. national grid, as well as a number of international governments including poland ministry of foreign affairs, northern ireland department of finance and personnel, along with swedish and italian governments, just to name a few. among the major bank this quarter, we renewed with deutsche bank, along with well-known american, canadian and indian banks, two major swiss banks, including the swiss national bank and a global credit card company. we also recently renewed for three years with global law firm, white & case.
as a law firm, they handle confidential data on the continuous basis, and they felt that none of our competitors met their security needs better than blackberry. during the quarter, we also successfully upsold cylance cybersecurity product to this and other uem customers. it is likely that we will continue to see some headwinds for uem in the near term, but we are taking steps to minimize that impact. this includes looking at ways to bundle blackberry uem with other partners' products that appeal to the mid-market, as well as continue to develop new features that our customers valued.
stay tuned for future updates on this. before i wrap up my comments on cybersecurity, i'd like to share that going forward we will start to provide quarterly billings information for our cyber business as part of our ongoing reporting. we believe that this will be well received by shareholders and help them more clearly see the progress that the business will be making. moving on to licensing.
on january 31st, this year, we announced that we entered into an agreement for the sale of the legacy portion of our patent portfolio. the sales price is $600 million with $450 million being due at the close and the remaining $150 million due in installments. i'm pleased to report that the transaction has successfully cleared a regulatory review stage, having received approval from the canadian government investment review division, on march 22, as well as the u.s. hsr approval, the antitrust approval that is, shortly before that.
completion of the remaining closing condition including financing is targeted for the end of this quarter. following the sale of the legacy portion of the ip portfolio, we will still retain all patents related to our core iot and cyber software businesses. we will, of course, keep the door open for future monetization, but revenue is likely to be minimal in the near term. upon the closure of the deal, we expect a reduction in the operating costs required to maintain our ip portfolio.
also, our cash position will be strengthened, enabling us to further invest for growth in our core markets, i.e., the qnx, ivy as well as cyber. we will invest both, organically and inorganically. in the quarter, licensing revenue was $11 million, beating expectation. gross margin came in at 55%.
i'd like -- i'll now hand over to steve to provide additional color on the financials. steve?
steve rai -- chief financial officer
thank you, john. as usual, my comments on our financial performance this past quarter will be in non-gaap terms, unless otherwise noted. and also, please refer to the supplemental table in the press release for the gaap and non-gaap details. total company revenue for the quarter was $185 million.
fourth quarter total company gross margin was 68%. our non-gaap gross margin excludes stock compensation expense of $1 million. fourth quarter operating expenses were $117 million. our non-gaap operating expenses exclude $22 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, $4 million in stock compensation expense, a $165 million fair value gain on the convertible debentures.
as john mentioned, we are continuing to invest in our core iot and cyber businesses, including headcount growth and new product development to drive top line growth. the planned investment is sizable. we expect to increase headcount by approximately 250 people across both of our core business units this fiscal year. this quarter, non-gaap operating profit was $8 million and non-gaap net profit was $6 million.
our basic gaap earnings per share was $0.25, while non-gaap earnings per share was $0.01 in the quarter. our adjusted ebitda was positive $20 million excluding the non-gaap adjustments previously mentioned. i will now provide a breakdown of our revenue in the quarter. cybersecurity revenue was $122 million, and iot revenue was $52 million.
software product revenue remained in the range of 80% to 85% of the total, with professional services making up the balance. the recurring portion of software product revenue remained at approximately 80%. licensing and other revenue was $11 million, given the ongoing limitations to monetization activity, prior to closing the sale of the transaction that john referred to. i'll now move to our balance and cash flow performance.
total cash, cash equivalents and investments remained consistent at $770 million as at february 28, 2022. our net cash position remained at $405 million. despite the ongoing investment in the business, we generated positive free cash flow of $8 million. cash generated from operations was $10 million and capital expenditures were $2 million.
that concludes my comments, and i'll now turn the call back to john.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
thank you, steve. let me provide the outlook for the new fiscal year. licensing revenue is expected to be minimal, excluding anything related to the patent sale. for the cyber business, we expect to deliver billings growth between 8% to 12% this fiscal year, mainly as a result of increased traction from our security products.
in fact, we expect to see higher billings in all four quarters when compared to the same quarter in the prior year. however, we model revenue for the year in total to be broadly flat year-over-year, factoring in the time for billings growth to convert to revenue. despite having delivered three consecutive quarters of billings growth of cyber, we're not satisfied with our results, particularly in arr. we feel, however, positive about the trajectory of this business for a number of reasons.
first is the cyber market is strong and demand appears to get stronger. second, following our recent product enhancement, the performance of our product is being recognized. a good proxy for this is winning awards in independent testing, example, including receiving the maximum aaa rating in the se lab's recent enterprise advanced security test. third is that we have increased the number of sales reps since the start of our fiscal year, and we'll continue to step up and expand hiring.
our plan is to recruit more than 100 additional cyber go-to-market professionals in the coming fiscal year. fourth, we continue to record head-to-head wins against our competitors. now, switch to the iot business. for the iot business, we expect to see continued strong growth despite the ongoing headwind for the auto industry.
we expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million, representing a 12% to 18% growth year over year. despite the macro environment for the auto industry, we based our confidence on the following factors. first, the visibility of the backlog of professional services from design wins already awarded. second, the strong pipeline of potential new design wins this coming year.
and thirdly, the upward trend in the royalty asp in the new designs. we see a fairly even distribution of revenue across the four quarters. before we move to q&a, let me quickly summarize the key points for the quarter. the iot business is executing well despite industry-level challenges, and we're encouraged by the line of sight we have for the years to come.
ivy continues to execute well with both, a new product release and strong demand for poc trials in the quarter. our cybersecurity business is tracking in the right direction, once again, delivering solid building growth and recording some encouraged head-to-head wins. and the sale of our noncore ip patent portfolio is progressing. despite our ongoing investment in the business, we generated positive operating cash flow and net profit this quarter.
that concludes my remarks. brent, could you please open the line for q&a?

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of daniel chan with td securities. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
hi, dan.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
hey, john. another strong quarter of strong general embedded wins. it's been a few quarters now where you've seen more general embedded wins than auto. what is -- how does the lifetime revenue stream look for some of these programs with respect to production royalties versus designs? because i assume that some of these new wins in general embedded have lower volumes than what you typically see in an auto space.
so can you just remind us how the revenue streams are structured for the general embedded space?
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
yes. you're talking about general embedded or you're talking about auto?
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
gem, general embedded.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
generally embedded. generally embedded, you see the production being a lot sooner on average, probably a couple of years out versus six or seven, or five or six years. and typically, not as big in terms of dollar on the asp, or it is a big organization like a hospital or medical devices, then the volume isn't as big as the car industry. but it's still very, very healthy.
now, general embedded vertical, i think we -- i mentioned medical, that's a really good field. we're winning a lot. we have good momentum in there and because of the safety certification. there are other general embedded markets that are really not as economically exciting.
that's a fair way to say. so we use -- we tend to stay away from those.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks. and then, on the headcount increase, i think you mentioned you guys are budgeting for an increase of 250 people this year. just wondering where that's going.
i think you mentioned 100 going toward cybersecurity sales professionals, where are the rest going?
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
to iot. the iot, a lot of them -- i mean, of course, the sales personnel, but also, we have a lot of backlog in professional services. so we need to fulfill those backlogs and get the revenue.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
your next question comes from trip chowdhry with global equity research. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
hi, trip. hello, trip.
trip chowdhry -- global equity research -- analyst
hi, john. another very strong quarter on cylance. a very quick question. i was wondering, like if you could put some more color to it.
like what kind of activity was, say, before the ukraine war and while we are in the war, you're getting a lot of interest in cylance. where is that interest coming from? is it from u.s.-based companies or european-based companies or the whole world? just provide us some anecdotal comments what you are hearing? i would appreciate that. and again, a very good quarter.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
thank you. so the cybersecurity world is -- there are a lot of more threats and attack. and we see demand growing -- raw demand growing. like everybody else in the market have seen, the raw demand is really going very fast.
there are also a replacement market for the older generation signature-based companies like mcafee and symantec and microsoft. so you can see the second generation, the ai/ml-based companies, like ourselves and some of the names, key names in the industry. we could do a lot of -- a good success rate in replacing legacy implementation. so that's the second one.
cylance is particularly strong in the mid-market, small, medium business mid-market. and i think we're seeing our activity picked up quite nicely, partly because of the guard software that we released, probably by now, it's about a year. and so, we could see that trend up continuously every quarter. and so, the number is starting to become meaningful.
so those are probably the drivers of what is happening. and then, last but not least, remember, we've been hiring aggressively for over a year now in the sales headcount. and so, it's starting to pay off in some area. and last but not least, we've been able to attract some very strong industry talent from the cyber world.
and particularly under john giamatteo because he came from mcafee and so he knows how to recruit a lot of these people. and not only individuals, but also channel partners. so things are starting to come together. still have ways to go but starting to come together.
trip chowdhry -- global equity research -- analyst
i just have one observation, which is -- i just wanted to share with you. ivy platform, providing machine learning, ai-driven battery management system, none of that system, which is ai-driven for bms, battery management system exist anywhere, not even the biggest ev manufacturer has that. i think this is very unique to your ivy platform. keep it up.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
ok. thank you. thank you much.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from paul treiber with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
hi, paul.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hey, john. thanks very much and good afternoon. just a question on go-to-market strategy in cyber. and it's just -- you mentioned uem is obviously strong in large enterprise, but then cylance is strong in smb.
how do you bridge those two businesses from a go-to-market perspective, because the customer base is -- your competitive advantages within each seem quite divergent?
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
that's a great question. so we now have three go-to-market teams that is coordinated under -- by region under one senior management, and so -- because of john g. and so, the three market -- go-to-market team are the -- think about it, strategic accounts, which are the large government, as well as banks, regulated industry, the smb market and the channel team. so our objective of the first team is to secure our base business in the strategic accounts and then upsell them into -- with technology that could apply to that uem base, for example, zero trust technology, which is -- the gateway is probably the most talk about right now, particularly the u.s.
government. the new biden administration budget has specific money allocated for zero trust, and they want every agency and every armed forces to do that, to be able to implement zero trust as part of the overall cybersecurity protection. so we have that business, and we're already in many of those institutions. so the upsell of cylance product into that space is a key of growth.
the second, smb, two approaches. one approach is through the guard services, the managed service, which smb typically needs that kind of help for either augment their resources or replace their resources because they can't hire fast enough. and so, that left with the cylance product, and then we upsell uem into it as more bundled oriented. and then, of course, the channel, typically all cyber.
and there's some good channel partners that's going to come online. i'm not at liberty to talk about it right now, but in 90 days, i will. i will. so that's the kind of how we go in with each different type of category of customers.
i hope that answered your question.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes. that was helpful. and i can't wait for the announcement in 90 days. just a second question, just on the sale of the patent portfolio.
to the extent that you can, can you just walk through some of the assumptions in terms of like the longer-term outlook that went into that arriving at that price? because one of the things that investors look at as you look at the revenue in that segment, in the previous year, it was quite a large number. how do we put the sale price in context to the previous revenue that you generated in that segment?
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
oh, ok. so i would say, there's still a lot of potential for this noncore set of patents. but two things obviously you know. one is, time is ticking down in the validity of the portfolio.
although we have a very young -- we typically have, even with the noncore, somewhere around eight to 10 years type average lifetime with the patent still remaining. but the -- if you notice that -- which you pointed out, the last couple of years -- or the last few years, we have some good success. but those are with very big names. and so, now, we need to go -- the business needs to go cultivate pipeline for the smaller name, which typically takes a little longer time, a lot more back and forth.
big name does too, but big names have big numbers. so in a way that the low-hanging fruit, we already approached. and so, i think the numbers we have done in market test the numbers, we think it's very fair to both sides.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks for that explanation.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
there are no further questions at this time. i would like to turn the call back over to john chen, executive chair and ceo of blackberry for closing remarks.
john chen -- executive chair and chief executive officer
thank you. i'm pleased to announce that -- by the way, i'm pleased to announce that on may 18, we'll be hosting a hybrid in-person and virtual analyst day from san ramon, california. and some of the questions asked earlier regarding our go-to-market will be addressed by john giamatteo and mattias eriksson, the two bu presidents. and i will strongly suggest you don't miss it.
in the case of mattias, we're also going to prepare to annually talk about backlog that will be during that call -- that meeting also. so i really encourage investors to join us and hear about key developments of our product and strategy, as well as financial focused sessions that will provide additional color on the iot and cyber business. more detail will be -- will follow in due course, so please stay tuned. thank you for joining the call today, everyone, and have a good evening.

[operator instructions]. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. i would now like to turn today's call over to tim foote, vice president of blackberry investor relations. please go ahead.
tim foote -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, brent. good afternoon, and welcome to blackberry's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. with me on the call today are executive chair and chief executive officer john chen, and chief financial officer steve rai. after i read our cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements, john will provide a business update, and steve will review the financial results.
we will then open the call for a brief q&a session. this call is available to the general public via call-in numbers and via webcast in the investor information section at blackberry.com. a replay will also be available on the blackberry.com website. some of the statements we'll be making today constitute forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of applicable u.s.

john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tim. good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining the call. i must first apologize. after speaking for two days, because we had our agm and board meeting, my throat is a little sketchy.
so i apologize for that. anyway, this quarter, we built on the momentum from fiscal '22 and continue to execute it well, delivering solid year-over-year revenue growth. total software and services revenue was $164 million, representing a 9% year over year. let me first start my review today with the iot business unit.
despite a tough macro environment for auto, we delivered revenue of $51 million, which represents 19% year-over-year growth. gross margin came in at 84%. iot arr was $94 million, increasing 9% year over year. we recorded strong revenue from preproduction development seats and professional services, setting yet another quarterly record for the third quarter in a row.
as you know, this is not only a positive for the current year but also a strong indicator of future revenue once the design enters into production. our strength in securing new design wins have driven a year-over-year increase in our royalty revenue backlog, which is now at approximately $560 million, 5-6-0, a 14% increase from a year ago. further, the number of vehicles with qnx software embedded has increased year over year from over $195 million to over $215, 2-1-5, million. i'm pleased with the strength of our design wins, once again allow us to overcome the impact of the headwind that the auto industry is currently facing.
these headwinds include covid-related lockdowns in china, supply chain issues, the ukraine war, inflation, and rising interest rates. on the supply chain front, the situation appears to be showing some signs of stabilization. while the economic issues will impact the overall auto market, demand for higher-end models and electric vehicle appears to be holding up. as mentioned, qnx continued to perform well in terms of securing new design wins.
in the quarter, we gained a total of 14 new design wins with nine in auto and five in the general embedded market. we are a market leader in adas, advanced driver assist, that is, and digital cockpits, both fast-growing safety-critical domains. in fact, strategy analytics, a leading independent auto analyst, estimates a three-year cagr for adas market to be 29% and digital cockpit to be 40%. and within those domains, we plan to grow even faster than that as we continue to win market share.
in the quarter, we had a number of large design wins in digital cockpit. in addition to wins with leading tier 1 bosch and visteon, we secured a win with a global automaker based in north america, as well as bicv, a leading chinese tier 1 for an augmented reality ai and hologram-enabled digital cockpit to be deployed in renault- jiangling's latest fully electric sedan. that's quite a bit of technology. furthermore, despite lockdown challenges, we were able to secure a number of new design wins with major chinese automakers, including autonomous drive design with great wall motor and others.
outside of auto, this quarter our qnx hypervisor -- sorry, qnx hypervisor, was pre-certified by the independent auditor at tuv rheinland to the highest level of safety for medical device software. we continue to make progress in medical design wins. and a good example in the quarter was for a dialysis machine with a major technology customer base in india. let me now provide you with an update on the progress we're making with ivy.
as previously mentioned, we have received more proof-of-concept or poc trial requests than we could currently handle, and we continue to receive more. this is a strong indicator that ivy is a product with the right strategy, in the right place at the right time. in the quarter, we commenced a number of pocs, which include leading global automakers and tier 1s. engagement so far has been positive and some of the learnings are helping guide our product development.
product development is advancing well, and our june release now supports an even wider range of sensors and hardware. we are also progressing well with developers' tools. progress is also being made of the application ecosystem side, and we currently engage with multiple potential partners. these partners enable a wide variety of exciting use cases, including ai-driven battery management, predictive maintenance, and user-based insurance just to name a few.
and a number of them are being considered for inclusion in the current pocs. overall, we continue to be excited by the potential opportunity for ivy and are pleased with our progress this quarter. now, moving on to cybersecurity. this was a solid quarter for the cybersecurity business unit.
revenue came in at $113 million, 1-1-3, a 6% growth year over year. buildings on a total contract value basis was $89 million, a 16% year-over-year increase. gross margin was 53%, arr was 3-3-4, $334 million, dollar-based net retention rate was 88%. this number, of course, does not include new logo wins nor certain perpetual license wins in government.
with the elevated cyber threat levels, we see a strong demand environment at present. given this backdrop, we continue to invest in go to market. in the quarter, we added net new -- net direct quarter carrying headcount. we are pleased with how these additions to the team are ramping up.
and of course, it will take a few quarters for them to reach full productivity. during the past quarter, we also expanded our channel presence. we added midis group, a partner with over 5,000 employees and a presence in over 70 countries across the middle east, europe, and africa. this significantly expands our reach in those markets.
midis brings a lot of experience in cyber, having been distributed with mcafee, symantec, and trend micro which also made a number of enhancements to our managed service -- managed security service provider or mssp program. as growth in our guard mdr solution has shown, this is a very large demand -- there's a very large demand for managed service in cybersecurity and mssp allow us to greatly scale out our go-to-market. during the quarter, we secured a number of new logo wins, mainly displacing legacy vendors. the legacy vendors market remains a very large opportunity for blackberry, and we have been running a number of targeted campaigns.
in particular, this quarter, we saw a number of customers move from a kaspersky -- sorry, to cylanceprotect. cylanceprotect works very well in this context and its lightweight agent is both quick and easy to deploy. we continue to compete head-to-head and win against other next-gen cyber players. a good example of a win this past quarter was of a major u.s.-based medical industry customer with deployments of tens of thousands of endpoints in a direct head-to-head competition against cloud strength.
the customers select blackberry because they were impressed by the effectiveness of our product, especially against the log4j and coveris, as well as our high level of customer service. our cyber products received further external validation in a recent minor attack evaluations. our cyber suite of solution was 100% successful in preventing both a wizard spider and sandworm attacks very early in each scenario and critically before any damages occurred. let me now provide an update for uem.
this quarter, we secured renewal with some of our largest customers, including the u.s. air force, u.s. navy, u.s. special ops command, the canadian senate, the supreme court of canada, and the royal canadian mint.
we booked a great amount of business with law enforcement agencies in the quarter, such as with the u.k. serious fraud office, the london and manchester police services, as well as the vancouver police department. we were pleased to both increase the number of uem license and deploy additional products to these customers. in addition to government, we secure, renew and upsell a number of leading financial services customers, including leading banks mufg -- i believe they are the largest japanese bank.
mizuho and sumitomo mitsui banking corporation, three of the large japan's four largest banks. switzerland's julius baer group, first citizens bank, and liberty bank in the united states,, as well as other leading banks in both germany and canada. as we mentioned previously, given the competitive market, we continue to strengthen our uem product offering, and we're pleased to partner with google to add support for enterprise running chrome os and chrome browser, support that microsoft intune does not offer. according to idc, chrome os recently overtook macos as the no.
2 desktop os with more than 10% market share, and chrome is also the world's leading browser with approximately 70% market share. the strength of our uem offering continues to be recognized. and last month, idc marketscape named blackberry as a leader in uem for the third year in a row. among other items, they highlight a wide range of government and industrial security and compliance certification that blackberry uem hosts.
these certifications help blackberry maintain a strong position in core regulated markets. and now a brief word about licensing. in the quarter, licensing revenue was $4 million, and gross margin was 50%. earlier this month, we issued a press release updating the status of the proposed sale of the legacy portion of our patent portfolio.
the buyer catapult is working to secure their financing, and we look forward to the completion of the transaction. at the same time, as we are no longer under exclusivity with catapult, we are free to explore new options as they come our way. we will provide more details as and when appropriate. let me now hand over to steve, who will provide additional color on our financial results for the quarter.
steve rai -- chief financial officer
thank you, john. as usual, my comments on our financial performance this past quarter will be in non-gaap terms, unless otherwise noted. also, please refer to the supplemental table in the press release for the gaap and non-gaap details. total company revenue for the quarter was $168 million.
first quarter total company gross margin was 63%. our non-gaap gross margin excludes stock compensation expense of $1 million. first quarter operating expenses were $132 million. our non-gaap operating expenses exclude $23 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, $1 million of restructuring expenses, $165 million relating to a one-time litigation settlement of a matter dating back to 2013, $6 million in stock compensation expense, and $46 million fair value gain on the convertible debentures.
this quarter, non-gaap operating loss was $27 million and non-gaap net loss was $31 million. the gaap basic loss per share of $0.31 was primarily driven by the one-time impact of the litigation settlement. non-gaap loss per share was $0.05 in the quarter. our adjusted ebitda was negative $21 million, excluding the non-gaap adjustments previously mentioned.
i will now provide a breakdown of our revenue in the quarter. cybersecurity revenue was $113 million and iot revenue was $51 million. software product revenue remained in the range of 80% to 85% of the total, with professional services making up the balance. the recurring portion of software product revenue remains at approximately 80%.
licensing and other revenue was $4 million. i'll now move to our balance sheet and cash flow performance. total cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $721 million as of may 31, 2022. our net cash position was $356 million.
q1 is traditionally a seasonal high for use of cash given the payment of annual bonuses and other annual items, and together with the ongoing investment in the business, free cash usage was $43 million. cash used by operations was $42 million and capital expenditures were $1 million. that concludes my comments, and i'll now turn it back to john.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, steve. before we commence our q&a session, let me first provide a current year outlook. there's no change from our previous guidance. we continue to expect through fiscal year '23 revenue for the iot business unit to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million, and revenue for the cybersecurity business unit to be broadly in line with the fiscal year '22, with about 8% to 12% year-over-year billings growth.
i'd like to thank everybody who attended our recent analyst day. i think it was may 12. for those who were able to join, we provided a three- and five-year revenue target for blackberry. we expect the total company revenue, excluding the ivy, to grow with a five-year cagr of approximately 13% with revenue of $886 million in fy '25 and $1.2 billion in fy '27.
breaking this down by business unit, while the iot tam is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 12% over the next three years, we expect to grow iot revenue at a five-year cagr of approximately 20%. this doubled the industry growth rate. this faster-than-market growth rate is primarily driven by the market share gain in our core safety critical auto domains. in addition to auto, we also expect growth from adjacent verticals, particularly medical and industrial, broadening our addressable market.
we estimate revenue in the fy '25 to be approximately $307 million and approximately $443 million in fy '27. this model is still -- is partially built on the multiyear revenue backlog from already confirmed designs and a line of sight to upcoming potential new design wins. it is important to note that these iot targets do not include any revenue from ivy, which then becomes upside to the story. for cyber, given the strong market condition, our technology portfolio and the road map, we expect revenue to grow with a five-year cagr of approximately 10%.
the cyber business unit includes both the more mature endpoint management products, as well as the higher growth endpoint security products. we target cybersecurity revenue of $579 million in fy '25 and $770 million in fy '27. we expect operating leverage for the business, expanding gross margin by over 100 basis points per year on average and trending toward our 20% operating margin by fy '27. given the investment we're making, we expect moderately negative eps and cash flow this current fiscal year, approximately -- approaching eps and cash flow breakeven in fy '24 and becoming eps and cash flow positive from fy '25 onwards.
we expect the two markets to converge and our position in both iot and cybersecurity will place us in a very strong position to capitalize on these growing market trends. so let me summarize the key takeaway from the quarter. one, this was a good quarter where we delivered year-over-year revenue growth in both our iot and cyber business unit; two, we set another quarterly record for design activities in iot, offsetting the impact of macro headwinds on auto production; three, on the cyber side, we recorded solid double-digit billings growth and continue to make progress in expanding our market reach. one final point.
this quarter, we released our first esg report with highlights including blackberry achieving carbon neutrality. for those who haven't seen it yet, a copy can be downloaded from our website. that concludes my remarks. brent, can you please open the line for q&a?

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of paul treiber with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, paul.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks so much and good afternoon. hey, there, john. first question, can you connect the dots between -- in the cyber business between the decline in arr versus the very healthy billings growth in the quarter. and more specifically, was there any contribution from perpetual license like secusuite in the quarter?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. actually, your second question answers somewhat partially the first question. we had a good secusuite quarter selling to the government and it's perpetual because of the way the government purchases the technology. and so that did not fully reflect it obviously, and it cannot be reflected on the arr.
there was some minor churn for the uem mid-market, which we have identified last quarter. so the combination of those two explains the delta.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you. and second question, just on the patent sale, and not so much in the details you mentioned you can't disclose -- obviously, negotiations are ongoing. but if the sale doesn't go through and you don't find a third party.
i mean, would you revert back to ip licensing? or are you -- you're definitely going to go through with the sale. you just have to find the right buyer and the right price.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
i believe for simplicity of our company's story and the focus, we should find a buyer, and i believe we will find a buyer. but we will not shy away from monetizing ourselves. we do have our team standby and ready. so -- but my first priority is a secure buyer.
and there has been other people that have approached, but i still believe that catapult will get it done.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok, great. that's helpful. i will pass it on.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question is from the line of trip chowdhry with global equities. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hey trip. trip, how are you?
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
hello. wonderful. wonderful. always exciting to hear about ivy.
two things -- two questions i have. first is regarding the chip supply position. do you think because of the depression in cryptos, some chip capacity may have been released and that may be easing out the chip shortage that automotive industry is facing. are you seeing something to that effect?
tim foote -- vice president, investor relations
seeing the chip shortages. so i think it's the fact that cryptocurrency is currently depressed, does that free up chips?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
i'm not good enough to answer your question there, trip. i'm not a big crypto fan. hate to say that. you know, they got you.
so i don't follow that very closely. i know it's very depressed at this point. and i don't know the relationship with that. i'm sure there are some with the chip shortages issue.
so sorry, i can't answer that question.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
all right. second question i had is regarding the ivy platform, and it's -- and you're getting insurance -- auto insurers on top of it. i was wondering what kind of use cases can you think about that can evolve over a period of time? and that's all from me.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
that's a very good question. i -- so we have, in our partnership, at least one, if not two, the organization has specialized in this area -- in the insurance area, for example. the big thing about the insurance area with auto is pay-as-you-go kind of a usage-based insurance model. and then the other one is a redefinition of how the insurance -- kind of related to the first one, how they were calculated and it's particularly more meaningful in the fleet management side of the equation.
so other use cases, there's a lot of use cases in ivy or ivy could host a lot of use cases. of course, we told you guys about battery management. the whole area of predictive maintenance are huge. and every oem will want to get their hands around the trader, around the actions that could generate, whether it's physically or over-the-air update.
so we're seeing a lot of interest of a lot of different use cases and auto as a wallet, there's also a lot of financial technology around it. and so this exciting time for ivy.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
thank you very much. all the best.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, trip.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of todd coupland with cibc. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hey todd. todd, how are you?
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
how are you there, john? good evening. thank you. i had a couple of questions. first on iot.
you talked about how you're seeing the supply chain ease. could you just talk about what you're seeing that's changed since you gave the last update?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. on the supply chain side, the oems around the world, they finally have a good strategy. and then as each of them has their own strategy, but i see it more suited to high-end cars being built, that they are able to manage their supply chain issue and build and release cars that hold more value to them. so high-end car being built, of course, there is a constant demand of electric vehicle particularly given today's environment with the gas price and the environment.
so -- and the good thing about us is qnx is typically embedded in the high-end cars more so than the lower-end models. and in addition to that, we have a strong footprint, 24 of the top 25 production volume producers, they're users qnx of the ev that is of the electric vehicle world. so as sales volume goes up, although still a small percentage of total vehicles sold, i think it's like 12% right now, that we're seeing the volume uptick. so it's -- it's a good trend for us.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
but it's -- i guess it's not material enough to move the iot guide for the year.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
no, no, because there is a headwind. we had a little delay on some of the stuff when china has a lockdown because of covid. and then, of course, now, as you all read, and you guys probably know this very well, that the interest rate uptick is causing a little bit of a demand slowdown for new vehicle purchases. and so those are all factors that we still need to confront with.
and so our strategy is we see a strong design win rate. we're winning a lot of new design win and they typically come with license, developer license, and some professional services revenue. we're strong enough in those areas that covers the shortfall on production or slowdown of production if there is any. so we believe that our guidance is still good.
and i hope i'm wrong on the conservative side. but i think our guidance is still good. and there's a mix shifted a little bit.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then my second question had to do on the cyber business. you talked about modest churn in smbs.
and you talked about that for a couple of quarters. what i was wondering is we're starting to see an enterprise staff being given auctions of blackberry uem versus, let's say, a competitor. and i'm just wondering if you're seeing that in other enterprise. and does that give you some concern that the churn might bleed into larger businesses? just talk about that trend.
thanks a lot.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. currently, we haven't seen that. so this is important that we continue to work on our products and partnerships, which i talked about. so far, the uem churn is usually in the nonregulated space and is a small -- more small, medium enterprise.
so for the very large one, we have continuous renewal and particularly the government world. so no, i haven't seen that as a major trend at all. even banks so far have been ok, knock on wood.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok, great. thanks a lot.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of daniel chan with td securities. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi. how are you, daniel?
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
hi, john. good. thanks. just wondering if you can provide some color on the drivers behind the 14% increase in the qnx backlog.
is that due to a recovery of production volumes, extension of some programs or higher asp? just any color on that would be helpful.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. it's the result of the design wins we've been telling you folks every quarter. and so, we have a very strict guideline and formula of what get counted, what didn't get counted. and we're very conservative on that.
but this is as a result of what the oem told us that this is the volume you should expect in future years on the total program. and we sometimes do a discount on it, sometimes we took it as is. and so -- and it was accumulation of those offsetting obviously the runoff which is the -- which is the royalty we got in the last 12 months, and that results in a 14% increase.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thank you for that. and then i wanted to ask a question on the patent sale.
you said you would explore options as they come in. i just want to know like whether you guys are actively looking for other options? like are you actually going back to other bits you had in your initial process or are you starting from the beginning again?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
no, no. not at all. in fact, we're being approached by others. i'm not actively looking for or starting from square one.
as i said i want to make sure that the shareholder knows that we're not just stuck with one option, but we do expect to see, and we would like to see the previously announced deal with catapult to happen. but what we're basically saying is we've been getting calls. and we are now responding to the calls because now the exclusivity has expired.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
great. thanks a lot.

tim foote -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, brent. good afternoon, and welcome to blackberry's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings conference call. with me on the call today are executive chair and chief executive officer john chen, and chief financial officer steve rai. after i read our cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements, john will provide a business update, and steve will review the financial results.

john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tim. good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining the call. i must first apologize. after speaking for two days, because we had our agm and board meeting, my throat is a little sketchy.
so i apologize for that. anyway, this quarter, we built on the momentum from fiscal '22 and continue to execute it well, delivering solid year-over-year revenue growth. total software and services revenue was $164 million, representing a 9% year over year. let me first start my review today with the iot business unit.
despite a tough macro environment for auto, we delivered revenue of $51 million, which represents 19% year-over-year growth. gross margin came in at 84%. iot arr was $94 million, increasing 9% year over year. we recorded strong revenue from preproduction development seats and professional services, setting yet another quarterly record for the third quarter in a row.
as you know, this is not only a positive for the current year but also a strong indicator of future revenue once the design enters into production. our strength in securing new design wins have driven a year-over-year increase in our royalty revenue backlog, which is now at approximately $560 million, 5-6-0, a 14% increase from a year ago. further, the number of vehicles with qnx software embedded has increased year over year from over $195 million to over $215, 2-1-5, million. i'm pleased with the strength of our design wins, once again allow us to overcome the impact of the headwind that the auto industry is currently facing.
these headwinds include covid-related lockdowns in china, supply chain issues, the ukraine war, inflation, and rising interest rates. on the supply chain front, the situation appears to be showing some signs of stabilization. while the economic issues will impact the overall auto market, demand for higher-end models and electric vehicle appears to be holding up. as mentioned, qnx continued to perform well in terms of securing new design wins.
in the quarter, we gained a total of 14 new design wins with nine in auto and five in the general embedded market. we are a market leader in adas, advanced driver assist, that is, and digital cockpits, both fast-growing safety-critical domains. in fact, strategy analytics, a leading independent auto analyst, estimates a three-year cagr for adas market to be 29% and digital cockpit to be 40%. and within those domains, we plan to grow even faster than that as we continue to win market share.
in the quarter, we had a number of large design wins in digital cockpit. in addition to wins with leading tier 1 bosch and visteon, we secured a win with a global automaker based in north america, as well as bicv, a leading chinese tier 1 for an augmented reality ai and hologram-enabled digital cockpit to be deployed in renault- jiangling's latest fully electric sedan. that's quite a bit of technology. furthermore, despite lockdown challenges, we were able to secure a number of new design wins with major chinese automakers, including autonomous drive design with great wall motor and others.
outside of auto, this quarter our qnx hypervisor -- sorry, qnx hypervisor, was pre-certified by the independent auditor at tuv rheinland to the highest level of safety for medical device software. we continue to make progress in medical design wins. and a good example in the quarter was for a dialysis machine with a major technology customer base in india. let me now provide you with an update on the progress we're making with ivy.
as previously mentioned, we have received more proof-of-concept or poc trial requests than we could currently handle, and we continue to receive more. this is a strong indicator that ivy is a product with the right strategy, in the right place at the right time. in the quarter, we commenced a number of pocs, which include leading global automakers and tier 1s. engagement so far has been positive and some of the learnings are helping guide our product development.
product development is advancing well, and our june release now supports an even wider range of sensors and hardware. we are also progressing well with developers' tools. progress is also being made of the application ecosystem side, and we currently engage with multiple potential partners. these partners enable a wide variety of exciting use cases, including ai-driven battery management, predictive maintenance, and user-based insurance just to name a few.
and a number of them are being considered for inclusion in the current pocs. overall, we continue to be excited by the potential opportunity for ivy and are pleased with our progress this quarter. now, moving on to cybersecurity. this was a solid quarter for the cybersecurity business unit.
revenue came in at $113 million, 1-1-3, a 6% growth year over year. buildings on a total contract value basis was $89 million, a 16% year-over-year increase. gross margin was 53%, arr was 3-3-4, $334 million, dollar-based net retention rate was 88%. this number, of course, does not include new logo wins nor certain perpetual license wins in government.
with the elevated cyber threat levels, we see a strong demand environment at present. given this backdrop, we continue to invest in go to market. in the quarter, we added net new -- net direct quarter carrying headcount. we are pleased with how these additions to the team are ramping up.
and of course, it will take a few quarters for them to reach full productivity. during the past quarter, we also expanded our channel presence. we added midis group, a partner with over 5,000 employees and a presence in over 70 countries across the middle east, europe, and africa. this significantly expands our reach in those markets.
midis brings a lot of experience in cyber, having been distributed with mcafee, symantec, and trend micro which also made a number of enhancements to our managed service -- managed security service provider or mssp program. as growth in our guard mdr solution has shown, this is a very large demand -- there's a very large demand for managed service in cybersecurity and mssp allow us to greatly scale out our go-to-market. during the quarter, we secured a number of new logo wins, mainly displacing legacy vendors. the legacy vendors market remains a very large opportunity for blackberry, and we have been running a number of targeted campaigns.
in particular, this quarter, we saw a number of customers move from a kaspersky -- sorry, to cylanceprotect. cylanceprotect works very well in this context and its lightweight agent is both quick and easy to deploy. we continue to compete head-to-head and win against other next-gen cyber players. a good example of a win this past quarter was of a major u.s.-based medical industry customer with deployments of tens of thousands of endpoints in a direct head-to-head competition against cloud strength.
the customers select blackberry because they were impressed by the effectiveness of our product, especially against the log4j and coveris, as well as our high level of customer service. our cyber products received further external validation in a recent minor attack evaluations. our cyber suite of solution was 100% successful in preventing both a wizard spider and sandworm attacks very early in each scenario and critically before any damages occurred. let me now provide an update for uem.
this quarter, we secured renewal with some of our largest customers, including the u.s. air force, u.s. navy, u.s. special ops command, the canadian senate, the supreme court of canada, and the royal canadian mint.
we booked a great amount of business with law enforcement agencies in the quarter, such as with the u.k. serious fraud office, the london and manchester police services, as well as the vancouver police department. we were pleased to both increase the number of uem license and deploy additional products to these customers. in addition to government, we secure, renew and upsell a number of leading financial services customers, including leading banks mufg -- i believe they are the largest japanese bank.
mizuho and sumitomo mitsui banking corporation, three of the large japan's four largest banks. switzerland's julius baer group, first citizens bank, and liberty bank in the united states,, as well as other leading banks in both germany and canada. as we mentioned previously, given the competitive market, we continue to strengthen our uem product offering, and we're pleased to partner with google to add support for enterprise running chrome os and chrome browser, support that microsoft intune does not offer. according to idc, chrome os recently overtook macos as the no.
2 desktop os with more than 10% market share, and chrome is also the world's leading browser with approximately 70% market share. the strength of our uem offering continues to be recognized. and last month, idc marketscape named blackberry as a leader in uem for the third year in a row. among other items, they highlight a wide range of government and industrial security and compliance certification that blackberry uem hosts.
these certifications help blackberry maintain a strong position in core regulated markets. and now a brief word about licensing. in the quarter, licensing revenue was $4 million, and gross margin was 50%. earlier this month, we issued a press release updating the status of the proposed sale of the legacy portion of our patent portfolio.
the buyer catapult is working to secure their financing, and we look forward to the completion of the transaction. at the same time, as we are no longer under exclusivity with catapult, we are free to explore new options as they come our way. we will provide more details as and when appropriate. let me now hand over to steve, who will provide additional color on our financial results for the quarter.
steve rai -- chief financial officer
thank you, john. as usual, my comments on our financial performance this past quarter will be in non-gaap terms, unless otherwise noted. also, please refer to the supplemental table in the press release for the gaap and non-gaap details. total company revenue for the quarter was $168 million.
first quarter total company gross margin was 63%. our non-gaap gross margin excludes stock compensation expense of $1 million. first quarter operating expenses were $132 million. our non-gaap operating expenses exclude $23 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, $1 million of restructuring expenses, $165 million relating to a one-time litigation settlement of a matter dating back to 2013, $6 million in stock compensation expense, and $46 million fair value gain on the convertible debentures.
this quarter, non-gaap operating loss was $27 million and non-gaap net loss was $31 million. the gaap basic loss per share of $0.31 was primarily driven by the one-time impact of the litigation settlement. non-gaap loss per share was $0.05 in the quarter. our adjusted ebitda was negative $21 million, excluding the non-gaap adjustments previously mentioned.
i will now provide a breakdown of our revenue in the quarter. cybersecurity revenue was $113 million and iot revenue was $51 million. software product revenue remained in the range of 80% to 85% of the total, with professional services making up the balance. the recurring portion of software product revenue remains at approximately 80%.
licensing and other revenue was $4 million. i'll now move to our balance sheet and cash flow performance. total cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $721 million as of may 31, 2022. our net cash position was $356 million.
q1 is traditionally a seasonal high for use of cash given the payment of annual bonuses and other annual items, and together with the ongoing investment in the business, free cash usage was $43 million. cash used by operations was $42 million and capital expenditures were $1 million. that concludes my comments, and i'll now turn it back to john.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, steve. before we commence our q&a session, let me first provide a current year outlook. there's no change from our previous guidance. we continue to expect through fiscal year '23 revenue for the iot business unit to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million, and revenue for the cybersecurity business unit to be broadly in line with the fiscal year '22, with about 8% to 12% year-over-year billings growth.
i'd like to thank everybody who attended our recent analyst day. i think it was may 12. for those who were able to join, we provided a three- and five-year revenue target for blackberry. we expect the total company revenue, excluding the ivy, to grow with a five-year cagr of approximately 13% with revenue of $886 million in fy '25 and $1.2 billion in fy '27.
breaking this down by business unit, while the iot tam is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 12% over the next three years, we expect to grow iot revenue at a five-year cagr of approximately 20%. this doubled the industry growth rate. this faster-than-market growth rate is primarily driven by the market share gain in our core safety critical auto domains. in addition to auto, we also expect growth from adjacent verticals, particularly medical and industrial, broadening our addressable market.
we estimate revenue in the fy '25 to be approximately $307 million and approximately $443 million in fy '27. this model is still -- is partially built on the multiyear revenue backlog from already confirmed designs and a line of sight to upcoming potential new design wins. it is important to note that these iot targets do not include any revenue from ivy, which then becomes upside to the story. for cyber, given the strong market condition, our technology portfolio and the road map, we expect revenue to grow with a five-year cagr of approximately 10%.
the cyber business unit includes both the more mature endpoint management products, as well as the higher growth endpoint security products. we target cybersecurity revenue of $579 million in fy '25 and $770 million in fy '27. we expect operating leverage for the business, expanding gross margin by over 100 basis points per year on average and trending toward our 20% operating margin by fy '27. given the investment we're making, we expect moderately negative eps and cash flow this current fiscal year, approximately -- approaching eps and cash flow breakeven in fy '24 and becoming eps and cash flow positive from fy '25 onwards.
we expect the two markets to converge and our position in both iot and cybersecurity will place us in a very strong position to capitalize on these growing market trends. so let me summarize the key takeaway from the quarter. one, this was a good quarter where we delivered year-over-year revenue growth in both our iot and cyber business unit; two, we set another quarterly record for design activities in iot, offsetting the impact of macro headwinds on auto production; three, on the cyber side, we recorded solid double-digit billings growth and continue to make progress in expanding our market reach. one final point.
this quarter, we released our first esg report with highlights including blackberry achieving carbon neutrality. for those who haven't seen it yet, a copy can be downloaded from our website. that concludes my remarks. brent, can you please open the line for q&a?

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of paul treiber with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, paul.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks so much and good afternoon. hey, there, john. first question, can you connect the dots between -- in the cyber business between the decline in arr versus the very healthy billings growth in the quarter. and more specifically, was there any contribution from perpetual license like secusuite in the quarter?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. actually, your second question answers somewhat partially the first question. we had a good secusuite quarter selling to the government and it's perpetual because of the way the government purchases the technology. and so that did not fully reflect it obviously, and it cannot be reflected on the arr.
there was some minor churn for the uem mid-market, which we have identified last quarter. so the combination of those two explains the delta.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you. and second question, just on the patent sale, and not so much in the details you mentioned you can't disclose -- obviously, negotiations are ongoing. but if the sale doesn't go through and you don't find a third party.
i mean, would you revert back to ip licensing? or are you -- you're definitely going to go through with the sale. you just have to find the right buyer and the right price.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
i believe for simplicity of our company's story and the focus, we should find a buyer, and i believe we will find a buyer. but we will not shy away from monetizing ourselves. we do have our team standby and ready. so -- but my first priority is a secure buyer.
and there has been other people that have approached, but i still believe that catapult will get it done.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok, great. that's helpful. i will pass it on.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question is from the line of trip chowdhry with global equities. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hey trip. trip, how are you?
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
hello. wonderful. wonderful. always exciting to hear about ivy.
two things -- two questions i have. first is regarding the chip supply position. do you think because of the depression in cryptos, some chip capacity may have been released and that may be easing out the chip shortage that automotive industry is facing. are you seeing something to that effect?
tim foote -- vice president, investor relations
seeing the chip shortages. so i think it's the fact that cryptocurrency is currently depressed, does that free up chips?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
i'm not good enough to answer your question there, trip. i'm not a big crypto fan. hate to say that. you know, they got you.
so i don't follow that very closely. i know it's very depressed at this point. and i don't know the relationship with that. i'm sure there are some with the chip shortages issue.
so sorry, i can't answer that question.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
all right. second question i had is regarding the ivy platform, and it's -- and you're getting insurance -- auto insurers on top of it. i was wondering what kind of use cases can you think about that can evolve over a period of time? and that's all from me.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
that's a very good question. i -- so we have, in our partnership, at least one, if not two, the organization has specialized in this area -- in the insurance area, for example. the big thing about the insurance area with auto is pay-as-you-go kind of a usage-based insurance model. and then the other one is a redefinition of how the insurance -- kind of related to the first one, how they were calculated and it's particularly more meaningful in the fleet management side of the equation.
so other use cases, there's a lot of use cases in ivy or ivy could host a lot of use cases. of course, we told you guys about battery management. the whole area of predictive maintenance are huge. and every oem will want to get their hands around the trader, around the actions that could generate, whether it's physically or over-the-air update.
so we're seeing a lot of interest of a lot of different use cases and auto as a wallet, there's also a lot of financial technology around it. and so this exciting time for ivy.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
thank you very much. all the best.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, trip.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of todd coupland with cibc. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hey todd. todd, how are you?
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
how are you there, john? good evening. thank you. i had a couple of questions. first on iot.
you talked about how you're seeing the supply chain ease. could you just talk about what you're seeing that's changed since you gave the last update?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. on the supply chain side, the oems around the world, they finally have a good strategy. and then as each of them has their own strategy, but i see it more suited to high-end cars being built, that they are able to manage their supply chain issue and build and release cars that hold more value to them. so high-end car being built, of course, there is a constant demand of electric vehicle particularly given today's environment with the gas price and the environment.
so -- and the good thing about us is qnx is typically embedded in the high-end cars more so than the lower-end models. and in addition to that, we have a strong footprint, 24 of the top 25 production volume producers, they're users qnx of the ev that is of the electric vehicle world. so as sales volume goes up, although still a small percentage of total vehicles sold, i think it's like 12% right now, that we're seeing the volume uptick. so it's -- it's a good trend for us.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
but it's -- i guess it's not material enough to move the iot guide for the year.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
no, no, because there is a headwind. we had a little delay on some of the stuff when china has a lockdown because of covid. and then, of course, now, as you all read, and you guys probably know this very well, that the interest rate uptick is causing a little bit of a demand slowdown for new vehicle purchases. and so those are all factors that we still need to confront with.
and so our strategy is we see a strong design win rate. we're winning a lot of new design win and they typically come with license, developer license, and some professional services revenue. we're strong enough in those areas that covers the shortfall on production or slowdown of production if there is any. so we believe that our guidance is still good.
and i hope i'm wrong on the conservative side. but i think our guidance is still good. and there's a mix shifted a little bit.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then my second question had to do on the cyber business. you talked about modest churn in smbs.
and you talked about that for a couple of quarters. what i was wondering is we're starting to see an enterprise staff being given auctions of blackberry uem versus, let's say, a competitor. and i'm just wondering if you're seeing that in other enterprise. and does that give you some concern that the churn might bleed into larger businesses? just talk about that trend.
thanks a lot.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. currently, we haven't seen that. so this is important that we continue to work on our products and partnerships, which i talked about. so far, the uem churn is usually in the nonregulated space and is a small -- more small, medium enterprise.
so for the very large one, we have continuous renewal and particularly the government world. so no, i haven't seen that as a major trend at all. even banks so far have been ok, knock on wood.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok, great. thanks a lot.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of daniel chan with td securities. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi. how are you, daniel?
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
hi, john. good. thanks. just wondering if you can provide some color on the drivers behind the 14% increase in the qnx backlog.
is that due to a recovery of production volumes, extension of some programs or higher asp? just any color on that would be helpful.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. it's the result of the design wins we've been telling you folks every quarter. and so, we have a very strict guideline and formula of what get counted, what didn't get counted. and we're very conservative on that.
but this is as a result of what the oem told us that this is the volume you should expect in future years on the total program. and we sometimes do a discount on it, sometimes we took it as is. and so -- and it was accumulation of those offsetting obviously the runoff which is the -- which is the royalty we got in the last 12 months, and that results in a 14% increase.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thank you for that. and then i wanted to ask a question on the patent sale.
you said you would explore options as they come in. i just want to know like whether you guys are actively looking for other options? like are you actually going back to other bits you had in your initial process or are you starting from the beginning again?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
no, no. not at all. in fact, we're being approached by others. i'm not actively looking for or starting from square one.
as i said i want to make sure that the shareholder knows that we're not just stuck with one option, but we do expect to see, and we would like to see the previously announced deal with catapult to happen. but what we're basically saying is we've been getting calls. and we are now responding to the calls because now the exclusivity has expired.
daniel chan -- td securities -- analyst

john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, tim. good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining today's call. this was a solid quarter for blackberry, delivering revenue in line with expectations and beats on the earnings. i'll start today with view with the iot business unit.
this quarter, iot delivered a strong 28% year-over-year revenue growth. qnx design base revenue remains the top performer. that is revenue from developer -- development fees and professional services. q1 was the third consecutive quarter that we set an all-time record in this category.
and this quarter, we almost set another. when we win a new design, this revenue is the first to be recognized with royalties coming later when a vehicle enters into production. this strength in design phase revenue is expected to continue, given the significant amount of professional services we already have lined up and the pipeline of potential new design wins in the next few quarters. on the production front, we saw an uptick in royalty revenue, but it remains below the pre-pandemic level, mainly due to supply chain headwinds.
gross margin came in at 82%. the strength of design wins was clearly illustrated by volkswagen, one of the world's largest automobile selecting blackberry qnx for its new vw.os platform. this platform will be deployed in all brands across the volkswagen group. we're rapidly being trusted to power the safety critical adas and autonomous drive applications.
the qnx is currently the market leader. this builds on design wins in recent quarters with bmw, volvo, and a long list of electric vehicle players in china. blackberry continues to win market share in core safety-critical domains. a couple of examples included an adas design win with hyundai and a digital copper design with one of the world's largest tier 1 supplier that utilizes the qnx hypervisor.
the hypervisor will host a safety-critical instrument cluster along non-safety-critical entertainment applications all on the same chip. on the ev front, we won another adas design with the chinese automaker, and blackberry qnx is now embedded in seven of the china's 10 largest ev oems. in addition to our strong position in auto, we have significant opportunities in the other verticals, too. this quarter, we announced additional support for the aerospace and defense market, with qnx achieving the latest technical standard known as the future airborne capability environment, or face.
face is a software standard, jointly developed by government and industry that establish a common operating environment. it enables the reuse of software components across different hardware, reducing developer friction, and costs. in addition to aerospace and defense, we saw progress in the medical and industrial markets with wins that include surgical robotics, a retail distribution pick-and-pack robot as well as control for a nuclear power plant. overall, in the quarter, we won 19 new designs with nine in auto and 10 in the general embedded market.
we successfully added talent to our iot team this quarter despite the tight labor market. this investment is supported by the large and growing schedule of professional services secured through the recent design wins, and by adding headcount, it will enable additional revenue. the macro environment for auto remains a mixed picture with varying dynamics across regions and oems. the chinese market where blackberry has won a number of designs recently appears to be bouncing back to the end -- due to the end of some covid-related shutdowns and the impact of robust stimulus measures.
in north america and europe, however, there appears to be a short-term contraction with certain chip supplies, constraining the ability of oem to build inventory and meet demand. going forward, the impact of rising interest rate on consumer financing, together with economic uncertainty created by the possibility -- creating the possibility of future choppiness. despite this ongoing challenge, we're delivering strong year-over-year growth and have a solid pipeline of potential new designs coming in the upcoming quarters. normally, given the strength of the qnx business, we will adjust our revenue outlook upwards. however, given the macro headwind, we've been prudent in holding our outlook as is.
we expect the full year '23 revenue for the iot business unit to still be in the range of the $200 million to $210 million as previously stated. on the ip front, we made good progress. our product development road maps remain firmly on track. we have had another new release in august that enabled support for a greater range of in-vehicle hardware and software.
this new release incorporates not only [inaudible] features but also value to real time feedback that we are getting from the ongoing group of concept trials. you may recall that we are currently running a limited number of these trials, including the travel oem and tier 1s and these are progressing well. we continue to receive requests for additional trials and this ongoing demand remains a positive sign of the customer receptivity of ivy. on the ecosystem side, we were excited to close another investment by the ivy fund this quarter in the german start-up named compredict.
compredict uses ai to enable automakers and fee providers to utilize predictive maintenance, i.e., using vehicle sensitive to get ahead of the maintenance issues. the predictive maintenance use case are added to many other [inaudible] enabling, including usage space insurance, intelligent ev avery management, in-vehicle payments and the next-generation 911 emergency response, just to name a few. looking ahead, we expect our product -- our next product release in december and remain focused on ivy design wins, which we currently expect to secure in calendar year 2023. we also plan to showcase more of ivy exciting capabilities and use cases at ces in january.
so please stay tuned for more details on that in the coming months. moving on to cybersecurity business unit. revenue for the quarter was in line with expectation at $111 million. the business also delivered sequential billing growth of 15% to $102 million.
cyber billing for the first half of the fiscal year grew 6% year-over-year. gross margin was 55%, arr came in at $321 million, dollar-based net retention rate was 85%. in the quarter, we closed business with a wide range of customers but saw particular strength in our core verticals of government and financial services. in north america, we secured business with the department of treasury, the federal trade commission, department of energy, airs, union stock exchange and the u.s.
mint. we also won business with leading merger agency such as the u.s. army corps and engineers, u.s. central command, u.s.
marine corps and other branches of the department of defense. internationally, we secured business with u.k., her majesty, i guess, we change that now, the majesty treasury, the uae ministry of presidential affairs, the new zealand parliamentary services, the australian electoral commission and the polish ministry of foreign affairs, just to name a few. in financial services, we won new logos as well as renewal and upsells with leading banks in u.s., u.k., switzerland, japan, israel, italy, and more. in addition to these core verticals, we recorded a strong quarter for new business in the middle market.
this is a large segment of the market dominated by legacy players, altering legacy solutions and one where our finance product portfolio is resonating well. blackberry is very well placed to grow in this market for a number of reasons. the level of timing risk for mid-market customers is high. with our current research team identifying that smbs, phases upwards of 11 cyber-attacks per device per day.
smbs are also those with the lowest level of insurance against ransomware demand. as our study with the corvus insurance show, meaning that they can often ill afford a breach. customers in this segment, particularly like our lightweight agent and how effective our products are at detecting threats. our ai engine, the most mature in the market has seen billions of data points, both malicious and non-malicious and use machine learning over several years to effectively distinguish between the two.
further, mid-market customers among those with the fewest resources and expertise to staff a 24/7 security operating center. and customers like how our managed service offering cylanceguard have solved the issues for that. as we described in previous quarters, there have been some headwinds for cyber arr. however, we expect arr to return to grow early next fiscal year.
a lot of efficient and investment made in the past two quarters are starting to bear fruit, and we see some data points and feel confident in this outlook. first, we saw the total timeline of potential opportunity for our cylance product at the end of q2 increased by 23% year-over-year. and for new logos specifically, the increase was 73%. second, significant progress has been made with the product portfolio in recent quarters and is continuing.
for example, i'll give you an example, recent enhancement to our protect epp product have positively impacted our positive rates as evidenced by trusted third-party virustotal. third, on the global markets front, we're working to replicate the success we already had, particularly with the mid-market customer, we added a lot of cybersecurity industry experience this year, and we expect to see more traction at these new hires fully ramp up. fourth, this coming quarter, we're commencing a program to build strong relationship with key channel partners and distributors that are well-established players in the cybersecurity market. we also received a lot of positive feedback following the cylance product rebrand, including a significant increase in both website traffic and new leads.
turning to the overall demand environment for cybersecurity, the rest of the fy '23 looks fairly solid. as i mentioned earlier, blackberry has a strong government footprint and demand in vertical appears to still be robust. overall, we're marketing customers coming back on the cybersecurity budget, even in the mid-market, given how critical it is to maintain the cyber defense. therefore, there are no change to the outlook that we have provided previously.
we continue to expect the cybersecurity business unit revenue to be broadly in line with fiscal year '22. let me now turn to licensing. revenue in the quarter came in at $6 million. the sales process for the non-core patent portfolio continues.
we understand that the length of time that this has taken is frustrating for shareholders, and we are equally as frustrated, if not more, as we work on it every day. however, we firmly believe that divesting the portfolio remains the best option for shareholder value. while the portfolio is still relatively fresh, the ip as part of the deal and the business of monetizing it, it's not related to our core business. at the time, we were required to announce the deal, we understand that getting the government approval could take up to 210 days, if not longer, but we were pleased that the process was completed much sooner. [inaudible] we're working to conclude the financing in parallel to getting government approval.
unfortunately, we believe the turmoil in the financial markets created unexpected challenges for the original financing syndicate. however, there has been much interest from other parties wanting to take their place, in [inaudible] are currently working to lock down their final syndicate. in parallel to this, we're actively working on an argument where financing is not a contingency as well as finalizing our plan to restart the monetization engine ourselves should that be necessary. we will, of course, keep shareholders posted until our final outcome is achieved.
let me now hand over the call to steve, who will provide additional color on our financial results for the quarter.
steve rai -- chief financial officer
thank you, john. as usual, my comments on our financial performance for the second quarter will be in non-gaap terms unless otherwise noted. total company revenue for the quarter was $168 million. total company gross margin was 64%.
our non-gaap gross margin excludes stock compensation expense of $1 million. operating expenses for the second quarter were $129 million, and these non-gaap operating expenses exclude $22 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, a $10 million fair value gain on the convertible debentures, $5 million in stock compensation expense, $4 million from the impairment of long-term real estate lease assets and $3 million of restructuring expenses.  blackberry continues to make carefully considered investments for top line growth, such as adding additional headcount to the iot team in response to a strong schedule of professional services from design wins as well as expanding our reach in the cyber market, as john outlined earlier. the non-gaap operating loss for the second quarter was $22 million, and non-gaap net loss was $29 million. the gaap basic loss per share was $0.09, and the non-gaap loss per share was $0.05.
adjusted ebitda, excluding the non-gaap adjustments previously mentioned, was negative $16 million. now breaking down revenue in the quarter. iot revenue was $51 million and cybersecurity revenue was $111 million. software product revenue remains in the range of 80% to 85% of total revenue, and professional services formed a balance.
as before, approximately 80% of software product revenue was recurring. licensing and other revenue was $6 million. now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. total cash, cash equivalents and investments were $699 million at august 31, 2022.
free cash flow was negative $26 million with cash used by operations of $23 million and capital expenditures of $3 million. that concludes my comments. i'll now turn the call back to john.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, steve. before we open the lineup for q&a, let me summarize the key points for the quarter. number one, our iot business unit delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth, in large part driven by ongoing strength from design phase revenue. iot remains firmly on track with proof-of-concept trials progressing well, and the team is executing on the product development road map as planned.
our cybersecurity business unit, net revenue expectations, delivering strong sequential business growth and continue to implement a strategy to build the business with arr expected to return to growth early next fiscal year. despite the volatility in the macro market, we are maintaining our revenue outlook for both business units and continue to execute against our plan. that concludes my remarks. and operator, could you please open the line for q&a.

[operator instructions]. your first question comes from the line of mike walkley with canaccord genuity. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hey, mike.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
hey, john. thanks for taking my question. if you delve in a little bit more to the cybersecurity business. the billings commentary sounds promising.
can you just update us maybe on the uem side, kind of where we are and that's falling off and the confidence that gives you that arr will start to grow next year?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so the uem, as you know, it's a very price-sensitive market on the mid and low end. and particularly dominated by one major player in the market, including [inaudible] and so forth. for the higher-end markets, where they absolutely needed better security, we tend to hold on to those businesses as well, and in some cases, expand on it.
we also have -- in addition to just the uem, secure communication and also an opportunity to upsell our ues product too, the finance product. so on a whole for the uem, we kind of expected our sales to holding is pretty flat. and then we'll have a way to grow the business next year by bundling some more other stuff and new products that come out and features. the final point i'd like to make is you -- microsoft, for example, their intune is really a mobile application manager.
this is really not a uem. so the customers are beginning to recognize that the security side of the equation, they're not fulfilling their requirements. so i think there might be a good strong argument for us to either overcome their tack from microsoft intune or actually coexist with them in account that absolutely needed mission-critical security. so that's kind of our current thinking.
and we feel reasonably good about what i said in terms of where the market validation has been, especially with big customer.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
and as a follow-up question, how has pricing in the endpoints security market as you go head-to-head with both legacy and some of the other next-generation vendors? and then also with the progress on your platform, are you sharing any metrics or give any rough color on how upsells going and how maybe some of your new customers are landing with more than just one product from cylance?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
i get the first part about the legacy. what's the second part? was it about platform and the ability to upsell. is that right, mike?
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
just how you're going? any metrics on customers taking more than one cylance module?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
i see. i don't have that information handy with me. so either we're going to have to follow up with you [inaudible] john chew on that information. and the legacy product line, it's interesting, we see actually the most progress we made against the legacy player, particularly in the mid-market where the mid-market doesn't really have a cecl [inaudible] what we offer, and particularly on guard which is the managed service, that's very well, resonates really well.
we see a pretty big strong growth. the numbers are not huge in terms of the actual amount of dollars, but the number of accounts that we're winning are reasonably sizable.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. i will pass it on.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question is from the line of luke junk with baird. your line is open.
luke junk -- baird -- analyst
hello there. good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. my first question, maybe a little bit of a bigger-picture question, john. i'd be curious to get your updated perspective on the auto software competitive landscape in regards to the iot business.
in the last few months here, we've seen both companies that haven't traditionally played in auto looking to make inroads here and in some cases, announcements with customers and some of the chip companies as well talking a bigger game of auto software, your thoughts on both, especially any comments that you build offer on your direct engagement with the chip companies and how that's evolved or incrementally grown recently? thank you.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
ok. that's a good question. so qnx is probably the biggest player in the auto embedded software space, particularly in the area of operating system and so we, by far, touch wood, with most of a big deal. i will refer you to the last two, three quarters of big win in bmw, in volvo, in volkswagen and a lot of the electric vehicle player.
because we occupy a pretty unique position on the stack. most people, when you talk about a big company, once again, in auto software, they tend to be more on the ui side, user interfaces, more on the infotainment side, but sell them on their core side of the deck, a case point is the announcement of that we won vw.os, volkswagen intend to build their own software stack. they do work with just a few players and the chip level up. and so we are one of the players because of operating system.
so as for your question -- so we feel pretty good about where we focus and the more mission-critical and safety certified components of our products, and there will be more that will come out. and we have -- just in case you don't remember this, but we have the highest level of iso certification in safety. so we feel pretty good about our position. and so as the question on chipset, probably the two or three biggest chip vendors that we work with are very committed to each other for a very longtime account in particularly two of them are qualcomm and nvidia.
and qualcomm and nvidia are quite dominant in the auto space. so we feel very comfortable in both our partnerships and their position in the market and our position in the market that doesn't overlap. so i think just being overly -- i don't want to change it obviously, but we feel pretty good. and in addition to that, even sales by google, at a quarter ago or two quarters ago [inaudible] hypervisor as google enjoy auto play.
so that will tell you something about the unique position we are in, but we are not really in contradiction to what they offer.
luke junk -- baird -- analyst
ok. thank you for the larger color then. and then staying within iot for my follow-up, you recently announced that you've gained certification in the aerospace market. and i was just hoping you can expand on the strategic approach to that market.
are there any parts of the market that you're focusing on initially? how are you investing and resourcing that initiative and anything similar that would be worth adding? thank you.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. this is a little early for us, but we do have the intent. and so when we look at the success in our auto market, it's really all rely on the highest level of safety certification. so we then -- and we have a new product that comes out that focus on high level of scalability.
and so if you think about this, and we think about, ok, who else, which vertical exhibit the same requirements, so needed the same requirement. so medical is one, industrial is one. and we've been doing reasonably well on what we call the general market -- general embedded market, which medical and industrial is in there. but we are very interested in the cycle of replacing some of the legacy software and the aerospace, particularly aircraft area.
and so this is why we want to make sure that we're certified so that a developer can reuse the code. and we likely will work through large system integrators like raytheon and [inaudible], but that's to the extent that i can share at this point.
luke junk -- baird -- analyst
that's -- we understand and helpful color. [inaudible] understand where you are headed. thank you.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
all right. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of paul treiber with rbc capital markets. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, paul.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, john. good afternoon. just i just wanted to follow up on your previous comments about auto software. what's changed in your mind in terms of the mentality of these auto oems and even google to adopt qnx as a foundational layer?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
well, it's a -- so first of all, qnx, the operating system has been in the business for over 30 years. and you all remember that on the extent some of it but it was way back when it was the infotainment company, it's actually long to harman. and blackberry bought it before my time, they bought it and was kind of creating an operating system with it. so, the safety certification has always been the claim the same.
and they want a lot of infotainment. so, what we have done since the time i arrived, what we have done is to expand from infotainment into areas of more safety-oriented and superior oriented on oriented applications actually related to a car. and of course, then in parallel, the world started to move toward the software-defined vehicle. so therefore, the oems are taking more control of the design, the stack, the software stack, ok? and -- but they also know that they can't just sit there and replicate their operating system and get it certified.  now some people try to use say automotive grade linux, agl, but agl couldn't get it certified, and it's an open source also with a -- has its own business challenges to it.
so, they gradually all came back to qnx. and that's the reason why. and then being having over 200 million cars that use our software today effectively, you will send a pretty sizable market for a lot of other players to ignore. so, on player to be ignored.
so, this is why google works with us and qualcomm works with us and nvidia work with us, and gi works with us, and [inaudible] works with us, and it's a long list of players that all uses us as a foundational piece, and then we'll continue to expand application or different types of features in that foundation base.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. the -- and it's in my next question. like how do you think about the economics within the foundational layer? and what's the strategy to try to maximize economics over the long term?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
it's -- well, our strategy is obviously use more of more of our foundational modules in the stack. and so -- that's the basic strategy. and then if you have multiple copies and then as we get deeper into the engine and deeper into the safety side of the equation of a car operation, it will -- the qnx will be able to demand or command a little bit more arpu. so we have more copies and higher-value copies like hypervisor is to have a higher value than infotainment.
for example, that's kind of move up the stack in arpu and broaden it to be multiple copies in the cart. this is our strategy in general for the business strategy side. and then don't forget ivy, because ivy is our next-generation push into ehs to cloud. and it not only provides security and privacy, it also provides economics because cloud-only solution is too expensive, and it's too much data being generated along the operation of a car.
so don't forget about that. so we feel that we have a pretty good one, two, three functions on the auto space or at least on the iot side, and we're going to expand it beyond auto, as i said. but today, we're very focused on auto.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and just if i can just squeeze in one more. just in regard to the patent portfolio, i mean i know it's -- you're limited in terms of what you can say. but how should we think about the time frame that the clock is ticking in terms of the ability to monetize the patents. as the time goes on, does it -- buying the patents decrease to you or to a potential buyer? or is there a way to get back damages, per se or back royalties and so the time is less critical?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. assume there are two data points, you already answered one, which is those that needed our license will have to address the path deployment. so it's not just time ticking away and therefore. so that's one of the answers to your question.
the other one is there is a miss out there about the time. there was an article published that's actually incorrect, and it's actually incorrectly almost throughout the entire article about the number of years for our portfolio and the value of that, that is absolutely not true. because if it had been true, then you would have -- you wouldn't have to be syndicate to wanted to make this thing happen. so i will just leave it at that.
i don't want to do a public debate with the writer, but i'm sorry, the writer is absolutely wrong. even though this article has been around for a little while, this was reprint by a newspaper that would like to, i guess, contextualize something that is not true. and anyway, i'll leave it at that. so yes, we could capture the path deployment and no, it's not that short of life.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you for clarifying.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
absolutely.
operator
your next question is from the line of todd coupland with cibc. your line is now open.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
hey there. good evening. i wanted to ask you about the cyber unit. you indicated you still expect revenue to be roughly flat year-on-year.
but implied in that comment is a seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter. and i'm just wondering, is that also still expected in line with prior expectations. and i just wanted you to close the logic on that point with growth expected early in fiscal 2024?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
earlier in fiscal 2024?
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
well, you commented on arr growth expected early next year.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
of course, yes, yes, yes. it's a little bit of a complicated set of math, but i'll focus on the kind of the high level. so yes, our q4 pipeline is a lot more bigger than q3. and so we believe that, therefore, my statement about the revenue relatively flat in line with the last fiscal year, it's a proper statement.
and then there will be some billings growth because of that. and then we also take a look at what the -- where the headwinds are. and if you look at all the headwinds from all the deals that we expected to either get or renewed and ones that are being attacked, especially the mid-market state, we believe that the major part of our headwind is behind us. we'll be behind us after q4, sorry, i should say that because we kind of look through it on a quarterly basis.
so therefore, next fiscal year, i don't know whether it's q1 or definitely q2, that we expect arr to have a year-over-year increase, and we should continue that trend going forward.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
and on that point --
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
does that answer your question?
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
yes, that's clear. and on that point, just remind us what you think the potential growth in cyber is once you start to benefit from improved product bundling and go-to-market?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
you saw the three-year plan that we put out -- a three- and five-year plan further release. in fact, i had recently presented to the board, we have not deviated from that, we're not deviating from that at all. so you can see that from a john [inaudible] group, the cybersecurity group, the compounded annual growth should be roughly about 10%. so that will be what we will focus on getting.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. thank you very much for the clarity.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
sure. of course.
operator
your final question comes from the line of trip chowdhry with global equities research. your line is open.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, trip.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
thank you. very solid execution in a brutal environment. two questions. first, i had this regarding your volkswagen deal, which is very significant.
can you give me some directional guidance in a sense that some metrics like you won the design, it's a design win, what should we be thinking in terms of production revenues once these vehicles go into production, how should we think, is it 1x, 2x, 3x the design win revenues? is production usually more than design wins? any color on that will be helpful. and then i have a follow-up question.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
ok. ok. so in general, i do auto because our backlog numbers are based on the auto. so in general, if you look at a cycle of an auto win somewhere between seven to 10 years.
so what we will see upfront is that probably on an overall -- let's say, a deal brings us $1 million. i'm making this up, ok? on total lifetime, obviously, it's a lot bigger than that. but let's just start with $1 million. so i would say the 10% upfront probably is something that we should expect and could expect on development fees.
and then probably there are some professional services revenue. so i will put it again in the range of 5% to 10%. now the bulk of the production will come a year normally four, five, six, seven, eight. however, we see that compressing because of all the -- because we're going electrified, right, the electrification, the electric vehicle market turns the product cycle a lot faster and particularly with the chinese.
the chinese is telling it around a cycle of three to five years instead of seven to 10. so -- and everybody else will probably have to keep up and whether they will get to three or five years, who knows. but it will shorten the seven to 10 years. so we get a little bit of upfront, which is always nice.
and then we get some professional services, and then we will get the production royalty.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
excellent. now i was also wondering, you have a very solid offering in terms of ivy. and today, you mentioned the hybrid approach that is in cloud and on device, which is a vehicle which is, i think, very novelty -- very novel, because you don't want the oem to be finalized for success where the success means more data. and if the whole objective is to put the data into the cloud, you, that is, blackberry or the oem purely like a resell around aws.
so i like that strategy big time. but i was wondering if you, that is, if there's a customer who is like volkswagen, which is already standardized on oem. are there any plans you may have to make migration or at least experimentation with ivy, like just a mouse-click away, do we have anything like that in plans? and that's all for me.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yes. that's a good question. i don't want to turn this into an announcement but let me just say that it is logical. it will be -- maybe put it differently.
it will be illogical for blackberry not to take advantage of all the assets. and there is a good reason why both ivy and qnx is in the same iot group.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
very good.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, tim. good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. this was a quarter where blackberry made good progress based on leading indicators for both the iot and the cyber businesses. blackberry beat expectation for both total company revenue and earnings per share.
on the iot side, we saw the business performing very strongly, setting yet another record for design-phase revenues. the strategic decision made over five years ago to position qnx as the trusted foundation for high-performance edge compute, especially in auto, is really bearing fruit. on the cyber side, in light of what we said last quarter, we saw an improvement in the level of churn that we experienced recently. the investment being made in product and go-to-market continue to drive sequential billings growth in our cyber business.
let me start my review with the iot business unit. as mentioned, it was another strong quarter. revenue was 51 million, a 19% year-over-year increase. gross margin was 80%.
preproduction revenue, that is revenue from developers' seat -- development seats and professional services set another record. this strength is being driven by significant new design wins. in fact, in the first six months of this fiscal year, blackberry added more new royalty backlog than in any prior 12 months period. and then, momentum continued this past quarter with wins in a number of verticals, but particularly in the safety-critical auto adas, advanced driver assist, and digital content domain where we are significantly gaining market share.
the largest win in the quarter includes a win with aptiv to use the qnx hypervisor and rtos to power a digital cockpit for european oem. other auto wins include a design with daimler truck and instrument cluster design win with tier 1 supplier marelli for a leading japanese automaker, and a design with a leading chinese tier 1 supplier for an adas driver-assist module. in the quarter, we secured a total of 24 new design wins with nine in auto and 15 in the general embedded market, or gem. in gem, we secured design wins with medical, industrial, as well as defense and aerospace.
among the use cases was an autopilot flight control system, a naval combat system, and a retinal surgery robotics, to name just a few. looking forward, we continue to see a very strong pipeline of upcoming new designs. we believe that we're strong -- we're in a strong position to convert this opportunity into wins given our recent success rate, our very strong reputation in the market, and of course, the strength of our technology. though industrywide macro backdrop for auto remains mixed, we see strength in china and india, both significant markets for qnx.
on the flip side, we see some tightening in north america and europe, primarily due to ongoing supply chain and some demand challenges. however, it is important to give this some context. while production volume is an important factor in qnx total revenue, the auto industry's significant shift to the software-defined vehicle and the development program that drives this has enabled us to deliver a double-digit revenue growth. this quarter, was made -- we made a major product announcement for qnx in the cloud.
at the amazon re:invent conference, aws announced that qnx will be made available to system supply developers via their cloud-native virtual engineering workbench. being able to access qnx in a cloud greatly reduced the time to market for developers and provides significant additional market reach for blackberry. qnx will be accessible by aws' large and growing community of over 1 million developers across multiple verticals, not just auto. we had very positive feedback from both this demonstration and early access product made available to selected oems and tier 1s.
we expect to provide more details on the general availability at ces. moving now to a new and exciting use cases for our certicom technology. in the quarter, we deliver a electric vehicle charging station pki, public key infrastructure, solution for a leading north america automotive oem. the solution enables the vehicle and ev charging stations to identify and establish trusted connectivity, as well as allowing oem to meet the new international standard for secure vehicle-to-grid interfaces.
these capabilities opens a significant opportunity for blackberry to secure critical smart city infrastructure in the future. given the strength of the iot business, going into q4, we expect revenue to come in at the high end of the range we provided previously. we, therefore, now expected our full-year revenue outlook to be in a range of 205 million to 210 million, which translate to 15% to 18% year-on-year growth. let me now move to ivy.
proof-of-concept trials for customer continue to progress well. product development also remain on track with the latest version released last week as planned. we have some significant product demonstration of ivy this past quarter. last month, at the bosch connectedworld in berlin, the ivy platform was running in a peugeot car and enabling predictive maintenance in-car payments and amazon alexa virtual assistant applications.
ivy was also shown operating in a cloud at aws re:invent conference in las vegas, and a developer workshop held there were well attended by oem and tier 1s. feedback from both events was very positive. we also added a new application from roadside telematics to the ivy ecosystem this quarter. roadside telematics is a california-based start-up aiming to use sensor data from blackberry ivy to provide automatic notification to 911 emergency service in the event of a crash.
let me now turn to our cybersecurity business. revenue for the quarter was 106 million. on the sequential basis, billing increase for the second consecutive quarter to 103 million. gross margin was a was 57%.
arr was 313 million. the dollar-based net retention rate was 84%. in line with our comment last quarter, we see signs that the investment in product and people are starting to pay off. the rate of churn seen recently has improved this quarter with an uptick in renewal rates and, with it, an improved quarter-over-quarter change in arr.
turning now a bit to the macro environment. we've seen the same, as many other software companies, including those in cybersecurity, in noticing some elongation of sales cycles during the past quarters. therefore, it is likely that the macro environment will be a headwind for the business in the near term, although we're likely to fare better than most given our heavy skewed toward regulated customers, particularly government. furthermore, cybersecurity still remains a essential purchase.
touching briefly on the oem market specifically. this past quarter, industry analysts noted increase adoption of uem solution in regulated environment. in the quarter, despite the macro challenges, we secure a great number of multiyear transaction than previously. this includes both renews and account expansions.
the customer include some of those with the highest security needs anywhere in the world, such as multiple agency in the u.s. department of homeland security, the u.s. defense intelligence agency, and the national guard. also, the u.s.
missile defense agency; the pan-european missile system company, mbda; as well as the nato headquarter, will also improve our blackberry secure voice solution for official nato communications. also, within government were shared services canada, the u.s. department of justice, the fbi, the u.s. department of treasury, as well as the u.s.
department of energy. outside of the north america, we secure business with the australian federal court, the government of iceland, the government of wales, the scottish police, and the german ministry of home affairs. in financial services, we did business with bank of china, credit agricole, blackstone investment management, singapore dbs bank, german kfw bank, as well as the german federal state bank. finally, i'll mention that we continue to win in other verticals too, with examples including johnson and johnson; a leading law firm, sullivan & cromwell; as well as switzerland abb, a leading electric equipment manufacturer.
some of you will hopefully have joined us for our security summit at the new york stock exchange in october. during the event, we announced the launch of a cyber threat intelligence subscription services that will provide customers with tailored threat briefings. this service will launch in january, and the initial response has been positive, particularly from the government agencies. turning to outlook.
we expect to see improvement in both customer churn and new logo acquisition continuing next quarter. we are not changing our outlook for -- by cyber revenue and billings. but as previously mentioned, q4 outlooks include some large potential government deals that the team is working hard to close. as always, with larger deal of this nature, timing can be predictable.
however, regardless of whether we were able to close these deals in time for q4 or if they slip into q1, we expect to deliver sequential billings growth in the quarter. this would mean sequential billings growth for the third quarter in a row. once more, we currently expect to see the value of billings in q4 exceeding revenue. this is a strong leading indicator, and we expect a return to arr growth in the second half of next fiscal year.
let me now move to licensing. revenue in the quarter came in higher than expected at 12 million. gross margin was 67%. in the quarter, we recognized revenue related to royalties from past licensing deals, and they came in stronger than expected.
let me now turn the call over to steve, who will provide more details on our financial.
steve rai -- chief financial officer
thank you, john. as usual, my comments on our financial performance for the third quarter will be in non-gaap terms unless otherwise noted. total company revenue for the quarter was 169 million. total company gross margin was 64%.
operating expenses for the third quarter were 137 million. these non-gaap operating expenses exclude 56 million fair value gain on the convertible debentures, 22 million in amortization of acquired intangibles, and 8 million in stock compensation expense. blackberry remains in a targeted investment mode, meaning our capital allocation strategy is for aggressive investment in our iot business to capitalize on the strong opportunities we see in front of us there, and for strategic investments in our cybersecurity business to drive both top-line growth, as well as deliver profitability. these investments are discretionary and can be eased back if required.
the strategy is starting to pay off with iot winning record levels of new designs and the trajectory of the cyber business improving. given these investments, we continue to expect manageable eps loss and cash usage in the near term. the gaap operating loss for the third quarter was 2 million, and the non-gaap operating loss was 28 million. now, turning to the balance sheet and cash flow.
total cash, cash equivalents, and investments were 505 million at november 30th 2022. free cash usage in the quarter, before accounting for the settlement of a prior legal case, was 22 million. that concludes my comments, and i'll turn the call back to john.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
ok. all right. thank you, steve. before we open up the line for q&a, let me recap on the key messages.
we are pleased with the progress made. sorry, because i think steve missed a few points in his notes. anyway, we appreciate the progress made by both our core business unit this quarter. the iot business unit continues to deliver strong 19% year-over-year revenue growth despite the macro headwind.
the cybersecurity business unit trajectory is progressing with the improved level of churn and increase in multiyear deals, as well as new logos. and finally, a quick update on the ip patent portfolio sale. as we said before, there are two main interested parties. i'm pleased to say that tremendous progress has been made with both of them.
catapult, who you know now has -- now has motivated financing partners lined up, and all parties are currently negotiating the final documents. the second party is a large pe firm that doesn't need external financing. they have completed their due diligence, and term sheets discussion are well advanced. we obviously will keep you updated as things progress.
that concludes my -- that concludes my remarks. matt, could you please open the line for q&a?

thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] we request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. and our first question will come from luke junk with baird.
please go ahead.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi.
luke junk -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. a couple of questions related to this iot business. first, john, if we could get any additional color on the subcomponents of your auto software business in iot, specifically if there's anything you'd be able to add on the preproduction parts of that business, of course.
but also be interested in any commentary on royalty trends looking forward and how that might lay out over the next few quarters or into next year in terms of launch activity that you have a line of sight too in the business. thank you.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
it didn't come across clearly.
luke junk -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
so --
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
luke --
luke junk -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes, this is luke from baird. breaking down iot revenue, we've obviously said that the preproduction piece is at record levels. any other comments, i'm guessing, around royalties?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
oh, i could tell you what typical year -- would a typical year -- typical quarter or year, actually. in our general guidelines, about 40% of our revenue coming from royalty, 40% coming from developer seats as well, professional, so -- and then -- sorry. and then 20% come from -- come from -- will come from services. that's kind of our rule of thumb.
yes, it didn't -- it didn't come across very clear on the microphone. so, luke, sorry about it. if you could --
tim foote -- vice president, investor relations
perhaps the question, luke, if i could rephrase, is, is there any color on -- on royalties, given the strength that we've seen in design phase [inaudible]
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
well, i mean, royalty is pretty much tied to production. the industry, auto production, basically, we're proportionately about the same, meaning that we expect, what, 85 million cars being built this year. so, it's a little probably about 10%, 15% down from previous pre-covid years. so, that -- that give you some guideline of what the royalty is like. 
luke junk -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
and i'll just leave it there given the bad connection and take it offline. thank you.
operator
our next question will come from mike walkley with canaccord genuity. please go ahead.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, mike.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
hey, john. just -- just maybe a follow-up on the -- on the iot question. just based on, you know, some of the -- the record level you're seeing for the design phase revenue and particularly in adas, you know, as these cars go into production in future years, you know, how should investors think about maybe the magnitude of a royalty per car versus, you know, current infotainment system today?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, yeah, that's -- that's a good question. so the arpu, which is you asking basically the arpu questions, you know, our targeted arpu remains to be $25 a car. and -- and of course, we were quite a big business from it.
however, if you look at the infotainment world, the infotainment world now down to probably $1 to $2 a car. on the other hand, you know, adas is probably pushing high single-digit dollars $8, $9 -- $7, $8, $9. so, that's how -- any newer features, you know, cockpit, clusters, you know, vehicle-to-vehicle communications and stuff, they all have reasonable dollar amount tied to it, certainly a -- you know, a factor about the infotainment.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. that's helpful. my follow-up question just -- just on the cybersecurity business and, you know, more maybe the endpoint and competitive landscape. you know, i know there's a share for cylance to gain from like the [inaudible] and trend micro, but, you know, there's several next-generation competitors that are pretty price aggressive and they're also talking about elongated deal cycles.
so, could you kind of update us on what you're seeing and what's giving you that confidence to return to arr growth in the second half of next year?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, we have a pretty elaborate model and spreadsheets between the cyber business units and the finance organization in the company. and it looks like that, you know, returning to arr second half of next year is quite real -- i mean, arr growth -- sorry, year-over-year arr growth the second half of next year. probably pretty stable in the first half, and that's obviously based on the pipeline we have today. you know, we factor in a little bit of the pushout and -- and then, of course, the renewal of some of the -- you know, the government contract.
one -- one of our challenges is we have so many government contracts, and they typically buy on an annual basis because that's all the budgets they have. and they can only they only spend what they have approved budgets on. so -- so -- so, that's one thing that we -- we faces. but on the other hand, the good news in there is that the government -- government customers are quite steady and stable, and their buying patterns are pretty steady also.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
ok, thanks. maybe one last question and -- and i'll pass the line. john, just your thoughts on the macro environment heading into next year. you guys have ample cash on the balance sheet.
and if you end up selling the licensing business, you should have more cash on the balance sheet. but as you look into a challenging macro, how are you guys thinking about balancing investment for growth versus, you know, preserving free cash flow?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
good questions. where we are right now -- and you listened to what steve outlined -- that we are in a kind of a very careful investment mode. in iot, we are definitely investing in hiring. we are winning a lot of the deals.
i wouldn't say all the ideas, but a majority of the deals, particularly in the adas world and the cockpit world, in the hypervisor world. so, we believe the momentum, you know, the kind of a tailwind is -- it's there for us and we wanted to capture it. so, we will be hiring engineers. we'll be hiring professional services people.
we are expanding our sales force, pilot programs, and everything else. on the cyber side, john giamatteo is balancing the growth of the arr and the billings, balancing that with the profitability so the growth will -- the investment there will still be there, but probably will be a little slower and with an eye to the bottom line given the uncertainty of the macro, as you pointed out. so, it's kind of a little bit of a tale of two cities here. one -- one is just keep growing because we got the momentum, and the other one is we want to do a more balancing, more guarded growth.
mike walkley -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. thanks for taking my questions and happy holidays to everybody on the call.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
 yes. thank you. same to you.
operator
our next question will come from todd coupland with cibc. please go ahead.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, todd.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
hey there, john. good evening. can you hear me ok? 
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. 
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
all right. sounds like the cibc internet mic is -- is working fine. i wanted to -- to ask you about, first -- first, on the cyber business, so basically saying flat year on year in the first half with some growth in the -- in the -- in the second half. how much -- how much more work is needed to bring the updated sales team and whatever other new product bundles you're contemplating actually get to those -- those ranges that you're talking about?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
i think we are net growing the sales force, meaning that sales force size is increasing modestly. and so, we don't have to have any mysterious program or -- or very aggressive program of some sort in order to achieve what i just said. i think, you know, we -- we all feel pretty comfortable -- in the cyber business unit feel comfortable, they be able -- they be able to be flattish in the first half. only reason that that is flattish, by the way, as a reminder, we were expecting growth in -- in the past for the first half is because of the so-called elongating sales cycle.
so, we expect it to be flattish for six months and then pick up again. and that's really a lot more macro driven rather than us having to do some special things. so, by and large, i mean, we have a road map of technology, but none of the stuff that i talked about depending on a particular product. i think the products are in pretty good shape.
we do need to continue to drive the channel, continue to increase the professional services, particularly the msp. i think those are the two things that needs to happen, but it's part of our plan to make happen anyway. so, nothing really special.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. that's -- that's helpful. and then, i had a question on, i guess, the movements on the balance sheet. so, i think in the past, the price for the patent licensing business is 600 million.
does -- does that potentially change if the second party comes in? like, if they get into the mix here, is the takeaway that you're going to get to 600 million or possibly higher? or is it just they get there first and they can close the deal? what's -- what's the message on that?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, i'm sorry, i shouldn't comment on it. i know the questions and i understand. of course, i have the answer, but it's unfair to both parties while we're negotiating in parallel. so, if you don't mind, just hold off with that until we made the announcement.
i'm expecting the announcement or the conclusion of this relatively soon.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
i see. but -- but the takeaway is that the confidence level with the second party has gone up from the last time we talked about this, where financing was in question, to where it's -- the probability of getting that 600 million is -- has gone up materially with -- with that, and then the other the initial party getting financing. [inaudible]
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, the -- again, i can't go into the structure, but the initial party, the confidence level had had -- you're right, has dramatically gone up.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
ok. should we -- should we take away, given the delay and the two parties here, that the -- the structure that was announced before is -- is potentially open to some adjustments?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
very minor.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
i see. ok. ok. and then just for one follow-up, balance sheet question, one of the debentures is due in about a year.
any messaging on paying it down versus refinancing at this point?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
oh, i think we're going to pay it down.
todd coupland -- cibc world markets -- analyst
you know -- the message is pay that down, ok. all right. great. thanks very much.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah.
operator
our next question will come from trip chowdhry with global equities research. please go ahead.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, trip.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
hello. this is still a very good quarter, considering the backdrop. two questions i have. whenever we are in a recession, the federal government usually opens up their budgets.
the budgets increase to offset the collapse of the economy. have you seen any federal government agency or across the globe who may have at least not reduced their budgets and may be thinking of increasing their budget yet? or you haven't seen anything like that so far?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
well, it's a mixed bag, trip. so, as far as cyber investment, i have not seen government back away from it, particularly the government that we deal with, which is probably about g-7, g-25, depending on the level that we're at, five eyes country, for example. so, no, we have not seen the budget being cut or reduced in an it spending and cyber spending. so, that's good news.
there are some very selective pockets, nato spending a little bit more, germany spending a lot more from -- from an it defense point of view. and -- and canadian government also spend more and supporting ukraine, for example. so, u.s., the money are there, a little bit more driven toward the more social program. so -- so, it's kind of a -- i can't give you a yes or no answer.
it kind of depends on the various government that we're keeping very close tabs with. and -- and -- but on the overall scale, i haven't seen the government reduce their it budget yet.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
very good. second question, as we are seeing a lot of new vehicles coming into the market and each one of them have at least two or three features, one, either the screens are really very big in the vehicles or they have multiple screens, do you think that changes the royalty stream for you? like, if a vehicle, say, just three or four years back, only had one tiny screen, now, on an average, they are three or four screens front entertainment, rear-seat entertainment, overhead entertainment, you name it, videoconferencing, just that. do you think there is a potential to increase some royalties because of the multi-screen approach that is new -- at least ev manufacturers are bringing to the market? and that's all for me. happy holidays to all of you.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank. thank you, trip. happy holidays to you, too. i don't believe -- i mean, i don't know multi-screen will bring me more copies.
however, there is a trend in software-designed vehicle either for redundancy purposes or multi -- mpu purposes, particularly as the capacity requirement goes up, they are using more copies of qnx, so -- so --
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
very good.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
so, it is more of an architectural point rather than a display point.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
i got it. i got it. i got it. very nice.
and then, from the same token, i think if we go from 5g to 6g of the royalty stream because of more use cases and more qnx copies and redundancy and resiliency, we may directionally see per vehicle royalties to directionally go up rather than go down.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
oh, yeah. i don't see -- i mean, there are two points to it. number one, we have not seen the royalty of qnx going to go down any time soon. in fact, more copy is expected for a car, and it should -- the revenue should have gone -- should go up.
in addition to that, don't forget we have ivy behind it, which are -- when a capacity goes -- goes up, you know, our usage of ivy goes up. so, wait till that get into production. and i'm hopeful that that will bring us also a good revenue stream.
trip chowdhry -- global equities research -- analyst
excellent. excellent. thank you very much. we look forward to seeing you all at the ces conference.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from paul treiber with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, paul.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, how's it going? i was just hoping you can speak to on the cyber business, the mechanics around ndr, you know, which declined sequentially versus your comment on improved churn. you know, can you speak to some of the moving parts there? and then, specifically, can you -- can you break out churn -- or the trends there in terms of uem versus epp?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
good -- good -- good questions. so, in general, as -- as we have indicated in the beginning of the year, the churn is coming from the uem base, small, medium -- small, medium enterprise. we have seen that as a consistent scheme -- consistent theme, but that has slowed down now quite a bit. at least the last quarter we have seen a slowing.
in fact, we are seeing that big a deal going a little bit more multi-year with us. i think uem is now definitely stabilized. it is also being viewed more strategic by the market. and gartner actually recently wrote a note on it.
and we we are seeing the same thing. customers are starting to see -- to treat uem, rather than a price item, is now starting to look at it a little bit more strategically, particularly on the cybersecurity side, as a factor of their cybersecurity. the last quarter, something have happened that causes the infrastructure and mobile infrastructures management, endpoint management, to be relooked at in importance. you probably know this, obviously.
a number of banks in the united states has been fined for using, you know, a messaging technology that are not the most secure or archivable. i think -- i think that forces all the banks' cio starting to look at the completeness of their infrastructure. so, obviously, the uem is a technology that been around for a long time. this is not just blackberry uem, you know, other established player uem also, obviously.
so, i'm answering your question a kind of a long roundabout way. the churn slowdown, still kind of contained within the smb and the uem space. and -- and we -- as i said, we see a slowdown. we haven't seen it anywhere else.
we definitely have not seen it on epp. epp seems to be holding its own.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
it's helpful to understand that. just on -- on your -- your point about the -- the settlement with the banks, i mean, does it seem like -- like when you look at banking or regulated industries, it seems like there's a shift away from bring-your-own-device to corporate-owned devices. do you see that in -- in other industries other than just -- just banking? and then, you know, how do you see that in, relatively speaking, helping blackberry from a -- from a product positioning or from a competitive position?
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
so -- so, when -- when the banks goes to corporate issued, they are typically looking at a high level of security and archivability, and that's where our strength comes in. so, we're known to be the most secure mobile platform that is -- that exists. so -- and i think there's not a lot of debate over that in the industry. so -- so, that helps us a lot.
and as far as i'm seeing in the industry, maybe different government branches and law enforcement, i have not seen other major verticals said go to corporate -- corporate-issued device or -- or at least swing back from a byod to corporate-issued devices.
paul treiber -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you for taking the questions and happy holidays.
john chen -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
