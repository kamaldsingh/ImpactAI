[operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to michael katz, senior vice president of investor relations. mr. katz, please go ahead.
mike katz -- senior vice president, head of investor relations and enterprise fp&a
thank you, and good morning. welcome to voya financial's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings conference call. we appreciate all of you who have joined us for this call.
as a reminder, materials for today's call are available on our website at investors.voya.com or via the webcast.
turning to slide 2. some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law. this includes potential impacts related to covid-19. i refer you to this slide for more information. we will also be referring today to certain non-gaap financial measures. gaap reconciliations are available in our press release and financial supplements found on our website, investors.voya.com.
joining me on the call are rod martin, voya financial's chairman and chief executive officer, as well as mike smith, voya's chief financial officer. after their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. for that q&a session, we have also invited the heads of our businesses, specifically, charlie nelson, retirement, christine hurtsellers, investment management, and rob grubka, employee benefits.
with that, let's turn to slide 3 as i would like to turn the call over to rod.
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning. let's begin on slide 4 with some key themes.
despite the many challenges of 2020, our q4 and full year results reflect strong financial performance and the power of our unique culture. we leverage the strength of our brand and our long-standing distribution relationships to attract and retain clients. we provided resources, fee credits and the new workplace programs to help our customers address the impacts of covid-19 on their health and wealth needs and we had candid conversations inside and outside our company about the racial inequity in our country and how voya can do even better to address these issues. all of this would not have been possible without our people.
despite every challenge, they focused on the needs of our clients with extraordinary professionalism and care. voya stands apart in our industry because of our people, our unique portfolio of workplace in institutional businesses and our commitment to our customers. this has enabled us to deliver strong bottom line results, top line growth and capital return that reflect the benefits of our diverse business mix of high free cash flow businesses.
turning to our earnings performance. fourth quarter normalized eps was $1.44, growing 21% year-over-year. our full year normalized eps was $4.81, representing a 14% increase compared with 2019. included in these results was significant organic growth in our businesses. we continued to see robust demand for our products and services. we are attracting new clients and retaining existing clients who value our expertise and capabilities.
for retirement, full year 2020 full-service recurring deposits grew nearly 7% year-over-year, reaching $11.1 billion. in investment management, we generated $8.4 billion of net inflows during 2020, representing 5% organic growth and exceeding our target of 2% to 4%. and in employee benefits, in-force premiums grew approximately 7% year-over-year, reflecting growth in our voluntary business. we began 2021 by completing the sale of our individual life business on january 4. this transaction provides voya with $1.4 billion of deployable capital with up to $100 million of additional proceeds by 2025. we expect to eliminate all stranded costs associated with the transaction by year-end 2022.
more recently, as we announced on monday, we have entered into a definitive agreement with cetera financial, in which they acquire the independent financial planning channel of voya financial advisors. importantly, the transaction preserves our ability to support our workplace clients with their financial wellness needs as 600 field and phone-based advisors will remain part of voya financial advisors. this transaction will provide us with over $300 million of deployable proceeds upon closing, which we expect to occur in the second or third quarter. each of these transactions mark important milestones in our transformation to focus on serving the workplace and institutional clients. they are also additive to our already strong balance sheet and capital position. combined with the proceeds, we will receive from the individual life transaction, we will have approximately $1.8 billion in excess capital.
going forward, we'll continue to demonstrate our commitment to being good stewards of shareholder capital. we remain confident in our ability to return capital despite the low interest rate environment. we continue to view share repurchases as our primary usage of excess capital, and we intend to utilize the new $1 billion repurchase authorization that we receive from our board over the course of 2021. this will enable us to build upon the more than $6.5 billion in excess capital that we have returned to shareholders through share repurchases. over time, we expect that dividends will continue to be a larger contributor to returns. at the same time, we are open to opportunities to use capital in a way that will further advance our strategy and our plans to expand our services and reach among the workplace and with institutional clients.
turning to slide 5. we have maintained a strong focus on our values and culture throughout the year. most recently, we were honored to earn the following recognition, being named to the human rights campaign 2021 corporate equality index with a perfect score for the 16th consecutive year, becoming a 2020 best place to work by pensions & investments for the sixth consecutive year, earning inclusion on the bloomberg gender-equality index for the fifth consecutive year, and once again being named to newsweek's list of america's most responsible companies, which was established last year. additionally, in recognition of our voya cares efforts, we earned the 2020 caregiving organization of the year award from caregiving.com, for our comprehensive set of benefits and policies that support caregivers.
this year, the actions of our people validated that our values are genuine and authentic, and continued to distinguish voya with all of our stakeholders.
with that, let me ask mike to provide more details on our performance and results.
michael smith -- chief financial officer & interim chief risk officer
thank you, rod.
despite a very challenging environment in 2020, we delivered strong top and bottom line growth, return significant cash to shareholders, closed the life transaction, and we entered this year with robust pipelines, setting ourselves up for a terrific 2021. i'm very proud of all that our team accomplished and look forward to continued success in 2021 and beyond.
turning to slide 7. we delivered normalized after-tax adjusted operating earnings of $1.44 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. this excludes three items. first, $0.49 of prepayment and alternative income above our long-term expectations. third quarter equity market supported alternative results and helped drive full year performance back above our 9% long-term expectation. second, $0.18 of favorable dac/voba and other intangibles unlocking. and third, $0.21 of stranded costs associated with individual life and other closed blocks. with the closing of the life transaction, stranded costs net of asa/tsa revenues will be included in normalized adjusted operating earnings going forward.
on a full year basis, normalized after-tax adjusted operating earnings grew 14% to $4.81 in 2020, largely reflecting growth in investment management and employee benefit earnings and lower average share count. on a reported basis, adjusted operating earnings were $1.90 per share for the quarter and $3.22 for the full year. gaap net income was $341 million for the fourth quarter of 2020. this includes results from our individual life business for a final quarter. in fourth quarter, individual life covid-related losses were in line with our expectations, which drove unfavorable mortality.
moving to slide 8. retirement delivered $228 million of adjusted operating earnings, excluding unlocking in the fourth quarter, contributing to full year earnings of $592 million. return on capital was 13% in 2020 in line with 2019. fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings included alternative income that was $64 million above our long-term expectations.
full year results reflect higher fee income and investment spread than 2019, but was more than offset by higher administrative expenses. 2020 full-service fee-based revenue was higher year-over-year, driven by strong net inflows and favorable equity markets. full year record-keeping and other fee-based revenues were in line with prior year. increased fees from significantly higher record-keeping assets and record stable value inflows were mostly offset by a decline in sweep fee revenues within our retail wealth management business due to very low short-end rates. we also waived certain fees to help participants navigate covid-19 during the year.
full year investment spread increased year-over-year as higher transfers into fixed account options with lower crediting rates helped to alleviate some of the spread compression associated with lower rates. our full year administrative expenses were higher year-over-year. expenses in the year were generated by strong business growth and included investments in our business to better capitalize on workplace opportunities. we also incurred expenses onboarding a large number of participants throughout the year, and there were some notable items, including a legal accrual and an expense accrual true-up.
turning to deposits and flows. 2020 full-service recurring deposits grew to over $11 billion, almost 7% higher year-over-year. for the year, retirement generated full-service net inflows of $1.6 billion, largely reflecting strength in corporate markets. as anticipated, we experienced fourth quarter outflows of $2.3 billion, largely due to the departure of a large case tax-exempt client. we had a record year in stable value flows. net flow momentum continued into the fourth quarter, adding $761 million in net inflows to drive the full year total to $4.3 billion. record-keeping flows exceeded $24 billion in the year, including $1.9 billion of outflows in the fourth quarter, driven by known departures from clients that had given notification earlier in the year. this increased record-keeping participants 15% to 3.3 million. in 2020, we added 30 new government plans and nearly 350,000 participants. with those wins, voya is now the number one retirement plan provider in the government space.
we are excited by our commercial momentum going into 2021. 2020 was a year which illuminated new ways to efficiently win business across all the markets we operate in. we have a robust pipeline and continue to make the right investments to accelerate our workplace strategy to drive long-term success.
on slide 9. investment management delivered a record fourth quarter with $90 million of adjusted operating earnings. this contributed to full year earnings of $197 million, exceeding our 2019 results, primarily reflecting strong fee growth from higher institutional aum year-over-year. we realized exceptionally strong performance fees in the fourth quarter related to our mortgage investment fund. this was driven by strong full year 2020 investment performance. our full year 2020 adjusted operating margin, including investment capital was 28%, an increase from 26.6% in 2019.
turning to flows. in the fourth quarter, we experienced $2.4 billion in net outflows, primarily driven by known redemptions, including a large client withdrawal in the affiliated channel and year-end profit taking in funds with strong fixed income performance. we saw strength in our insurance channel. we issued two clos, including a euro-denominated clo, and we closed on several private mandates. despite the fourth quarter outflows, we still delivered full year 2020 net flows of $8.4 billion, representing organic growth of 5%, exceeding the high-end of our 2% to 4% target range. our fixed income performance remains strong. 90% of our fixed income funds outperformed the benchmark on a three-year basis and more than 96% did so on a five and 10-year basis.
looking ahead, while we see a few redemptions in the first quarter, we are starting '21 with the strongest pipeline of unfunded wins ever and see opportunities across multiple strategies. with a track record of five consecutive years of positive flows, we are confident we can achieve our 2% to 4% organic growth target in 2021.
turning to slide 10. employee benefits delivered $50 million of adjusted operating earnings in the fourth quarter. full year adjusted operating earnings were $204 million, slightly higher than the 2019 result of $199 million despite approximately $30 million in covid-related headwinds. the trailing 12-month return on capital remained over 30%. full year annualized in-force premiums grew nearly 7% year-over-year. total aggregate loss ratio for the year was 70% at the low end of our targeted range. group life loss ratios were elevated as they include covid-related claims. these claims were approximately $10 million in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with our expectation of $1 million to $2 million per 10,000 incremental deaths. we expect first quarter 2021 group life claims to be elevated relative to fourth quarter due to typical seasonality and continued covid claims. we are encouraged by the outcomes seen so far in our year-end renewal season. looking further ahead, we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive strong top line growth while maintaining pricing discipline, leveraging long-standing distribution partnerships and differentiated service capabilities to accelerate our workplace strategy.
turning to slide 11. our deferred tax asset remains a key source of value. the net present value of the deferred tax asset is $1.05 billion as of december 31, or over $8 per share. the change in npv reflects our utilization over the year. if enacted by the new administration, a higher corporate tax rate would help increase the value of our dta. under current tax rates, we now expect to utilize approximately 40% to 50% of our dta within the next five years. and we continue to expect to pay essentially no net cash taxes for the next five to eight years. and the dta contributes to our 90% plus free cash flow generation.
on slide 12, we provide items to consider for the first quarter of 2021. the first quarter 2021 will benefit from lower incentive compensation expense in corporate. fourth quarter incentive compensation was primarily related to strong fourth quarter alternatives and performance fees. the latter of which is not expected to recur in first quarter. offsetting first quarter items include investment management performance fees, net of variable compensation, are not expected to recur in the first quarter. corporate segment results will include net realized stranded costs now that the life transaction has closed, higher seasonal group life loss ratios and employee benefits combined with elevated claims driven by covid. we continue to expect our sensitivity range of $1 million to $2 million for 10,000 us covid-related deaths to hold. and other seasonal items, such has higher preferred stock dividends and administrative expenses related primarily to payroll taxes. while we have provided some items to consider, there will, of course, be other factors that affect first quarter results, including changes in our average share count, market impacts, business growth, and the potential for additional covid-19 impacts.
on slide 13, we are reintroducing guidance items for 2021, now that we have better line of sight on longer-term results. the results include impacts from both the life transaction and the recently announced financial planning channel transaction. we expect 2021 earnings per share to grow 8% to 12%, supported by growth across all businesses. we expect retirement to grow earnings at a commensurate 8% to 12%. within investment management, we will overcome the impact from the life transaction to have consistent earnings in 2021. that said, adjusting for the exceptional performance fees in fourth quarter, we expect growth of 8% to 12%.
in employee benefits, earnings are projected to increase modestly, in part due to the continuing impact of covid claims, but also due to an expectation that the favorable loss ratios in 2020 will moderate from a low end to the middle of our 70% to 73% range. also included on the slide are the assumptions underlying these growth expectations and earning sensitivities to macroeconomic factors and the pandemic. we believe the earnings growth expectations shown here present a compelling investment opportunity and demonstrate continued strong performance.
turning to slide 14. our diversified investment portfolio continues to perform well in the current environment. our estimated impact to excess capital in each stress case are unchanged. we have incurred a cumulative impact of approximately $100 million from a combination of net negative ratings migration and credit impairments. we expect the prospective impact through year-end 2021 to be roughly $200 million and $350 million in cases one and two, respectively, and this is before any active management. importantly, we view these potential impacts as manageable, given our excess capital and continued free cash flow generation. we continued to spotlight certain investments in our portfolio, including our commercial mortgage loans in the appendix. as of december 31, there are no outstanding loans in forbearance. overall, we remain comfortable with the quality of our commercial mortgage portfolio, which is more than 87% cm1 rated and has a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 46%.
slide 15. giving pro forma effect to the life transaction, our estimated rbc ratio is 498%, above our target of 400% and excess capital is $1.8 billion. as rod mentioned, we expect the sale of the independent financial planning channel to provide over $300 million of deployable proceeds when it closes later this year. this amount is not included in the pro forma amount i just mentioned.
we resumed share repurchases in the fourth quarter via an accelerated share repurchase agreement for $150 million, of which, $120 million was executed in the quarter. the remaining $30 million of repurchases was completed last month. we deployed over $500 million on share buybacks in 2020, despite uncertainty around covid-19 and its impacts. going forward, we expect to deploy our $1 billion authorization ratably over the course of 2021, while balancing investments we are making in the business to accelerate long-term growth. our financial leverage is roughly 30%, in line with our target. this is pro forma for the estimated gain on sale realized on the reinsurance portion of the life transaction.
this quarter, we are also introducing a new financial leverage ratio that more closely aligns with the assessments of the rating agencies. the new leverage ratio eliminates equity credit for hybrids and preferreds, and now includes aoci and noncontrolling interest. going forward, our target will be to manage this new financial leverage ratio to be below 30%. we continue to expect $600 million to $800 million of debt extinguishment this year, which we anticipate will occur in the second half of the year. finally, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 10% and to $0.165 per share. this affirms our confidence in the stability of our cash flows at over 90% free cash flow conversion. the higher dividend keeps our yield at over 1%, even if our share price were to increase meaningfully from current levels.
in summary, we are pleased to have closed the life transaction, leaving behind significant interest rate and tail liabilities with it. we believe our strong workplace and institutional franchises have proved resilient in challenging times and are poised for strong growth in 2021 and for long-term success. we generate high free cash flow and have a significant excess capital position. we will continue to act as good stewards of capital as we look to deploy proceeds in the best interest of shareholders.
with that, i will turn the call back to the operator so that we can take your questions.

our first question today is coming from ryan krueger from kbw. your line is now live.
ryan krueger -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
hi, good morning. i had a question on m&a. i know this is -- the potential to do bolt-on m&a is not exactly a new topic, but it did seem a little bit more prominent in your language on at this quarter. so i wanted to understand if it's more of a priority now, or if it's just something that you would consider doing if there were opportunistic properties that emerged?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
ryan, it's rod. mike and i and the team will toggle as usual. ryan, our philosophy on capital management remains the same. we're going to be disciplined on shareholder value, that very much includes m&a. we're excited about what mike and i just talked about in terms of deploying $1 billion of share buyback this year. as mike just shared, we will have $1.8 billion in excess capital, and we are looking to both invest in our business and looking at inorganic opportunities to focus on the growth in our business, and this is really to improve outcomes and the experience for our customers. so we will consider this. we are looking at ways that we can enhance the experience for our customers. and we aren't prepared to speculate on size or preference other than to say it's highly reinforcing of our workplace and institutional focus.
ryan krueger -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
understood. thanks. and then just could you is -- probably for christine, could you provide a little bit more color on the strong pipeline in investment management and the expectations there as we go through the year?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
christine?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
sure, ryan. so ryan, as you think about it, i know when you look at our guidance, we're forecasting flattish flows in the first quarter. there are a few known redemptions but also uncertain timing in terms of unfunded wins. so how do we see the pipeline? well, number one, we're starting the year with the largest a level of unfunded one but unfunded wins that we've had at $4.7 billion and that doesn't include the pipeline, what we call when we're either in the finals or semifinals. and the exciting thing about the unfunded wins, ryan, is that we have over 10 strategies represented in nearly 40 different clients. so think of it as being diverse and robust. so when you look at our guidance, we're guiding to 2% to 4% organic growth. we're going to continue to leverage our exceptionally strong investment performance, the products that we have, both in public and private asset classes as well as we've got a great distribution team.
so overall, very confident that we're going to hit that range. and so again, recognizing we've had -- just think about negative outflows as far as life happens episodic because when you look at our history, we've delivered five years of positive cash flows, five straight years. and so i'm confident we're going to be delivering six.
ryan krueger -- keefe, bruyette & woods -- analyst
thank you.
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ryan.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from suneet kamath from citi. your line is now live.
suneet kamath -- citi -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i wanted to start with retirement, if i could. maybe a similar question to ryan's on investment management. charlie, can you give us a sense of maybe what the pipeline looks like there in terms of transfer deposits and maybe how today it compares to prior years?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
charlie?
charles p. nelson -- chief executive officer, retirement & employee benefits
sure. thank you. yeah, transfer deposits and the activities on our total deposits are looking very, very strong. we saw an improvement in increase, i should say, in rfps in the quarter, and even in january, we saw an increase in rfps year-over-year, and that's leading to higher notifications. we continue to see improved notification, similar to what christine was just referring to. these are notifications where we are awarded the plan it just waits to be funded. so from a transfer deposit, and it's not just in our corporate markets where we've had 29 quarters of full-service net -- positive net flows, but it's also coming in our tax-exempt business in the first quarter and in early part of 2021. so that's kind of underpinning a fair bit of the confidence in our net flows and outlook for '21.
suneet kamath -- citi -- analyst
got it. and then i guess, if i could shift over to capital. i guess, rod, if we sit here and think about the $1.8 billion going to $2.1 billion, once you close the independent financial planner sale, yes, that's a pretty sizable amount of excess capital. and i know if i think back to the years around the time of the ipo, you guys used to commit to deploying 100% of the excess capital sort of over the subsequent 12 months. and i know the world is different today with covid. but if we assume that there's no major negative shocks or new surprises, is that still a reasonable expectation for investors that you would deploy kind of the full $2.1 billion over the next 12 months?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
suneet, what we've just communicated was for 2021, we are committing $1 billion of the excess capital in the form of share buyback, principally ratably. you have seen us generally lean in and out depending on market conditions, but we're highly confident in communicating that, which i do realize leaves a balance, and that balance will be used in the same judgment and experience that we've used in creating the $6.7 billion of capital that we've returned to date. and what do i mean by that? we're going to continue to look for ways to invest in our business organically. we will look for opportunities inorganically that makes sense in furthering and strengthening the solutions around workplace and on health and wealth. and of course, we're going to continue to have an eye toward returning capital in a very constructive way to shareholders. so we tried to frame it around that. we -- it gives us an enormous amount of flexibility. we're in an enviable position, in my view, to play offense as we move into 2021.
you've heard from charlie and christine this morning, the momentum that we have as we finished 2020 and go into 2021, we're highly encouraged about and we're going to let the year play out. i will remind, suneet, all of us that we still are facing covid. and we're encouraged about the vaccines we're encouraged there's a light at the end of this period of time. but this will be with us, certainly for the first half of this year, which is why we're going to be prudent as we approach them.
michael smith -- chief financial officer & interim chief risk officer
suneet, this is mike. maybe if i could just add, and i think i fully agree with everything rob just said. just to add a little color around the financial planning channel proceeds. i -- look, we disclosed the transaction -- or just signed the transaction, excuse me, a couple of days ago. and so i think in terms of the use of those proceeds, the same philosophy will apply. there's nothing different there. but i'd probably stop short of saying we would put those necessarily to work by the end of the year. we may not close it until sometime in the third quarter. so just a little caution on that. but the discipline and the focus and the commitment to delivering shareholder value remains. the commitment to focusing on growth creation through investments in our business is just as strong as it's been.
suneet kamath -- citi -- analyst
okay. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question today is coming from jimmy bhullar from jp morgan. your line is now live.
jimmy bhullar -- jp morgan securities -- analyst
hi, good morning. so maybe first, just following up on the discussion so far. if you could, maybe rod and/or mike, talk about where do you feel that you would like to add through organic and/or inorganic investments in your business? and what sort of the market environment is and the competition is for deals in those areas?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
jimmy, good morning. i'll start. and obviously, we'll toggle back and forth. we've talked about looking for opportunities to improve the outcome and experience for our participants and our companies built again around health and wealth. so think about that as an example in terms of our participant engagement, and the data and the technology that will support those other growth initiatives. so improving that experience and outcome would be an example. we've talked about historically, jimmy, the consideration of adding a block of business to our retirement, if it met our financial targets. we've talked about expanding our distribution reach with our existing strategies within our asset management business internationally that has been growing. we've got great momentum in the insurance channel with christine's team, over the last five years, that would be an area of -- that we continue to want to make sure we're making the proper investments in.
and certainly, the -- we've had terrific momentum with particularly against the covid backdrop with our employee benefit -- group benefit business. and that would be another area that would make sense to add capabilities as we perceive them as we move forward. mike?
michael smith -- chief financial officer & interim chief risk officer
i'd just add, again, the focus, jimmy, will be on shareholder value and delivering that. and that can come in many forms. but accretion dilution remains an important consideration, growth remains an important consideration, shifting our business mix to be more fee-oriented and less risk-oriented with the rerating potential that that creates, all of those are important factors as we think about the opportunities that could be ahead for us.
jimmy bhullar -- jp morgan securities -- analyst
okay. and then just on the outflows in the retirement business in the fourth quarter. was it just a matter of timing of case wins and losses? because for the year, you had a pretty strong year overall, but what drove the outflows in 4q, and especially in the recordkeeping business? and any comments that on trends that you're seeing in terms of employee deferrals and employer matching contributions with the sort of at least stability or a little bit of recovery that we've seen in the economy?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, jimmy. charlie?
charles p. nelson -- chief executive officer, retirement & employee benefits
okay. jimmy, you had a couple of things in there. so i'm going to get them -- try to tick away at them, and if i miss one, circle back on me. specific to your question around some outflows. in the fourth quarter, we did have a small number of plans of larger plans that did not renew, in particular, in 2020, i should say, in our tax-exempt business. and i'm very proud of our team. i think we've been maintaining good pricing discipline and not renewing plans generally with higher guaranteed rates. i think it's the right thing to do, but they've also been able to have some very strong growth in our tax-exempt business. i don't think you see some of the things that we see on the net flows in our tax-exempt business because it's actually better than what you might see there because our rollovers out of our tax-exempt business actually show up in our retail assets. so there's -- we've been able to retain a fair number of assets there. so we've got some good growth there.
and over the last five years, our cagr in growth of assets and tax exempt's been 20% a year for the last five years. and as mike said, we moved to that number one position in the government market. and so that's kind of a commentary both on record-keeping as well as our full-service business as i look at both of those. and adding 0.5 million participants, it was really a significant net-net 0.5 million participants. significant achievement with the total net flows, between recordkeeping and full service, i think we're about $26 billion for full year 2020. and so that creates some tremendous momentum. and in particular, i think when you look at where we gained that share, we gained that share the largest portion of it from top five dc competitors. so we're winning not just from kind of the mid and smaller, but we took a meaningful share from some top five dc providers. so that kind of gives us some confidence there.
in terms of your question on recurring deposits, employer contributions. as i think i had mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we actually saw an improvement in employer contributions year-over-year in recurring deposits. and that was pretty measurable. and that kind of gives us some confidence going into 2021, i should say, 2021. actually, we're going to hope that, that continues, that employer contributions continue. as rod says, there's still some uncertainty around covid. but we're starting to see a bit of a rebound there that employer contributions went pretty significantly positive in a higher growth rate than what we saw in the second and third quarters.
i think that was all of your questions around record-keeping, full-service and deposits. did i miss any?
jimmy bhullar -- jp morgan securities -- analyst
no, you did well. thank you.
charles p. nelson -- chief executive officer, retirement & employee benefits
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question today is coming from erik bass from autonomous research. your line is now live.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
hi. thank you. can you provide some more detail on the drivers of the 8% to 12% expected normalized growth for retirement earnings in 2021? and also help us think about the revenue and expense implications from the sale of the ifp business?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike, charlie, do you want to start? mike and then charlie.
charles p. nelson -- chief executive officer, retirement & employee benefits
okay. do you want to start, mike, and then i'll go.
michael smith -- chief financial officer & interim chief risk officer
charlie, why don't you go ahead?
charles p. nelson -- chief executive officer, retirement & employee benefits
okay. sure. the drivers for us, obviously, it's been largely driven by our growth. i think -- you've seen the growth that we've talked about in our recordkeeping business. there is -- and i think as i mentioned, we have some spread revenue pressure that that's a challenge. when we -- when i look at on the expense side of things, where we did come in a bit above range last year, and we think we'll have a bit of a modest increase next year, the driver, i would say, is really just some investments we're doing in our it infrastructure, data, digital, automation, which we believe are really going to give us some longer-term benefits. but we've also just kind of the growth and what we're expecting and continue to expect an onboarding plans both last year and this year.
but even with that growth and some of the higher expenses, i would note that we drove our unit cost down kind of a measure of some leverage in our business by 6% in 2020. and we expect to have continued improvement in our unit cost and retirement in 2021 as a driver of kind of our focus and our earnings as we go forward. so hoping for -- and continued growth on the recurring deposits, strong flows, net flows, recurring -- or excuse me, in tax-exempt, our corporate as well as record-keeping are going to be the main drivers with a little bit of headwind coming on the spread revenue.
michael smith -- chief financial officer & interim chief risk officer
and erik, the only thing i'd add is in addition to the just really good underlying momentum in the growth of the business, there were a couple of one-timers in last year that were adverse that we wouldn't expect to recur. so that's as a little bit of the growth as well. so they're not part of the normalization inflation.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
got it. and on the ifp sale, because i think that's reported within retirement. i mean was that business generating anything material from earnings at this point? and i assume that that's where some of the spread compression was coming from since kind of the sale reduce that going forward? and i guess the last one on that is, i think you're retaining $20 million or $20 billion of assets, can you just talk about what those are?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike?
michael smith -- chief financial officer & interim chief risk officer
well, let me start on the impacts from the financial planning transaction. so the earnings are a bit volatile, but you should think of it in terms of $20 million to $25 million is the earnings impact there. so and you're right, the -- pre-tax, excuse me, yeah, $20 million to $25 million pre-tax. the impact of the sweep account was particularly pronounced in 2020. and i think that will -- certainly, that amount of volatility will abate. it didn't come through in spread revenue, though, it came through in fee. so it came in, in a different line item. and then in terms of the $20 billion, i'm not sure what you're referring to. maybe i just maybe step back, right, on the impact of [speech overlap].
charles p. nelson -- chief executive officer, retirement & employee benefits
the $20 billion is the leftover in our field advisors and our investor channel.
michael smith -- chief financial officer & interim chief risk officer
okay. so just to be clear, there's no impact to assets under administration or under management. there's no impact to assets under management here. we're already on the cetera platform. as the financial planners move over to cetera, we'll continue to have those relationships with them. and in fact, we wind up in a stronger position going forward with cetera. so the economics of that as it relates to the management, by the advisors go to cetera, but the rest of it is unaffected.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
got it. thank you. that's helpful.
operator
thank you. your next question is coming from humphrey lee from dowling & partners. your line is now live.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners securities -- analyst
good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. regarding to the im flow, especially for the unfunded mandate, any color that you can share in terms of the strategies and also -- the type of strategies and also kind of how should we think about the fees for those inflows?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
christine?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
sure, humphrey. a couple of things. so let's just start with a little more detail on the pipeline. and then i can address how to think about fees as the year evolves. so again, when you think about the pipeline, it is 10 different strategies, so quite a bit of diversity. so we continue to see strong client interest in private credit, private asset classes generally as well as commercial real estate. so those are attractive just really, when you think about the spread and the returns in the low return world, those are very attractive to long run investors. and then pivoting to the public side, we've seen quite a bit of interest in what our global fixed income mandates, if you will, and global unconstrained.
so across the board, we're seeing quite a bit of diversity in flows. we also have a very strong securitized group. so that is getting interest as well. and certainly, overall, our mortgage investment fund we'll be closing. it was closed, and we reopened it. so expect maybe some modest inflows in that. so overall, lots of diversity to think about it. we see continued strength across those product types. but now pivoting to your flow -- or excuse me, your revenue and how to think about the evolution of what sort of fees that we're earning on the business. 2021 will be a little bit confusing at the beginning of the year, simply because when you think about resolution life and the close of the life sale, those assets are currently the basis that we earn on those assets when we manage them for voya capital are not included in that external client aum basis points. so what you're going to see is a natural headwind or drag down at the basis points under management. but when you look forward at the rest of the year, when you think about some of the private asset classes and things, you should see -- we're expecting to see pretty much a steady basis point year in terms of what we're earning on assets under management.
and again, as you know, just given the organic growth, we're expecting to grow our earnings in the range excluding the performance fees that were very strong in the range of 8% to 12%. we're going to achieve that through the strong performance, leveraging that. also think on the fixed income side, we have investment-grade credit, as an example, top decile performing strategy that's getting a lot of interest. those tend to have lower fees, but again, they're highly scalable. so we think about growing the revenue overall, both through certainly, the fees are important, but also when you think about the scalability and what can drop to the bottom line, those are going to be key again to hitting that earnings target that we've put forward in our guidance.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners securities -- analyst
that's helpful. shifting gears, i still want to touch back on retirement and earnings a little bit. so you talked about the 8% to 12% growth for 2021. but if we take that kind of earnings kind of based on the normalized earnings in 2020 and then comparing to the q4 '20 normalized number, it seems like the quarterly run rate for 2021 would be 5% lower than the q4 '20 normalized number. and i believe charlie and mike talked about some of the headwinds that is running in the numbers. but at the same time, 2020 is supposed to have some negative impact from the one-offs, where does the covid-related withdrawal waivers and legal accrual. i guess just in terms of -- how to think about some of the headwinds going into 2021?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike or charlie, do you want to take that?
charles p. nelson -- chief executive officer, retirement & employee benefits
maybe i'll start, and mike, if you want to chime in as well. in terms of headwinds going into 2021, certainly, the spread-based revenues are going to be pressured and continue to pressure -- be pressured. i think that that is something that we're dealing with. offsetting that, is some of our -- obviously, is our strong growth that we had last year and the growth that we see coming in into '21 both in record-keeping and both in our full-service, corporate and tax-exempt markets. so i think those are some things that are helping us tremendously as well.
and then on the expense side of the equation, yeah, i think i'd mentioned just a little earlier that we do expect to be modestly above and expenses in '21, but we're also expecting to see continued improvement in our unit cost. and we're seeing some benefits and expecting benefits from some of the investments we've been making around data, digital, automation and automating. and i'll give you an example that we have going live in the first quarter of this year is just as we continue to automate various dimensions and processes of our onboarding and our full-service plans. so our full-service corporate plans, we've got some tools that we will be deploying internally to help automate that -- part of that implementation process.
and those things kind of all start coming together to help us drive that unit cost down over time, but as we look at it, it's really, i think the drivers are going to be kind of where rates are. certainly, our growth and our continued growth, which we feel good about and the line of sight that we have as well as just our continued strong retention. i don't anticipate as high of covid hardships and loans is what we had 2020, which really kind of were strong -- were pretty high in the second, third and a little bit in the fourth quarter, but they seem to be moderating a bit, but they'll still probably be higher than maybe our average run rate. so all in all, i think it does give us the confidence all these things that gets back to our guide of 8% to 12%.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners securities -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question today is coming from andrew kligerman from credit suisse. your line is now live.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, good morning. i think i want to take one more crack at the m&a question. rod, you kind of -- you mentioned earlier investments in data and technology, blocks of business for retirement, expanding strategies for distribution and investment management. all of that sounds similar to when another one of our covered companies calls like a buy-to-build strategy, where there -- i would call it writing checks of $50 million to $200 million to kind of help build their business, but not do anything outsized. does that -- am i reading that properly? does that sort of seem more like the voya bias?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
andrew, good question. i'd overlay that again with the discipline that we've demonstrated over the entire period, we've been a public company on driving shareholder value. so we've -- mike and i have been very clear on the threshold for that. i think we've worked really hard and the team has executed, in my view, beautifully to put the company in the position we're in to have the privilege of the excess capital, reinvesting $1 billion in share buyback this year. and we're going to use that same discipline. so i'm going to fall short, andrew, of saying, this is size by which we wouldn't do something other than we're going to be disciplined about that. we are focused on growth. and we've done a number of rather small using your word bolt-on pieces to date. but we will continue to look at those opportunities that ultimately will drive shareholder value. and mike, feel free to add.
michael smith -- chief financial officer & interim chief risk officer
i think you covered it really well, rod. i don't have anything to add to that.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thanks for that one. and then just shifting over to employee benefits. you've got a pretty nice annualized in-force premium growth projection of 7% to 10%. and i think charlie was talking about some competitive signs in the employer workspace kind of trending in retirement. so we're still in kind of a very -- we're still in a tough economy. so how in employee benefits are you able to project out 7% to 10% in-force premium growth, maybe a little color around that would be helpful?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
absolutely. rob, do you want to lead on this?
rob grubka -- president of employee benefits
yeah. sure. thank you, rod. and andrew, thanks for the question. yeah, look, we've i think, demonstrated over the last several years, our market focus, middle and larger employers, certainly through the latest environment has helped us. our product mix is tighter in a number of ways relative to the competition. so we're focusing stop-loss, the voluntary benefit business and the life business with voluntary had exceptional growth. our book of business this year grew 20-plus percent even in that covid environment. sort of the sequence of sales. i think you've got a pretty good handle on that. you and others of one, obviously, is important to us, and we've got a pretty good view into that.
we feel good about where we are in that process of those cases coming on board. both from the volume of what we're seeing, but also the price at which we're seeing it. and so we'll continue to be disciplined on it. 7% to 10%, certainly in the marketplace is good. but i think that focus, from a market perspective, the products that we play in, the covid environment certainly is impacting things. so we may see some different mix of business from a product perspective or the case sizes could be a bit different. but the long-term trend for the business and the focus on workplace benefits, as rod has said, across health and wealth both. there's a lot going from just a pure momentum perspective. i think the solution set, the distribution depth and breadth that we have across the workplace and institutions is really firing well. we'll continue to fight hard and just get a tighter grip on maintaining that. but i think those are sort of the high level currents of why we've got confidence in what we're seeing as we look ahead.
having said that, there's always surprises, as we experienced last year. and we'll just adapt and innovate and the foundational investments that are going on across voya, i think just have kept us nimble and agile and capturing the growth that we've seen of late.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you much.
rob grubka -- president of employee benefits

thank you. our next question is coming from john barnidge from piper sandler. your line is now live.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah. you've done a number of divestitures over the last number of years. and then you did the financial planning channel sale this week. can you talk about any similar smaller businesses that maybe we on the outside might not be thinking that could potentially be divested?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
the -- what we have done, as you just outlined. we're really executing to enable the company to be the capital light, high return, high free cash flow businesses. we've largely exited as -- you commented and we've discussed with the broader audience. our retail businesses and capital-intensive businesses and the businesses with tail liabilities, particularly that could be impacted in the lower for longer interest rate environment. so i feel very good about where we are. and the execution, not just the ideation of it, the execution of actually implementing those. and what's that -- the outcome of which is enabling us to be on the high end of our 85% to 95% free cash flow conversion range and absolutely capital light. in terms of, are there others? i think that pretty well covers the waterfront for now, but mike, feel free to add if i missed something.
michael smith -- chief financial officer & interim chief risk officer
no, you haven't missed anything. i think the focus is pretty clear now for us on workplace and institutional. i think all the significant pieces we have aligned with that. so it really is more of a focus on growth from here. could there be on the margins, little things to do? maybe. but broadly speaking, i think we're comfortable with what we have.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
that's very helpful. and maybe my follow-up. there have been a number of asset managers out there creating product designed to give the investment community, broad-based or targeted exposure to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. are you working on any similar product for the investment management segment that you can speak to?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
christine, do you want to speak to that?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
certainly, rod. a quick answer, no. we're focused -- yeah. no. but no, we're not. and we're -- certainly, we watch cryptocurrencies. what is the role in the general economy, etc., they still tend to be somewhat opaque at times what's driving some of the valuations. our focus is on specialty products, expanding our credit franchise, continuing to evolve our active equity strategies with our acquisition of our machine learning team to incorporate to do more concentrated strategies as well as really corporate esg into what we do. and then to strategically add to our distribution teams, we've gone into europe. i think there's -- we have asian clients. we think there are some good opportunities to step into asia a bit at end of the year. so again, when you think about our product development, our focus on behalf of our clients, we're going to stick true to our brand proposition, really, which is exceptional client service specialty products and continuing to expand our distribution range.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you very much for the answer.
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer

our next question is coming from jeremy campbell from barclays. your line is now live.
jeremy campbell -- barclays capital -- analyst
hey. thanks. and christine, maybe just one more for you, and thanks for all the great color today. as you kind of unpack some of the strengths in certain areas that are kind of underlying the strong pipeline. just maybe want to kind of flip that one a little bit. are there any of the equity or other strategies that are showing improving flow momentum either from fewer outflows or a pivot from outflows to inflows that will either yield less of a headwind or maybe a positive tailwind to the organization?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
yeah, certainly. in terms of the active equity performance itself and flows, we had some challenges in performance in 2020, namely in some of our smaller growth strategies, i think small cap, as an example. we have very strong performance in mid-cap and value, handily outperforming our benchmarks and competitive to peers. and so overall, with active equity, we've seen into the more traditional asset classes, some inflows into large cap growth. and so think of that as a marquee franchise, and we do expect the outflow headwinds to abate as we look into 2021. and so as we think about equity, we've been spending a lot of time really working on esg as well as analytics and acquiring our -- what we now call it was g-squared, we call it our emi team, our machine learning team, very strong performance in those strategies, concentrated, quantitative. and so we're starting to see pipeline of interest there.
so overall, i think we're going to have a better year in terms of overall flows and active equity as well as, again, we have such strong performance in fixed income as well. and i just want to know very quickly, and i realize we're up against time. but when you see our performance versus benchmarks in those supplements, those are publicly traded asset classes. we're not including pomona. we're not including the mortgage investment hedge fund. you saw the strong performance fees we delivered in the fourth quarter. so overall, the strength of what we do and our value proposition expands beyond the traditional 90% outperforming for three years fixed income as an example that you see on the slide.

thank you. in the interest of time, our final question today is coming from tom gallagher from evercore. your line is now live.
thomas gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning. just a few quick ones from me. rod, do you plan on exercising the option to extend your employment contract into 2022?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
tom, thanks for the question. we are intending to communicate, as we've, again, discussed from time to time, not just with you, but more broadly, our plans by the end of the first quarter. i am very excited and encouraged about the growth and development of the team. and we will -- as we've communicated previously, our board is looking at this in in a very comprehensive way. i couldn't be more pleased with the thoroughness of which we and they are approaching it. and by the end of the first quarter, we will be communicating the plans in a manner that i think will be thoughtful and very orderly. so stay tuned, but we will be communicating that shortly.
thomas gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. thanks, rod. and just, mike, a question on the excess capital and the leverage. so that you had mentioned you're planning on using $600 million to $800 million to pay down debt. i think previously, you had said it's probably going to be close to the low end of the range. is that still the expectation? and just to confirm, we should be taking $600 million to $800 million out of the $1.8 billion of excess capital because you've not yet earmarked that. is that -- i just want to confirm that.
michael smith -- chief financial officer & interim chief risk officer
so on the second part, yes, that is a use of excess capital. so just to be clear. now as to the range, the $600 million to $800 million was a pro forma target, right? so it was to get us back to the leverage levels that we were at the time of the announcement. we will -- ultimately, how much we buy will depend on how the year unfolds. but we'll be managing the leverage ratio, the new leverage ratio to likely something a little bit under 30 to give us a little room, but that will be how it ultimately plays out. it will be -- we think it will be in the range of $600 million to $800 million. if things go well, it will be closer to the lower end of that. if we have -- if the world throws us a curveball, on asset impairments or something like that, then it may not be. but broadly speaking, that's my expectation, we'll be toward the lower end.
operator
thank you. we've reached end of our question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. our success throughout 2020 reflects the resilience and agility of our people. and our commitment to helping our clients navigate difficult times. as we look ahead, we recognize the challenges related to covid-19 will continue to impact both the us and the broader economy. that said, we remain optimistic about our ability to build on our track record and to continue to welcome new clients to voya as we make further investments in our workplace capabilities and expertise. we see, as we've discussed, continued client interest in supporting their employees' needs as they navigate the many health and wealth challenges they're facing. we believe that voya will continue to stand apart for our solutions and expertise in solving those needs.
we look forward to updating you on our progress as we pursue our vision to be america's retirement company. thank you, and good day.

operator
good morning and welcome to the voya financial first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to michael katz, executive vice president, finance, strategy and investor relations. please go ahead.
mike kartz -- executive vice president, chief strategy, planning and investor relations officer
thank you and good morning. welcome to voya financial's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. we appreciate all of you who have joined us for this call. as a reminder, materials for today's call are available on our website at investors.voya.com or via the webcast.
turning to slide 2. some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law. this includes potential impacts related to covid-19. i refer you to this slide for more information.
we will also be referring today to certain non-gaap financial measures. gaap reconciliations are available in our press release and financial supplement found on our website, investors.voya.com.
joining me on the call are rod martin, our chairman and chief executive officer; as well as mike smith, our vice chairman and chief financial officer. after their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. for the q&a session, we have also invited our vice chairman and chief growth officer, charlie nelson as well as the heads of our businesses, specifically, heather lavallee, wealth solutions; christine hurtsellers, investment management; and rob grubka, health solutions.
with that let's turn to slide 3 as i would like to turn the call over to rod.
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning. let's begin on slide 4 with some key themes. our results for the first quarter demonstrate that we continue to operate from a position of strength with a specific and clear strategy centered on health, wealth and investment solutions, voya has tremendous opportunities to expand and grow. our businesses give us both the scale and the insight to help employers and their employees manage a variety of health and wealth needs, and we're seeing an increase in demand for what we offer. the pandemic has led to individuals becoming even more focused on their health and wealth needs. as a result, employees are increasingly looking to their employer for support and employers are very much focused on this. recent research by the employee benefit research institute indicates that employers overwhelmingly either have a strategy or are developing one to improve their employees financial well being. we believe that voya is well positioned to deliver on this demand, which will enable us to provide even greater value for all of our stakeholders.
turning to our results for the quarter. we delivered significant adjusted operating earnings-per-share growth. in addition, to strong investment income and the execution of our share repurchase plans, our eps growth reflects continued momentum across our businesses. in wealth solutions, full service recurring deposits grew more than 5% compared with the trailing 12 months. this was driven completely by organic growth. we generated over $850 million in full service net flows and recordkeeping flows were also strong at $3.5 billion. collectively, this reflects our strong results in both retention and the onboarding of new clients.
in investment management, we saw continued institutional inflows and interest in a number of our fixed income strategies. while we experienced net outflows during the quarter, we expect to achieve our 2% to 4% net flow organic growth target for 2021 due to a strong unfunded pipeline. in health solutions, annualized in-force premiums grew nearly 9% year-over-year. the strong increase reflects the growth across all products, but particularly in our voluntary business.
during the first quarter, we announced a new operating model to advance our growth plans and ensure a customer-centric focus on health, wealth and investment solutions. we're excited about the opportunities to meet the increasing needs of employers and their employees. we're focused on how we can expand the solution set that we offer to drive a more coordinated and integrated experience through the workplace. our acquisition of benefit strategies, which we announced yesterday, is a good example of focusing on increasing our capabilities and reach in the workplace. specifically, this acquisition will accelerate our expansion in the health savings and spending accounts markets. we look forward to continuing to update you during the year on our plans and at investor day later this year when we will provide details on the next phase of our growth strategy.
finally, our balance sheet and capital position remains strong. we continue to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing $235 million of common stock during the quarter. as of march 31, we have returned $7 billion of capital to shareholders through both share buybacks and dividends since our ipo. as previously shared, we expect to repurchase $1 billion of our shares during 2021, and we had approximately $1.6 billion of excess capital as of march 31. moving forward, we will continue to demonstrate the responsible stewardship of capital that has been a hallmark of voya as a public company.
we've also further strengthened our board, i'm pleased to share that we have welcomed yvette butler as a new independent director. yvette brings to our board over 25 years of experience in financial services where she has distinguished herself as a strategist and a leader in providing wealth, advisory banking and financial planning solutions. we're delighted to have yvette join us. and at the same time, i want to acknowledge lynne biggar, who stepped down from the board last month. lynne served on our board since 2014, and has provided valuable contributions to voya's success. on a personal note, i am very grateful for her guidance and her perspective.
turning to slide 5. we continue to earn further accolades for voya's strong culture and commitment to ethical business practices during the quarter. voya was named one of the world's most ethical companies for the eighth consecutive year. we were one of only 135 companies to earn this recognition and one of only six in the financial services category. this honor and others likely reflect our culture and the character of our brand. and these include being ranked fifth overall on barron's 2021 100 most sustainable companies list and earning the number one ranking in the financial services category for the third consecutive year and earning inclusion on fortune's list of the 2021 best workplaces in financial services and insurance. our management team is extremely proud of our employees and all they have contributed for our clients and customers during the past year. despite all that has occurred, our people have been steadfast in adapting and pivoting to ensure that voya can be there for our customers when they need us the most.
with that, let me ask mike smith to provide more details on our performance and results.
michael smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
thank you, rod. before we turn to the numbers, i want to echo rod's comments about our employees. we have many stakeholders of voya including our clients and our shareholders, but it is our employees that have enabled us to execute everything you've seen from voya over the past year. from completing the sale of our individual life business to responding to our customers when they needed us most, our employees have gone above and beyond, while also managing health and work life balance challenges. for this, we are all very grateful for their support.
this quarter we have changed the focus of our earnings discussion from normalized to adjusted operating earnings. in doing so, we hope to simplify the earnings presentation for investors. this is also consistent with our evolution toward being a less complicated company, especially with the life transaction now behind us. in order to assist with trend analysis, we will of course call out notable items and any one-time adjustments.
turning to slide 7. we delivered after tax adjusted operating earnings of $1.70 per share in the first quarter of 2021. this includes the following items: first, $0.66 of prepayment and alternative income above our long-term expectations. alternative income was boosted by favorable fourth quarter equity markets. first quarter equity market strength is likely a positive for second quarter alternative performance, though roughly a quarter of our holdings are in sectors that were relatively flat in the first quarter. second, $0.17 of unfavorable covid-19 related claims impacting health solutions. and, third, $0.03 of unfavorable other notable items in the quarter. with the life transaction now successfully behind us, we are focused on and confident in our ability to eliminate stranded costs by the end of 2022. gaap net income was more than $1 billion for the first quarter of 2021. this was largely driven by a significant gain from the reinsurance component of the individual life transaction booked at close. this gain reduced the ultimate gaap loss on sale for the overall transaction to $633 million, at the low end of the guided $600 million to $800 million range.
moving to slide 8. wealth solutions delivered $255 million of adjusted operating earnings in the first quarter, significantly higher than $124 million in the first quarter of 2020. the year-over-year increase was largely driven by favorable alternative income, which was $81 million above our long-term expectations and $74 million higher than the first quarter of 2020 as well as a favorable dac unlock relative to last year. investment spread continued to benefit from the volume of transfers into our fixed account in 2020. in addition, we benefited from crediting rate actions that became effective this year, seasonally lower crediting days and income generated from discounted bonds that were called in the quarter. equity markets along with consistently strong full service and recordkeeping net inflows, all combined to drive higher asset levels which provided a tailwind for our fee-based business. our administrative expenses were favorable compared to a year ago, reflecting our expense discipline and continued drive toward lower unit costs.
turning to deposits and flows. full service recurring deposits grew 5.1% to over $11 billion on a trailing 12 month basis. we expect employer match and participant referral trends to continue improving throughout the year, such that full year recurring deposit growth will be 6% to 8% as previously guided. we generated over $850 million of positive full service net flows and more than $2 billion over the last 12 months. recordkeeping net flows were $3.5 billion in the first quarter, largely driven by a large client win. stable value saw modest net outflows of $156 million, following a record year for net inflows in 2020.
looking ahead, we expect full service net flows to remain positive and recordkeeping flows to moderate slightly in the second quarter. we have a robust pipeline, a strong and growing distribution and we continue to invest in our customer-focused solutions through the workplace. our diversified revenue streams from our top-tier presence across all markets will contribute to our ability to achieve long-term growth.
on slide 9. investment management delivered $52 million of adjusted operating earnings. this is higher than $40 million in the first quarter of 2020, primarily driven by investment capital results, which were higher year-over-year and significantly above our long-term target. we generated greater fee revenues from higher average asset levels and successive client wins. this was partly offset by waived fees on certain short-term money market products due to the current level of short-term rates. more materially external client revenue yield is down in the quarter due to the life transaction, which produced an expected movement of assets from the general account to institutional. administrative expenses were higher year-over-year, largely due to variable compensation associated with strong investment capital results in the quarter and continued investments in the business. our adjusted operating margin, including investment capital improved 200 basis points to 28.8% benefiting from strong investment capital results.
turning to flows. overall net outflows were roughly $400 million in the quarter, primarily driven by the timing of expected redemptions and is in line with the guidance we shared in the prior quarter. in institutional, we saw strong demand in private credit and commercial mortgage loans across domestic channels, including insurance. this was offset by outflows from longer duration investments by international clients as us rates rose sharply in the first quarter. having said that, we are seeing indications that trend is stabilizing. additionally, we saw some short-term liquidity outflows related to client hedging activity. we are now separating these flows in our investor supplement to better represent the true growth of our business. this categorization change had an immaterial impact on historical organic growth and our outlook for 2021. retail flows continue to improve sequentially, however, remain negative this quarter. our fixed income performance remained strong. 94% of our fixed income funds outperformed the benchmark on a three year basis and over 95% did so on a five and 10 year basis.
looking ahead, we expect to return to positive net flows in the second quarter and to achieve full year organic growth of 2% to 4% driven by a strong unfunded pipeline of client wins. we have a diverse platform to meet client needs across market cycles. our strong long-term investment performance, strength of distribution channels and diversity and solutions, providing differentiated returns continues to drive long-term optimism in our pipeline.
turning to slide 10. health solutions delivered adjusted operating earnings of $37 million in the first quarter, compared to $61 million in the first quarter of 2020. we incurred $29 million of covid related claims driving most of the variance. prepayment and alternative income exceeded our long-term target by $6 million and was more favorable than first quarter of 2020 by $5 million. annualized in-force premiums grew 8.6% year-over-year, supported by growth in all product lines, highlighted by double-digit growth in voluntary and 9% growth in stop-loss, following a successful january sales and renewal season. the total aggregate loss ratio was 71.8% on a trailing 12 month basis within our targeted range of 70% to 73%. group life loss ratios were elevated in the quarter due to covid claims. loss ratios for stop-loss and voluntary were in line with our expectations. as rod mentioned, we are excited by our recently announced acquisition of benefit strategies. this acquisition accelerates our presence in the fast growing hsa market that we entered in 2019. as we look out to the rest of the year, we remain optimistic that as covid eases throughout the year, earnings growth should rebound given solid underlying commercial growth momentum across our entire book of business.
on slide 11, we provide eps items to consider for the second quarter of 2021. second quarter will benefit from several seasonal first quarter items not repeating at the same levels, including administrative expenses, group life loss ratios and preferred stock dividends. in the second quarter, we also expect an earnings benefit from lower variable compensation in investment management associated with investment capital results and less severe covid related claims relative to first quarter levels. considering claim submission lags, we expect $20 million of covid related claims impact in the second quarter and $10 million in the second half of this year based on a full year assumption of 300,000 total us covid-related deaths. offsetting these items is the call bond investment gained in wealth solutions not expected to recur. we also experienced outsized alternative income in first quarter above our long-term expectations of 9%. while we have provided some items to consider, there will of course be other factors that affect second quarter results, including changes in our average share count, market impacts, business growth and the potential for additional covid-19 impacts.
slide 12. our robust capital position allowed us to continue our strong track record of returning capital to shareholders. this quarter we returned $255 million to shareholders, including $20 million in common stock dividends and $235 million in share repurchases, the latter of which comprised $30 million of shares related to an asr agreement that was entered into in the fourth quarter of 2020, $200 million of shares delivered as part of a new $250 million asr agreement we entered into during the first quarter and $5 million of shares repurchased through open market transactions. the total amount of capital returned to shareholders since our ipo is $7 billion predominantly through shares repurchased. we continue to expect to deploy approximately $1 billion of capital toward share repurchases over the course of 2021 in a ratable manner, while continuing to balance investing in our business for the long-term. our financial leverage ratio was above our 30% target, largely due to the impacts from the life flows and lower aoci, due to the moving interest rates at the end of the quarter. this does not change our plan to retire $600 million to $800 million of debt this year, of which we retired $75 million in the quarter. we ended the quarter with strong excess capital of $1.6 billion. we continue to expect at least $300 million of additional excess capital upon the completed sale of our independent financial planning channel.
in summary, we are pleased to have closed the life insurance transaction, a huge step in our transition to our capital-light business and to have shared our new operating model. we believe our strong workplace and institutional franchises are poised for long-term success. we generate high free cash flow and have a significant excess capital position as well as an increasingly valuable deferred tax asset should higher corporate tax rates become law. we will continue to act as good stewards of capital as we look to deploy proceeds in the best interest of shareholders.
with that, i will turn the call back to the operator, so that we can take your questions.

operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from elyse greenspan with wells fargo. please state your question.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi, thanks, good morning. my first question on, just on the capital side of things, you guys reconfirmed $1 billion of buyback for this year. i was just hoping we could get more color on how to think about just timing. i think you said it will still be ratably throughout the year, but given that there is more certainty on the economy and coming out of covid, will you perhaps look to pull forward some of the buyback given that the worst is behind us?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
elyse, good morning, i'll begin and as usual, mike and i will toggle back and forth. and your assumption is correct or your understanding is correct. we have committed to $1 billion of buyback this year. as mike just shared, with that we -- that's on top of the $7 billion that we've already done historically since the ipo. we're also retiring debt that you've heard mike talk about between $600 million and $800 million and we'll probably be in the middle of that range. and if you look at how we've done this historically elyse, we've done it ratably and that has served us well. and so that philosophy and approach is how we're approaching it and we will always make some judgments based on market conditions, but that's generally been the approach. and michael, please feel free to add.
michael smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
i think you covered it really well rod. i would just kind of reemphasize the point of, we'll look for opportunities as the stock trades up and down or general market trades up or down to lean in or lean back with open market purchases where that makes sense. but, the ratably part elyse just to be clear, was less about covid and uncertainty and more just the application of the discipline that we've shown consistently. i think as rod said it's served us well and we expect it to continue to serve us well.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, great. and then my second question on you guys announced the deal benefit strategies yesterday and i just, you guys didn't disclose the payment, so it sounds like it's more of a bolt-on deal. so as we think about additional m&a, would it more be kind of similar bolt-ons or could you just kind of give us an update as you guys think about potential additional m&a transactions?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
elyse, thank you for mentioning that. we are very excited and i'll have rob comment in just a moment about benefit strategies, but in terms of our consideration we've talked about considering opportunities that will help accelerate growth in the workplace by integrating -- by increasing integrating outcomes across the health and wealth focus with employees and employers from an engagement in the data integration and the technology perspective. so, it -- elyse it's extremely difficult to comment about size because these opportunities emerge as they emerge, but this is a good example of adding to a business that we started organically and i think enabling us to accelerate significantly but let me add rob -- ask rob to jump in and just describe this a little more fully. rob?
rob grubka -- chief executive officer, health solutions
yes, sure. thank you, rod. thanks for the question, elyse. yes, no, we're certainly excited about it from a strategic standpoint. i think it's probably super self evident as to why we got excited about this particular opportunity and to speak of them more particularly they have been in this business for a long time, they are east coast based company. so, there is a broad mix of solutions that they cover and service and administer. hsa is certainly sort of a headline story because we see it as such a great connector between our health and wealth businesses and trying to really bring together for consumers, a more integrated decision framework, an opportunity to provide guidance and think about even servicing the business in a more holistic way. so there is certainly that element of things.
as a reminder, we talked about this actually back at investor day in 2018 and over the last couple of years, we certainly have learned a lot as we've entered that marketplace. we're excited about what we've learned. again, it just reinforced the connectivity and the receptivity in the market to bring in together the wealth story as well as the hsa, a notional account story and connect it all the way through and then obviously it's an opportunity for our investment management team to play a role in this solution as well. so, we're really excited about the cultural fit, the consumer fit and the capabilities they bring, we actually partnered with benefit strategies last year in a more meaningful way. so, we got to sort of test ride with each other a little bit and just found it a really good match culturally and from an execution and delivering for our customer perspective, i couldn't be more excited about it.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst

our next question comes from nigel dally with morgan stanley. please state your question.
nigel dally -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks, and good morning everyone. i just wanted to circle back to capital management. i understand that you could lean in or out depending on market conditions, which makes a lot of sense but, as you also mentioned, it does seem like the uncertainty with regards to the pandemic, the economy has dissipated, your current capital position remains very strong, your free cash flow is among the best in the industry and you also have the deal in the third quarter which is going to free up some additional capital. so if things go right, is there potential upside to the amount or should we -- or should i be taking from your comments that that $1 billion that you talked about, we should view as being largely safe and sound [phonetic] at this point?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
nigel, i'll start, but, again mike and i will toggle back and forth. just, maybe as we believe the share repurchases are and have been a core part of the voya story. in addition to that, we're carefully looking as we've discussed for opportunities to accelerate our workspace strategy, benefit strategies is an example of that. we're also retiring as we commented about just a moment ago, $600 million to $800 million of debt. and as a reminder, a number of these transactions close later this year. so, we will and have been opportunistic historically, but the guidance that we've given for 2021 is fully based on both organic growth and what we have in place now. with that mike?
michael smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
yes, nigel, i think the only thing i'd say is that you shouldn't view the $1 billion as a ceiling. i think there are -- to the extent that opportunities present themselves, and it makes sense for us to do, i think we could lean in, and we've -- i think we've said from the beginning was at least $1 billion. we will see how the balance of the year unfolds. we'll need to close the financial planning channel transaction and then we'll see how the balance of 2021 emerges. but to rod's point, focusing on delivering shareholder value and being conscious of that has been i think a hallmark of this management team and i don't think that's in anyway changing here.
nigel dally -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, that's great. i appreciate the color. and just one other one on investment management. you commented you have a strong unfunded pipeline of mandates, any color as to where that's likely to be coming in as we kind of looking at that in the second quarter or just too tough to judge?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
christine?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
nigel, i would say not to go as far as say too tough to judge, but as you know just quarter-to-quarter, some of these mandates in the pipeline, not all are a bit lumpy. so, but, so saying that you know looking out at the full year and what we do see is see very strong unfunded wins as well as progressing through finals and semi-finals, so feeling really positive about it. you know, it's like what's driving some of this? well, listen, right now our unfunded wins are 10 strategies, so, it's diverse -- diversified client type too. a lot of the demand is for some of our traditional private assets like private credit is an example, also commercial real estate that was held up a bit in terms of where the market was pricing and really the ability to underwrite properties last year, so that in covid so that headwind is starting to dissipate and will be turning into a tailwind. so, overall what are we seeing, we're still -- we're very confident forecasting that 2% to 4% beginning of aum growth, it's diversified and as you say, nigel, it could be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but overall the long run trajectory is very strong and as you know we've delivered five consecutive years of positive net cash flows and so we're well on track for having our sixth year of positive cash flows.
nigel dally -- morgan stanley -- analyst
sounds great, thanks a lot.

our next question comes from josh shanker with bank of america. please state your question.
joshua shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, thank you very much. i wonder if you could talk a little bit, you get the question a lot, but i can tell you that from my perspective the fee margin on recordkeeping business has shrunk more quickly than i thought it would. i know you've had some big wins and those wins might be coming at a lower negotiated rate than the legacy portfolio, but when we talk about the trend, what we should expect going forward and as you do put on new wins, the margins on those wins relative to the legacy margin in the portfolio?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
absolutely. heather?
heather lavallee -- chief executive officer, wealth solutions
yes, josh. thank you so much. appreciate the question. first, i'll say, first, we did have some one-time annual fees in the fourth quarter that did not repeat in the first quarter which really drove the appearance of some accelerated fee compression between the quarters. we are very much focused in on positive and profitable sales growth and while we do anticipate some revenue pressure really across the industry, we are very much focused on growth in our full service, specifically within our mid-market space where we have expanded distribution. and what we see there is we may sell larger plans with a lower average fee but, higher total net revenues and very, very much in line with our expectations.
second factor i'd point to is, we continue to be very focused on driving operational efficiencies and enhancements to our client experience that are helping to bring down expenses and helping to offset revenue pressure. and the final item i'd really point you to is, we're focused on driving alternative sources of revenue by expanding and enhancing our proprietary solutions that are really resonating in the market. so while we do recognize that there are revenue pressures, we are very confident in our ability to hit our 8% to 12% earnings growth that we forecasted for the year.
joshua shanker -- bank of america -- analyst
and the timing of the win that you had in the quarter, did that show up toward the end of the quarter, skewing the average balances as opposed to the beginning and end balances?
heather lavallee -- chief executive officer, wealth solutions
well, i will say i'm sure, let me address it this way, it's kind of talking about the flows in the quarter. we had very, very strong flows across full service and recordkeeping totaling $4.4 billion and all organic growth. so very, very pleased. what i would comment in terms of net flows is we did see a greater acceleration of funded wins coming in the quarter. so, i think a little bit less driving anything you're seeing in terms of average fee revenue, but again, i'm going to point to the fact of very, very strong flows in the quarter and really driving our strong commercial momentum that we're anticipating throughout the year within recordkeeping as you know it can be a little bit lumpy. we're building off an extremely strong 2020, so as i look forward into 2021, we expect flows to moderate a little bit, see continued strong revenue from our diversified portfolio and just strong commercial momentum throughout the year.
joshua shanker -- bank of america -- analyst

our next question comes from tom gallagher with evercore isi. please state your question.
thomas gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning. rod, i heard your comment before about in reaction to m&a that it depends on opportunities that emerge, but just wanted to ask you about sort of directionally where your head's at with the types of deals you'd consider because as you guys probably heard prudential may be considering divesting their full service retirement business and i'm not asking you specifically about prudential but would voya consider a larger scale integration oriented deal in that space or is it really more bolt-on smaller size deals that we should be thinking about with more consideration for not wanting to take on too much execution risk here?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
tom, thank you. two comments; one, we have scale in that space with our 6 million plus participants and it's been growing nicely as i think you're aware. the second piece is what we've really tried to signal is the focus of again accelerating growth in the workplace. benefit strategies is an example of that but, by increasing the outcomes across health and wealth. the employee and employer engagement, data integration and technology, that's where our focus is. tom, through the pandemic the world in our view has really changed and you'll hear us and particularly charlie with his focus on growth talking about connecting the unconnected. there are more and more employees are looking to their employer for help and support in this area and we see that as our primary focus. i think, benefit strategies is a good example of that in the, and again it's hard to comment beyond that, because it's hypothetical, but mike, feel free to add.
michael smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
yes, just maybe, tom, as rod said, we have scale in retirement. scale will always be important in retirement and so those, we've talked consistently about looking at bolt-ons in retirement and bringing on additional scale where it makes sense, but that will be very much a numbers game and as you pointed out an execution risk assessment game. i think we're -- as rod also said, very excited about the opportunities to broaden our capabilities in the realm of integrating the experience for employers and employees, and so that's also going to be a continued focus.
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
maybe one other comment, if you go back to what we've done with our voluntary benefit business, i mean that was nascent and grow organically and over the last eight or 10 years, all organically. we've gone from really being a non-significant player to being fourth or fifth in the marketplace. and that experience and confidence about how the team has done that has bolstered our confidence and focus on what are the other adjacencies that we can do to something like benefit strategies that can further expand our capabilities and respond to what we're hearing from employers and employees that they're looking for. i'm sorry i interrupted you.
thomas gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
no, that's really helpful. appreciate the color from both of you. just one follow-up, mike if i could, on the sharp drop in crediting rates in the wealth solutions business, clearly it looks like that was a pretty favorable earnings driver in the quarter. can you expand a bit on what happened there and whether or not there is more flexibility on the crediting rate side going forward or was this kind of a big lever that was pulled and what it means for future margins? thanks.
michael smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
tom, i think i'll actually bump that one over to heather. i think she is in a better position to give you the color on that.
heather lavallee -- chief executive officer, wealth solutions
thanks, mike. yes, happy to do so. first, as mike did mention, we had a notable in the quarter that will not repeat in terms of the sale of call bonds, but we've taken very specific action to address some of the interest rate pressures. and let me point you to three specific actions. first, mike talked about in his comments that we took some crediting rate actions last year and in beginning of this year, very much in line with the low interest rate environment that were reflected. second, our gmir initiative from several years ago has continued to help us on this front. and then the third item is that we had significant transfers from variable to fixed in 2020 into lower crediting rate product that, that really also helped our spread income. so, we certainly recognize the fact that recent rate increases have been a bit of a tailwind for us. we expect the low for long interest rate to continue and we are always looking for opportunities to further mitigate the risk from our low interest rate environment while honoring the commitments we've made to participants and planned sponsors. but overall, we feel that our earnings are very well balanced between spread, asset base and participant fees and very confident with our ability to deliver on the earnings targets that we set forth for the year.
thomas gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks, heather. any further flexibility in that, and to continue to lower crediting rates?
heather lavallee -- chief executive officer, wealth solutions
yes. i appreciate the question. i mean, we are always looking for opportunities, i won't point you to any specific actions, but i'll tell you that the teams are always looking at certain blocks of business. we're looking at crediting rates and we want to make sure that we are kind of balancing opportunities to de-risk and with commitments we've made to clients, but being very good stewards of capital to shareholders. so, again, it's something that i think we have a very solid track record over the past several years of both adjusting crediting rates and taking appropriate action and we'll continue to do that going forward.
thomas gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, thanks.
heather lavallee -- chief executive officer, wealth solutions
sure, thank you.

our next question comes from andrew kligerman with credit suisse. please state your question.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone. i'm interested in health solutions and the sales outlook as we look to the first quarter, stop-loss sales were up 23% year-over-year, but life sales were down 26%. and we would have expected higher life sales just given the increased attention to that product area. so could you touch on both product lines in health solutions?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
rob, do you want to begin?
rob grubka -- chief executive officer, health solutions
i'd be happy to. thanks, andrew. and, as you know, stop-loss obviously really strong start to the year. on the life side just to connect that and then i'll circle back because i think the story across life and also voluntary is just worth reinforcing. but on the life side, on the sales front, definitely down sharply. again, i'd point back to mix of sales being the real driver there. so at the larger end of the market, we just saw less sort of things to take swings at and the activity was just slow during 2020 for the obvious reasons.
now to your longer term point of like why wasn't recognition around life insurance and the needs of it all the more apparent, i'd say that's very true. so i would look at this is more long-term trend intact, if not increasing, but at the same point, we just, the 2020 noise from covid and what went to market was the real story there. and then when you look at the in-force book of business, just to put an emphasis on it, our in-force book of life and disability grew at close to 4%. so you had on the one hand, the drop in sales, but you also had an improvement retention. so, i think, net-net, the story kind of connects from both perspectives and underlies the point of just let's go into market than you might have otherwise anticipated. stop-loss, again that's a business where we get swings at every year, feel good about the discipline around that.
and then, somewhat similar story on the supplemental health voluntary side of the house where we actually wrote a significant number of new groups over year-over-year, they just happened to be more middle market or smaller market than we've seen in prior years. so it was really a sales mix story on sort of national account, 500 lives -- 5,000 lives and up versus where we ended up writing a lot of business, a lot of groups with more in the middle market. so as i alluded to in comments, we're seeing that activity open back up and this is sort of prime season for both voluntary and the life business and we're optimistic about the activity in the pipeline.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
very helpful. and then my second question is around the wealth solutions unit and i saw earlier last year, i think you had put together multiple -- multi-employer plans tied to secure act, and i'm wondering how that's going? and then i see the secure act 2.0 legislation in the house, and i'm wondering what the addressable market there is? so, maybe a little bit about how you're proceeding with respect to the secure act? how it's impacting sales and now this new legislation, what that could do for you?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
heather?
heather lavallee -- chief executive officer, wealth solutions
yes, happy to address it. so, for starters, and i think we've been very clear in our support of both the secure act 1.0 and 2.0 and we think that secure act is providing a tremendous opportunity for more americans to have greater access to retirement savings. so, very, very supportive and a couple of things that i would point to -- to your questions about multiple employer plans and i'll comment on even pooled employer plans. we believe that voya is very well positioned. we have seen some great success in the adoption of pooled employer plans and voya is absolutely well positioned to play successfully in that space and we're anticipating some growth in sales, particularly in our, in our corporate markets.
as i pivot to your question on secure act 2.0, there, we think that there are a couple of components specific to secure 2.0 where our tax exempt business is going to be particularly well positioned to support it. specifically, there are some opportunities that have been proposed that would expand the investment line-ups for tax exempt clients, specifically providing access to cits, collective investment trusts, and then also opportunities with four-tax exempt plan sponsors to enter into multiple employer plan. so, again, all in all, we're very well positioned. we have pivoted and responded very quickly to the adoption of secure act and we think that voya is in an excellent position to help increase the savings rates for both participants as well as growing plan sponsors as a result of secure act.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst

our next question comes from ryan krueger with kbw. please state your question.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
hi, good morning. i was hoping you could discuss the divergence in recurring deposit growth that you're seeing in full service corporate which has recovered pretty strong compared to tax exempt, which seems to still be under some pressure?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
heather?
heather lavallee -- chief executive officer, wealth solutions
yes, thank you. happy to address your question. first, as mike stated in his comments, we're very confident on our ability to achieve the 6% to 8% recurring deposit growth for the year, very much in line with 2020 and to get specific to your question around the divergence, when we, if i look back to 2020, our tax exempt business did not, was not as impacted by covid in terms of recurring deposits throughout the year. so, we did not see the same kind of rapid decline as we saw in the corporate markets.
now, on the flip side, as we look into first quarter, our corporate market is seeing just a faster recovery from what we're seeing from the economy, specifically in terms of employer contributions and employee contributions. so, all in all, i think what it really speaks to is a very balanced mix of our business across corporate and tax exempt that was both growing and seeing nice signs of recovery and again i'll really point more toward that full year forecast on a combined basis, which is what we're, what we're really focusing in on, but again, i think we're very, very well positioned across markets and we do expect to see some improvement in tax exempt recurring deposits as the year progresses.

thank you. our next question comes from erik bass with autonomous research. please state your question.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
hi, thank you. to start on wealth solutions, can you just talk about the outlook for expenses for this year? was there anything unusual in the admin expense this quarter or should we expect kind of continued minimal year-over-year growth?
heather lavallee -- chief executive officer, wealth solutions
yes, i'll jump in and answer that question. so, for starters as we look back to first quarter of 2020, we did have some one-time expenses result in -- as a result from some large sales in 2020, particularly in our recordkeeping business and as we look forward, we continue to be very, very disciplined with our focus on expense management. we are proud of the fact we've driven lower unit cost across our book of business, which continues to be a focus. so what i'd say is really no notables. we are -- as i kind of look at the different levers that we have to pull, focusing in on not only expense management but how we're driving operational efficiency, how we're driving improved client experience that help us to manage expenses. so nothing notable for the year and again just something we'll continue to be disciplined with throughout 2021.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
thank you. and then i was hoping you could talk about your current distribution relationship with nn investment management and how that could be affected by their announced strategic review?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
actually, christine, do you want to take that?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
sure thing, rod. yes, eric, as you referenced, nn has made an announcement about nnip potentially being up for strategic review and as you point out, they've been a long run strategic partner of ours. how do we think about this around a couple of lenses? i mean, number one, we know that the capabilities that they distribute on our behalf like notably investment grade credit, that's one of the best performing investment grade credit sicavs in the world and so the quality of what we produce should continue and we would expect that strategic partner to continue, because on both sides we're adding real value. but how to think about the way forward? we have been planting seeds as far as direct distribution offshore, i mean, those markets are growing rapidly, notably, asia. we did add sales resources into emea last year and also when you think about apac we're going to add some resources in the fourth quarter and what we're seeing out of apac notably is because a lot of the larger clients purchase evestment data, we've actually won through direct origination just based on the quality of what we do some asian clients.
and then finally, we continue to grow our product set in asia, we worked hard to set up as an example, a cayman fund for commercial real estate for a large japanese insurance company just due to some technicalities around taxes. so, continuing to be innovative, continuing to be able to meet some of the more complex solutions needed out of offshore clients and so again, nn has been a great strategic partner, but we're doing a lot away from them to continue to grow sort of our notable growing client interest offshore based on the state of yields globally.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
thank you and do you have a rough breakdown of kind of what your international distribution is that's sort of independent versus through that relationship?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
sure. we have a small team in emea that is direct. we have some onshore resources that are fully dedicated to servicing and reaching out to asia. and we don't have any direct salespeople boots on the ground in asia yet. we're in the planning process with mike smith and team but we're expecting to add a small team there in the fourth quarter and really what we want to do with that team is ensure that they are insurance focused as well because we just think globally there is a real opportunity given the strength of our insurance, asset management and the products that we have to really tap into that client base worldwide.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from jeremy campbell with barclays. please state your question.
jeremy campbell -- barclays -- analyst
hey, thanks. mike and rob, i'm just hoping you could help us think about the sizing of benefit strategies. i think the release said 370,000 participant accounts across hsa, hra all that other fund stuff, i think that the national average balance for hsa is about 18,000 obviously everything else is probably quite a bit lower. so any high level color on account splits or total aum on board would be helpful as well as any opportunity to convert some of these hsa assets into voya strategies would be helpful as well?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
rob, do you want to begin?
rob grubka -- chief executive officer, health solutions
yes, sure. look, we're not going to peel it all the way back as you're trying to do, which is understandable. look, i think as we close the transaction, obviously once it's closed, we'll be able to talk differently about just how to set expectations. it's an appropriately sized deal. it's very strategic for us. again, i think, i alluded to this before, it's a breadth of products. i wouldn't hang up on sort of the aum story around it as much as it's a fee story and so certainly there is the side benefit of growing aum as we move forward and continue to try to scale the business, but it's really a fee-oriented business and that's the best way to think about it. and i'd just say sort of stay tuned as we continue to refine putting numbers and specificity to it once the deal is closed.

our next question comes from humphrey lee with dowling and partners. please state your question.
humphrey lee -- dowling and partners -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my question. in investment management accounting for the favorable investment capital return and the corresponding expenses, the normalized earnings would be around kind of $34 million which seemed low relative to where it has been running. i think you talked about there are some reinvestment expenses going on into the quarter. so just how to think about the earnings power for investment management and where you think you should be kind of accounting for some of the variables in the quarter as well as the individual life transaction?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike, you want to start?
michael smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
yes, i'll take that. humphrey, thanks for the question. and maybe just to cut to the chase on where we see voya investment management coming in, in second quarter. i think there are a number of moving parts and probably too much to try and cover in the time we have, but we see the second quarter being in the mid 40s, that's going to be primarily driven by the variable comp adjustment that we flagged in the walk forward, a reversion to more normal expenses from the first quarter typical seasonality as well as some fee income growth. so i think all of that together, there's a couple of other smaller ins and outs, but i think if you think of it in terms of mid 40s, i think that's a good place for you to be for 2q and that incorporates the impact of the life transaction which we've shared previously is $10 million to $15 million annually.
humphrey lee -- dowling and partners -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from suneet kamath with citi. please state your question.
suneet kamath -- citi -- analyst
yes, thanks. the stop loss ratio in the quarter at 75.6% was quite a bit lower than kind of where it's been running over the past kind of three quarters. is there anything unusual going on in there or is that just normal [technical issues]. are you seeing people -- any impact from people sort of putting off medical treatments because of covid and unwillingness to go to hospitals, etc?
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
rob?
rob grubka -- chief executive officer, health solutions
yes, sure. i think the quick answer on this is, look, it's a business that's all about managing volatility for employers and so sometimes we're going to see the good or the bad of that volatility at different points in time. i wouldn't wrap it up in a seasonality comment, i think it's just how the block is evolving and as we're writing new business putting that on and then renewing new business, you're just going to see some inherent volatility there, but nothing that we obviously don't focus on and manage through as time goes on. so, it's sort of the knock-on question of delayed treatment and do we expect different sort of severity or frequency of activity. i think we're certainly like everybody in the industry sort of watching for those trends or those issues to emerge. at this point, we haven't seen sort of material deviation in the types of sort of coverage that we provide.
just as a reminder, our attachment points in the market, given where we play, sort of that middle part of the marketplace, those are in and around $300,000 deductibles. so, it's going to take pretty severe events for us to cover. as you get down market, some players in the stop loss space are going to see different sorts of activity, different sorts of experience because they attach at lower deductibles. so there can be some give and take because of that dynamic that i just highlighted there, but we're certainly on top of it paying attention to it, and we'll see how it evolves and then we get a reprice as on the annual cycle and recover if we need to, but at this point, we're feeling good about where we're sitting.
operator
our next question comes from john barnidge with piper sandler. please state your question.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you very much. as we think about the health savings account initiative and push there and the lens of taxes presumably going up. can you talk about the opportunity to actually get maybe more of those accounts at like a fully funded level as opposed to where they traditionally maybe are and how the products across the suite at voya helps that? thank you.
rodney o. martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
rob?
rob grubka -- chief executive officer, health solutions
yes, i'll jump in. from a funding level perspective i think maybe you're getting that using them more as savings of vehicle versus spending. i'll just sort of run with that assumption in case you dropped off, but look over time we certainly view the flexibility, the customer value piece from the tax treatment, is an area where most consumers to the extent they can accumulate assets there, it's really great, probably underutilized way to save and accumulate funds. you'll hear people talk about and we talk about the cost of medical care once you reach retirement age and that's in the $200,000, $300,000 range. it's not insignificant. hsa certainly can play an important role in that. i think for us it's recognize an individual situation, understanding what they're trying to accomplish, what their needs are at any point in time, obviously, those things change over time as well. and so i think this just puts us in a really good position to understand someone's situation, understand where they sit, both from a retirement perspective as well as the savings for healthcare perspective and provide really good guidance around that and support for them making really good decision. so back to rod's comment around data integration and taking a more holistic approach to the consumer, again, that's why we view this is such a strategic move.
operator

operator
good morning, and welcome to the voya financial second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. all participants will be in listen-only mode. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to michael katz, evp finance, strategy and investor relations. please go ahead.
michael katz -- executive vice president & chief strategy, planning and investor relations
thank you, and good morning. welcome to voya financial's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. we appreciate all of you who have joined us for this call. as a reminder, materials for today's call are available on our website at investors.voya.com or via the webcast.
turning to slide 2; some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law. i refer you to this slide for more information. we will also be referring today to certain non-gaap financial measures. gaap reconciliations are available in our press release and financial supplement found on our website, investors.voya.com. joining me on the call are rod martin, our chairman and chief executive officer; as well as mike smith, our vice chairman and chief financial officer. after their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. for that q&a session, we have also invited our vice chairman and chief growth officer, charlie nelson, as well as the heads of our businesses, specifically, heather lavallee, wealth solutions; christine hurtsellers, investment management; and rob grubka, health solutions.
with that, let's turn to slide 3 as i would like to turn the call over to rod.
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
good morning. let's begin on slide 4 with some key themes.
we delivered strong results during the second quarter with record adjusted operating earnings per share. this was driven by strong investment income and solid performance across our businesses. our clear and focused strategy is enabling us to drive greater outcomes for our workplace and institutional clients and this was demonstrated by the results we delivered. in wealth solutions, full service recurring deposits for the trailing 12 months grew approximately 7% compared with the prior year period. we generated $238 million in full-service net flows. this was driven by growth in both our corporate and tax-exempt markets.
in investment management, we generated $249 million of net flows during the second quarter. this was driven by a return to institutional inflows and continuing of new mandates particularly in fixed income strategies. in health solutions, annualized in-force premiums grew nearly 10% year-over-year. this significant increase reflects growth across all of our product lines. in addition to exceptional earnings growth, we continue to demonstrate our focus on being good stewards of shareholder capital. we repurchased over $500 million of shares in the second quarter, leading to $753 million of shares repurchased during the first half of this year. and we had approximately $1.5 billion of excess capital as of june 30.
we expect to repurchase at least $1 billion of our shares during 2021. and we're well positioned to continue to build upon the more than $7.5 billion of capital that we've returned to shareholders through both share buybacks and dividends since our ipo. this quarter, we also continued to advance our focus on the workplace and institutions. on june 9, we completed the sale of the independent financial planning channel of voya financial advisors. and on july 1, we completed our acquisition of benefit strategies, a leading third-party administrator of health account solutions. this strategic acquisition will expand our capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our workplace and institutional clients.
through our purposeful actions, we've positioned voya to meet the context and increasing needs of our clients. our unique digital capabilities, insights and focus on client needs will enable us to create greater value for all of our customers and have positioned us to generate further earnings-per-share growth. voya has a clear focus and unique solutions that will enable us to take advantage of the opportunities before us. we look forward to sharing more detail about the next phase of our growth strategy at our investor day in november.
turning to slide 5; as an original signatory, of the ceo action for diversity and inclusion, voya recently held a day of understanding. this annual initiative encourages organizations to dedicate a day to hosting conversations that advance diversity, equity and inclusion. and in may, we once again celebrated voya's national day of service in its new hybrid format. voya employees volunteered approximately 10,000 hours to numerous nonprofits across the country. as highlighted in a recent forbes article, voya's 2021 inclusive advertising campaign, which features a family with special needs has contributed to new brand highs. this includes total brand awareness, ethics, trust and interest in doing business. this campaign is a continuation of our long-standing commitment to people with disability and special needs, which helped enable voya to earn recognition as a best place to work for disability inclusion for the fourth consecutive year.
voya earned a score of 100% on the 2021 disability equality index. the actions taken by our people and our company reflect our culture and carry through all that we do in our communities and for our customers. we will continue to focus on the needs of all americans in our businesses, our company and in defining the character of our brand.
with that, let me ask mike smith to provide more details on our performance and results.
michael smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
thank you, rod.
turning to our financial results on slide 7; we delivered record after-tax adjusted operating earnings per share of $2.20 in the second quarter of 2021, which included 4 notable items: first, $0.77 of prepayment and alternative income above our long-term expectations, mostly linked to first quarter equity market strength; second, $0.11 of favorable dac/voba and other intangibles unlocking from equity markets in the quarter; third, $0.08 of unfavorable covid-19 related claims impacting health solutions; and fourth, $0.11 of other items, which is primarily driven by incentive compensation related to the strong performance in the quarter. second quarter gaap net income of $459 million reflects several favorable items, including strong underlying operating results and alternative income, gains from the sale of our independent financial planning channel and the sale of our equity investment in venerable. these favorable items were partly offset by cmob mark-to-market and restructuring costs.
moving to slide 8; wealth solutions delivered record adjusted operating earnings of $295 million in the second quarter. this was materially higher than $37 million in the second quarter of 2020, largely driven by a recovery in alternative income. alternative and prepayment income was $96 million above our long-term expectations. while we also experienced a favorable dac unlock in the quarter due to strong equity markets. underlying core business results were also solid this quarter. investments had continued to benefit from the crediting rate actions taken earlier this year and higher surplus income. fee-based revenues benefited from business growth and from higher asset levels that were helped by favorable equity markets. partially offsetting this was the loss of revenue from the sale of our independent financial planning channel. looking ahead, we expect the sale to reduce pre-tax adjusted operating earnings by $10 million to $15 million in the second half of 2021. administrative expenses were also favorable year-over-year, due to a prior year legal accrual, not repeating and our continued focus on expense discipline.
turning to deposits and flows; full service recurring deposits grew 6.7% to over $11 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, led by rising employee and employer contributions. we continue to expect full year 2021 recurring deposit growth in the range of 6% to 8%. we generated $238 million of positive full-service net flows contributing to $2.3 billion of inflows over the last 12 months. we experienced modest recordkeeping and stable value net outflows of $755 million and $502 million in the second quarter, respectively. looking ahead, we anticipate record keeping net outflows in the second half of 2021 due to the termination of 1 large case client and higher participant surrenders as a result of elevated equity market. higher equity markets meaningfully improve earnings but they also increase the size of full service and record-keeping participant's surrenders. while the number of participants' surrenders are on plan, the equity effect on participant surrenders will be a headwind for both record-keeping and full service net flows.
despite this headwind, we still expect overall full year full-service net flows to remain positive. we remain bullish on the growth outlook for 2022 due to our robust pipeline, strong rfp activity and favorable client retention trends.
on slide 9; investment management delivered $66 million of adjusted operating earnings, higher than the second quarter of 2020 by $46 million. the year-over-year improvement included significantly favorable investment capital results, which in this quarter were $20 million above our long-term target. revenues were higher year-over-year due to growth in both institutional and retail client assets. administrative expenses were elevated relative to second quarter 2020, largely due to variable compensation associated with strong investment capital results in the quarter. our adjusted operating margin, including notables, was 34% in the quarter.
turning to flows; we saw a return to positive overall net inflows were $249 million in the quarter. this mostly reflected institutional demand, which was partially offset by modest retail net outflows. we saw fixed income demand from u.s. institutional clients in investment-grade credit and long-duration solutions. and we continue to see a demand for private credit and commercial mortgage loans from our insurance channel clients. our domestic strength was partially offset by some weakness in international flows this quarter. retail flows improved sequentially, however, remained slightly negative this quarter. looking ahead, we expect overall net outflows in the third quarter, driven by a $3 billion client outflow related to a divestiture by an insurance client. as a result, we are lowering our full year 2021 organic growth expectations to 1% to 3%. notwithstanding this, we are still seeing great demand for our solutions across a diverse set of strategies.
encouragingly, this includes demand for higher-margin products that are strengthening our revenue yield profile. for these reasons, we believe our long-term growth outlook remains positive, driven by 3 key strengths: first, our continued exceptional investment performance, demonstrated by 89% of our fixed income funds outperforming their 3-, 5- and 10-year benchmarks in the second quarter; second, the strength of our distribution channels and a significant unfunded pipeline; and third, the diversity in our solutions providing clients with a differentiated value proposition.
turning to slide 10; health solutions delivered a record earnings quarter with adjusted operating earnings of $63 million in the second quarter, despite the impact of excess group life claims related to covid. this result compares favorably to $36 million in the second quarter of 2020. similar to the other businesses, health solutions benefited from strong alternative and prepayment income, which exceeded our long-term target by $11 million. underlying business performance was exceptional. annualized in-force premiums grew 9.8% year-over-year. we experienced growth across all product lines, including double-digit growth in voluntary and stop loss. the total aggregate loss ratio was 71.6% on a trailing 12-month basis within our targeted range of 70% to 73%. we continue to see favorable voluntary loss ratios in the second quarter. also reflected in the total aggregate loss ratio is $73 million of covid-related claims over the last 12 months, of which, $13 million were incurred in the second quarter of 2021. we attributed an additional $15 million of previously reported claims to covid following the receipt of updated cause of death information, $5 million of which impacted the first quarter of 2021. please note that this does not change previously reported financial results.
we continue to expect a pre-tax covid earnings impact of roughly $10 million for the remainder of the year and overall impact of the pandemic to be within our expected range of $1 million to $2 million per 10,000 u.s. death. this quarter, we closed on our acquisition of benefit strategies, which accelerates our presence in the fast-growing hsa market and expands on a range of solutions offered through the workplace. we expect future earnings momentum to be supported by reduced covid-related headwinds and a strong pipeline of 2022 activity.
turning to slide 11. in the third quarter, we showed the effect of alternative income returning to our long-term expectation of 9% annual growth and the favorable second quarter dac unlock, not repeating. we pay a seasonally higher preferred stock dividend in the third quarter and will realize a full quarter's impact of the sale of our independent financial planning channel. we also expect health solutions voluntary loss ratios to normalize. specific to wealth solutions, we foresee continued headwinds from lower interest rates. favorable third quarter eps items include an improvement in group life underwriting due to lower covid-related claims. we also expect lower incentive compensation in the third quarter. third quarter eps also includes a $0.09 per share benefit from the late june asr program. potential market impacts affecting third quarter outlook are not included on this page.
there are, of course, other factors that could affect third quarter results, including potential share repurchases over and above the second quarter asr, warrant dilution, business growth and additional unexpected covid-19 impacts. while we typically do not guide on excess prepayment and alternative income, there may be upside to third quarter adjusted operating earnings following strong equity market performance in the second quarter.
turning to slide 12. year-to-date, we have returned almost $800 million to shareholders and more than $7.5 billion of capital to shareholders since we have been a public company through dividends and share repurchases. in the second quarter, we repurchased $518 million in shares through a combination of asrs and open market repurchases. this quarter's repurchase activity puts us well on track to reach at least $1 billion of repurchases in 2021. our ending excess capital position was $1.5 billion, which included the majority of the proceeds from the sale of our independent financial planning channel. our estimated rbc ratio is 545%, while our financial leverage ratio was 30.2%. our leverage ratio is lower than last quarter, reflecting strong earnings, gain on sale impacts and increases in aoci and non-controlling interests driven by financial markets.
finally, with respect to our covid-related capital impacts, year-to-date, we have incurred roughly $20 million of net negative ratings migration and credit impairments, including a net positive impact in the second quarter. due to improving macro conditions, our previously shared stress scenarios no longer apply. that said, we could see up to a gross $100 million of credit-related impacts in the second half of 2021 in the unlikely event, there is a significant shock from covid-related impacts.
in summary, we are pleased with our record second quarter earnings results and the performance of our underlying businesses. we believe our highly regarded workplace and institutional franchises are poised for long-term success, and we generate high free cash flow and have a significant excess capital position. we will continue to act as good stewards of capital as we look to deploy proceeds in the best interest of shareholders.
with that, i will turn the call back to the operator so that we can take your questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from jimmy bhullar with jpmorgan.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
so i had a question primarily on the asset management business? and if you can sort of give us a little bit more insight into the $3 billion mandate that you're losing, what it actually is in terms of asset class? and then the fees and/or the margins on that business, just so we get a better sense of the impact on revenues? and then relatedly, what gives you the confidence that you will actually have positive flows for the year? and how should we think about like what's driving that?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
jimmy, thank you. christine?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer of investment management
yes. thank you, jimmy. so first, let's start with the $3 billion outflow. it was as a result of a client that sold the business, so not at all related to invest performance. and so how to think about what that mandate was? it was core public fixed income. and so when you think about mandate, that we manage just given the size of the relationship with our clients as well as it being public fixed income, it's on the lower side of what we typically do in terms of base points as far as how to think about that. now moving on to your question about -- in the context of that outflow, what gives us the confidence because we're -- we just pivoted our guidance down from 2 to 4 to 1 to 3. so very strong. and we expect to have our sixth straight year of positive net cash flow sourced from our distribution team. so why is that? what do we see?
we see a really robust pipeline. it's not just 1 huge mandate that we're expecting to fund. but rather, it's quite diversified, both on client type as well as strategy. and i would say, jimmy, one thing too, that we've seen this year that is really changing, that's gone from a bit of a headwind, if you will, in converting our flows into win was commercial real estate due to covid. we have strong demand for that asset class, and it was just hard to get out. but as we've seen the economy reopen, capital getting exchanged, that's really starting to pick up for us. so from a lot of lenses as we look at it, we're confident that we're going to have a strong remainder of the year.
jimmy bhullar -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. then, if i could just ask one more on buybacks. i think you mentioned that you intend to do at least $1 billion. i just wanted to -- and you've been doing a lot more than that, obviously, through the first half if you prorate that. so is the $1 billion sort of a minimum number that you intend to do? or -- and what's the likelihood of upside to that assuming your results are fairly stable and credit line?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
jimmy, it's rod. what we've said is we will do at least $1 billion. and as you well point out, we've returned almost $800 million to shareholders in the first half of this year. and as you're well familiar, if you look at the -- at least $1 billion in a single year basis, that's over 10%, well over 10% of our market cap. so we've got a lot of confidence in the momentum that we have. we've got a lot of -- we're very proud of the track record that we've -- that's delivered back to me to $7.5-plus billion. and we feel good about where we are in the year and what we'll deliver for the second half of the year.
operator
our next question comes from john barnidge with piper sandler.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
during 2q '21, im closed its first new infrastructure fund on project financing the renewable space. can you talk about fees for this relative to the overall fixed income business? and how big of a business opportunity this could be?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
christine?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer of investment management
sure, john. thanks for the question. so yes, you're absolutely right. we did do our first close of a really differentiated product, which is an infra debt fund that's focused on renewable energy. so i think the next of infrastructure and esg all-in-one product offering. so we're very excited about the potential for the fund and the value it's going to give clients. so we did our first close. we're working on a second close in the third quarter. and again, really excited longer run about what we're going to be able to do with this particular offering. and i would say not to get specifically into the fees themselves, but know that this is a differentiated private credit structure. so it's going to have meaningfully higher fees than your normal fixed income mandate.
and again, just one other thought about what's going to drive growth that makes us excited, is we're working on actually creating a fund that will be more capital efficient for our insurance clients. so again, just another reason to think why this is going to be a real winner for us in the long run.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. [indecipherable] traditionally 15% to 18%., it's been above that in the first half of the year. does it seem likely this dynamic should probably persist, assuming vii in the near term is favorable?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
mike?
michael smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
john, thanks for the question. in any quarter where the alternative income or other factors drive outsized earnings result that's going to drive a higher tax rate. and potentially, as we've seen in the last couple of quarters because the alternatives have performed so well, even a little of our range of 15% to 18%. i don't think -- we clearly don't expect that to be a persistent effect. but as long as the alternative performance continues to be strong, that will drive that result.
operator
our next question comes from erik bass with autonomous research.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
i was hoping you could talk a bit about the outlook for retirement, recurring deposits and the trends you're seeing in a participant and employer level? and is there any potential for upside to your outlook given the economic recovery we're seeing?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
heather?
heather lavallee -- - chief executive officer of wealth solutions
yes. thank you, erik. i mean we'll start by saying that right now, we're very much in line with our targets of the 6% to 8% recurring deposit growth on a trailing 12-month basis for the year. as you commented, we are seeing some nice double-digit growth in our employer contributions and employee contributions. and we still expect to see sequential improvement in recurring deposits throughout the year. we're also seeing an increase in participants contributing. so overall, macroeconomics are definitely helping us to improve our recurring deposit view for the year. and really, what i would say is, for now, for us, it is just expecting that we are going to come in right on target and that we're benefiting from macroeconomic conditions driving our growth.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
got it. and then there was recently another large consolidation transaction in the retirement market. so just wondering your views if the threshold for adequate scale is changing at all? and does this shift your views at all on m&a?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
heather, do you want to begin on the scale piece first?
heather lavallee -- - chief executive officer of wealth solutions
yes, happy to. yes. so for starters, we're top 5 to 5 defined contribution provider, and we're at scale to compete in all of the markets that we play in. and if you look at it, our organic growth rate over the past several years has outpaced the industry. specifically, we have not needed inorganic growth to drive our success. and we're winning in the market and our competitive position is really resonating with clients and intermediaries. and when you think about it, when the decision comes down to a small number of very fine companies, voya stands out. we stand out around our unique culture, our purposeful innovation and our commitment to the retirement market, our competitive suite of workplace offerings across health, wealth and investment management that are improving customer outcomes. and the other thing that i would say around this is that when we see movement in the industry and, frankly, this type of consolidation, they create opportunities for us to win business.
we tend to see an increase in off-cycle rfp volumes during consolidation, and voya has been actually a strong beneficiary of this type of activity in the past. and so bottom line is, we really like our position to win and grow organically in our target markets and are at scale to compete today.
operator
our next question comes from the line of ryan krueger with kbw.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
when you think about the $1.60 to $1.70 eps range that you had guided for the fourth quarter of this year, can you just comment on if you feel like things -- everything that's happened this year if you're still on track to that?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
sure, ryan. mike?
michael smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
ryan, thanks for the question. so in short, if you continue to use the old definition of normalized earnings, which we've really gone away from, but just to keep it on an apples-to-apples basis. we would expect that we would be at the low end of that range in or around the bottom of the range. however, there's an important factor to consider, which is that includes the impact of incentive compensation this year that is really pretty much entirely driven by the outsized alternative performance. and that's one of the reasons i think that we've gone away from the normalized is it was very difficult to kind of fully extract the impacts of outsized alternative performance. so, if you do back that out, and i think it's a fair way to look at it, we'd actually be toward the top end of that range. and backing out is also important as you think about 2022 because the increased expense is a temporary phenomenon, and it goes away as incentive comp starts over beginning in 2022.
and the last thing is, just to keep in mind is as you think about alternative income, and we tend to want to back it out, it's still pretty helpful in terms of the excess capital position. it's been a meaningful contributor to that $1.5 billion of excess and will enable us to put it to work in ways that i think are very beneficial to shareholders. so it's real money, but it's -- we single it out as it's not sustainable. but also the incentive comp effects are related to that, i think, especially this year. and so think of it as we'll be in a good position ex the incentive comp, i think we'd be near the top end of that range.
ryan krueger -- kbw -- analyst
that's really helpful. and just to make sure i have this right. so ongoing higher incentive comp in the back half of the year will run, i guess, it sounds like maybe in like mid- to high single-digit sense per quarter in the next couple of quarters before going back to normal in 2022?
michael smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
that is correct. think of that as about -- depending on share count, $0.07 to $0.08.

our next question comes from humphrey lee with dowling & partners.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners -- analyst
my first question is related to the leverage ratio, which seems to have come down quite a bit given the sizable book value moves in the quarter. at this point, does it change your outlook for debt reduction for the back half of the year?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
mike?
michael smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
humphrey, thanks for the question. so our outlook for the debt repurchase has been consistently $600 million to $800 million related to the -- and this goes back to when we first announced the life transaction, $600 million, $800 million of debt pay down. we made a down payment on that in the first quarter with a $75 million. so for the balance, i would expect given the favorable movement in leverage, and that was driven by strong earnings, including the gain on the sale of the financial planning channel, as well as favorable movements in aoci as of june 30 as well as the non-controlling interest driven by equity markets. so that, i think, gives us a little more flexibility. it would probably push us toward the lower end of that range and maybe even below it. so we'll see how events unfold in the coming weeks. obviously, we're in a very dynamic situation. i think we still -- we feel good about where the economy is betting overall and about certainly the trajectory of voya. but we'll be mindful of the environment and look to make probably a meaningful progress on the debt paydown in the third quarter if things are proceeding normally.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners -- analyst
so, one of the health insurers has talked about rising medical costs in the outlook that is affecting their kind of earnings for the back half of the year and maybe into 2022 on their earnings call. i know the topic of medical cost inflation is not new. but given some of the broader inflation concerns that we're seeing, how do you see the inflation affecting your stop loss business? does it change your pricing strategy in the near term?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
rob?
robert grubka -- chief executive officer of health solutions
sure. thanks, humphrey. so inflation in medical is not a new thing. to your point, is it in a different stage or a different cycle of how it could impact cost around care and those things. obviously, in this business, just to level set on stop loss, as a reminder, it's a business that we're going to reprice every year. as we look at the balance of our growth, a big part of why the stop loss business has grown in the past is driven by exactly this dynamic around medical inflation. so there's an element of, did you get your assumptions right for sure, that we got to continue to pay attention to again, just come back to the -- we get a reprice and reassess things on an annual basis, which certainly reduces the risk as you might think about it over a period of time. and the other dynamic i'd just point to, sometimes there's a pure medical inflation cost of just resources that go into it. another big driver that may be applied in here is just the cost of pharmaceuticals and the actual sort of pipeline of drugs that are coming to get we're equally paying attention to that. but again, you come back to this annual dynamic that's built into how the products are managed and run, and we feel good about how we're positioned to respond to that. we, like others, as you just pointed out, being close to pay close attention to that as it evolves into the future, though.

our next question comes from andrew kligerman with credit suisse.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
so just to follow up on the wealth solutions question about the competitive dynamics. i think when empower did the transaction with prudential, they showed a slide, i think they had $1.4 trillion, $1.5 trillion in assets under administration. and i think voya is somewhere in the $500 billion range. so we think going forward, are there areas where you might want to acquire that you might want to get bigger even with the backdrop that you do have scale? and maybe just the same question in health solutions. we've seen peers do bolt-ons and acquire there too, maybe the same exact question in-house solutions?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
andrew, i'll start. we've talked about previously when asked a question about what might we consider from an m&a perspective, looking at and evaluating adding a book of business in a line of business that we're in. so that is something that we certainly would consider. as heather pointed out, we've got over 6 million participants. we've added 850,000 in the last 2 years. and one of the great parts about the rfp process, as heather talked about, is the market is very efficient, and you're narrowed down to 2 very fine players. and then the choice is made. and increasingly, we're finding that choice is made with voya. so would we consider adding a book of business? we would. but our plan through this year has been, as you know, fully organic, and we fully expect to meet or exceed that plan based just on the organic growth. but heather, feel free to jump in.
heather lavallee -- - chief executive officer of wealth solutions
i'll add a couple of points on to what you said, i agree 100% with what you said. but i think some of the other things that had been pointed out with the prudential acquisition have been enhanced capabilities and particularly pointing to non-qual capability. and when we look at not only our scale, we also look at the robust solutions that we offer across the market segment. and we already have a very strong non-qual business. we have continued to enhance our offerings around financial wellness. i think about our partnership with our health business and the hsa product that rob team has been growing as a wonderful complement and we're seeing a lot of really positive momentum. so to me, it's not just around scale play. we have been taking appropriate action to bring down our expenses while continuing to invest in the business. we continue to enhance our platform, our participant, engagement, experience, our security protocols and all of the things that, frankly, are really taking precedent in the minds of our clients and intermediary partners. so while we wouldn't rule it out, again, our focus is very much around what are the capabilities that we need and to make sure we can compete at scale and at a competitive cost structure, and we think we're well positioned to do that.
robert grubka -- chief executive officer of health solutions
this is rob. maybe i'll just, andrew, to your point on pivot into health for sec. just all great comments have been made. but in the health space, when you look back at us over the last few years. obviously, we've done a tremendous job growing the top line. if you stack us up against a number of different competitors and you look at it in aggregate, you could argue we've been small. i think what i'd point out and push on is just where we choose to play this product solutions capability, the service and customer support that goes with it. we have no trouble competing. and again, you see the results this quarter, 10% top line growth, record bottom line numbers. i feel good about our position as we move forward from here as well. and to heather's comments, how do we bring capabilities to play, be really deliberate on what we do versus what we don't do and finding ways to differentiate ourselves and drive ultimately better outcomes. the work that's been going on will continue to go on, and we'll talk more about this at investor day, we see a lot of upside opportunity as we look into the future.
operator
our next question comes from tom gallagher with evercore.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
just a question on the stranded cost program. where do you see it going? and are you still on track to have it largely completed by the end of this year? i guess if you look at corporate expenses for the 3q bridge, they seem to be running high, but from what i'm hearing from you, it sounds like that's more comp accrual than stranded costs, is that fair?
robert grubka -- chief executive officer of health solutions
mike?
michael smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
tom, thanks for the question. so first, broadly speaking, the stranded cost program has two components, right? first, it's the stranded costs, but there's also a transition service arrangement fees that are coming our way. and so what's coming through the corporate program or corporate line is the net of those things. we expect the standard cost to be taken care of by the end of next year. along the way, the tsas will come down kind of alongside that, it won't necessarily be joined at the hip, but they'll generally be consistent with that. so by the end of '22, we expect to be fully neutralized. in terms of the corporate walk, think of it this way. you've got -- we came in at 71% loss for corporate in the second quarter. you've got a differential in incentive comp between second and third quarter of about $7 million. and then there's going to be a couple of other things, largely improvement in the net stranded costs that gets you to another 4. so that gets you to the $60 million. and then you add in the pref dividend and $70 million. and so then you've got -- that's why we're bracketing $65 million to $75 million as the expectation for corporate.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. and my follow-up is just a free cash flow conversion question. the 90% plus or i think it's 95% that you're guiding to. just remind me how many years left at that level? how much of that is being driven by utilization of tax assets? and what happens when you're done fully depleting the nols? where would you see that trending on the other side?
michael smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
yes, it's a pretty straightforward answer, right? we expect the tax benefit to persist for at least 5 years and maybe a few years beyond that. so it's a little hard to say where we'll be when we get there. but that will really depend on how the business mix evolves from here. but in all of our businesses, i think we've got pretty high cash conversion. ultimately, though, the way to think about this is the tax benefit and the corporate costs, including debt and so on are kind of netting out to be 0. so if and when, and at the time the tax benefit does fully get utilized, then you would see the corporate start to come in and reduce it a bit over time.
operator
our next question comes from the line of elyse greenspan with wells fargo.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
my first question; so in response to an earlier question, you guys alluded to the fact that you could be at the low end or actually below the low end of that $600 million to $800 million debt paydown that you had targeted. so if you're ending up lower on that debt pay down, and how -- should we expect that then there could be incremental buybacks relative to the $1 billion plan for the year?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
mike?
michael smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
well, and again, elyse, thanks for the question. just to remind, it's at least $1 billion and we mean at least. so please don't view $1 billion as the -- it's kind of -- don't think of that as a ceiling. so certainly, as we think about the use of proceeds and our debt pay downs go down, then that would make more available for potential share repurchases. so it all hangs together. the exact timing of that and so on is certainly paying down less debt does create a bit more flexibility for us on the other side.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
okay, great. and then in terms of health solutions, the margins there and the loss ratios have trended pretty well relative to your targets just when we neutralize for covid. so anything kind of one-off that you've seen? or should we just expect that things normalize kind of the ratios to stay within group life and stop loss kind of within the 77%-80%. and then, maybe just a little bit of reversion to more normal levels in voluntary, like i think you pointed out?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
rob?
robert grubka -- chief executive officer of health solutions
yes, sure. thanks, elyse. look, i think you summarized it pretty well for me. what we've seen, as you said, without covid and doing those views, we think our guidance is still appropriate. obviously, we'll see how the third and fourth quarter transpire relative to covid, and we'll be able to be more specific about expectations moving forward from there. we highlighted the impact and the strong results from a loss ratio perspective around the voluntary block. if you peel that back just to call it out, it's not been said yet, but regardless of the product you looked at, we sort of saw that dynamic going on, we would expect that to revert as we put in the guide for 3q. but we'll continue to monitor it closely. stop loss has really been middle of the fairway for us so far this year; lots of experience to continue to emerge in the back half of the year. but again, based on what we're seeing at this point in time, we feel really good about the results that we're seeing and just the overall trend of the book is running where we had expected to, and we'll try hard to keep it in the middle of the fairway and make it easy for you.
operator
our next question comes from mike ward with ubs.
mike ward -- ubs -- analyst
i just had one question. i was wondering about the investment portfolio stress tests. and i don't think this is necessarily front and center of these days, thankfully. but 1 of your competitors actually with a very similar business mix as you guys this quarter, they lowered their credit loss expectations or their kind of stress case to basically 0 to actually maybe positive from upwards ratings migration a little bit. so i was wondering if there are certain asset classes or sectors where you still see actual credit ratings migration risk in your portfolio?
rodney martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
mike, do you want to start?
michael smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
sure. mike, thank you for the question. i think the way to think about the stress case is simply if things change from here in a meaningfully adverse way, i think we're just trying to sort of put an estimate of what it could mean. but i think as we look ahead, kind of in the most likely path, i don't think we're that far off from where what you described is. we don't see anything other than kind of normal levels of migration ahead. and there's always an undertone of that, but we also have ability to manage the portfolio and create offsets as we go forward. so, kind of our expectation is that it's not a capital impact. if we see a meaningful change in direction around economics potential shutdowns, lockdowns, economic activity reverses, then maybe you could see some additional pressure there. and we were just trying to ballpark it and think of the 100 relative to where we had been six months ago or a year ago, thinking it could be potentially much larger than that.
so overall, we feel good about the portfolio. i don't think there's a read-through in allocations or anything of the sort that we would be a differentiator.

this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference call back over to rod martin for any closing remarks.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the voya financial's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to michael katz, executive vice president, finance, strategy and investor relations. please go ahead.
mike katz -- executive vice president and chief strategy, planning & investor relations officer
thank you, and good morning. welcome to voya financial's third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. we appreciate all of you who have joined us for this call. as a reminder, materials for today's call are available on our website at investors.voya.com or via the webcast. turning to slide 2. some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law. i refer you to this slide for more information. we will also be referring today to certain non-gaap financial measures. gaap reconciliations are available in our press release and financial supplement found on our website, investors.voya.com. joining me on the call are rod martin, our chairman and chief executive officer; as well as mike smith, our vice chairman and chief financial officer. after their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. for that q&a session, we have also invited our vice chairman and chief growth officer, charlie nelson; as well as the heads of our businesses, specifically, heather lavallee, wealth solutions; christine hurtsellers, investment management; and rob grubka, health solutions. with that, let's turn to slide three as i would like to turn the call over to rod.
rod martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
good morning. let's begin on slide four with our key themes. we delivered strong results during the third quarter with record adjusted operating eps for our second consecutive quarter. this was driven by strong alternative income and solid performance across our businesses. we continue to see strong demand for our solutions. this has translated to top line growth in our businesses in the third quarter, which, based on our expectations, will extend into the fourth quarter as well. in wealth solutions, full service recurring deposits for the trailing 12 months grew 8.7% compared with the prior year period. and we generated positive full service net inflows of $355 million. this reflects continued sales growth and strong retention in several markets. in investment management, we generated solid fixed income inflows in the third quarter. already in the fourth quarter, over $7 billion of new mandates have funded. and this demonstrates the continued appeal of our investment strategies. as a result, we expect annual net flows to be at the high end of our 1% to 3% organic growth target for 2021. in health solutions, annualized in-force premiums grew approximately 11% compared with the prior year period. this was driven by growth across all product lines and reflects the continued demand for our protection solutions among both employers and employees. we have executed a number of initiatives to effectively manage and deploy capital. on share repurchases, we are currently executing additional buybacks and now expect to repurchase at least $1.1 billion of common stock for the full year 2021. on a more long-term, forward-looking note, we also recently received an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization from the board. in addition, last week, we announced a more than 20% increase in our dividend to $0.20 per share. given the strong performance of voya common stock, this enables us to maintain a dividend yield of over 1% and is yet another demonstration of our confidence in our businesses. collectively, we expect that our capital actions this year will result in us having returned almost $8 billion of capital through both dividends and buybacks since our ipo. finally, as we announced last week, we will extinguish approximately $400 million of senior debt by the end of november.
looking ahead, we remain well positioned to execute on our strategic priorities with approximately $1.5 billion of excess capital. the results that are noted on this slide reflect our ability to continue to drive organic growth across our businesses. we are leveraging our scale, our significant distribution relationships and our capabilities to deliver greater outcomes for clients. we're also demonstrating the value of our high free cash flow businesses, which have enabled us to deliver greater shareholder value. we have a clear focus on the workplace and institutions at a time of growing demand for our capabilities. and we're further centering ourselves around the needs of our clients. as a result, we're better positioned than ever to drive top and bottom line growth. the combination of client demand, voya's leading market positions and our clear focus will enable us to deliver further profitable growth and shareholder value. we look forward to sharing more details on our strategy and outlook at investor day on november 15. turning to slide 5. during october, which is national disability employment awareness month, we partnered with the ceo commission for disability employment, disability:in and the valuable 500 to highlight the need to increase and improve the employment of people with disabilities and special needs. as a testament of our leadership and success in the industry, we were recently named retirement leader of the year at fund intelligence's mutual fund industry and etf awards. our work to advance our culture was further validated by our recent recognition as a great place to work for the sixth consecutive year, which aligns with the positive feedback that we've heard from our people throughout the year. and savoy magazine recently recognized two of voya's board members, yvette butler and aylwin lewis, on its 2021 most influential black corporate directors list in the publication's fall issue. with that, let me ask mike smith to provide more details on our third quarter performance and results.
mike smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
thank you, rod. turning to third quarter financial results on slide 7. we delivered another record quarter of earnings with $2.57 of after-tax adjusted operating earnings per share. this reflected strong underlying business results and $1.17 of prepayment and alternative income above our long-term expectations. there were a few notable items in the third quarter eps. we saw $0.05 of favorable dac/voba and other intangibles unlocking, primarily related to our annual assumption updates. this minimal impact was a result of our derisking actions over the last few years. we expect the annual assumption process will continue to be less meaningful going forward. given the surge in u.s. covid-related deaths in the third quarter, we experienced $0.14 of unfavorable covid-related claims impacting health solutions. and we also saw several other smaller items that total the net unfavorable $0.18. this included a legal accrual in wealth solutions and incentive compensation related to the strong alternative performance for the year. third quarter gaap net income of $142 million reflects strong underlying operating results and alternative income. this was negatively affected by a $121 million after-tax impact from the assumption update on our recently reinsured life business. importantly, this reduction in the reinsurance-related gaap intangible had no cash impact to voya. moving to slide 8. we generated another quarter of record results in wealth solutions with adjusted operating earnings of $319 million in the third quarter. this is meaningfully higher year-over-year due to favorable alternative and prepayment income and continued strength in underlying business results. spread revenues improved year-over-year due to higher surplus income as well as lower credited interest due to rate actions taken earlier in the year. this was partly offset by lower investment income, driven by the ongoing rate environment. fee-based revenue meaningfully increased year-over-year, driven by full service client net flows over the period and by favorable equity markets. in the quarter, we realized a full quarter impact to fee-based revenue from our independent financial planning channel sale. the earnings impact of this was in line with our annual pre-tax guidance of $20 million to $30 million.
stranded costs from this transaction are included in the wealth solutions results and will be eliminated by the end of 2022. administrative expenses, excluding notables, were in line year-over-year. looking ahead, we expect fourth quarter expenses to be moderately higher than third quarter due to the timing of certain expenses, such as advertising. this quarter, we have begun to share the operating margins for our health and wealth businesses. for wealth, our margin was over 36% on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding notables. please refer to our investor supplement for more detail on how we calculate this metric. turning to deposits and flows. full service recurring deposits grew to $11.8 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. as employee and employer contributions continue to strengthen in corporate markets, we now expect full year 2021 recurring deposit growth to be at the high end of our 6% to 8% guidance. we generated $355 million of positive full service net flows, bringing our total full service net flows year-to-date to $1.5 billion. meanwhile, recordkeeping and stable value realized net outflows of $1.8 billion and $719 million, respectively, in the quarter. looking to fourth quarter, we anticipate some full service and recordkeeping net outflows but expect to end the year with between $500 million to $1 billion in positive full service net flows with good momentum going into 2022. as we noted on last quarter's call, higher equity markets have the effect of increasing the dollar amount of participant surrenders even as the number of surrenders remains in line with our expectations. while higher equity markets are a headwind for net flows, market levels supported record results for the quarter and over $1 billion of earnings over the last 12 months. overall, we have a robust pipeline across all market segments, a strong distribution team and a competitive suite of workplace solutions, giving us confidence in our ability to achieve profitable growth going forward. on slide 9, investment management delivered $63 million of adjusted operating earnings, higher than the third quarter of 2020 of $47 million. the year-over-year improvement was driven by favorable investment capital and growth in fee income. revenues were higher year-over-year due to growth in both institutional and retail client assets. administrative expenses were modestly higher than third quarter 2020, largely due to variable compensation linked with fee income growth and strong investment capital results in the quarter. our trailing 12-month operating margin improved year-over-year to 33.1%, including investment capital, and 26.1% on an ex notables basis.
turning to flows. overall, third quarter net outflows of $1.1 billion reflected an insurance client outflow that we signaled last quarter. this masked the strength in institutional flows, which included two clo closings, including one european clo, as well as multiple private credit mandates. while we had retail net outflows in the quarter, we have made several enhancements to our equity platform in an effort to improve our position heading into 2022. our fixed income performance also remains strong with over 90% of our fixed income funds outperforming their benchmarks on a 3-, 5- and 10-year basis. looking ahead, we expect to reach the high end of our full year 2021 overall organic growth rate of 1% to 3%. we have confidence in this outcome, given the already $7 billion of funded mandates in october. these are large-scale mandates that we expect will be margin-accretive. additionally, we do not expect to realize performance fees in the fourth quarter related to our mortgage derivative strategy. that said, this strategy has performed exceptionally well over the long term and expect to return to performance fees in 2022. clients value this strategy as it produces alpha uncorrelated to global credit risk and equity markets. going forward, we continue to see great demand for our solutions across a diverse set of strategies. this includes demand for higher-margin products, including our growing private and alternatives franchise. we are confident in our outlook, given the excellent public and private asset performance, our broad range of solutions and our strong distribution team. turning to slide 10. health solutions delivered another record quarter of adjusted operating earnings at $71 million. this result compares favorably to $56 million in the third quarter of 2020. similar to the other businesses, health solutions also benefited from strong alternative and prepayment income. underlying business performance was strong despite the impact of excess group life claims related to covid. similar to wealth solutions and investment management, we are introducing operating margins metrics for health. our health solutions margin was over 33% on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding covid claims and other notables. given our recent favorable claims experience excluding notables, we would expect margins to normalize to closer to 30% once the pandemic subsides. annualized in-force premiums grew close to 11% year-over-year. we experienced growth across all product lines with continued strong growth in voluntary and stop loss. the total aggregate loss ratio, including the impact of covid, was 71.6% and on a trailing 12-month basis, within our targeted range of 70% to 73%.
excluding notables and the impact of covid, we would be below that range. our total aggregate loss ratio included $85 million of covid-related claims over the last 12 months. we incurred $22 million in the third quarter of 2021. the impact in the quarter was on the high side of our guidance as deaths were more common in younger working ages than had been seen in past quarters. we expect this age shift will persist going forward. as a result, we expect to be at the higher end of our estimated $1 million to $2 million in claims per 10,000 u.s. covid deaths in coming quarters. looking ahead, we have a healthy pipeline powered by our expansive distribution. and early indications are for continued strong top line growth as we approach the january one renewals and sales season. before we turn to slide 11, given the actions we have taken to simplify our company and in an effort to focus investors on our longer-term goals, we will no longer be providing our quarterly eps walk slide. that said, we will continue to periodically communicate guidance with respect to developments in our business and financial outlook as circumstances dictate. please see slide 15 of the appendix for more detailed commentary on the fourth quarter. now turning to slide 11 on shareholder return. by year-end, including dividends, we expect that our capital actions will result in us having returned almost $8 billion of capital to shareholders since we have been a public company. year-to-date, we have returned approximately $900 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. this includes the completion of our june asr as well as october repurchase activity. by year-end, we expect to repurchase at least $1.1 billion of shares. additionally, in order to keep pace with our strong stock performance, we increased our dividend by over 20%, thereby maintaining our dividend yield of over 1%. we also recently called for redemption nearly $400 million of debt. this will reduce both our leverage and future interest expense. our financial leverage ratio is now 27.5%, below our 30% target. finally, given our strong excess capital and rbc ratio, we announced that our board has approved a new $500 million share repurchase authorization. while our excess capital reflects an rbc target of 400%, we intend to lower our target to 375%, effective with the end of 2021. this change coincides with the effective date of new higher rbc c1 factors and will have minimal impact on excess capital.
in summary, we are pleased with another quarter of record earnings and the strong underlying performance of our businesses. we believe our highly regarded workplace and institutional franchises, powered by our expansive distribution, are poised for long-term success. and we will continue to generate high free cash flow, adding to our significant excess capital position. we look forward to sharing more on our long-term strategy and financial outlook in a few days at our investor day on november 15. with that, i will turn the call back to the operator so that we can take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question today is from nigel dally of morgan stanley. please proceed with your question.
nigel dally -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks. good morning. i had a question on capital management. you've been at the $1.5 billion or above in terms of excess capital every quarter this year. in the past, i think you've been very good stewards of capital. but more recently, it seems like you're holding back on returning that capital back to shareholders. so why that reluctance? i know you're planning to ramp it up somewhat in the fourth quarter. but it still seems like you could be a lot more aggressive, so just trying to understand the rationale there.

thank you, rod, and thank you, nigel, for the question. maybe i'd start by trying to put the actions that we've taken in perspective. and if you think about what we've done and what we will have done over the last six months of the year, you've got a $400 million asr that completed in the middle of september, you've got $400 million of debt actions and you've got $100 million of share repurchases so far this quarter with at least another $200 million coming forward. so over the last six months of the year, we will put together -- put to work, excuse me, $1.1 billion at least of capital. so i feel like that's -- we feel really good about the pacing on that. we feel really good about our leverage and overall capital position and the flexibility it affords us. so i think we continue to think about what the right pacing is going forward, continue to monitor conditions. and over that period, you can expect nothing to be different from the way we've managed in the past. i think everything we've done this year has been consistent with the philosophy we've used over the last several years. and i feel very comfortable with it.
nigel dally -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great, thank you.

the next question is from tom gallagher of evercore isi. please proceed with your question.
thomas gallagher -- evercore isi institutional equities -- analyst
good morning. mike, just wanted to make sure -- and i realize you're not giving out the bridge anymore, but just wanted to make sure we're thinking about it correctly. there's a bunch of items that seem to be, i guess, you could probably argue, somewhat one-timer in nature for q4. can you give a level that if you did still provide the bridge that you'd expect to be at?
mike smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
yes, tom, let me try to frame it up this way, and thanks for the question. so the guidance we had given in the past was that we thought the fourth quarter would be in the high end of the $1.60 to $1.70 range, assuming normal alternatives or expected levels of alternative performance and excluding the impact of alternative performance thus far this year on incentive comp, right? that was where we were. that guidance really continues to hold with a couple of new things. first is the performance fees that we talked about in investment management that are not expected to occur this year, but -- and i think that may have been what you were alluding to. over time, those have been really strong. but in this particular year, you should think of those as being close to 0. and then the other new thing will be covid, i think, when we gave the guidance at the end of last quarter, i think our expectation was that covid in 4q would be relatively small. while we don't have a number and nor am i going to try and estimate what u.s. deaths are, we did give the guidance of $1 million to $2 million in claims for every 10,000 u.s. deaths. and we expect to probably be at the high end of that. so you can you can plug in your best guess as to what covid deaths would be for the u.s. in the quarter and translate that. but that should be the main adjustment. so if you put those two things in, on top of the incentive comps that we talked about before, i think that should get you in the neighborhood.
thomas gallagher -- evercore isi institutional equities -- analyst
got you. and then mike, just a follow-up on that. i also saw the elevated expenses in your wealth segment is sequentially something like a $0.15 to $0.16 headwind. and is that something -- so if i just compare it to like what the $1.67 of core, that would also be a reduction sequentially. and is that something we should be thinking about as normal spending in the business? or would you view that as unusual, not likely to be replicated in 4q of next year?
mike smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
so we'll be able to talk maybe a little bit more about '22 guidance at investor day. but there are some timing things that i think are putting that a little bit above sort of a normal trendable. but we'll get more into where we expect to be in '22 and beyond in a couple of weeks.
thomas gallagher -- evercore isi institutional equities -- analyst
ok, thanks.

the next question is from andrew kligerman of credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse ag -- analyst
hey, thanks a lot. good morning. back on the capital management question, and again just respecting that your programs have been excellent over the years, it did seem odd that you only bought back $100 million in the third quarter. and it's caused a number of people to question whether your stance on m&a has changed. i know you've recently mentioned that there could be areas of interest. but it would be good to kind of hear you just either restate or update us on your stance with regard to m&as.
rod martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
andrew, good morning. it's rod. mike and i will toggle back and forth. our position on m&a is the following. we've stated, as you just summarized, that we've been, in my view, very responsible with capital and will continue to be as we look at opportunities to further accelerate voya's growth and our outlook. in my opinion, our track record is second to none in terms of the discipline we've had. and that applies coequally to how we approach m&a. that has not changed. eps will continue to be a very important metric for us as we look at and assess inorganic opportunities. and we're going to -- and we continue to believe that share repurchase are a core part of our story. and absent other actions to create shareholder value, you're going to see that philosophy and approach be very consistent. mike?
mike smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
thank you, rod. andrew, the only thing i'd add is just maybe to help people understand what actually occurred in the third quarter as it relates to repurchases. so the asr that we entered, the $400 million asr we entered in late second quarter, was effectively all executed in the third quarter. so that -- essentially, the $400 million of shares were bought during the third quarter at an average price of a little over $63.50. so that had -- that activity was certainly going on. and then with the activity that we had planned for the fourth quarter, i think that basically winds up being $700 million, more than half of the total share repurchases in the back half of the year. i feel good about the pacing. and i think that's consistent with the way we've talked.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse ag -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then my follow-up is around the recordkeeping business. after an extremely strong 2020, this year, we've seen some net outflows. i think it was about $750 million in the second quarter, $1.7 billion this quarter. and i'm wondering if you just could give a little color around the outlook for recordkeeping flows. and then just secondly, a backdrop, just the dynamics of that business, how competitive it is, what you're seeing out there.
rod martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
sure. heather?
heather lavallee -- chief executive officer of wealth solutions
thank you, rod. and thank you, andrew. and if it's ok, i'm going to kind of broaden the question and talk a little bit about flows in general for both full service and recordkeeping to kind of give a little bit of dynamic on both. and i think it's important to recognize that as you look at our commercial momentum in both full service and recordkeeping, it's all been done organically. so if i start with full service, we had $355 million in positive flows for the quarter, $1.5 billion year-to-date. that really reflects the strong sales and retention we've had across all markets but really led by our corporate market. as we pivot and look into the fourth quarter, as mike mentioned in his comments, we have talked about negative flows in full service in the quarter driven by two factors. first is driven by slightly higher plan surrenders as a result of m&a activity as well as higher participant surrenders due to higher account balances from the equity market growth. and as mike mentioned in his comments, we have seen and we talked about this in the second quarter, we have seen the higher equity markets having -- creating a headwind for net flows. but if i kind of finish on the full service side, we're expecting positive net flows for the full year between $500 million and $1 billion. and if we look over the past two years, generating over $3.3 billion in positive flows for full service. now andrew, to get back to your question around recordkeeping flows, as we talked about, in recordkeeping, you tend to have much more lumpiness in terms of larger plan sizes. so while we do anticipate negative flows in the quarter, it's really driven by one plan surrender. and we also, similar to full service, we did see higher participant surrenders due to the higher participant account balances from the equity market growth. but recordkeeping flows can fluctuate in any given year really due to the timing of cases in and out. and as you referenced, we had really strong recordkeeping sales and flows in both 2019 and 2020. and so when i take a step back and i look at our recordkeeping, our fundamentals are really strong.
building on the $39 billion in positive flows we generated in the last two years, we've got a really robust pipeline. however, the sales cycle is longer from rfp through implementation. so our pipeline has grown. we have several unfunded, large plan wins over a variety of different industries that we expect to fund in 2022. so the bottom line is we feel really, really good about our sales team, our pipeline across both full service and recordkeeping and the competitive suite of products. and i guess i'll close, andrew, by answering the second half of your question, which is just what's going on in the market dynamics of recordkeeping. it's a competitive sector. but we continue to be disciplined on where we can best target where our solution set are going to resonate with clients. and we've often talked about then, when we're competing against very fine companies, you win on inches and it's very often our culture that is a driver for us in that segment. so we feel really good about where we're headed in 2022 and beyond.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse ag -- analyst
very helpful, thank you.

the next question is from elyse greenspan of wells fargo. please proceed with your question.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst
hi, thanks. my first question is also on the capital side. i guess, given the $400 million debt pay-down and where your leverage is, i'm assuming leverage actions are behind us. and then the second part of that question, you guys put in place a new buyback authorization with earnings that run through the end of next year. so should we think of that as putting in place your buyback plan for the next 14 months or so?
rod martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
elyse good morning, mike?
mike smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
thank you, rod. and elyse, good morning thanks for the question. so first, on debt activity, i think the call will get us, as we've shown, to a leverage ratio that we're comfortable with. we'll continue to manage that going forward as events unfold and as the book value of the company evolves. but i think to the extent you want to view it as done for now, i think the answer is nothing planned in the near term. but obviously, we'll continue to manage that. we do like having a leverage ratio in the range that it's at, given the potential for some movement in the denominator with aoci. so pretty comfortable there. and then in terms of the authorization, you should think of this as a return to the practice of a couple of years ago from -- that we followed, which was a series of $0.5 billion authorizations. and so while the authorization extends through the balance of 2022, you shouldn't view that as tapping or being our expectation. i think we will continue to monitor our capital position as it unfolds and continue to pursue the discipline and approach that we've used for the last many years now. so if we exhaust that authorization before the end of 2022, then we'll discuss with our board whether another one makes sense. and they've been very willing to grant those, that we have had 13 authorizations since becoming a public company and with this latest one, over $8 billion worth of authorization. so i don't think there's any hesitation there or any limitation to be thinking about.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities, llc -- analyst

your next question is from erik bass of autonomous research. please proceed with your question.
erik bass -- autonomous research llp -- analyst
hi, thank you. can you talk more about the new adjusted margin metric that you're providing for the wealth solutions business and how we should think about the right target level for this going forward? is this going to be the kpi that you manage to? and is the goal to continue expanding margins or to sustain them at this level?
rod martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
heather and mike, do you want to jump in? good morning.
heather lavallee -- chief executive officer of wealth solutions
erik, good morning. thank you for the question. so i'll start. we're certainly going to provide more detail on our wealth solutions operating margin at our upcoming investor day. but we are focused as a simpler business. we think operating margin is a good metric of performance. we're pleased with the operating margin we generated this quarter. and going forward, you're going to hear us talk about a focus on maintaining those strong margins going forward.
mike smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
and erik, maybe just stepping back a little, we think this is a really powerful way to think about the prospects of the company, right? i think we are simpler. we don't have nearly the complications that we certainly used to have and certainly simpler than many that are in our traditional peer group. and so we think that we'll be able to not only help people who follow us closely understand better the underlying trends but also investors that are maybe new to the story. and so -- and talk about our company in a way that they're used to seeing in other industries. and so if we're able to talk about revenue growth, net revenue growth and then ultimately the margin we're going to earn on that and set appropriate expectations around all of those, we think that will make the story much easier to follow. and so we're excited about being in this position and being able to talk about it this way.
erik bass -- autonomous research llp -- analyst
thanks. and i certainly agree, simpler is better. and maybe on that note, ldti accounting is certainly another topic that's coming up. and just hoping maybe you could talk about which of your business lines will be affected by different elements of the accounting change and maybe the potential impacts to aoci and retained earnings. and is it right to think of that since you've exited a lot of your insurance businesses that you are less exposed than most in the industry?
mike smith -- vice chairman & chief financial officer
yes. erik, so we're still doing work and a lot of work underway to fully understand the implications. i think the your readthrough though, kind of based on what one sees publicly about the kinds of products that are affected, as you noted, we don't have most of that anymore. so i think it's fair to say that the kinds of impacts will be probably on the smaller end. but i'm not in a position to give any kind of magnitude or direction. but relative to others in the industry, i think you should expect it to be fairly muted for us. and in terms of the business line, i'm going to -- i'm just going to hold off on. i'm trying to parse that out because it's fairly complicated. and i think you probably need to see the whole story, including the impacts on aoci and some of the related areas there.
erik bass -- autonomous research llp -- analyst
got it, appreciate that. thank you.

the next question is from john barnidge of piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
john barnidge -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
yes. my question on stop loss sales. they've had quite a period of growth and then decline year-over-year. can you maybe talk about distribution there and expectations ahead?
rod martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
john good morning. rob?
robert grubka -- chief executive officer of health solutions
yes. thanks, john. maybe i'll just do the step-back first on sales and the book of business in general. and as we shared, obviously, the overall book is run at over close to 11 percent year-over-year. so the fundamentals within the book, not only sales but also retention across the business, has been good. and we're really pleased with how that's performed. on stop loss, look, that's a segment where we'll write close to 80 percent of our business focused in on 1/1. as we started this year, we certainly started the year well. i think you could imagine within the underwriting shop, that they get appropriately stingy, which -- with what we think we should be writing business at when we started the year where we did. so i wouldn't overread into it. it's -- look, it's a business that's always going to be competitive. as we think about things moving forward though, we feel really good about where we sit and the position we're in. we've done a nice job doing both the top line growth as well as the margin improvement in that business over the last few years. so at this stage, i wouldn't read into that. again, it's competitive. we're in the cycle now for 1/1 business, both renewal and new business, that we're sort of hot and heavy in. but as we see that, we feel like we continue to be well positioned as we move forward, and again excited about the growth that we've had and the margin improvement that's come with it.
john barnidge -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
thank you very much for that. my second question, 4q '21 mandates, really strong. can you talk about sku-level or asset focus maybe a bit more there and then what that gives you in confidence in the pipeline for the quarter beyond that? thank you.
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer of investment management
hey good morning john. thank you, rod. john, it's christine. listen, as far as a little bit more color in terms of the strength of the 4q pipeline, as you can see, very strong october, and our outlook is overall organic growth. we're pushing up to the top end of our to percent to three percent range for assets under management growth this year, so very strong quarter. how to think about it? there were multiple strategies that have funded. but there were more than one north of $1 billion. so what we've seen is a large multi-sector core fixed income mandate, a couple of credit mandates. and when you think about those, those do tend to be lower, more aggressive basis points because they're public markets. so when you think about the quarter, when you see that measure, you will see it lower. note that this quarter though, actually our basis points under management was higher. so again, it all goes to a mix of business and it's going to vary quarter-to-quarter. and also something to think about, particularly with our insurance clients, is we typically will fund in liquid markets and then over time, move those into higher-margin, more differentiated product strategies. so overall, that's what i see. fundamentals of the business, very strong, given our investment performance. how does the pipeline look today? still very strong, again driven by both investment performance and our differentiated product alignment. we have a number of strategies represented as well as over 40 different clients that are in our current unfunded wins. so we see good, strong momentum as we move into the early part of next year.

[operator instructions] our next question is from humphrey lee of dowling & partners. please proceed with your question.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners securities, llc -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my question. my first question is related to the stop loss and voluntary claims in the quarter, which continue to be favorable. can you just talk about your claims experience throughout the quarter and how did they trend? and then kind of given some of the deferral of care, do you anticipate any kind of pricing impact as you're going through your renewal cycle?
rod martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
humphrey, thank you. rob? good morning.
robert grubka -- chief executive officer of health solutions
good morning humphrey. well, look, this is an environment we're trying to talk a lot about trends month-to-month or within a quarter. it feels a little bit dangerous. but let me take a shot at just again sort of the step-back. as i alluded to on the question prior, stop loss business, we've been doing a lot of work to just strike the right balance between growth and margin pricing discipline. that certainly played out this year. is there some knock-on impact from delayed care and those sorts of things? like it's impossible to say there's none. is it dramatic? the one thing i would say for us that keeps it away from being dramatic is just where we play. so as a reminder, in the larger end of the market, think about deductibles at an individual level of in that $200,000 to $300,000 range to just put some numbers to that. and so that tends to insulate us as we think about it. and certainly, we've had some impact from covid within the book. but at this point, it's been on the edges and not driving the numbers materially.
so we'll see how that plays out into the future. we feel good about just understanding our book and where claims trends are going and how we're thinking about renewal strategy as we go into this cycle for 1/1. so i would just sort of a step-back on stop loss, again where we play, i think, helps us stay insulated a bit from noise. and we'll continue to monitor it closely. as we think about voluntary, and obviously mike hit the life story from a covid perspective, but on the voluntary side, this one, if you go back to the start of the pandemic, we talked about in the accident product, having just seeing a bit more dramatic dip in what was going on from a loss ratio perspective there and strong results. that's moderated and sort of come back to more normal-ish range.
when you think about critical illness and hospital indemnity, obviously, those are two areas that i just feel like through the pandemic, it maybe bounced around a little bit more than we would have expected. but net-net, the book of business is running well. we think about it in totality. and so it's a little bit hard to draw a conclusion on, ""okay, what did third quarter do? and now what do we think about the future?"" i think as we talk about things at investor day, we still feel good -- and we'll talk more deeply about it. but we still feel good about the underlying trends and the fundamentals within the business and what we're seeing from a claim trend perspective. but these -- again, these days have had things move around a little bit differently than we would might have otherwise anticipated. but net-net, strong top line growth in this business. the margin story, loss ratios are running right in the middle of our guided range. but it's been a little bit hard to crystal ball the future perfectly for all of us.
humphrey lee -- dowling & partners securities, llc -- analyst
appreciate the color. my second question is related to investment management. i think in your prepared remarks, you talked about taking some actions on the retail side to improve the overall flows picture. can you provide some examples on some of the actions that you've taken? and how should we think about that retail flows will trend in the coming quarters?
rod martin -- chairman & chief executive officer
christine?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer of investment management
certainly, humphrey. so as far as retail flows go, some of -- what are some of the actions that we've taken? we've been focused on really strengthening our active equity platform. and so when you think about some of the things that we've done, we acquired a machine learning equity team, so think ai-driven investment results. and in fact, we have sizable unfunded win that we expect with that strategy to fund in the first quarter. so that's certainly getting momentum. and we've recently announced some additions to our team as well as the co-cio structure. so think about vinnie, who is overseeing quant and the ai team, combined with mike pytosh, who runs fundamental.
so important because this is going to continue to leverage multiple views in its sight, fundamental plus machine learning, to really strengthen our performance on behalf of our clients. so that is definitely a key area of focus. and then just let me get back to kind of what do we see about flows going forward and what's driving flows? we have very strong investment performance, notably in fixed income. so we're continuing to see client demand in our strategic income opportunities fund, so think about a fund that's going to appeal to people with inflationary concerns, which is becoming a broader part of the market conversation. as well as something really excited in terms of retail flows is we have a retail version of our secondaries' pomona business. it's called the pomona investment fund. and that is delivering extremely strong performance. it's existed for seven years. so it's got a long track record, top-performing fund in its category. and we're seeing real momentum. that fund is crossing the $0.5 billion mark, which you know is pretty important in terms of getting bigger allocations into the fund. and i would say a strategic focus for us on retail, continue to leverage our traditional asset classes but also more and more focused on delivering private and alternative strategies to high-net-worth individuals through our retail distribution force.

good morning, and welcome to the voya financial fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference. [operator instructions] please note that this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to michael katz, evp finance, strategy, and investor relations. thank you.
please go ahead.
michael katz -- executive vice president of finance, strategy, and investor relations
thank you, and good morning. welcome to voya financial's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings conference call. we appreciate all of you who have joined us for this call. as a reminder, material for today's call are available on our website at investors.voya.com or via the webcast.
turning to slide two. some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law. i refer you to this slide for more information. we're referring today to certain non-gaap financial measures.
gaap reconciliations are available in our press release and financial supplement found on our website, investors.voya.com. joining me on the call are rod martin, our chairman and chief executive officer, as well as mike smith, our vice chairman and cfo. after their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. for that q&a session, we have also invited our vice chairman and chief growth officer, charlie nelson, as well as the heads of our businesses, specifically, heather lavallee, wealth solutions; christine hurtsellers, investment management; and rob grubka, health solutions.
with that, let's turn to slide three as i would like to turn the call over to rod. 
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning. let's begin on slide four with some key themes. in 2021, we delivered strong results, including organic growth across our businesses, margin expansion and significant excess capital generation. for the full year, we achieved record adjusted operating earnings of $1.3 billion.
we achieved this record not long since we divested our life and annuities businesses. this is a clear demonstration of how our health, wealth, and investment solutions focus is driving further profitable growth for voya. for the fourth quarter, adjusted operating earnings were $1.90 per diluted share. underlining our performance was both strong alternative investment income, as well as continued organic growth in our businesses.
notably, all of our businesses exceeded or achieved the high end of our organic growth targets for 2021. for wealth solutions, full year 2021 full-service recurring deposits reached $12.1 billion, up 9% compared with the prior year period. and we generated positive full-service net flows of $576 million in 2021. in investment management, we generated $7.8 billion of net inflows during 2021, representing more than 4% organic growth.
and in the fourth quarter, we achieved record net inflows of $9 billion, which includes significant inflows from several large mandates. in health solutions, in-force premiums grew 10% compared with the prior year period, which reflects growth across all product lines. beyond the organic growth that we delivered; we continue to demonstrate the power of voya's high free cash flow businesses. this drives a free cash flow yield, which is one of the highest in the industry.
in 2021, we generated $1 billion of excess capital organically. this enabled us to build on our capital return track record, deploying a record $1.7 billion of excess capital this year. and with the continued benefit of our high free cash flow businesses, we concluded the year with approximately $1.5 billion of excess capital. since our ipo, we've returned approximately $8 billion to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends.
as we move forward, we will continue to be disciplined and balanced with our use of capital. we've delivered another year of strong organic growth, record excess capital generation and deployment and significant eps growth. these themes will remain our focus as we advance our strategy and the three-year growth plan that we shared with you at investor day. as i shared in november, our strategy puts the needs of employers, employees and intermediaries at the center of all that we do.
we help employers optimize their benefit spend. we enable employees to make the right financial decisions. and we provide investment capabilities to meet the long-term needs of institutions and retirement plan participants. by bringing our innovative thinking, resources and tools to customers, we can help them achieve better outcomes.
in short, our strategy and focus will help drive our growth plans and create further value for all of our stakeholders. turning to slide five. our focus on values and culture continue to differentiate voya. most recently, we were honored to earn the following recognitions, the bloomberg gender-equality index for the seventh consecutive year.
the dow jones sustainable index for the sixth consecutive year and as one of only eight companies included in the north american diversified financial services category. a 2021 best place to work in money management by pensions & investments for the seventh consecutive year. and once again, earning recognition on the human rights campaign's 2022 corporate equality index with a perfect score for the 17th consecutive year. the actions of our people and our company reflect the strength of our culture and how that carries through in all that we do.
with that, let me ask mike to provide more details on our performance and results.
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
thank you, rod. let me begin by saying i am proud of all that our team has accomplished in 2021. we delivered a record year of adjusted operating earnings and generated a significant amount of excess capital. we shared our outlook for voya at our 2021 investor day and the exciting opportunities we have to accelerate growth for our business.
we are confident as we look forward to continued success in 2022. turning to slide seven. adjusted operating earnings were $1.90 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021, which included: first, $0.55 of net alternative and prepayment investment income above long-term expectations; second, $0.22 of covid-related impacts; and third, $0.05 of other notable items, primarily net performance fees below expectations. fourth quarter results contributed to a record 2021 adjusted operating earnings of $8.37 per share.
on an ex-notables basis, we delivered adjusted operating earnings of $6.04 per share, broadly in line with our full year guidance given at investor day. full year results reflect strong alternative investment income performance and strong underlying core results across all businesses. fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders of $403 million led to full year net income of $2.1 billion. with that, let's turn to our segment results beginning on slide eight.
wealth solutions delivered $241 million of adjusted operating earnings in the fourth quarter contributing to record full year earnings of $1.1 billion. fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings included alternative income that was $82 million above our long-term expectations. full year adjusted operating earnings, excluding notable items, grew 22% year over year, driven by 13% net revenue growth and operating margins of 35.5%. full year net revenues reflect higher fee income from business growth, favorable equity markets and net investment spread experience.
full year administrative expenses were higher year over year, in line with our expectations. looking ahead, we expect first quarter administrative expenses to be consistent with fourth quarter levels despite seasonality. recurring deposits and flows. 2021 full service recurring deposits showed continued strong momentum, exceeding $12 billion in total, which is 9% growth year over year and above our targeted 6% to 8% range.
the growth was driven by higher employer and employee contributions primarily in corporate markets. for full year 2022, we expect to return to 10% to 12% growth in recurring deposits. for the full year, wealth solutions generated full-service net inflows of $576 million, while record-keeping and stable value saw net outflows of $6.7 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. 2021 net flows faced headwinds from higher dollar amounts of participant surrenders due to higher equity market levels.
also, in the fourth quarter, stable value sales slowed which mirrored industry outflows from capital preservation options. we are pleased with the volume of rfp activity in full-service, recordkeeping and stable value. our pipeline of plans and implementation is leading to an expectation of $300 million to $600 million of positive full-service net flows in the first quarter of 2022. we are encouraged by the market interest in our integrated health and wealth benefit solutions designed to optimize financial outcomes for our participants.
our new plan activity and our differentiated value proposition give us confidence in our ability to grow revenues while maintaining operating margins. on slide nine. investment management delivered $59 million of adjusted operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2021. this contributed to full year adjusted operating earnings of $239 million, exceeding our 2020 results of $197 million due to strong investment capital results.
fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings included $12 million of investment capital returns above expectations, offset by lower-than-expected performance fees on our mortgage derivative strategy. full year net revenues, excluding notables, grew 11% year over year. primarily reflecting fees generated on higher retail aum and strong fourth quarter fees generated from several private equity fund closings. these closings boosted the share of revenues from our private and alternative platform to roughly 50% in the quarter.
higher 2021 administrative expenses year over year were mostly driven by higher variable compensation. our adjusted operating margin, excluding notables, was 25.7% for the year. as we shared at investor day, we expect to continue to grow our margin by 1% a year with a target of at least 27% by the end of 2022. turning to flows.
we generated a record $9 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter. this contributed to full year net flows of $7.8 billion, which represented 4.2% organic growth in the year and exceeded the high end of our 1% to 3% growth expectation. we achieved strong net flows across our institutional u.s. and insurance channels with continued demand for investment-grade credit, private credit and commercial mortgages.
we also saw strong private closing and issued two additional clos in the fourth quarter. we are seeing a strong start to 2022, supported by a robust unfunded pipeline that gives us confidence in our 2022 organic growth target of 2% to 4%. our longer-term fixed income performance remains strong. 79% of our fixed income funds outperformed the benchmark on a three-year basis, while 92% and 98% did so on a five and 10-year basis.
looking ahead, we are excited by the continued strength across our diversified investment strategies and distribution channels, benefiting from excellent fixed income platform investment performance. we have a strong unfunded institutional pipeline to start 2022 with notable contributions from private and alternative strategies. turning to slide 10. health solutions delivered $33 million of adjusted operating earnings in the fourth quarter.
full year adjusted operating earnings were $204 million, in line with our 2020 results. the fourth quarter earnings results included $9 million of alternative income above expectations and $34 million of covid-related impacts. full year 2021 covid-related impacts were $112 million, which drove total aggregate loss ratios toward the high end of our 70% to 73% target range. age mix has driven our recent experience above the high end of our covid sensitivity range such that we now expect a $2 million to $3 million impact per 10,000 u.s.
deaths. full year adjusted operating earnings, excluding notable items, grew 14% year over year, driven by 13% net revenue growth and stable operating margins. higher full year net revenue, excluding notables, primarily reflects growth in stop loss and voluntary, as well as the contribution from our recent benefit strategies acquisition. full year annualized in-force premiums grew 10% year over year, at the high end of our target range.
as we maintain pricing discipline and protect margin in 2022, we expect the annualized in-force premium growth toward the lower end of 7% to 10%. higher 2021 administrative expenses year over year were mostly driven by volume-related costs, timing and certain nonrecurring expenses. looking to first quarter, we expect expenses to be consistent with fourth quarter levels despite seasonality. while expenses were higher in 2021, our adjusted operating margin, excluding notables, remained stable at 33% on a trailing 12-month basis at the high end of our investor day target of 27% to 33%.
going forward, we expect to drive strong net revenue growth while maintaining operating margins. our health and wealth strategy continues to resonate with the market, and we remain confident in the strength of our distribution channels, customer solutions and differentiated customer experience. turning to slide 11. our strong capital generation helped to support our record capital deployment in 2021 of $1.7 billion.
this included $80 million of common stock dividends and $1.1 billion of share repurchases in the year, of which, $310 million was repurchased in the quarter. we also extinguished approximately $0.5 billion of debt in the year, helping to reduce our financial leverage ratio to below our 30% threshold. our full year organic capital generation of approximately $1 billion demonstrates the high free cash flow generation of our businesses. this capital generation contributed to our $1.5 billion of excess capital at year-end 2021 despite record deployment.
our 90% to 100% free cash flow conversion also leads to a high free cash flow yield, which currently stands at 13.2%, one of the highest in the industry. going forward, capital deployment will continue to be a strong contributor to our 12% to 17% annual eps growth target as we shared at investor day. in summary, we are incredibly pleased with our year of record earnings, strong performance from the underlying businesses and how the collection of our health, wealth, and investment management businesses continue to execute on our strategy. we remain confident in the plan we laid out at investor day last year, and we will continue to be balanced and disciplined as we look to deploy capital in the best interest of shareholders.
with that, i will turn the call back to the operator so that we can take your questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question is coming from nigel dally of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
nigel dally -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. i wanted to start on capital. a number of questions.
first, cash flow generation looked very robust this quarter, and i think specific to this quarter behind that. second, your excess capital level looks -- continues to be very strong. what are your plans for putting that work? it seems like your capital management recently has been funded through free cash flow, leaving that excess capital buffer unchanged? and then third, any thoughts on perhaps altering the mix of capital management doing buybacks and dividends? thanks.
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
nigel, good morning. i'll let mike begin.
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
thanks, nigel. good to talk to you this morning and appreciate the questions. so first, in terms of cash flow generation in the quarter, i'd point to several things. alternative performance was robust.
i think that certainly contributed to the absolute level of cash flow generation. there were also some additional kind of like trailing cash flow contributions from the two most recent transactions, the sale of the financial planning channel with cetera, as well as the life transaction with resolution, both of those contributed relatively small, but still in the scheme of things, meaningful contributions there. and there was a little bit of an effect of our reducing the rbc level from 400 to 375. that was -- while it was done to offset the impact of the new c1 factors, it was -- the going down in 25% increments led us to have a small benefit there.
so that all added up to a very robust generation of free cash flow that completely offset the repurchases, pleased with that. and point to as well, just overall for the year, while any given quarter, it's going to potentially fluctuate the year -- was pretty much right at the high end of our range in terms of overall organic capital generation and cash flow conversion. so very pleased, we're able to do that. in terms of plans in 2022, i think we laid it out at investor day that we expect capital management to continue to be a very important part of our eps growth.
we shared that we thought the leg of the stool -- that leg of the stool, i should say, was 7% to 9% of our growth with the balance coming from revenue growth and margin expansion at 4% to 6% and 1% to 2%, respectively, adding up to the 12% to 17% eps growth that we expected. so we'll be operating within that framework over the course of 2022. we'll continue to take the same sort of basic philosophy of being measured approach, consistent buyers looking to lean in where opportunities arise and lean back, we think the stock is not where we want to be purchasing and trading high. and then, just last on capital mix or capital deployment mix and the question of dividends.
that's a question we asked investors regularly and get lots of feedback, and we'll continue to ask that question. and i think the way we think of it is when you look at the cash flow yield on our stock at over 13% right now, while i think we have a lot of confidence in our ability to generate ongoing cash and appreciate the point that increasing our dividend from where it is now, which is slightly over 1% yield would be a great way to signal that. we look at that share price, and we just -- it's hard to pass up the opportunity from a shareholder perspective to deploy capital that way. but again, open -- we're not opposed in any way to increasing the dividend philosophically.
it's just a relative value question, and we think share repurchases are pretty clearly a really good use of capital for us right now.
nigel dally -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great. thanks, mike.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from suneet kamath of jefferies. please go ahead.
suneet kamath -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i wanted to start on the financial leverage ratio. you guys include aoci in your calculation, and that's -- i'm not sure that most other companies do that.
and with ldti coming, there's clearly a potential for aoci to kind of swing around. so just wondering if that's a voya decision to include it? or is that something that the rating agencies kind of have you looking at? and is there any sort of potential change in the way you're calculating this based on some impacts from ldti? thanks.
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
thank you, suneet. yep. and at least on my end, suneet, you broke up, but i think i heard -- i got the gist. so let's start with just the leverage ratio and how we manage it.
we have a target of 30%. we try to aim for something a little bit below that to allow for some volatility in aoci, and that's part of the process that we go through. so we chose this particular formulation because it's what one of the rating agencies focuses on. each agency has its own particular approach to leverage ratios.
they also -- they look at a lot of other things. i think the leverage ratio gets a lot of airtimes and a lot of attention. but also looking at cash coverage, other forms of leverage and so on. so it's just a -- it's a shorthand way for us to show where we are in terms of our debt equity structure.
ldti, absolutely will have an impact here. and so, we're starting to think about what that might look like and will we make changes. and we're going to have to take our lead to some extent from the agencies as well because i think it's important that we remain, if not exactly identical, at least in sync with how they're thinking about leverage. so a lot to come over the course of the next the next several quarters.
i don't think in the end, though, it's going to change the level of debt that we carry. we may measure it differently, we may have a different set of metrics around it, but i don't think we're going to have to do any dramatic capital action. as i mentioned in the prior quarter, at this point, we don't see ldti having a terribly meaningful impact to our book of business, but it's still early days. we're still doing a lot of work and not in a position to share that -- those numbers today.
suneet kamath -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. got it. and then, just switching gears to retirement. can you talk about any leverage to rising short-term rates? i seem to recall at some point in the past when rates were rising, you had a floating rate portfolio that started to kick off some additional investment income.
just wondering where we stand with that and if you have any sensitivities that you could provide?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike, you want to start, and perhaps i will follow?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
yeah. i'll go with that. sure. so suneet, your memory is correct, there was a floating rate pool, but that was primarily part of the financial planning channel.
so most of that, at least as it relates to wealth is gone. we do have some floating rate exposure. it's in the neighborhood of $2 billion in gross assets. so there will be some benefit as rates -- as it relates to short-end -- rates go up.
broadly speaking, our interest rate guidance remains where we've been, which is 100 basis point increase for a year would generate $20 million to $30 million of additional income, and a decrease would be a $10 million to $20 million drop -- 100 basis point decrease will be $10 million to $20 million drop. as rates go up, you should think of that lower range, the decline range, that will start to creep up, and we'll update that as events unfold, but we're probably closer to the high end than the low end given where rates have gone over the last month or two. and that's for the whole business, by the way, but mainly retirement, but that is for the all of voya.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from mike zaremski of wolfe research. please go ahead.
mike zaremski -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, great. good morning. maybe a follow-up on mike, your comments on the uses of capital and the free cash flow yield you cited. you cited the 13%, which i thought was a trailing figure when we looked at the deck and which was kind of propped up by better-than-expected alternative returns.
but just trying to make sure -- and if i look at consensus on a forward basis, i think the expectation for things to normalize. so just curious, are you guys -- if there's a read-through saying you think on a forward basis, your free cash flow could remain around 13%?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
look, i think our -- yeah. so mike, thanks for the question. so yeah, the 13% is, i think, the trailing. but going forward, i still think we're very attractive looking on a free cash flow yield basis.
so that will continue to be our -- one of the measures we look at as we're considering the relative mix of capital use. but as i said, that's something we're open to talking with investors about and gathering opinions and we could potentially adjust it in the future. there's not a plan at this point, but we're open and nimble and willing to consider the different approaches.
mike zaremski -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. understood. and my follow-up would just be any update on the ceo search in terms of timing?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's rod. as we've communicated previously, my employment agreement is through the end of the year. that is when i do intend to retire. we are working through this in a very thoughtful and purposeful way.
and i've communicated previously that it is our intention to have no surprises for the investor community as we do this, but we we've got lots of runway through the course of this year before that's announced, and we will keep you all posted.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from tom gallagher of evercore. please go ahead.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning. i think in some of the past calls, you all have been talking more about m&a as a possibility balancing that against buybacks for use of capital. just given where your stock is trading, other opportunities that might be in the market. can you talk about your updated thoughts on m&a and whether or not that can include somewhat larger-sized deals because i think the deals you've announced so far have been pretty small?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike, would you like to begin, and i'll follow?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
sure. thank you, tom, for the question. so in short, i'd say nothing has really changed in our -- from what we said back in november in terms of our view on m&a. so we think there are potential opportunities that would enable us to accelerate growth, particularly in the benefits space, as well as we talked about privates and potentially alternatives in the investment management space, things that would enable us to be closer to customers, have better data capabilities.
we're also, i think, open to scale opportunities where those might make sense. so what we did say too was that for smaller deals, the time frame for accretion might be stretched out a bit from our 24-month window, and that's accretive relative to share buyback. so at larger deals, we've not, nor will we set a limit in terms of what we're thinking other than kind of the practical limits that you all can imagine. and we're open to whatever would make the most sense for shareholders that -- of the opportunities set that's in front of us.
so i think the stance here is one of how can we continue to drive revenue growth while preserving or increasing margins? and those are the kind of deals that we're going to be looking for.
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
tom, the only piece i'd add to what mike said is, we're laser-focused on the 12% to 17% eps growth and all of that we presented at investor day is organic. and those levers that mike talked about earlier on the 4% to 6% contribution from revenue or the 1% to 2% for margin expansion or the 7% to 9% from capital management, those are levers that have always been at our disposal. we'll continue to be, and we are going to continue to be absolutely focused on enabling that outcome.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
got you. and then, just my follow-up is the -- just a question on the elevated pension expense. what -- i think there was some derisking that caused that. any actual pension contributions that we should be thinking about? or is there no funding actually for this? because i believe, it was mentioned, it was noncash.
and if it is noncash and we're going to have higher pension expenses, should we assume your free cash flow conversion ratio actually gets a little better considering that that's going to hit gaap earnings, but not cash flow?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
tom, thank you. so first, correct that it will not hit cash flow. and so, all else equal, at the margins the gaap earnings will be a little bit lower than they might have been, and cash flow is unaffected. so yeah, the math would push you up a bit.
i don't know that that's going to be all that discernible given the magnitude of the numbers. but what's happening more broadly here is every year, we remark, if you will, the pension plan. that's just an accounting process that we go through where we evaluate the liability, we apply a current rate to it is something every company does. and then, you make you adjust in one-timer adjustment of the liability to reflect current conditions.
and then, those affect your estimates of pension income, which is the -- on a gaap basis, the earnings you get from the funds underlying the pension plan and the expense. and so, what has happened over the last few months is our pension committee, which is independent of management, by the way, made the decision to shift more of our assets into fixed income in recognition of the fact that we're in a very favorable funding spot. so we're more fully immunized. there'll be less volatility in the underlying pension assets, which is great given that we're very well-funded now.
and so, don't expect to see the kind of volatility that we might have seen in the past. but that also comes at the cost of having lower return expectations. and so, that's -- the pension income will be lower this year. the pension expense is basically unchanged.
it hasn't changed very much. i think it's a tiny increase. and so, the net of those is that it's a smaller benefit because the income actually on a gaap basis exceeds the expense. as it relates to contributions, i don't think we've got the numbers that we'd be in a position to share.
but any contributions this year, i would expect to be relatively small and not going to have any meaningful impact to our ability to do repurchases, pay dividends or otherwise.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from erik bass of autonomous research. please go ahead.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
hi. thank you. can you provide some more color on the expenses in the fourth in 4q, which i believe included some accelerated investments? and then given the upward pressure that we are seeing on wages, how are you thinking about the g&a expense outlook across your businesses in 2022?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike, would you like to begin?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
sure. i'll take a start and then others can join in. so fourth quarter was a couple of things. there was timing that we had signaled on spend like advertising, some it spend around adding some capabilities just happened to be a little bit higher in the fourth quarter.
also, a couple of other -- not expected to recur, accounting adjustments that were relatively small, but ended up as well. so overall, that drove us to the level of expenses where we're able to say that first quarter, which is normally a seasonally higher quarter next -- this year will be about the same as fourth quarter. but the investments are -- i think -- we're pleased to have had the chance to accelerate some of those capabilities. and we'll go forward from there.
it will help with the revenue growth. overall, the wage conditions, we've made our best estimate that in terms of what we think that's going to -- the effect that's going to have in '22, that was baked into our targets that we shared at november. i don't think our view has changed meaningfully since then, but it's obviously a pretty rapidly evolving situation. and so, we want to be -- we'll be very mindful of where we are relative to competitors for our most important asset, which is our talent.
we're very focused on that. we have regular conversations about it at the most senior level. so very focused on that. but i think it's within our footprint, at least our ability to manage going forward.
i'd also point out, and i think other calls -- other companies have pointed us out too, wage increases are broadly speaking, a good thing for the businesses that we're in, particularly in the wealth business in terms of contributions, as well as in the group life business, particularly in terms of benefit amounts and premiums that get paid. so those things will be generally favorable for us. so the balance of interest, i think, is that some degree of wage inflation is probably a good thing for us. but throughout we'll be focused on managing and delivering the margins that we've talked about and continuing to grow revenue.
and those, i think, are going to be our primary guidepost as we go forward.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
thank you. and then, in the health business, it looks like the voluntary loss ratio quarter and where it's been running. can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of claims experience and if this is starting to normalize?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
rob?
rob grubka -- chief executive officer, health solutions
yeah. thank you. appreciate that, erik. so i think, look, the step back on quarter-to-quarter, there's always a bit of noise depending on the products, it ebbs and flows a little bit with seasonality.
voluntary, you get a little that in fourth quarter with just enrollment activity and sort of a reminder of, oh, i've got these benefits. and so, you see a little bit of that noise. but i would say that was pretty modest. and really, as you do the step back for the year -- we've obviously had really strong growth in the supplemental health voluntary product line, 22% growth year over year.
and then, in line with that, if you look at the underwriting margin for the year, it's growing at 23%. so i think we're really in line and feeling good about what we're seeing there. the underlying dynamics, there's no sort of issue that we're concerned about as we move forward. that business has been running well for us.
time will tell, obviously, covid and the dynamics that you're alluding to of things going to change, behavior is going to change. we'll see those things, and we'll react to those things. but as we look at the overall health of the business, i'd say, we're doing exceedingly well.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from ryan krueger of kbw. please go ahead.
ryan krueger -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
hi. good morning. first question is just can you just remind us what your current expectation is for first quarter expense seasonality?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
ryan, the place to lay that would be somewhere around $25 million to $30 million, just like it was last year, i think, is a good place to start.
ryan krueger -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
thanks. and then, now that the mandates have funded, can you give an updated view of the investment management pipeline headed into 2022?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
happily. christine?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
yeah. sure thing, ryan. so yeah, we had a very successful quarter, as you saw, our largest net inflows that we've had. and just thinking about the quarter in particular, what we think of as larger mandates call that north of $1 billion.
we had more than one fund, so that certainly contributed. but underneath a lot of diversity. so our private markets continue to advance, client demand remains strong. so when you look out, and we're looking at the pipeline and unfunded wins into '22, we see a lot of diversity there, a lot of strength.
and we're confident we're going to get into our 2% to 4% organic growth range, our target that we put forward on investor day. so really excited about it. again, we've got great products, the demand for differentiated asset classes plus leveraging are strong, fixed income investment performance continues. so again, feeling good about the year.
ryan krueger -- keefe, bruyette and woods -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from alex scott of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
alex scott -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. first question i had was on health solutions. you guys gave a lot of guidance there. so we have a good amount to work off of.
but i just wanted to see if you could comment on the stop loss business and just how you view your competitive positioning there? that's sort of a business that goes through cycles. and i was just wondering how you view that market and sort of price adequacy and so forth moving into 2022?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
rob?
rob grubka -- chief executive officer, health solutions
yeah. great. thanks, alex. so stop loss, as you alluded to, it goes through cycles.
as you do the look back for what we've experienced in our book over the last couple of years and i would say we were doing very well in this version of the cycle with loss ratios at the lower end of our guide around that 77% to 80%, we're in the 77% neighborhood. and so, that's been great. and it took a lot of work to get there a couple of years prior. we were working hard to improve underwriting margin in that business.
i think as you've seen us operate over the last couple of years, the last few years, it's been about striking that right balance of growth and disciplined underwriting. i think that is the story that we'll continue as we move forward. it's a business where if you lose a handle on underwriting margin, you obviously can't grow fast enough to recover from that impact that it has on your book of business. and so, we'll do what we continue to do is focus on the right balance there.
as mike alluded to, in our growth guidance, the 7% to 10% range, we expect them to be at the lower end of that. a piece of that will be what we experienced in the renewal and new business cycle for one-to-one. so on the new business side of things, we came in about where we expected, if not right on top of it. renewal season was a little bit more challenging.
but again, as i alluded to, our book of business has been running very well. so we have plenty of competition on trying to retain good running cases, but importantly, knowing when not to chase the market and that's just going to happen. that's the ebb and flow of that business. so we'll be in a position to talk a lot more about what we saw, what we experienced once we talk about 1q.
but at this point, we're going to strike the balance, as i alluded to and that we've done over the last few years.
alex scott -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that was helpful. and then, my follow-up question is just on ldti. i know you're not ready to give impact sensitivities and so forth.
but i was wondering if maybe you could just note how much of the existing reserve balance is transitioning to this new accounting? so sort of how much of your existing reserves or fas 60 today that we should think about potentially having an impact here?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
alex, i don't know the number off the top of my head, but that's something we could maybe be prepared for in first quarter as we get -- it's a good question. i think just to the point i made earlier though, it's going to be relatively small, but it's not zero. there is some legacy -- there are some legacy contracts still around that are here, but it's not going to be a meaningful amount for us in my view. but we'll come back to you on that as we give a little more color in the coming quarters.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from andrew kligerman of credit suisse. please go ahead.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey. good morning. staying on the health solutions area, again, thoughts around the group life and disability and the ability to get rate and perhaps how much influence that might have on the 7% to 10% growth that you're looking at?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
rob?
rob grubka -- chief executive officer, health solutions
yeah, sure. thanks, andrew. it's interesting. you tend to think about life and disability is this old stodgy part of the market, and you kind of got to do it.
i just a couple of things, and i'll get to your question. the ability to deliver an integrated experience, the impact, especially post covid and during covid here, as we said, of lead management and the dynamics around the complexity of that element of a life disability package and what that means to decision-making and just overall satisfaction with an employer and their provider of coverage. so i would say there's always been just stinginess around rate in that market and what are you going to be willing to pay. but i would say the decision-making criteria has gotten a bit different.
how that plays out as we think about covid mortality and the impact and pressure that can have on pricing, how the market's going to calibrate to that i think is a story to be written. obviously, there's an impact as the underwriters are looking at and making decisions about what they think go-forward experiences in our business. just as a reminder, most of the stuff that we do is going to be experience rated for the most part. and so, we're going to see what's going on and make assessments and make good decisions as we move forward.
and we'll see what the market will bear. what i would just say is that element of lead management and how that comes together is an incredibly important part of the decision-making that's i think, only gotten heightened of light. and then, what we started to see more that we talked a little bit about investor day is just what's come in the market is not just life and disability, a lot of times and over 30% of the time, closer to 40%, we're seeing business come to market now that's also got supplemental health as part of the conversation and the shopping that they're doing. and so, i think the price element starts to maybe get diluted a little bit.
and hopefully, that means there's upward movement. as we talked about, mike just said a second ago, wage inflation, wage growth, those are things that also help the business overall. so it's a little bit more complicated than it used to be, but let me just sort of take a pause there and see if you want me to go deeper.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
yeah. i think you said the book is yet to be written, but is there any movement at all in price?
rob grubka -- chief executive officer, health solutions
well, again, i think it's hard to say at this point in time. and part of why i say that is like, look, we're getting into national account season as we speak. have we seen meaningful change in price? i would say the answer to that is no. but it's something that, obviously, we continue to assess and see where the market settles in.
and then, you throw in the factor, as i was alluding to at the end there, i think there's other bigger elements that are going to drive decision-making, which in theory will allow for some price drift up. but again, i don't want to declare it just yet. i think there's a lot more complications around those decisions than there used to be.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
cool. that was helpful. and then, my second question would be for mike smith around the earlier comment about capital, and i'm just kind of thinking to myself about share repurchases. and mike, you talked about capital return to shareholders being 7% to 9% of the 12% to 17%.
the other backdrop i'm thinking about is organic generation of close to $1 billion again this year, excess capital of $1.5 billion. so i'm looking at $2.5 billion of potential redeployable capital. last year, you bought back over $1 billion of stock. that would create more than -- probably more than 10% eps upside as i eyeball the number.
so the question is, would you be willing to go for a year of over $1 billion in buybacks or maybe well over $1 billion in repurchases if there's that opportunity to lean in?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
andrew, thanks for the question. i think part of the reason that we're not giving specific numbers at this point is because we have, i think, an enormous amount of flexibility. and so, i think we're open to whatever opportunities present themselves that makes the most sense for shareholders at the time we're giving them. so i'm not going to maybe comment specifically on any given number other than that's going to be our focus.
it has been our focus and will continue to be our focus, shareholder value.
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
and then rod, just to modestly reinforce that. you certainly at investor day and on this call, we continue to point very clearly to the 12% to 17% eps growth rate. and as you well point out, that is a lever that we can use, that we have used and we will continue to be very open to using prospectively. so i think as you think about voya, after we completed the derisking a far simpler company, a very attractive eps growth rate, we will continue to lever and exercise those tools fully to -- for shareholder outcome.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our next question is coming from john barnidge of piper sandler. please go ahead.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you very much. my question, in the investor day slides, you talk about privates and alternatives, 3% to 4% versus organic from other markets. so you're clearly expecting more growth out of privates and alternatives. now, you're breaking out disclosure around that around alts and privates and fixed income.
so thank you. you currently sit at 30%. where do you aspirationally assume it grows to for that 2024 target of 5% to 7% per year? thank you.
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
christine?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
well, john, how we think about it is, certainly, we have forecasts based on it is driving significant growth within investment management. we do have targets. are we specifically saying we're going to be x percent of aum at a certain point in time? no. and so, how we think about it though, and what we see is it is a higher-margin product.
as you said, it's about a third of our assets today. we had a strong quarter in private in 4q. so again, it's going to contribute to our margin expansion. and one of the things that i just love about asset management here at voya, sort of our untold story is we took out such a good diverse product line, whether it's private asset classes, as you see, as well as public asset classes.
so we're focused on alpha. we're focused on investing strategically in our private capabilities with fund launches that we have in the pipeline already this year, such as the commercial real estate impact. so think of the beauty of green or esg coming to private markets with that. so again, we're investing in it.
it's growing, but we have a broad book of business. and so, we're really focused on delivering alpha for clients because they have complex needs that they're facing every day in this world in which we live, as well as really focusing on driving our operating margin expansion. and so, again, when you see that, it's going to be based on fundamental growth, client demand as we go on our journey to continue to deliver for shareholders as well.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from elyse greenspan of wells fargo. please go ahead.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. my question is just -- i was hoping to get some color if you guys have any line of sight into the reduced full-service fee pressure that you guys have guided to?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
heather, would you like to begin?
heather lavallee -- chief executive officer, wealth solutions
sure. thank you. and good morning, elyse. so a couple of things that i would point to around the fee pressure.
and as was noted in the presentation. in the quarter, we did see a little bit of movement in the full service fees that were driven by onetime accounting items that we don't expect to repeat going forward. now, our guidance on fee pressure has remained unchanged since investor day. we talked about at investor day that we expect our fee pressure to ease down from one basis point per quarter down to a half a basis point.
and really, it's driven by three main fundamentals. no. 1 is, we are focused on strong pricing discipline in our existing book of business. second is the focus on writing profitable new business.
and then, deepening our client relationships, and we've got a lot of paths to be able to diversify revenue through growth of managed accounts and some of the enhancements we've made to our own target date funds. and at the end of the day, we are very focused on driving the revenue growth of 2% to 4%, while maintaining the operating margins that we've done so since our ipo.
operator
thank you. our final question today is coming from josh shanker of bank of america. please go ahead.
josh shanker -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. this is just an easy one. on the vii and thinking about the private equity, what has been your long-term view of the return on that asset class? and how does that factor into your modeling for normalized earnings?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
christine?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
well, maybe...
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
maybe i can take that, rod.
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
yeah. go ahead, mike.
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
so thank you. so we assume 9% returns. that's our normalized amount. i think if you look back historically, over the last several years and certainly the reason you pushed us meaningfully above that.
but even excluding last year 2021, we've been a little above that, but i think 9% is a reasonable assumption going forward, and that's what we've built into our models. and when we say above expectations, that's what we're comparing it to.
operator
thank you. at this time, i'd like to turn the floor back over to rod martin for closing comments.
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. our success throughout 2021 reflects the purposeful decisions that we've made as a company, as well as the commitment and dedication of our people. despite the challenges posed by the pandemic over the past two years, we've remained committed to our plans, to our communities and to our employees. and we benefited from the diversification and strength of our businesses, and this has benefited all of our stakeholders.
now, as we look forward, we're excited about the opportunities before us as a leading health, wealth and investment company. our focus driving net revenue growth, along with our strong free cash flow and increasing margins will enable us to further -- drive further earnings-per-share growth. we look forward to updating you on our progress. i hope you and your families stay healthy and safe.
thank you, and good day.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the voya financial first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to michael katz, executive vice president, finance, strategy and investor relations. thank you.
please go ahead.
michael katz -- executive vice president of finance, strategy, and investor relations
thank you, and good morning. welcome to voya financial's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. we appreciate all of you who have joined us for this call. as a reminder, material for today's call are available on our website at investors.voya.com or via the webcast.
turning to slide 2. some of the comments made during this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law. i refer you to this slide for more information. we will also be referring today to certain non-gaap financial measures.
gaap reconciliations are available in our press release and financial supplement found on our website, investors.voya.com. joining me on the call are rod martin, our chairman and chief executive officer; as well as mike smith, our vice chairman and chief financial officer. after their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. for that q&a session, we have also invited our vice chairman and chief growth officer, charlie nelson, as well as the heads of our businesses, specifically, heather lavallee, wealth solutions; christine hurtsellers, investment management; and rob grubka, health solutions.
with that, let's turn to slide 3 as i would like to turn the call over to rod. 
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning. let's begin on slide 4 with some key themes. overall, we delivered solid results during the first quarter. this included strong adjusted operating eps, organic growth across our businesses as well as disciplined and opportunistic capital management.
these results were achieved despite the macroeconomic challenges during the quarter. our performance speaks to strong client demand as well as being proactive in both capital and expense management. as a result, we generated first-quarter adjusted operating eps of $1.47. excluding notable items, eps grew 15% year over year.
a key driver of our results was the commercial momentum that we demonstrated across our businesses. in wealth solutions, full service recurring deposits for the trailing 12 months grew 11.2% compared with the prior-year period. during the first quarter, we generated positive full service net flows of $446 million. and this reflects the strong organic growth as well as lower participant and planned surrenders.
in health solutions, annualized in-force premiums grew 9.7% compared with the prior year period. this was driven by growth across all product lines, including a 22% increase in our voluntary results. in investment management, we generated $1.3 billion of net flows during the first quarter, driven in part by several new private credit mandates. net flows over the last 12 months were $9.5 billion, which represents organic growth of 4.5%.
as we shared at investor day, we are generating organic growth with the products and solutions that we provide today while also making investments that will enable us to do even more for our customers going forward. for example, in march, we announced the launch of myhealth&wealth. this is a new integrated and holistic benefit selection experience that offers personalized and digital guidance. specifically, it helps employees optimize their spending across retirement, health insurance benefits and emergency savings.
this is just one example of how we're taking a customer-centric approach to helping our clients with their health, wealth and investment needs. in addition to our commercial growth, we are continuing to benefit from our high free cash flow businesses. during the quarter, we deployed more than $700 million of excess capital. given the decline in the equity markets during the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased $500 million of our shares.
the remainder of our capital deployment during the quarter consisted of approximately $200 million of debt extinguishment and $20 million in common stock dividends. as of march 31, we had approximately $900 million of excess capital. we've also recently received an additional share repurchase authorization of $500 million from our board. moving forward, we will continue to be disciplined and balanced with the use of our capital, including investing in our businesses to support our growth plans and meet our client needs.
despite inflationary pressures, equity market volatility and rising interest rates, voya remains well positioned. and this is due to the purposeful decisions that we took to derisk voya and to create a simpler company. we have a clear strategy, strong businesses with significant scale and multiple levers to achieve the growth plans that we shared at investor day. we will continue to execute as we did in the first quarter on all components of our plans, net revenue growth, margin expansion and disciplined capital management.
by doing so, we see a path to achieve double-digit adjusted operating eps growth in 2022. and while macro conditions will affect this result, we will be steadfast in adapting and pivoting. specifically, we will continue to demonstrate our experience as strong operators and expense managers. as you've seen this management team demonstrate in the past during challenging market conditions, we will be proactive in controlling what we can control, and we'll continue to balance both short and long-term needs of our stakeholders while positioning voya for future long-term success.
turning to slide 5. our focus on our values and culture continue to differentiate voya. recently, voya was named as one of the world's most ethical companies for the ninth consecutive year. we were one of only 136 companies to earn this recognition and one of only six companies in the financial services category.
and our commitment to sustainability earned voya inclusion in s&p's global sustainability yearbook. we also came together in april for voya's celebrate diversity month. this coincided with our continued partnership with the ceo [inaudible] for diversity and inclusion focus on a day of understanding. the actions of our people and our company reflect the strength of our culture and how that carries through in all that we do.
with that, let me ask mike to provide more details on our performance and results.
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
thank you, rod. we delivered a strong quarter commercially and financially, even with the backdrop of geopolitical conflict, inflation and rising interest rates. we have demonstrated our ability to manage well through such challenges and have a strong track record of effectively employing the multiple levers we have at our disposal to drive growth. as rod said, our priorities remain clear and unchanged, growing revenue, maintaining or improving margin and disciplined capital management.
during the quarter, we showed progress on all of these. in particular, we demonstrated our commitment to managing capital effectively and opportunistically by deploying $500 million toward share repurchases and complemented with nearly $200 million of debt extinguishment. additionally, we have taken actions to manage spend highlighted by real estate actions enabled by our hybrid approach to the workplace. we will continue to actively manage expenses with an eye to both our top and bottom line.
as rod mentioned, we have demonstrated our experience as strong operators and expense managers. as such and despite the headwinds from the macro environment, we continue to see a path to achieve double-digit adjusted operating eps growth in 2022. we will continue to execute on the growth, margin and capital components of our plans and we'll balance near-term results with opportunities for longer-term growth across all of our businesses. with that, let's turn to our financial results on slide 7.
we reported adjusted operating earnings of $1.47 per share in the first quarter of 2022. this includes three notable items: first, $0.40 of net alternative and prepayment investment income above long-term expectations; second, $0.24 of covid impacts; and third, $0.11 of unfavorable dac unlocking related to the movement in the equity markets during the first quarter. excluding these items, our adjusted operating earnings per share grew 15% year over year, in line with our target eps growth range of 12% to 17%. first quarter gaap net income was $27 million, which included investment losses associated with higher rates and wider spreads along with impairments, primarily related to exposures in russia.
it also includes losses in businesses we have exited that do not impact our capital generation. moving to slide 8. wealth solutions delivered strong earnings and operating margin in the first quarter despite the macro headwinds. that translated into $205 million of adjusted operating earnings, including $52 million of alternative income above our long-term expectations and $16 million of unfavorable dac unlocking.
year-over-year net revenue growth, excluding notable items, was 11.5% on a trailing 12-month basis, reflecting our continued commercial momentum supported by our diversified revenue mix. while we grow revenue, we also continue to be disciplined around spend as evidenced by our adjusted operating margin of 35.5%. turning to deposits and flows. full service recurring deposits grew by over 11%, driven by higher employer and employee contributions across corporate and tax event market.
in addition to growth and contributions, we continue to grow our participant base, giving us confidence in our 10% to 12% target for 2022. we generated full-service net inflows of $446 million for the quarter, within our previously guided range of $300 million to $600 million. looking ahead, we are encouraged by expected full service net flows supported by favorable plan and participant trends and our robust pipeline. this quarter, we also saw a return to positive net flows and stable value with $1.4 billion of net inflows, driven by strong sales and participant rebalancing.
record-keeping outflows of $893 million were primarily driven by one large case surrender. despite this, we expect positive flows and net participant growth in record keeping for the full year. our healthy sales pipeline and competitive suite of workplace solutions gives us confidence in our commercial momentum while our diversified business mix with substantial fee and spread-based revenue continues to help us navigate the macro environment. turning to slide 9.
health solutions continued to generate growth in revenue and premiums in the first quarter driven by ongoing momentum in voluntary. on a trailing 12-month basis, net revenue, excluding notables, grew 14.1% year over year driven by strong growth in voluntary. the business delivered $22 million of adjusted operating earnings in the first quarter, including $5 million in alternative income above long-term expectations. our health solutions expenses tracked higher relative to first quarter 2021, primarily driven by business-related growth and the acquisition of benefit strategies.
importantly, we maintained margins within our targeted 27% to 33% range with an adjusted operating margin, excluding notable items, of approximately 31%. in addition, first quarter annualized in-force premiums grew 9.7% year over year, supported by strong voluntary retention. we had previously guided to full year premium growth being at the lower end of our 7% to 10% target range as we continue to be disciplined on underwriting to protect margin. however, better-than-expected voluntary retention has modestly improved our outlook for the year, and we now expect to be closer to the midpoint of the range.
this quarter, we experienced higher-than-expected non-covid mortality causing group life loss ratios to be elevated on an ex-covid basis. despite the elevated mortality and significant impacts from covid to our group life block our total aggregate loss ratio on a trailing 12-month basis was still within our target range at approximately 73%. covid-related claims were $35 million in the first quarter, in line with our expectation of $2 million to $3 million per 10,000 incremental deaths. elevated group life loss ratios were partially offset by strong performance in stop loss and voluntary has both continued to deliver strong margins.
our mix of solutions has allowed us to perform well and deliver strong operating results despite adverse covid impacts. it is this track record that gives us confidence in our ability to manage through cycles and utilize the levers within our control to maintain margin while we continue to grow revenue. moving to slide 10. investment management continues to deliver strong revenue growth, reflecting growth in our private and alternative strategies, which will lead to higher margins over time.
on ex notables basis, trailing 12 months net revenue grew 10.4% year over year, reflecting continued strength in private strategies. adjusted operating earnings were $39 million. this includes $2 million in net investment capital results above long-term expectations. adjusted operating margin, excluding notables, was 25.9% supported by expense management actions that we took to offset impacts from the macro environment.
going forward, we will continue to drive expense efficiencies and prioritize margin expansion. that said, we will balance near-term margin expansion with our commitment to investing in the business for growth as we have capabilities that are driving profitable new money flow, particularly in the fast-growing alternative space. in the first quarter, we generated net inflows of $1.3 billion with strong institutional net flows driven by private and alternative fund closings. this contributed a 4.5% organic growth over the past 12 months.
we are encouraged by the strength of our robust unfunded pipeline, with the majority of flows consisting of higher-yielding private and alternative strategies. we remain confident in achieving 2% to 4% organic growth in 2022. investment performance remains strong across a broad array of fixed income strategies, with 95% of our fixed income funds outperforming on a 5- and 10-year basis. the modest decline in performance on a three-year basis was driven by a multi-sector strategy that modestly trails peer median.
of note, this strategy continues to outperform the respective benchmark in this competitive asset class. looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to manage expenses and expand margin supported by continued revenue growth across our diversified business mix. turning to slide 11. as capital management remains a key lever of eps growth, we leveraged market conditions and our strong excess capital position to deploy $713 million in the first quarter.
we have deployed $2 billion over the past 12 months. reflecting our commitment to driving shareholder value and achieving our targets. in the quarter, we deployed $500 million of excess capital toward share repurchases. this includes a $275 million asr we entered in mid-march.
the board also provided authorization for an additional $500 million of share repurchase, increasing our total existing share repurchase authorization to $521 million. beyond share repurchases, first-quarter capital deployment also included $192 million for debt extinguishment and $21 million for common dividends. additionally, we deployed approximately $35 million of capital in investment management, largely to help further our growth plans within the private and alternative space. we expect to deploy approximately $60 million of additional capital for investment management over the remainder of 2022.
our investment capital assumes a 9% long-term rate of return. debt extinguishment was approximately 40% of share repurchase activity in the quarter. we will continue to balance debt extinguishment with share repurchase activity to achieve acceptable levels of financial leverage considering the current rate environment. we ended the quarter with $900 million in excess capital, reflecting our strong starting position and the strong free cash flow conversion driven by our diverse business mix.
in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of eps expansion, and we have multiple levers within our control to continue that growth, supported by our history of being effective operators. our workplace and institutional businesses continue to perform well in challenging times, and we expect to see further positive commercial momentum through 2022. we have a strong excess capital position and will continue to deploy that capital in the best interest of shareholders. with that, i'll turn the call back to the operator so that we can take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question today is coming from erik bass of autonomous research. please go ahead.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
hi. thank you. in wealth solutions, can you talk about the outlook for spreads given the rise in interest rates year to date. if rates remain here, are we at a point where new money yields are above roll-off rates and spread compression would either start to abate or potentially even reverse?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
erik, it's rod. heather, why don't you jump in?
heather lavallee -- chief executive officer, wealth solutions
thank you, rod, and thank you for the question. so as we think about our interest spread and our spread-based revenues, i'll first kind of point to the diversification of our business, which allows us to kind of balance the macro environment questions -- the macro environment situation. but to get specific to your question, within the quarter, we did see lower credited interest. we had two fewer days in the quarter, and we also saw higher transfers from variable to fixed.
we do think that for the full year that we're going to see some nice tailwinds within our spread income but we're going to continue to be very balanced in how we're managing our investment income portfolio as well as the crediting rates that we're offering in the marketplace. so long and short, to answer your question, i think that this is something that spread income is -- we're seeing an improvements. we're seeing a tightening between portfolio yields and new money rates, and i think that it's going to create a tailwind for 2022.
erik bass -- autonomous research -- analyst
and then maybe if i could move to investment management. can you give us a sense of how much higher expenses were in the first quarter than you would expect going forward now that you have some seasonally higher costs. and then it sounds like you are still confident that even with the market headwinds year to date that you'll be able to improve margins in 2022. did i hear that right?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike, do you want to start?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
yes. sure. and let's talk about the expenses first. we  first quarter in the range of $25 million to $30 million.
i think, again, in terms of margins, we feel good about the margins that we have in health and wealth and feel like there is, over time, they'll be little. and then on the investment management, certainly, there's headwinds coming from the impacts of the markets on both the equity and fixed income side, but still feel like there is ample opportunity for us over the three-year period to get to our target of 29%.
operator
the next question is coming from elyse greenspan of wells fargo. please go ahead.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
thanks. good morning. my first question is just, i guess, on the cadence and pace of buybacks. i think you guys mentioned you took advantage of just where your stock was trading and pulled forward some buyback expected later in the year to q1.
so can you just give us a sense of how we should think about the cadence of potential repurchase activity over the balance of the year?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
thank you, elyse, for the question. so i think what we did this quarter was entirely consistent with what the philosophy that we've operated with for years now with what we've signaled, which is we'll be consistent buyers of the shares as long as we're in an excess capital position and where it makes sense to do so. we'll look for opportunities to lean in where market conditions create those kind of opportunities. we believe we saw that in the first quarter and so we did -- we also -- and we signaled that we had repurchased $200 million of -- or extinguished, i should say, $200 million of debt, and that's to manage the leverage ratio.
as we go forward, we'll continue to manage all of those things. we'll look for opportunities to continue to buy back shares, we'll manage our leverage ratios alongside that, and we'll be paying attention to the macro conditions. but this is all done with a larger framework of ensuring that we're doing all we can to help achieve the eps targets that we've set, right? so all of that comes into play as we're making those choices. i would point out that the asr that we entered in mid-march will not end until mid-june.
and so we'll assess that -- we'll assess at that time what the opportunities are, but that's a relatively narrow window for us to engage in the second quarter. but the philosophy we've used consistently over the last several years and including the last 12 months where we repurchased $2 billion. we put $2 billion of capital to work. that continues to be in place.
elyse greenspan -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and then my follow-up is on -- is within group. the life loss ratio, excluding covid, was elevated in the quarter. i think you guys called out some elevated non-covid mortality.
can you give us a sense of how large that was in the quarter? and then how should we think about that non-covid mortality piece trending from here?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
rob?
rob grubka -- chief executive officer, health solutions
yes. great. thanks, elyse. yes, as mike said, we called out the $35 million of covid and then that certainly still left us some gap to explain, as you're asking for.
and i'd really break it down into a couple of pieces. one, we talked historically about seasonality in the first quarter of life mortality just tends to be a bit hotter, and that's not unusual. what was a little bit different, and i'll size it for you from a reporting perspective, we did see some time lag in deaths that were occurred in fourth quarter, but we don't get all the paperwork until first quarter. that expanded a little bit more than we would normally expect it to be.
but when you bring the lag and seasonality together, you're talking about roughly $18 million of impact in the quarter. as i think about it, i kind of split it 50-50 of lag and seasonality. as we think about the go-forward view, this is really the first quarter where non-covid mortality is sort of reared up to certainly to this extent. so we felt up to this point, the last couple of years, we were actually running a bit better than you would have expected on the mortality side, again, with covid set aside.
so as we think about it, this is one quarter different than the last couple of years. we'll just continue to monitor it. i would say, in the data and what we saw, there was nothing that was jumping out and causing sort of a new level of concern or a different point of view as we move forward. we'll just continue to monitor it.
and i think importantly, as our results have held up through covid into this point in time, the diversity of our block of business and the different places that we play in tend to work in different ways that help us from a diversity standpoint, and we still feel really good about the long-term view around margin and growth in the business.
operator
the next question is coming from jimmy bhullar of j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
jimmy bhullar -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. i think mike smith, your voice is going in and out. so it might be an issue with your mic on your end.
so i just thought i'd point that out. but in terms of my question, obviously, with the rates going up, that's a positive for the business overall. but how do you think about the impact of interest rates going up on fixed income assets on the asset management side and with the decline in assets, how much of an impact do you expect on fee income in the near term in that business?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
sure. and jimmy, thanks for letting us know about the microphone situation. i hope this is better. so the way to think about fee income impact for the movements to date is in the neighborhood of 5% to 10% pre-tax per year.
obviously, we'll have to see where rates settle. the market has priced in, i think, some substantial fed increases. i think those are likely to occur. but where we go from here, we'll have to wait and see.
it's worth noting, as you're thinking about the quarter that this was a pretty extraordinary set of circumstances in the marketplace, right? you'd have to go back to when i was in high school where interest rates moved this much. and so i think that's created a degree of change that we've managed through quite effectively. but i think as you try to put the quarter into perspective, it's important to keep in mind how sudden and significant those movements were.
jimmy bhullar -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and still the same issue with the sound, but we can make out what you're saying. it's fading a lot. but either way.
the other question that i just -- i had was on your views on alternative investment income. and obviously, it was good this quarter. i think that's mostly because of the lag effect of the market. but how do you think about investment income in the near term? and like is looking at the equity market a good indicator of how it will be for the next couple of quarters?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
jimmy, thanks again for the question. and i've moved to new mics. so we're dusting. this is in new york.
great. and it worked fine and sound check, i promise. so in terms of hard to say, ultimately, where alternatives are going to come out, there is a degree of correlation between the performance of our portfolio, which is a mix of limited partnerships and private equity, real estate and so on. but it's not perfect correlation, right? and so if i were to venture a range that we're kind of thinking about here would be plus or minus 3% centered on 0.
that's what we've got in our hedge for the quarterly return, right, and that would annualize to minus 12% to plus 12%, right? so we don't, though, expect a significant decline at this point, but we don't have really any information from the underlying funds to be able to point to, to substantiate that, that's based on historical inference is probably the way to think about that.

next question is coming from alex scott of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
alex scott -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. i had a follow-up just on the impact of net investment -- or sorry, the impact of higher interest rates on net investment income. any way, you could provide a little more detail just on the amount of floating rate assets you have. i think there was also a portfolio that when rates are going down, i think i heard maybe it was mortgage securitizations and so forth that i think had some impact in the past.
i mean do you still have balances that are going to benefit more directly from short-term rates going up?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
thanks, alex. i think the guidance that we've given in terms of the impact of changes in rates, it largely still holds. i think the current thinking is that for another 100 basis point increase, it's still a $20 million to $30 million benefit, more likely to be toward the lower end of that range. i think as we've assessed the impact on fixed income assets and still a decrease of 100 basis points is in the 10% to 20% range.
in terms of floating assets, the only -- maybe the one thing to point out is some of the sensitivity is gone because of the sale of our financial planning channel which did have some direct relationship in the sweep account mechanics that went on there. but the floating rate assets are not a substantial portion of the impact, but they are -- whatever we do have is baked into those sensitivities.
alex scott -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and a follow-up on investment management. can you talk about rising rates? and if that has any impact one way or the other on just the pipeline for net flows, i mean i heard that you reiterated your organic growth guide. so it sounds like all that's still intact, but i'm just interested if rates is a headwind.
and if it is, what are some of the things in privates and alts that you're doing that are sort of offsetting that?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
christine?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
sure. thanks, alex. as far as rising rates and impact on forward momentum. as mike alluded to in his opening comments, the pipeline continues to be very strong, and we reaffirm our 2% to 4% organic growth range for this year.
so why is it so strong? and how could rates possibly affect it? a lot of the interest really is in private markets. so when you think about just private markets being really unique sourcing for clients that they can't get access to as well as they tend to provide higher spread and returns to public markets. and so really just see increased interest actually in that no dissipation as well as we have strategies, particularly commercial real estate that are libor-based or floating as well as absolute return strategy. so overall, we're not seeing an impact in terms of rates.
where i would say it has impacted is a little bit on the retail flow side, when you think about retail fixed income assets. and just as mike said, just really outsized percentage decline in fixed income assets overall in the market. so see an impact there. but overall -- and one other thing i would point out, alex, that's interesting is with the sell-off in rates, we actually are starting to see a pickup in some of the u.s.
credit strategies, offshore namely out of europe. so it continues to be more attractive. so overall, see diverse pipeline going to hit our organic growth targets continuing just one other thing to going back a little bit to erik's question earlier on, very focused on profitable growth. driven by organic strengths as well as expense discipline.
granted first quarter, we do see seasonality in comp and other things typically always comes in a little hot. but that's absolutely a lever that we pull. and as you would expect, with the macro environment, we're continuing to be disciplined pulling back on some of our expense that we were going to do, but being very mindful, again, of this organic growth, we're a strategic asset manager investing in the business, launching funds. so overall, very confident we're managing through the volatility and driving toward our 29% margin target and continuing to be very focused on improving the profitability of the business.

the next question is coming from john barnidge of piper sandler. please go ahead.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you very much. my question, you called out peripheral eastern european countries, that was $53 million in 1q '22 in the presentation. could you let us know what was that balance at 4q '21, please?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
mike?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
john, it really isn't any different in 4q '21. that is primarily exposures in turkey and kazakhstan. and it's worth pointing out that the marks that we're seeing today on those assets are basically right on top of book. so we're not seeing any deterioration in that part of the portfolio nor do i expect there to be, but obviously, time will tell events are unfolding rapidly and potentially and predictably.
and so we're monitoring carefully.
john barnidge -- piper sandler -- analyst
and then my follow-up question, clearly, a good guy with the health solutions business now at the midpoint of that 7% to 10% versus the low end previously. can you maybe talk about that better-than-expected retention, no renewal season is important for that?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
rob?
rob grubka -- chief executive officer, health solutions
yes, sure. thanks, john. yes, so what we talked about at the 4q call was really based on and driven by what we were seeing within the stop loss business, as you said and mike said voluntary ended up doing a bit better than expected. and so there's a couple of elements to that.
just obviously, we've been going through like all workplace benefit. companies are doing a lot of remote enrollment activity going on. and you always sort of hope for the best, but fear for the worst, and we ended up seeing that come in better. so i think from a just enrollment participation perspective, there was a benefit there.
and then certainly, from a group decisions that were made by the employer and broker consultants involved in those decisions, we just saw better retention at the group level at the case level than we would have anticipated. i think that's driven by just excellent service experience that we're providing. that's a business where there's still a lot of variability in what good looks like from us or competitors. and so i think we've been winning more of those games and losing and feel really good about just the quality of the portfolio that we've built, obviously, dramatically over the last handful of years with plus 20% growth given where we're at and the size of that business now, it's certainly something i'm proud of and the work that the team has done around it.
but we got to keep working at it and keep getting better at it as we move forward. we love the diversification within our book of business as we alluded to on stop loss, a little bit tighter environment, but we're going to make good balanced pricing decisions around that business. and now in the year, in 12 months, we're going to get another shot at continuing to grow the business a little bit faster, but we want to be again, disciplined on the price. so we feel good about the overall net story within the book, growing at the rate we're growing at close to 10%.
not an easy thing to do, especially in the sort of covid environment than what we've been going through.

the next question is coming from andrew kligerman of credit suisse. please go ahead.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey. thank you. can you hear me?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
andrew. yes.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. great. ok. because it was the operator [inaudible].
so back on the excess capital question, you're sitting on $0.9 billion. you certainly had a very robust capital management. and i guess the question is, does that signal that m&a has decreased as a priority? and secondly, along those lines, sitting on $0.9 billion of excess capital, is that something you want to get down to 0 and over what frame?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
andrew, i'll begin. mike and i, as usual, will toggle back and forth. i think the key theme i'd like to leave you and the listeners with is our north star is and has been eps growth. and we've talked about that organically.
we've talked about that in expanding our product solutions, and we've talked about that in consideration of adding capabilities or data or expanding international distribution or potentially scale place. but the driving factor in all of that decisioning is the north star of eps growth. and i think the quarter represents a really good example, as you just pointed out, in our deploying that capital and using the levers to accomplish what we said we would accomplish at investor day. but with that, mike, i'll let you add.
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
the only thing i'd add, rod, is just, look, we view the excess capital as excess and it is available to be deployed. i think as a practical matter, the timing is such that will we ever get to zero it will depend on how macro events unfold. it will depend on how the credit performance, the underlying portfolios and so on. but we've operated with a balance, i think throughout my tenure as cfo that's ranged from the low 100s to $1.5 billion, right? and so i think we do view all of that as excess, right? we're often asked is there a cushion you're targeting? and the answer is no.
we view it as available to be deployed and in the right situations, we will do so.
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
and, andrew, to underscore that, as mike talked about a moment ago, we deployed $2 billion of capital over the last 12 months and generated organically $1 billion of capital in 2021. so i think it's a really good example of what we're saying and frankly, the essence of your question.
andrew kligerman -- credit suisse -- analyst
and just a quick follow-on to that part. are you seeing m&a opportunities that could be eps accretive out there? is there much out there that you're seeing?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
andrew, we're not going to speculate on. we've talked about what we might consider, but certainly aren't going to speculate on a given property or discussion other than to say we are 100% focused on growing our eps as our north star.
operator
thank you. the next question is coming from tom gallagher of evercore. please go ahead.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning. first question is, mike, you had mentioned you deployed $135 million of capital into the investment management business this quarter, and you expect to do another $60 million for the balance of the year. can you just specifically talk about what that's being invested in? and is that seed capital fund launches or something else?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
tom, thanks for the question. and i'll start, but then i'll hand it to christine who can really give a lot more color about what it is we're specifically focused on. but it was $35 million of seed capital in the quarter. you may have misspoke.
i think you said $135 million.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
i did.
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
for the balance of the year, we expect to get to about $100 million in total, inclusive of the $35 million. so that is indeed seed capital. it is capital that we will ultimately earn a return from, and we expect that to be an attractive return, just as we expect our customers to reap an attractive return. and it reflects just the opportunities that we see for growth and some of the new capabilities that we're anxious to bring to the market.
and i think christine can take it from there. so, christine?
christine hurtsellers -- chief executive officer, investment management
yes. thanks, mike. yes. so just to provide a little bit more color, what we're about, certainly, going back to our privates and differentiated strategies.
we continue to see very strong demand to expand our perimeter, so to speak, and some of the products and the vehicles we offer. so specifically, we are in the process of working on a commercial real estate debt fund that is focused on impact investing. so think esg meets commercial real estate. and so just very compelling strategy, appeals to many clients, including our robust insurance clients.
so that's one example. another, we are also in the process of launching a middle market opportunistic credit funds, again, expanding our perimeter here in what we do. and so overall, why it's so important? our clients also love the fact you often hear us say we eat our own cooking. just our alignment with client interests with our own capital.
it's just such an important part of the trust that we have built with our client base. and so again, we're really excited about the opportunities to continue to deploy capital and grow the franchise.
tom gallagher -- evercore isi -- analyst
that's helpful. and my follow-up is, can you talk about some of these below-the-line charges that were taken this quarter, i presume some of them were impairing your russian or ukraine investments. maybe if you could quantify that. and also, if the markets remain under some pressure here, would you still expect some level of losses to be taken? or do you think would you expect those to be much lower and for you to get closer to the 90% free cash flow conversion
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
sure. happy to do so. and maybe i'll frame it. just if we look at the three adjustments that we highlighted to operating income to get to net, right? and i'll frame that both in kind of like what's in there from a gaap standpoint as well as which things are affecting our statutory capital position, right? so first, if you start with the net investment gains, you're right, there is an impairment in there related to several underlying russian-related assets.
there is also another private credit, just kind of normal course, nothing extraordinary about that. it's very much a singular event. it's not a representative of any other broader trend. that's a little bit less than half of that $69 million.
the balance is related to trading activity on various hedging and also just underlying trading activity period. those are all from a capital standpoint that -- the trading-related stuff doesn't have a capital impact because of the imr effect, right? so a little bit less than it -- a little bit half of that $69 million affected capital. the business' exited line is primarily adjustments related, they're noncash, noncapital related, almost exclusively. there is a small tail legal reserve being put up related to our -- the financial planning channel, but that's like mid-single digits.
the balance of that is noncash, and it's all related to gaap accounting on the exited blocks, full stop. and then the other think of that as two components. there are -- there was some -- and again, given the extraordinary movement in interest rates, there was a -- about half of that number was related to a stable value hedge. that hedge is not designed to be perfect.
it's designed to work reasonably well through most economic scenarios. i would say, even so, the number here is not particularly consequential one way or the other, and there have been gains in the past, and there will be in the future. and then there was also some restructuring costs, which is something that will ultimately go away, but it was particularly just a tiny bit heavy in the quarter. so in terms of going forward, the way to think about this, tom, is in most quarters, the range of 90% to 100% should absorb most of that noise, if not all of it.
there will be quarters where we were -- in this case, for example, where a lot of adjustments went the same way and they happen to go negative. there will be other quarters where the adjustments could go positive. and so in those quarters, we might be somewhat above or below the range that we've specified. but over the long term, we do expect to be in the 90% to 100%.
but in any given quarter, there will be -- there could be noise. and again, just harking back to the extraordinary changes that we saw this quarter, it's not surprising that there's a little bit of excess noise. and given the direction of rate changes, it's not surprising that it was negative.
operator
the next comes from nigel dally of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
nigel dally -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning. so i had a question on your longer-term eps growth goals.
back at investor day, you laid out a goal to grow the eps in the range of 12% to 17%. clearly, since the equity markets are a lot more challenging. so i would be interested in your view as to whether those goals are still achievable. i heard your comment that you're still targeting double-digit growth this year.
so does that mean double digit this year followed by 12% to 17% thereafter. just wanted some clarity there.
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
nigel, it's rod. i'll start, and mike will jump in. and as you just pointed out, given the significant market movement, 12-plus percent will be difficult. that said, we are, in fact, underscoring with some confidence double-digit growth this year.
and i'd remind all of our listeners that the three-year plan is it's three years. it's not quarter to quarter, it's over the three-year period of time. but we want to be specific and are. we do see a path to double-digit growth based on the markets that we see today, and we feel very good about the commercial momentum that we've got across our businesses.
but with that, mike?
mike smith -- vice chairman and chief financial officer
yes. just to reemphasize, certainly no change in our view for the long term. i feel very good about our commercial prospects and how that will translate into eps growth. and i don't reiterate the multiple levers and our willingness to pull them as demonstrated by the first quarter.
so just maybe to give a little more color to the way we're thinking about this. the headwinds from equity markets as we stand right now, and this -- obviously, the path that we follow will be pretty important. but the headwinds from where market stood at the end of april is in the high single-digit percentages, right? and so that is eroding our ability to get to the midpoint -- to get into the range. we are taking actions that will offset much of that, but it's not going to be able to offset all of it, we'll also get a little benefit.
think of this as low-single digits from interest rates. and so that's how we get to the double digits. i think if we get a little bit of help from the equity markets over the balance of the year, 12 plus is still on the table, but we're going to need a little bit of help. i think it's going to be difficult otherwise.
operator
the next question is coming from josh shanker of bank of america. please go ahead.
josh shanker -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. thank you. as we emerge from covid, obviously, sales are doing really nicely in the health business. i'm wondering if there are some strategies that you're using that you're getting engagement with your counterparts who are buying products from you.
also, when i look at the stop loss growth and the voluntary and general group products, they're both growing. and i think that's a different conversation with a different part of the corporate structure when you're trying to sell those products. how are you doing so well? and i guess, who are you taking share from?
rod martin -- chairman and chief executive officer
let me ask rob to start. but charlie, i'd like you to jump in on the heels of that also, please. rob?
rob grubka -- chief executive officer, health solutions
yes, sure. thanks, josh. yes, look, we've -- as you point out, we've kind of been firing on all cylinders from a growth perspective across what arguably is a pretty focused set of products and solutions relative to the peers. what i would tell you is, we sort of daisy chain activity really, really well.
and so when you think about the sales cycle for stop loss being back-end loaded, but turning into the conversations that become focused in, in our market, middle and upper part of the marketplace, national account season across the life, disability, lead management space as well as supplemental health. and so there's just a nice cadence to what we're doing, and we're building deep relationships because for the most part, those conversations, while there may be different parties involved, there's a consistency within the benefit team and department on who we're engaging with and the account management side of it. as we get into a group, even with stop loss after a couple of years, close to 20%, 30%, we're able to penetrate and get other products in place. and then with the life disability lead management business, more often than not, you're selling that as a package.
and then as we've grown our capabilities in supplemental health and driven scale and credibility in market, it's not unusual for us to get all those things going, and it doesn't all happen at the same time. but again, we sort of daisy chain our way into just broaden out the relationships and feel really good about the momentum we've created. but again, it comes back to, as i alluded to before, like how are we executing once we're in. it's one thing to win the business.
it's another thing to earn credibility and then grow the business from there, which gives us a ton of confidence and i'll create the handoff here for charlie about not just within the health business, but also how do we leverage and bring together the health account solutions conversation with the wealth conversation and the retirement business, i think those things were set up really, really nicely because we just execute well once we're in. but charlie, i'll let you add on.
charlie nelson -- vice chairman and chief growth officer
yes. thanks, rob. it's a great question because, certainly, kind of we -- if you take the end of the first quarter, 3/31 and went back for the last two years, we've kind of been in that covid environment. and you kind of say, ""geez, we've got tremendous momentum."" during that covid the last two years, we put on over $60 billion in business from sales in our retirement or in our wealth business, employee benefits.
and think about that, that most of those sales were really done without meeting the client in person, shaking a hand, letting them kick the tires, so to speak. it's been done virtually. but why is that important? i think that's important to keep in context because it tells you how strong our brand is, how strong our solutions are resonating in the market. our distribution partnerships and footprint, how wide and vast that is.
and even equally importantly, how strong our team is and how they've worked through this. our voice is different in the market. just as rob had articulated there, we've got really a focus at kind of more holistic solutions. and certainly, the labor market is a challenge and inflation is a challenge for employers.
so we see them increasingly looking for things that we have. employers want to get more out of their health and wealth benefits. they want to manage their benefit costs in a more holistic way and an ability to be able to attract and retain talent. so with that, that really pivots us, i think, to be really well positioned.
and where our focus is and the growth office with our sales and service teams for health and wealth, to focus on the growth and the sales momentum that we have, and that's really buoyed not just by the retention that you saw on voluntary but we've had strong retention in our retirement as well. and that's been great. second, it's really been on profitable revenue growth in our businesses, both in health and wealth and in investments and the things that we've got there. and i think that buoys itself and reflects in our strong margin and gives us confidence of where we think we're going to end up the year from a margin perspective by the solution mixes that are being driven by our approach.
and that value proposition, i would just wrap with saying is it really is resonating in the market. i think intermediaries and plan sponsors are increasingly seeing that voya helps you realize greater value and improved financial outcomes by helping get employers workplace savings and benefits in sync and we just see that continuing to resonate in being a different voice in the market.
josh shanker -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
well, i'll let you go, given that it's up at the hour. i'll ask some more questions off-line on this, but i appreciate all the answers.
