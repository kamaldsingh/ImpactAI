steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
operator, our first question, please?
operator
our first question will come from robert jones with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
robert patrick jones -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. i guess maybe just to start on guidance in the pharma segment, you're calling for a mid-single-digit ebit growth there. wanted to just get a little bit more on your thoughts around the underlying assumptions versus some of the more one-time items, specifically thinking about things like lapping pharmedium, which you mentioned and then, obviously, additional covid costs from this year that might not recur at the same level at least for next year. and then i guess to the upside, i know, steve, you continue to talk about the growing opportunity with biosimilars. i was hoping maybe you could also touch on what, if anything, is considered in that opportunity for fiscal 2021?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. well, bob, this is jim, and i'll start with some of your questions you asked on guidance and then turn it over to steve for your final part of the question. so fiscal year '21 financial guidance, i mean it reflects strong growth across multiple businesses, building upon the momentum from the strong fiscal year '20 despite the covid-19 challenges. and if you know, we're guiding to mid-single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit operating income growth, and that mid-single-digit operating income growth is both in pharma distribution segment and in other. and adjusted diluted eps guidance in the range of $8.20 to $8.45 and keeping in mind there that we don't include unidentified capital allocation in our guidance. so in terms of pharmaceutical distribution, again, some of the things that are driving it. we continue to benefit from our pharmaceutical-centric positioning, particularly from our leadership in specialty, where we're seeing biosimilars continuing to contribute meaningfully. we're expecting pharmaceutical utilization trends generally consistent with the experience we had in fiscal year '20. we're assuming that brand inflation and generic deflation levels that they are in line with what we saw in fiscal year '20. we will have a tailwind in the first quarter of fiscal year '21 from the exit of pharmedium. and so that will be a benefit of $20 million in operating income tailwind comparing of the first quarter of '21 with the first quarter of '20. and then we continue to remain disciplined on expense management. we work -- and i'm strongly encouraged by our opex performance in fiscal year '20 and continue to remain focused on expense management. we're unlikely to have the same level of favorability related to some of the corporate and administrative expenses in fiscal year '21 that we had in fiscal year '20, like our internal healthcare expenses would be an example of that, but we continue to expect to perform well on the opex front. and so if we look also kind of quarterly cadence, i would say that the first quarter will be a bit stronger because we have the tailwind compared to first quarter of fiscal year '20 related to pharmedium. and then the second quarter will be a little bit tougher because we're comparing to the second quarter fiscal year '20 wherein march we had elevated sales with the onset of covid.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
well hi, thanks for the question. yes, we've seen encouraging usage of biosimilars and the biosimilars market has continued to -- we expect to materially increase by 2025. most importantly, we see -- potentially increased molecule demand by 2% to 4%, indicating increased patient accessibility as supportive care and other products become more affordable and especially with some of the copay and equity that we try to highlight elsewhere. so of course, for abc, these products are the most impactful. but i think biosimilars are a key trend for us. they're important for our customers. they're important for the patients that we all ultimately serve. and the pricing is remaining intact to the commercialization business that we are so in favor of performing for, for abc are able to still being played access and adherent solution. so very positive trend for abc, we believe. next question, please? sorry, bob, please go ahead, bob.
robert patrick jones -- goldman sachs -- analyst
no, i was just going to say the one other item. i saw that amerisourcebergen was selected by hhs for this strategic national stockpile initiative. i was just wondering if you could comment on what, if anything, is included in guidance around that new contract?
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. no. so there's nothing specific in our guidance. we can confirm that we've been selected to store, manage and distribute strategic national stockpile pharmaceuticals. and i think this is a further testament to that value that abc provides, our deep promotional expertise. and i think one of the areas that we've really been focusing on is our data and analytics capabilities. and we've talked a lot, in my script, in particular, about innovative solutions that enables us to provide -- that provide unique solutions to government and commercial partners. so we believe that during this period, we've become the invisible pillar of innovation. and this is a further example. i think many, many more stakeholders are aware of the capabilities of an amerisourcebergen than they were before. so i think this is extremely good evidence of it. so we're proud to receive this award.
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, bob, and i'll just -- bob, i'll just add that the contract is in our numbers, but there's nothing specific to call out.
robert patrick jones -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
next question please, operator?
operator
our next question will come from lisa gill with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
lisa christine gill -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
hi, thanks very much and good morning. first, just to start and go back to your comments around biosimilars. jim, i understand that the comments that steve made and that this is positive, but is there any way for you to frame what the potential margin opportunity would be for a biosimilar versus a traditional branded drug that goes through your specialty business?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. yeah. let me start out there. and as we commented on biosimilars, it's really one of the very positive things that's driving our strong results in our specialty physician services business. and we do see higher margin opportunities with biosimilars than we see with traditional brands. and that was one of the factors, for instance. we were quite pleased this year, which we -- when we saw our operating margins tick up a couple of basis points in biosimilars. and the adoption of biosimilars being stronger than we expected is one of the factors that caused our operating margin to tick up during the fiscal year.
lisa christine gill -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
but when we think about it, if we were just to use traditional margin, is there a way to think like is this onetime more profitable, 2 times? i mean just to kind of put this in reference, as we start to think about the number of biosimilars that will come to the market over the next few years -- and i agree with you that i believe that this is a great opportunity, especially given the size of your specialty business and the manufacturing services that you have. i am just trying to put this into context. i know you said that there is part of that in your 2021 guidance, but how do we think about that margin differential and the opportunity, not just for 2021, but over the next several years?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. we do think it clearly was a positive factor in '20, it will be a positive factor for us in '21 and in future years, the growth of biosimilars. we won't get specific on margin, but we'll say that the margin is higher than brand, specialty and not as high as generic margin and -- but we do feel like it will be a continued growth driver for our businesses.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
and lisa, one final point, community oncology practices, particularly we believe members of our ion gpo that have really shown an ability to partner with key manufacturers have been early adopters in embracing biosimilars. and if you look at the data on our larger practices adoption versus providers on a national level, it's favorable. so we believe that's further evidence of our being able to promote new and effective therapies.
operator
our next question will come from ricky goldwasser with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
rivka regina goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. hi, good morning. so i have one question that is really around capex and capital deployment. i think you increased your capex guidance for this year. so what areas are you looking to spend on? and how should we think about these areas as driving growth in the foreseeable future? and then clearly, it sounds like you're getting closer to an opioid settlement and resolution of litigation that's occupied you for a few years now. so now with you -- you're freeing up kind of like that capacity, how are you thinking strategically about capital deployment in areas for potential expansion?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. let me start out there. so yeah, we are expecting capital expenditures to be a little bit higher in fiscal year '21 than fiscal year '20. they were about $370 million in fiscal year '20, and our guidance is about $400 million in fiscal year '21. and we've got many projects in place, there's no one project that's driving our capex. it's really a shared focus across supporting growth. so a lot of our capex is about supporting both, increasing our efficiency and then enhancing our commercial and compliance capabilities. and then in terms of capital deployment, our capital deployment strategies remain unchanged; invest in the business, strategic m&a, opportunistic share repurchase and maintaining a reasonable dividend. and one thing i think is really nice to point out is that our balanced approach to capital deployment has been a commercial and financial differentiator for us. we ended fiscal year '20 with a trailing 3-year average adjusted return on invested capital of over 18%. and i think we are well positioned for capital deployment ending fiscal year '20 with zero net debt.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah, just -- thanks, jim. i just would add that for strategic, accretive m&a, it's important that the targets must be actionable with appropriate returns. jim and laza, our controller, work very closely with our finance committee of our board, and we evaluate all opportunities. but i'd say that overall, we didn't do any m&a this year, but amerisourcebergen continues to benefit from our strategy being pharmaceutical centric, particularly our strength in specialty. and we're always looking to pull on our key strengths. so our commercialization services, animal health, those are areas -- patient access, analytics and data to the extent that they are in the special area, those are all key areas for us, ricky.
operator
our next question will come from glen santangelo with guggenheim. please go ahead.
glen joseph santangelo -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. steve, i just wanted to also follow up on sort of the opioid litigation. it's obviously an encouraging sign. and assuming you're correct and the number that you put in the press release that you reserve for the $5.5 billion after tax over 18 years, it's only about $300 million a year. and so when i think about that in the context of free cash flow of about $1.5 billion, how do you think about changes you may or may not have to make to your historical capital deployment strategy? and then, jim, maybe my follow-up for you would be, is there anything you can do in this low interest rate environment to maybe get creative on how you fund or pay for settlement? or do you just anticipate this may be something that you fund out of free cash flow? thanks in advance.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, glen. again, i think i will answer -- jim and i answered the last question pretty thoroughly. we were always contemplated. and our first priority is, of course, always internal investments, and we did about $360 million, $370 million this year. and we have always robust requirements from the business, which also gets well scrutinized. but essentially, they been some of our best returns and the area of interoperability, et cetera, those are very important for us. but as we look at different liquidity options, as we look at the cash holding and the free cash flow, we really -- we'll keep on looking at being that preferred place for shareholders to invest. jim has a comment as well.
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, glen. as i commented earlier, our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged. we're certainly cognizant of the potential settlement and the impact of the settlement as we consider capital deployment. but at the same time, it's really important that this doesn't change our strategic focus and the need to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. and as everyone knows, the other important piece of running our business is remaining investment grade, and that's something that we've been aware of and conscious of throughout the opioid discussions.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you. next question, please?
operator
next question will come from george hill with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
george robert hill -- deutsche bank -- analyst
good morning, guys. steve, i'm going to ask kind of a characterization question, first of all, with the fiscal '21 guidance, we talked about very small moving puts and takes as opposed to any large moving puts and takes. it almost seems like, what i would characterize, as a normal year going back to all the pricing concerns and everything that we've seen scratching back to 2015. i guess i'd ask, would you characterize it that way? and then my quick follow-up would be, as it relates to the '21 guidance, can you talk about how you're thinking about volumes relative to the pre-covid baseline?
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. george, thank you. i mean it's interesting that you're referring to the past 12 months with all the recurrences that we've had, not necessarily for amerisourcebergen but in our society as a normal year. but look, the resilience of our businesses were truly on display. we had, of course, the spike in march and in the -- the softish april and may. and if you go back to those times, the confusion that we had, so i think we've had also -- in 2009, we had the fiscal crisis and the worldwide recession. and our business was extremely recession-proof in those times as well. and payers keep paying, our customers keep on seeing their patients and keep on really finding ways to access patients. so i think if you think about fiscal year '20, the resiliency overall, the way that some of our businesses that were a bit softer, including, say, our production, animal health businesses came back. those are all very important to us and i think a good reason why we performed the way we did. if you look at fiscal year '21, we expect that overall providers will be able to navigate through any surge in the virus in patient loads very effectively. i think that we're much more aware of patient treatments, more effective therapies that are available and that have been improved or brought into utilization, even now one for fda utilization. so we're quite optimistic about our providers' abilities to sustain and manage through any prolonged covid crisis. and then some of the trends that we've talked about, we've talked about them a lot, including our portfolio of customers and the businesses. we are pharmaceutical centric and our ability to do incredible business continuity planning, which should not be underestimated, i think, positions us very well. jim, i see you have a comment?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. and i think the last six months of fiscal year '20 -- well, all of fiscal year '20, but in particular, the last six months of fiscal year '20, we really demonstrated the resilience of our businesses to operate in this environment. and so that gives us good confidence in our fiscal year '21 guidance as we look at mid-single-digit revenue growth guidance and mid-single-digit operating income guidance for fiscal year 2021.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
next question, please, operator?
operator
our next question will come from charles rhyee with cowen. please go ahead.
james auh -- cowen and company -- analyst
this is james, on for charles. i just had a question on other. the performance in other was strong this quarter, adjusted op income up 21%, up 5% for the year, which is ahead of the fiscal '20 guidance despite covid. but can you speak more on what drove the strong growth in the quarter and then some of the puts and takes heading into fiscal 2021?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. and in the other segment, yeah, we did have a very strong quarter, up -- operating income up 20% and we did hit 5% operating income growth for the year, and we're guiding growth next year to mid-single digits. and we saw some of the businesses and other be a little bit more impacted by covid during our third fiscal year, but really come back nicely in the fourth fiscal quarter. really, kind of the standout business in the other segment has been world courier. world courier has really has demonstrated the value of its service in global specialty logistics that manufacturers have really valued during this environment. and so that's been a standout and really very strong momentum to into next fiscal year. but we're really seeing good performance during the quarter from other businesses also. we saw mwi with 8% revenue growth, including double-digit revenue growth in companion animal and have returned to growth in production animal also during the fourth fiscal quarter, and we saw solid performance out of lash and other businesses. so we think those businesses are very well positioned going into fiscal year 2021.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
next question, please?
operator
our next question will come from eric percher with nephron research. please go ahead.
eric r. percher -- nephron research -- analyst
thank you. i want to return to the theme on pharmaceutical growth and maybe some of the seasonality. so i think we heard you loud and clear for medium in q1. i would love to hear any thoughts you have on covid impact as we get through the middle of the year, how meaningful that is? and then two other specifics. one would be generic pricing stable, is that less of a benefit than it was when we were moving from high deflation to lower deflation? and last of the 3, in the independent pharmacy marketplace, there's been reports of you extending your largest customer there for a long contract. did that have any negative in this year that might be unique relative to a normal year?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. let me start out there, eric. so you asked about kind of seasonality in pharm distribution as it relates to fiscal year '21. and again, i think what the second half of fiscal year '20 demonstrated was our resilience and our ability to perform well and have solid growth in the covid environment. and so as we look to seasonality this upcoming year, you've commented, we do have that tailwind, the $20 million tailwind in the first quarter from exit of pharmedium. in the second quarter, we do have a little bit more of a tougher comp, because as we've commented before, we saw a sales spike in the month of march last year with the onset of covid. so that creates a little bit tougher comp during the second quarter. but i think really kind of the key thing is the resilience of the business. and of course, we track the volumes in all of our businesses very closely, and we've just seen strong resilience in fiscal year '20 that we would expect to continue in fiscal year '21 in this environment. and then on generic deflation, the question you asked on generic deflation, we saw generic deflation moderate as we've commented during fiscal year '20, and our expectation for fiscal year '21 is for generic deflation to be consistent with what we saw in fiscal year '20. and with regard to independents, and what we see an independent, steve, i'm not sure if you'd like to comment at all on independents?
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean i'd like to -- i think you're talking about our largest pharm group customer. and there's nothing to really comment on there. that's -- we're managing through, and that's really around pricing, balancing that we have talked about with all customers. so, nothing important to comment on there at all, eric. thank you.
operator
our next question will come from steven valiquette with barclays. please go ahead.
steven james valiquette -- barclays bank -- analyst
great, thanks. good morning, steve and james. congrats one these results. so the u.s. elections obviously are not quite concluded yet as we all know. just curious if you have any updated thoughts just on the outlook for drug price reform going forward, with at least some visibility on a split congress. but maybe just within your overall fy '21 guidance, do you make any sort of allocation for potential changes on either international pricing parity or other things? or does all that just get absorbed within the guidance range?
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
steve, my 88-year-old father called me this morning and said, ""what's going on in pennsylvania. why can't you get your results?"" so i don't think that, that was quite as directed as this comment. but on policy, i think we always go back to some of our key themes. it's really important to remember that pharmaceuticals are the most efficient form of source of care. and that i think people sometimes forget -- that not you obviously, but that total healthcare spending, we actually are under 10% now and overall increases have been pretty reasonable. so i think those are the themes that we try to highlight. and of course, if there were any changes that you referenced like the international pricing, those should be done thoughtfully and then transitioned in a sensitive way. so i think you've seen the market rallied yesterday on healthcare stocks. and i think we -- at amerisourcebergen, we have a seat at the table, we are involved. we've really advanced in that area. we often get seen as experts on a lot of these reimbursement and policy areas as it affects our customers. and that's a big part of our focus, right? we'll continue to advocate on behalf community-based care. we will continue to be a fair partner to pharma and buy on those sort of organizations. and we'll also look to make sure that anything that affects our industry is fairly legislated like the pedigree rule is a good example of that, things like that. so we think it's important. and also amerisourcebergen, of course, really benefits as a mutual fund of all pharmaceutical-based spending. so we will represent in all the segments, so you should just think about that.
i think operator, we have time for -- no more questions, ok. our investor relations head is putting an end to questions. so i'm going to just end up by saying we're excited to finally be in fiscal year '21. we're focused on execution and growth in fiscal year '21, which we now just completed october. most excitingly, from a personal point of view, i remember when i joined the former bergen brunswig about 27 years ago that we were doing about $3 billion or $4 billion in sales. and potentially, this next year, this upcoming year when we could celebrate the 20th anniversary, we all celebrate the 20th anniversary of amerisource and bergen merging, we could record a $200 billion in revenues, which would be quite a momentous achievement for a 20-year-old company. so just let me end by saying that we're excited about fiscal year '21. we'll also be opening new headquarters for our company. and we're hoping that we can celebrate together with our wonderful associates that have done such a great job throughout this year. we are well positioned to deliver growth and create stakeholder value as we are guided by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. thank you for your time today. i know it's been a busy morning. thank you.

steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, bennett, and good morning to everyone on the call. today, we will be discussing amerisourcebergen's strong performance in fiscal 2020 and our expectations for fiscal 2021. importantly, we would like to start by, first of all, acknowledging the exceptional efforts of our associates to support our customers and help them navigate the challenges stemming from the covid-19 pandemic. in fiscal 2020, we once again delivered strong performance due in large part to our continued ability to innovate and execute, an inherent resilience of our business. driven by our purpose and guiding principles, our associates stepped up whenever we're challenged to address the unprecedented circumstances facing our industry. thanks to them, we've been able to meet stakeholder needs while enabling the continuity and stability of the supply chain and demonstrating the vital nature of our role in a health system as an invisible pillar for pharmaceutical innovation and access. when the covid-19 pandemic first emerged, we put the health, safety and well being of our associates and customers first. we implemented enhanced, clean protocols and supported associates by providing additional pay power for associates who needed quarantine or care for family members, bonuses for frontline associates and back up dependent case. we also shifted all suitable roles for remote work. feedback from our associates on these measures have been overwhelmingly positive.
more than 90% of our associates surveyed say communication, collaboration and creativity and innovation have remained the same or better. we also understood and appreciated our opportunity to deliver on our purpose and be part of the solution, given our central role in the supply chain. in addition to our normal supplier portion and process, our teams have ensured that critical medications are allocated on a propriety basis to facilitate patient access. on the pharmaceutical distribution side, our ability to provide real-time data and analytics has helped facilitate actionable channel solutions and awareness for commercial and government stakeholders. at world courier, our team has been helping manufacture partners navigate the complexity of moving materials across the globe with limited global air traffic while also enabling innovation with clinical trials in at-home settings. we believe the strength of amerisourcebergen's diverse portfolio, combined with our dynamic operating agility, have demonstrated our businesses resilience and our long-standing commitment to robust business continuity plan and investments. our stakeholders now have an even greater appreciation for our vital role in the supply chain and in the healthcare system overall.
i am especially proud of the inspiration and diligent efforts of our associates. we have supported our customers with increased collaboration and innovative solutions, ensuring that they're able to meet patient needs, even if they're adapted to the new environment. i would now like to comment on some of the recent developments regarding the potential global framework for opioid litigation resolution. we have made significant progress in the fourth quarter toward reaching a potential settlement to resolve our opioid lawsuits. as a result, the company determined it was appropriate to accrue for this potential settlement based on a framework that we think is workable for all the related parties. advanced discussions are ongoing, and we are not able to comment easily on the matter at this time. we take comfort from our belief that settlement fines will be used in support of initiatives to combat the opioid epidemic, including treatment, rehabilitation, mental health and other important efforts. as you all know, we have been consistent in stating our desire to be a part of the solution to address the enormity of the opioid challenge. we always have and will continue to take our role of supply chain seriously and continue to work diligently and alongside our industry partners and government and state agencies to combat drug diversion. we will also continue to support real solutions to help address the crisis in the communities we serve, work and core power them. just to reiterate, we believe that this is an important step toward resolution, which would allow our business and our people to focus on performing our vital role in the healthcare system, which has been clearly on display during the covid-19 pandemic. looking ahead, amerisourcebergen enters fiscal 2021 with strong momentum as our key differentiators continue to provide a platform for value creation for all our stakeholders. first, we have the best customer base in the industry, with a balanced portfolio of key end customers across all the segments in which we operate.
with our diverse and extensive customer base, amerisourcebergen is well positioned to support patient access wherever a prescription is needed. today, i would like to highlight our good neighbor pharmacy network of independent pharmacies. in september, we held our first virtual thoughtspot. our annual good neighbor pharmacy conference and trade show. throughout thoughtspot, i was implied by the unwavering commitment that our gmp pharmacies had maintained with their patients and communities. they've gone above and beyond with the entrepreneurial spirit and adapted to the pandemic environment with innovations, such as leveraging social media, to engage with their patients, making and distributing hand sanitizers to all supply base and adapting to enable drive-through prescriptions. we shared this purpose-driven mindset of our gmp pharmacies and will continue to support all of our customers by understanding their needs, delivering a seamless experience and deepening our relationship with them. second, we continue to involve our amerisourcebergen's unparalleled leading specialty franchise. enhanced by the value-added services we provide, our specialty physician services business has the strongest portfolio of service and customer relationships in the industry. our position in the market enables us to capitalize on emerging trends, such as the rise of biosimilars, where we saw better-than-expected adoption and growth this year and which has become a meaningful and growing part of our business. a recent iqvia report focused on biosimilars highlighted the strong utilization trends, expect an overall growth for biosimilars and a corresponding savings that they will create for the healthcare system.
the growth of biosimilars is a long-term driver for amerisourcebergen as we are able to provide valuable commercialization services upstream to manufacturers and support access downstream to community-based providers. specialty has been an important driver of amerisourcebergen's growth over the last few years. and in fiscal 2021, we are focused on furthering our value proposition and supporting our specialty physician customer base by continuing to invest in technology, innovation and data and analytics solutions. our ability to continuously innovate is our third differentiator. we embrace advanced technologies to enable real-time communication and transparency for our partners. our sourcing and distribution teams integrate their commercial expertise with our data and analytics capabilities to provide actionable channel insights to our provider and manufacture partners and government stakeholders. during this week, amerisourcebergen was selected by the department of health and human services to store, manage and distribute pharmaceuticals for the strategic national stockpile. we take great pride in being chosen to support the government in their planned pharmaceutical stockpile activity. amerisourcebergen is a trusted data provider in the pharmaceutical supply chain, with stakeholders across the health system used to enable data-driven solutions to new and existing challenges. we also continue to solidify our partnerships to become even more efficient and to serve our customers with greater speed, efficiency and data capabilities.
having an innovative mindset means that not only do we seek creative ways to solve problems, but also that we are decisive and nimble to apply our capabilities. during the pandemic, for example, we quickly launched telehealth tools, face-to-face virtual platforms and other technology solutions helping providers across our customer spectrum from specialty position services to mwi animal health adapt to the new environment. amerisourcebergen remains solutions-oriented and committed to providing value-added innovations and services so that our customers can take advantage of the opportunities available in this rapidly evolving market. finally, turning to our fourth differentiator. we have a history of successful corporate stewardship. on the financial side, we have maintained our thoughtful and strategic approach to capital deployment with a focus on value creation and maintaining financial strength. this fiscal year, we invested $370 million in the business through capital expenditures, while at the same time returning more than $760 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. on the key community side, we are guided by our purpose. we engaged our associates to operate in a sustainable and responsible manner and support healthy and resilient communities where we live and work. we are making positive improvements for the environment and in our communities. in the last year, we have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 5%. earlier, i mentioned the associate satisfaction with our covid response. we have also seen a marked improvement in engagement on topics of personal importance, such as diversity and inclusion.
membership in our employee resource groups, for example, has increased by more than 40% year-over-year. in addition, inspired by our recent conversations with our associates around social injustice and racial inequity, we have exciting plans for more diversity and inclusion initiatives in the coming year. just this week, we appointed a new chief diversity and inclusion officer, and we look forward to working with him to continue our progress and focus in this important area. there's value generated by the power of difference. and we believe that fostering an environment that embraces diversity, inclusion and addressing unconscious bias advances our purpose and our culture making us an even better amerisourcebergen. as we enter fiscal 2021, the evolving healthcare landscape continues to offer opportunities for amerisourcebergen to leverage our strengths and capitalize on our unique position in the market. we are focused on several key adjacencies supporting growth across the enterprise by enhancing our market-leading specialty portfolio of innovative customer-centric services and solutions and deepening our strong strategic partnerships; furthering our execution excellence by reinforcing our ability to deliver best-in-class service and efficiency; three, continuing to strengthen our associates' experience with a conservative effort to advance our talent and culture; and fourth, evolving our technology and communications to further the interoperability of our businesses and to become an even more unified amerisourcebergen.
most of all, we remain purpose-driven and well positioned to create significant stakeholder value. our businesses and teams rose to the challenges of the year and went above and beyond to deliver support and results for our customers and their patients. thank you to our associates for their dedication, inspirational efforts and execution and for remaining united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. now i will turn the call over to jim for a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results and to provide fiscal 2021 guidance. jim?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, steve, and good morning, everyone. for amerisourcebergen, fiscal 2020 was a year of resilience made possible by the diligent execution of associates across our organization, enhanced by the exceptional performance they delivered across our businesses. and following our purpose, our associates adapted and innovated to meet the needs of our customers and their patients. our team strengthened our relationships with partners, both upstream and down, focusing on providing transparency and solutions at a time they needed it most. amerisourcebergen's long history of internal investment helps support this important work and enabled us to establish robust business continuity plans, which utilized our efficient and modernized distribution network and our strong it infrastructure. i take great pride in being part of such a purpose-driven company and have been humbled by the results that our teams have delivered. before i delve into these results, please note that my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-gaap financial results unless otherwise stated. growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year period. for a discussion of our gaap results, please refer to our earnings release, which was published earlier today. moving now to our fourth quarter results.
we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted eps of $1.89, an increase of 17%, primarily due to higher operating income. our consolidated revenue was $49.2 billion, up 8%, driven by solid revenue growth in both the pharmaceutical distribution services segment and other, which includes our global commercialization services & animal health group of businesses. gross profit increased 6% to $1.3 billion, driven by gross profit growth in each operating segment resulting from higher revenue. consolidated operating income was $530 million, up $74 million or 16%, driven by the performance of both the pharmaceutical distribution services segment and our global commercialization services & animal health group. moving now to income taxes. our income tax rate was 21.7% due to an unfavorable discrete item, up from 19.6% in the prior year quarter, which included a favorable discrete item. our adjusted diluted share count increased by 3.3 million shares or 2% to 206.4 million shares driven by opportunistic share repurchases earlier in the fiscal year, notably when the share price came under pressure with the market in the month of march. for the year, we repurchased $420 million of our shares. in fiscal 2020, as steve mentioned, amerisourcebergen returned over $760 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.
and this morning, we also announced that the company's board of directors approved a dividend increase of 5%. this completes the review of our consolidated results. now i'll cover our segment results. beginning with pharmaceutical distribution services. segment revenue was $47 billion, up 8%. the segment continues to benefit from strong specialty product sales, including growth in specialty physician services as well as overall customer growth, particularly with some of our larger customers. fourth quarter revenue growth benefited from an easier comparison to the prior year quarter. in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, our large mail order pharmacy customer had already seemed volume from one of their large health plans roll off and we had not yet onboarded the customer's post-merger incremental volume. normalizing for the comparison, revenue growth would still have been at the upper end of the mid-single-digit range. segment operating income increased about 15% to $426 million. as a reminder, the segment's operating income had an $18 million tailwind due to the exit of the pharmedium business. in addition, as we called out back in may, we established an incremental bad debt reserve in the march quarter related to the onset of covid-19. the incremental reserve was not related to any specific customers but due to a point-in-time analysis of potential receivables risk.
as a result of the continued financial resilience of our customers, we determined that it was appropriate to reverse a significant portion of this bad debt reserve. if you were to back out the tailwind from the pharmedium exit and the benefit from the bad debt reversal, segment operating income growth in the quarter would have been more in line with segment revenue growth. i will now turn to the other segment, which includes businesses that focus on global commercialization services & animal health, including world courier, amerisourcebergen consulting and mwi animal health. in the quarter, total revenue was $2 billion, up 11% primarily due to growth at mwi and world courier, but also reflecting growth across the group. mwi's revenue grew 8%, driven by double-digit growth in the companion animal business as well as growth in the production animal business. the global commercialization services group, which includes world courier and amerisourcebergen consulting businesses, had revenue growth in the mid-teens. the other segment had operating income of $105 million, an increase of 20%. world courier continued its exceptional performance in the quarter. this completes the review of our segment results for the quarter. before i turn to our full year fiscal 2020 results, i want to take a moment to discuss our expense accrual in connection with opioid lawsuits. in the fourth quarter, we recorded a gaap pre-tax charge of $6.6 billion, which is excluded from our adjusted non-gaap results.
the company is in advanced discussions, which are ongoing, to reach a global settlement to resolve cases currently filed and that could be filed in the future by states, counties, municipalities and other governmental entities covered by the settlement. the decision to record the charge is due to the significant progress made during the fourth fiscal quarter toward reaching a potential settlement and our determination that a loss is now probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. the global settlement remains subject to contingencies that could impact whether the parties ultimately decide to move forward. due to the ongoing work toward settlement, we are unable to comment further on these matters at this time. now i will turn to our full year fiscal 2020 performance. our consolidated revenue was $189.9 billion, up 6%, driven by growth across our broad portfolio of businesses, particularly in specialty physician services and also for our largest customers, walgreens and express scripts. consolidated operating income grew 7% for the year to $2.2 billion, while our operating margin increased two basis points. as it relates to operating expenses, we did experience a favorable impact from lower-than-expected corporate administrative costs, which resulted in a modest expense growth for the year. pharmaceutical distribution segment operating income grew 8% and global commercialization services & animal health had operating income growth of 5%.
from a segment perspective, we saw growth across our businesses and pharmaceutical distribution. this segment continues to benefit from our strategic relationships in each customer segment and strong performance in specialty physician services where innovation and demographics continue to be organic growth drivers. in addition, we had notable contribution from biosimilar utilization in fiscal 2020 as we saw better-than-expected uptake of biosimilars, particularly in oncology. in other, world courier continues to differentiate itself with key solutions in a complex world for global specialty logistics. our manufacturer partners are leveraging our capabilities to enable at-home clinical trials and support treatment accessibility through world courier. the investment we have made over the last few years have positioned our world courier business to offer best-in-class solutions for our manufacturer customers along with the expertise and capabilities needed to help navigate an increasingly complex environment for global specialty logistics. the adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 20.8% and relatively consistent to 20.6% in the prior fiscal year. turning now to eps. our full year adjusted diluted eps increased 11% to $7.90 primarily due to the resilience and outstanding execution throughout our businesses that enabled us to deliver strong operating income growth. our eps also benefited from lower net interest expense and a lower share count with share count down by 2%. adjusted free cash flow for the year was $1.9 billion higher than expected primarily due to timing of customer and supplier payments.
the timing benefit helps fiscal 2020 adjusted free cash flow and results in slightly lower adjusted free cash flow expectations for fiscal 2021, which we expect to be $1.5 billion. again, i am proud of the ways our associates and teams have executed and adapted to deliver strong fiscal 2020 results. as we enter fiscal 2021, we have strong momentum and visibility to continue our growth trajectory in both of our operating segments. before detailing our guidance, i will note that our working assumption for pharmaceutical pricing in fiscal 2021 is that brand inflation and generic deflation rates will each be similar to what was experienced in fiscal 2020. turning now to discuss our fiscal 2021 financial guidance. as a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a gaap basis, so all of the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-gaap basis. starting with revenue. we expect consolidated revenue growth in the mid-single-digit percent range. next, operating expenses. we expect consolidated operating expenses to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range. we do not expect the same level of favorability from lower corporate and administrative costs experienced in fiscal 2020 to repeat. understanding the importance of expense management, we will certainly be thoughtful in trying to have operating expense growth in the lower part of that mid-single-digit percent range. however, in fiscal 2021, we will continue to be diligent in protecting our associates and thoughtful on how we utilize continued remote work for our associates that are not on the frontline.
regarding operating income, we expect for operating income to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range, with mid-single-digit percent growth expected for both of our operating segments. in pharmaceutical distribution services, we continue to capitalize on our leadership in specialty distribution, particularly specialty physician services and benefit from our key anchor customer relationships across pharmaceutical distribution. as it relates to the impact from exiting pharmedium, we will experience a $20 million operating income tailwind in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as we left the last quarter in our financials prior to the pharmedium exit. moving now to other. the global commercialization services & animal health group is expected to continue its positive trajectory in fiscal 2021 supported by continued execution from mwi, world courier and our businesses within consulting as the businesses continue supporting our commercial partners and successfully traversing the covid-19 landscape. turning now to our consolidated tax rate expectation. our guidance assumes a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 22%. regarding share count, as a reminder, we do not include unidentified capital allocation in our guidance. our fiscal 2021 guidance assumes that we finish the year between 206 million and 207 million weighted average shares outstanding. as a result of these expectations, we are guiding our fiscal 2021 adjusted eps to be in the range of $8.20 to $8.45, reflecting growth of 4% to 7%.
finally, turning to capital expenditures and cash flow expectations. first, capex is expected to be about $400 million. we have many projects in place, and there is no one project driving our capital expenditure, rather they have a shared focus on supporting growth, increasing efficiency for enhancing our commercial and compliance capabilities. amerisourcebergen's balanced approach to capital deployment, which prioritizes internal investment is an important commercial and financial differentiator for us. now for adjusted free cash flow. we expect our adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2021 to be approximately $1.5 billion. as i mentioned earlier, the timing benefit that helped fiscal 2020 cash flow to be higher than expected has an offsetting impact on fiscal 2021. in closing, we have seen firsthand this year how valuable amerisourcebergen's purpose-driven, talent and culture are to delivering differentiated value to all our stakeholders. drawn upon our adaptability, resilience, openness and dedication as professionals, we continue to deliver for all our partners and come together as individuals to embrace our differences. i am confident that we are furthering our talent and culture as we become an even more unified amerisourcebergen. the fundamentals of our business remain strong as we continue to benefit from our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, key partnerships and leadership in specialty. amerisourcebergen is well positioned to continue to create long-term shareholder value and deliver on our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. now i will turn the call back over to steve for some final remarks. steve?
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, jim. before we open the call up for questions, i would like to share my reflections on a year that has made a lasting impact on our lives. 2020 has been a year of uncertainty and challenge for communities across the globe. during this time, amerisourcebergen has put the needs of our associates, our customers and our communities first, from planning safe ways to work to ensuring the delivery of live-saving medication and to enabling our profits to bring relief to communities from california to nevada. through our purpose, scale and expertise, we have ensured that our partners have had the connectivity, capability and data needed to think, plan and act effectively. as we work to ensure that patient needs were met across our footprint, we recognized that we were only able to do so because of the resilience of our business, which has been reinforced by our focus on pharmaceuticals, our diverse portfolio of customers and businesses, our differentiated customer experience and our leadership in specialty. as i've said for the last few months, i've never been prouder to be a part of amerisourcebergen. i've been humbled by the conviction, dedication, inspirational efforts and professional execution carried out by our associates. their teamwork and passion have truly enabled us to deliver on our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. i remain incredibly proud of the work that our associates are undertaking across all areas of our business. this concludes our prepared remarks for today. now i'll turn the call over to our operator to begin the q&a session. operator?

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question today comes from glen santangelo of guggenheim securities. please go ahead.
glen santangelo -- guggenheim -- analyst
yeah, thanks. good morning and thanks for taking my question. jim, i just want to follow-up with you on the guidance. it's kind of hard to reconcile all the moving pieces in the fiscal '21 guidance. you've raised the guidance last month when the company announced the alliance healthcare acquisition and now you're raising it again today with these better than expected 1q results. so could you maybe help us think about, maybe what has changed from the beginning of the fiscal year, taking into consideration some of the incremental covid related benefits you called out in the release and your prepared remarks? thanks.
james cleary -- chief financial officer
glen, thanks a lot for the question. yeah, i'd be happy to talk about guidance in some of the moving pieces. and first of all, i'll say that, of course, it's early in our year and at this stage, after the completion of our first fiscal quarter, we've done a healthy increase in guidance versus our original guidance in november, we're up $0.20 at the lower end of guidance and $0.15 at the higher end of guidance. and this is really due to the fact that we're seeing positive trends across our businesses and really strong execution across the business, both in pharmaceutical distribution and in commercialization & animal health.
and some of the positive trends that we're continuing to see in pharmaceutical distribution include continued very good performance in specialty physician services, very strong performance also in health systems including the distribution of covid treatments. we're seeing strong biosimilar growth in q1 in both specialty physician services and in health systems and very good growth at some of our largest customers and broadly across our businesses. and then in commercialization services & animal health, we're seeing strong growth in mwi and world courier with continued positive trends. and so as we think about guidance beyond these, overall positive trends that i mentioned just now in my prepared remarks. there are also some noteworthy moving pieces to call out related first of all to the exit of pharmedium. we had our final tailwind in q1, a $20 million tailwind related to the exit of pharmedium in q1, which of course doesn't repeat in future quarters.
we also had, which i mentioned in my prepared remarks, the inventory writedown recovery in q1. that was a $10 million benefit to gp in q1, which of course doesn't repeat in future quarters. and then also in q2, we begin to lap [phonetic] significant year-over-year growth rates related to biosimilar utilization. and so the contribution to operating income will continue to grow from biosimilars, but not at the same rates we saw in the last three quarters of fiscal '20 or in the first quarter of fiscal '21. and then also, a key point with regard to our guidance assumptions -- our guidance assumes that our sales of covid therapies will be significantly lower for the balance of the year than they were in the first quarter, particularly during the second half of the fiscal year. regarding opex, we're starting to compare to the part of the fiscal year that had notably low expenses, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year. and as you recall, we called that in fiscal '20, particularly in the back half of the year that last year we benefited from lower opex growth associated with lower healthcare costs and travel.
and then finally, glen, there is couple things below the operating income line. we assume in our guidance that the acquisition debt for the alliance acquisition is issued a few months before closing the acquisition and we have associated carrying costs. and then also importantly, there is no share repurchases in our guidance as we prepare for the acquisition. so, overall, i'd say that we feel very good about the increase in guidance of fundamentals and our business are strong as evidenced by the excellent q1 results. i mean, we've done a good increase in guidance, particularly given the fact that it's early in the fiscal year.
operator
the next question comes from eric coldwell of baird. please go ahead.
eric coldwell -- baird -- analyst
thanks. jim, first before my question, i just have to say you raised guidance here for the second time in a month and then you tell us seven things that are headwinds. so i'm sure the underlying performance has to be pretty fantastic if that's the case or at least headwinds for the rest of the year, i guess we would call it. i'm really interested -- you've talked a lot about patient access and manufacturer services and i think in the past, the street perhaps thought that was maybe a bit more lip service than it really is and we're seeing it with these $2 billion revenue beat in a quarter with low scripts and low cough-cold flu season. you've talked a lot about covid therapies and i know you've had several exclusive deals with manufacturers. i'm curious if you could possibly quantify the revenue impact and maybe even the margin impact if you're willing to go that far on the antiviral and antibody distribution to health systems that you've highlighted a few times today?
james cleary -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure, absolutely. first of all, thank you for your positive comments on the quarter. you had the fundamentals of our business and the execution and the performance of our businesses have been very strong. with regard to the impact of covid therapies, approximately $0.12 of eps in the first quarter is due to the net impact of covid and this reflects the important work we're doing distributing covid therapies. and it also includes elevated expenses associated with things like associate bonuses for frontline associates, kind of cleaning costs, a payroll ramp which represents things like quarantine over time and temporary health. and that the expenses that i just described were a couple pennies during the quarter and are included in the $0.12 of net benefit to eps during the quarter that i just mentioned. and i think one important need to call out is that our guidance does assume that our sales of covid therapies will be significantly lower for the balance of the year, particularly in the second half of the year. but in summary, the net benefit during the quarter was $0.12 of eps.
operator
our next question comes from lisa gill of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
lisa gill -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi, thanks very much and good morning. great quarter as well. and as we think about just a couple of moving parts, jim, i just want to understand the renewed relationship with walgreens. so generally when you have a contract that renews and you extend the length, you give up some amount of pricing or give something else up. is there anything attached to this new extended relationship with walgreens as we think about what the margin structure of the overall business will look like going forward would be my first question? and then secondly, i just want to understand underlying utilization trends. you talked about going into the march quarter that there were some things that were pulled forward a year ago, but what if you stay in here in the first month of the march quarter around [technical issues] and how do we think about cough, cold and flu impacts on your business?
steve collis -- chief executive officer
hi lisa, thanks for your comments. i'll take the first question on. i know i won't get a question if i don't answer this given all the guidance, but i just think we should go back to the 2013 deal and it was really a remarkable deal that in anyway changed our industry we've had, of course, with a key feature that, that was a big change in our industry and we were able to get much more competitive pricing for generics. but also the way we structure the distribution agreement with taking on the generics of walgreens, which i think has been a terrific benefit to not only walgreens, but to ourselves and our scale and leverage and also brought again more competitive pricing to our customers. so the way we set that up was really brilliant i think, and very -- in simplification of time. and the agreement had self-regulating mechanisms and it's still working through 2029, which this next phase of our contract will go through. we took into account changes and brand mix, many areas like that. so we didn't really have to make the adjustments because of the market mechanisms already in place.
and then the second part of your question, i believe, jim has the answer.
james cleary -- chief financial officer
yeah. and the second part of the question was on utilization and i will say on the -- with regard to the walgreens relationship, we are really excited also about expanding the agreement and all the initiatives that we're going to be working on with walgreens with regard to growth and efficiency around things like sourcing, logistics and distribution and the potential synergies that we have targeted there. and then on utilization, we aren't really calling out anything on january at this point. we're still in the first few days of february. but i'll just comment then on the first quarter -- in the first quarter of the year. we really saw very strong fundamental trends throughout our businesses, many of which we talked about in the prepared remarks. and that's what i'm really focused on and we really focused on as a company as the sales data and sales trends in our businesses. and probably given our strength in specialty, clearly we've seen strong trends in specialty physician services and strong trends in our health systems. but i'll also say just broadly across our businesses, we saw good volume and profitability trends across our businesses in both pharmaceutical distribution and our global commercialization services & animal health businesses.
steve collis -- chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
your next question comes from robert jones of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
unidentified participant
hey, this is kevin on for bob this morning. thanks for taking the questions. i just wanted to -- in the other segment, growth is obviously pretty strong and are coming around like 17%, i think year-over-year. i know you guys talked about the overall covid impact at bergen [phonetic]. wanted to know if any of that could be attributed to the other segment? and then just, as we're looking out over the balance of the year, guidance is calling for growth somewhere south of that. i know you have somewhat easy comp in fiscal 3q. so anything just on the cadence over the course of the year and what might drive that sequential deceleration would be helpful?
james cleary -- chief financial officer
sure. so with regard to the other segment, yeah, we did have a very strong quarter with revenues up 11%, operating income up 16%. and you will see depths about the impact of covid on the other segment. and really, call it, probably the one thing i'll call out is that it's been an opportunity for world courier really to prove its value to manufacture partners with things like direct to patient capability and with things like just our best-in-class solutions being able to help manufacturers navigate the complex environment for global logistics that has become more complex in the covid environment. and so covid has enabled world courier to really show its value. and then, i think, the second part of your question had to do with the guidance. and we've really kind of gotten through of guidance in prepared remarks and the first question. but i guess you talked about cadence and so the one thing that i reemphasize is that we look at cadence for the year, we had a particularly strong quarter in the march quarter of fiscal '20 as there was a pull forward of sales during the month of march with the onset of covid and so that makes the march quarter '21 a little bit tougher comp.
operator
next question comes from ricky goldwasser of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, hi. good morning and congrats on the quarter. so thinking about kind of vaccine, i understand that you're doing kind of like outside the u.s., not yet in the u.s. but how do you think the market is going to evolve and what could be the opportunities for you especially as i think we're waiting for the j&j vaccine approval that could change some of the access point in the marketplace? so how do you think about your potential role there?
steve collis -- chief executive officer
yeah, hi, ricky. thanks for the question. so, i actually was on a couple of calls. i heard dr. fauci speak last time. we had dr. gottlieb as a guest in our thinklive commercialization summit. and, of course, we are all vaccinated on this. and i do believe that the u.s. is going to get tremendous amount of supply in the next couple of months and the pharmaceutical distribution is highly efficient and sophisticated kind of wrestle [phonetic] between people point to any impediment to vaccination as distribution and it's just such a misnomer. and we believe that people get -- that patients -- the supply chain will not be a problem, as you know the u.s. has gotten appropriate infrastructure to ensure accurate and timely delivery. i also do appreciate that in the u.s., we've seen that this really enhances a lot of distribution and supply chain as -- that a whole covid pandemic has really slows the importance and we like to talk about companies like amerisourcebergen being the visible pillar of innovation. and i think that's very true without us that getting the products to market and the access that we talk about so much, has been -- would not be as efficient as it is.
we are doing the distribution in canada. of course, canada is sourcing the product from europe. we are proud of that role. and also proud that our world courier business is doing some very complex logistics. we actually heard again at the thinklive summit a harrowing story of norway where we had to [indecipherable] to get some products to remote island before that expire. so there is terrific stories. i'm sure that everyone involved in this unique logistics and distribution challenges has got great stories to tell. moreover, i would just say our future, alliance company, and of course we will let them talk about it. it is also playing a role in vaccine distribution. so abc is well positioned to be an essential provider for logistics and distribution. thanks.
operator
the next question is from eric percher of nephron research. please go ahead.
eric percher -- nephron research -- analyst
thank you. steve, maybe i'll ask you for some insight on distribution to the hospital. has the growth been dominated by the gilead and lily products where you had talked about exclusives publicly? are you seeing additional products? and i think it hard -- it's hard to track product demand in the hospital channel, but we certainly can track the number of hospitalizations for covid, so is this been more therapies adopted or has it been simply about the number of hospitalized?
steve collis -- chief executive officer
no, it's -- there have been about five or six ua products been at trial [phonetic], and we are playing a prominent role in almost all of them because of the unique capabilities that amerisourcebergen has on data reporting, we have every hospital in the u.s. just about registered as a customer and the licensing. and then just stability with limited supply in unprecedented demand and really waves of demand to quota; a term that our competitor used a lot non-linear demand. so it's just based on patient inputs. and so it's been quite extraordinary the role that we play and you will see that, of course, fluctuate from quarter to quarter and jim has spent a lot of time explaining that. but the therapies are important and we hope that there won't be as much in demand as they were in the first quarter. so, thanks.
operator
the next question is from george hill of deutsche bank. please go ahead.
unidentified participant
hi, this is charlotte [phonetic] on for george. thanks for taking my question. can you expand more on what drove the gross profit margin expansion in the core drug segment? given the growth in specialty and branded generic conversions, we would have expected gross margin expansion, so if you could just provide any color there?
james cleary -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. yeah, we did see very good margin performance during the quarter. i mean, as i said, margins were up 15% or 12 basis points. and let me kind of go through some of the things that drove it. one was increased specialty product sales that both specialty physician services and health systems, really in both specialty physician services and health systems that included biosimilars, but as we talked a lot about in health systems that also included covid-19 treatments. and so really kind of both that was one of the drivers of our increased gross margin during the quarter. and we continue to see the positive trends in biosimilars. but, of course, as we commented on, we began to see significant utilization in biosimilars in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. i mean, we start to lap that significant year-over-year comparison difference now and so we'll continue to see growth in biosimilars, but perhaps at a lower rate.
and other things that helped our margin, getting back to your question, we are seeing growth overall in our higher margin businesses, so specialty physician services. we talked about mwi and world courier are also higher margin businesses. growth in those higher margin businesses is adding to our gross profit. and then the other thing that i called out is exiting the pharmedium business helped our gross profit, about half of the benefit was in gp and the other half in opex, so that helped our gross profit. and then the reversal of the inventory writedown reserve that i mentioned that also helped our gross profit during the quarter. so, there were a number of different things, but really the performance of our businesses was excellent and the performance of our higher margin businesses was particularly strong during the quarter.
operator
the next question is from charles rhyee of cowen. please go ahead.
james auh -- cowen -- analyst
hi, this is james on for charles. you've noted strong performance in mwi and world courier, which drove other operating profit growth. but can you talk more about, maybe how the consulting services business is performing in the quarter and some of the dynamics that you're seeing in that business?
james cleary -- chief financial officer
yeah. i think our consulting business continues to perform well as an important part of our business, our lash business and our extensive [phonetic] business. at the lash business, for instance, we're really kind of fully into rolling out fusion and rolling out fusion is going well and we view that to be a nice competitive advantage for us. and so our consulting businesses are very important businesses to us, provide really important manufacture services. i think that they will have good synergies with some of alliance's manufacturer services business. so we look forward to that collaboration. and so overall performance there is as expected and continues to be super important part of the company, just didn't grow as fast during the quarter is the mwi and world courier businesses.
steve collis -- chief executive officer
yeah. and as i've said, the thinklive commercialization summit was held this week, it's the first virtual one. and really we took our core businesses and focused on emerging trends like cell and gene therapies, access and reimbursement issues, copay accumulators, various issues that [indecipherable] manufacturers minds. and i have to tell you, i had to stop this thing to -- i had to drag myself away from this thing because it was such compelling content than we were able to provide. we have such excellent people that understand the manufacture side and understand that the commercialization process, product lifecycles, emerging trends on innovation, it was really just -- i couldn't have been more proud of the way that our people showed up in this conference and i look forward to seeing the rest of it because really amerisourcebergen's expertise -- you think of the work that world courier does, it's remarkably complex and we do it so well and we have such outstanding people and we've displayed leadership in this area for many years as we have it at lash and so many of our other commercialization businesses. so thanks for the question.

the next question is from steven valiquette of barclays. please go ahead.
steven valiquette -- barclays -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning, everyone. so i just wanted to check the box just on the brand pricing and generic pricing in early calendar '21. i'm guessing that brand pricing maybe has been in line with our expectations. on the generic side, a little bit of a bump up in actual price increase activity, but curious if that's something that has called your attention or you would also characterize just overall generic pricing is kind of in line with your prior view. just little more color there would be great. thanks.
james cleary -- chief financial officer
yeah. we just say for both in line with our expectations, brand and generic pricing are trending in line with the original expectations we had for the year. you asked about generics. we saw that generic deflation moderated in fiscal 2020 and there was a levelling off at the end of the fourth quarter, but still in general range that we experienced throughout the year. and we're expecting a similar levels of generic deflation in '21 that we saw in 2020. so, as i said, both are trending in line with our expectations.

steve collis -- chief executive officer
thank you, bennett and good morning to everyone on the call. amerisourcebergen has had a strong start to our fiscal '21 year. we delivered exceptional results driven by differentiated commercial solutions with revenues of $52.5 billion for the first fiscal quarter, representing growth of 10% year-over-year and our adjusted eps increasing 24% versus the prior year quarter.
building upon our businesses resilience, our teams executed and leveraged our capabilities to create value throughout the supply chain. our purpose driven culture continues to empower our associates to think, plan and act decisively to support all of our partners and to facilitate patient access to critical medical treatments. in addition to these results, as we announced in january, we entered into a strategic transaction with walgreens boots alliance to acquire the majority with large healthcare business and extend and expand our existing distribution agreement. as we have said, these agreements are part of the next evolution of enhancing amerisourcebergen's ability to deliver innovative solutions for our partners, further building on our platform to deliver key distribution capabilities and value-added services to support patient access in new geographies.
amerisourcebergen's ongoing focus on patient access means providing innovative services and solutions to support our manufacturer partners and provide customers with our differentiated value proposition. world courier, for example, is highly sought after for it's expertise in helping manufacturer partners navigate complexities on a global scale. during the pandemic, world courier's proven track record as an international leader in specialty logistics have enabled us to support our customers worldwide against the backdrop of changing local restrictions, limited air traffic and additional operational challenges. we have been able to facilitate direct to patient services and global clinical trials at a time when both demand and complexity for these services was understandably at its peak.
similarly, we continue to support patient access to vital treatments for covid-19. thanks to our robust suite of specialty distribution capabilities and our deep industry expertise, we are uniquely positioned to support our public and private partners and amerisourcebergen is both honored and proud to be able to be part of the solution to help them preserve public health. in the u.s., we continue to be the distributor of antiviral and antibody therapies, which are playing an increasingly important role as more and more hospitalized patients are receiving these treatments to help them recover from covid-19. in canada, our innomar business is partnering with fedex as the primary distributor for the covid vaccine. our team at innomar is safety and security storing the vaccines in the storage facilities across canada and packaging them to support the temperature requirements specified by the manufacturer.
amerisourcebergen's scale and expertise in specialty as well as our culture of delivering collaborative and innovative solutions, enabled this important work. we have spent years building on and enhancing our leadership, especially distribution. this continued investment in and focus on an important part of the pharmaceutical market continues to benefit both amerisourcebergen and our partners. and over the last several months, the ability of our sourcing and commercial teams to leverage our expertise and data analytics capability is foundational to our facility to play an important role in providing the specialty distribution solutions for covid related treatments. we deliver a clear and differentiated value proposition for our partners in the u.s. healthcare system and continue to focus on building on our strengths in specialty distribution as those capabilities continue to be even more important to all our customers.
amerisourcebergen's strong portfolio of customers is another important differentiator for us as it is an important driver of growth across our businesses. over the years, amerisourcebergen has made it a priority to have long-term strategic relationships with manufacturers and providers that embrace and appreciate collaboration. as we announced last month, we have agreed to strengthen our strategic partnership with walgreens by extending and expanding our commercial agreements. this extended and expanded partnership in the u.s. will allow us to create incremental growth and efficiency opportunities, enabling each of our enterprises to better serve our respective customers.
teams from both our companies have already identified new opportunities for enhanced growth and efficiency in the areas of logistics, transportation and distribution. as we continue to realize the improved capabilities derived from this partnership, these initiatives will enhance our ability to create differentiated value for all of amerisourcebergen's customers. one customer group, for whom we have consistently created new incremental value, is our independent pharmacy customers including our more than 5,000 good neighbor pharmacy and elevate provider network members. these independent pharmacies provide critical care for their communities and their fearlessness and adaptability as entrepreneurs have enabled them to rise to the challenges of the pandemic. we are proud to have been able to support them with the tools they have needed to connect with their patients and keep them healthy. we look forward to working as a network administrator on behalf of qualified and eligible pharmacy network partners to support vaccination efforts in their communities when we enter the broader inoculation phase here in the united states.
in the animal health segment, our mwi business has moved swiftly to deliver innovative solutions to help our customer succeed in the current environment. these include ensuring that mwi associates are accessible to our customers 24/7 and bolstering our customers' abilities to offer virtual services to a pet caring clients including innovative client communication solutions and home delivery services of quality medications and pet care products. amerisourcebergen's long-term focus on strong customer relationships, leadership in specialty distribution and manufacturing services and our continued ability to support innovation, has solidified our market leadership and business strength over the years. from this position of strength, we recently took a significant step to power the next evolution of enhancing our ability to provide innovative and global healthcare solutions.
as we announced last month, we've entered into a strategic agreement with walgreens boots alliance to acquire the majority of it's alliance healthcare business. through this acquisition, we will extend our distribution capability into key new markets; add in depth, breadth and reach, and strengthening our global platform of manufacturer and other value-added services. with expanded scale and added services, our combined business will be able to better support pharmaceutical innovation through a global footprint of broad leadership and local expertise, which further positions amerisourcebergen as the partner of choice. the pandemic has heightened both our public and private partners' awareness of the value of a strong and capable pharmaceutical supply chain and alliance healthcare better positions amerisourcebergen to meet its increasingly global nature as well.
as our global footprint expands, so do the importance of corporate stewardship, amerisourcebergen understand and appreciate the value of being a responsible enterprise and our recent initiatives, including continue to advance our talent and culture, accelerating workforce diversity inclusion and further investing in and supporting our associates. we remain vigilant in our efforts to protect the safety and well-being of our associates as the covid waves effect various regions and teams and the importance of the work we're doing remain unwavering. driven by our purpose, we are maintaining our enhanced protection and safety protocols and appropriately compensating frontline associates. remote work is still the prevailing policy for all suitable roles, we are watching the situation closely as i'm sure all of you are doing and we'll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates.
underscoring our efforts to support and empower our associates around the world, amerisourcebergen was recently certified as a great place to work company following the survey of employees around the world. the survey reveals that our associates reported a consistently positive experience with peers among leaders and in job responsibilities. we saw high scores for all indicators and our overall score was significantly higher in the typical u.s. based company. additionally, for the fourth year in a row, the human rights campaign has recognize amerisourcebergen as a best place to work for lgbtq equality awarding us a perfect score on the corporate equality index due to our non-discrimination policies, equitable benefits, support of an inclusive culture and focus on corporate social responsibility. amerisourcebergen recognizes the business and personal importance of having a culture that is inclusive and equitable regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity and for veterans and people with disabilities as well.
to this end, we are accelerating our diversity and inclusion strategy to become an even more diverse and equitable company. over the past months, we have conducted a comprehensive d&i organizational assessment, initiated a global d&i strategy to support among measured and engaged workforce, formed a d&i council led by a senior c-suite executive and signed the ceo pledge for diversity and inclusion, which is a commitment to increased diversity and support more inclusive work environments. amerisourcebergen strives to ensure that our associates feels a part of a fare inclusive and transparent workplace. a diverse inclusive and equitable culture is a proven enhancer of business value and these initiatives will ensure that we have the right programs and tools in place in the short term, so we can become a leader in this area in the longer term.
our success in advancing our progressive culture, one that is fuelled by the passion pride and dedication of our purpose driven associates, is visually embodied by our new brand, which we unveiled last week. the new brand embodies a spirit of innovation for the design that is energizing, confident and inspiring, while also displaying our unity as an enterprise when we go to market. as we continue to move our business forward, we remain committed to advancing a differentiated culture that inspires our associates, unites them and helps them develop and achieve their full potential. our business strength is a direct result of having engaged, passionate and dedicated associates and our focus on advancing our talent and culture remains a key strategic priority.
in closing, i want to take this time to thank our associates. we have continued to execute across our business to help us deliver innovative solutions to our partners. as amerisourcebergen continues to involve, we are empowered by our purpose and we will build upon our strengths to drive growth across enterprise. we will further strengthen our portfolio of solutions and customer relationships, enhance our specialty capabilities to support both upstream partners and downstream customers, continue to focus on execution and supporting innovation and enable positive outcomes globally by facilitating market access and supporting pharmaceutical innovation. i continue to be inspired by, proud of and confident in our themes to rise to the many challenges and complexities that we face with courage and effectiveness. by being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, amerisourcebergen is purpose driven and well positioned to create long-term sustainable growth.
now, i'll turn the call over to jim for a more in-depth review of our financials. jim?
james cleary -- chief financial officer
thanks, steve, and good morning, everyone. my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-gaap financial results unless otherwise stated. growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year december quarter. for a detailed discussion of our gaap results, please refer to our earnings release.
as steve mentioned, we clearly had a strong start to our 2021 fiscal year with growth across our businesses. as i said back in november, we entered fiscal 2021 with strong momentum and that clearly accelerated in the quarter as our teams executed it across the entire portfolio of amerisourcebergen businesses. guided by our purpose, our teams worked diligently to support pharmaceutical innovation and facilitate patient access to vital medications. amerisourcebergen's key differentiators continue to provide a platform for value creation for all our stakeholders, help me provide key solutions for our partners, both upstream and down, to ultimately ensure patient health and well-being. throughout my tenure with amerisourcebergen, i have shared my pride in being part of a company that is driven by purpose, focused on execution and unwavering and our efforts to strengthen our associate experience. our associates power our success and amerisourcebergen continues to protect, support and invest in our talent.
turning now to discuss our first quarter results. i will provide commentary in two main areas this morning. first, i will review our adjusted quarterly consolidated results and our segment performance. second, i will cover the upward revision to our fiscal 2021 guidance. beginning with our first quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted eps of $2.18, an increase of 24%, primarily due to exceptional operating income growth across our businesses. our consolidated revenue was $52.5 billion, up 10%, driven by revenue growth in both the pharmaceutical distribution services segment and other, which includes our global commercialization services & animal health businesses.
gross profit increased 15% to $1.4 billion, driven by increases in gross profit in each operating segment. in the quarter, gross profit margin increased 12 basis points from the prior year quarter. this gross margin improvement is due to growth in a number of our higher margin businesses, and in particular, a significant increase in sales of specialty products. the margin improvement is also due to the gross profit portion of the tailwind related to exiting the pharmedium business and additionally, our reversal of reserve taken in the back half of fiscal 2020 associated with forecasted inventory value writedowns that did not materialize. the pharmedium comparison and the inventory writedown reversal contributed one-third of the 12 basis point gross profit margin improvement.
consolidated operating income was $617 million, up $122 million or 25% compared to the prior year quarter. this increase was driven by the increased gross profit in both the pharmaceutical distribution services segment and our global commercialization & animal health group, which i will discuss in more detail when i review segment level performance. to support our revenue growth while protecting, supporting and appropriately compensating our frontline associates, operating expenses grew 8% to $810 million. operating expenses as a percent of revenue was 1.54% which is a 2 basis point decline from the prior year quarter.
moving now to net interest expense, which increased $3 million to $34 million primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from a decline in investment interest rates. our effective tax rate was 22%, up from 21%, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. our diluted share count declined modestly to 206.8 million shares. regarding free cash flow and cash balance, our adjusted free cash flow was $838 million in the first quarter. this strong start to the year on cash flow, positions us well after the first quarter and we are on track with our adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year. we ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash of which $1.1 billion was held offshore. this completes the review of our consolidated results. now, i will turn to our segment results.
beginning with pharmaceutical distribution services, segment revenue was $50.5 billion, up 10%, driven by increased specialty product sales, including covid-19 therapies, as well as growth at some of our largest customers and broadly across our businesses. segment operating income increased about 27% to $496 million with operating income margin up 13 basis points. as a reminder, the exit of the pharmedium business represented a $20 million tailwind to the segment's operating income, roughly half of which is in gross profit and the other half in operating expense. excluding the pharmedium tailwind, segment operating income growth would have been up 20%. the strong operating income performance was driven by continued positive trends across our robust portfolio of customers and broadly across our businesses and, in particular, a significant increase in sales of specialty products.
amerisourcebergen's leadership in specialty distribution, led by the specialty physician services group, and our capabilities in supporting specialty sales into health systems continue to provide us the platform to deliver differentiated value for our partners through our scale, reach and expertise. in the quarter, our specialty physician services group continued a strong growth as practices are prepared operationally to continue to treat their patients throughout covid challenges. additionally, our health systems business had significant growth as we're helping to facilitate vital access to antiviral and antibody therapies for covid-19 patients. the fundamentals of the health systems business overall continue to be strong particularly as we are now also seeing increased biosimilar utilization in this customer segment. while biosimilar utilization continues to be strongest and most impactful on the specialty physician side, we are encouraged to see growing adoption trends in health systems.
i will now turn to the other segment, which includes businesses that focus on global commercialization services & animal health, including world courier, amerisourcebergen consulting and mwi. in the quarter, total revenue was $2.1 billion, up 11%, driven by growth across the three operating segments. operating income for the group was up $17 million or 16%, primarily due to growth at mwi and world courier. mwi is benefiting from ongoing process initiatives and the strength of its customer relationships, particularly in the companion business where veterinarians are benefiting from increased pet ownership, increasing standards of care and adapting well virtual engagement and limited physical interaction.
world courier has continued to differentiate itself as the provider of choice in global specialty logistics as their commercial customers navigate increased complexity, the need for cell and gene solutions grows and there is an increased utilization of direct-to-patient capabilities. additionally, i will note that world courier's growth rate in the quarter was augmented by foreign currency exchange rate. this completes the review of our segment results. so i will now turn to our fiscal 2021 guidance. this updated financial guidance does not include any contribution from the proposed alliance healthcare acquisition announced in january 2021.
as i've just outlined, amerisourcebergen delivered exceptional growth in the first quarter and continues to expect positive trends across our business as we move further into fiscal 2021. therefore, as we said in this morning's press release, we are raising our fiscal 2021 adjusted eps guidance from a range of $8.25 to $8.50 to our new guidance range of $8.40 to $8.60 reflecting growth of 6% to 9%. we are also updating other financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2021. revenue is now expected to be in the high single-digit percent growth range as we have seen better than expected growth in both pharmaceutical distribution services and other.
next, operating expenses, we now expect operating expenses to grow in the mid to high single-digit percent range. we remain committed to investing in, protecting and ensuring the safety and well-being of our associates, especially those on the front lines.
turning now to operating income; we now expect to grow operating income in the high single-digit percent range. this is a result of raising our pharmaceutical distribution operating income guidance to the high-single digit range, given the significant operating income growth in the first quarter and continued overall positive trends across the business. it also reflects our improved expectation for operating income in other, which we now believe will grow in the mid to high single-digit range as a result of positive trends in our global commercialization & animal health businesses.
lastly, regarding shares outstanding. given the cash needs associated with the alliance acquisition, we are narrowing our guidance from a range of 206 million to 207 million and we now expect to finish the year around 207 million shares outstanding. all other financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2021 remain unchanged. regarding our fiscal second quarter eps expectations, while we do not provide quarterly guidance, i will note that the march 2021 quarter will be impacted by a tough comparison to the march 2020 quarter, which added significant pull forward of sales associated with increased customer purchases at the onset of covid-19.
in closing, our strong customer relationships, focus on execution excellence and commitment to innovation will continue to drive our business forward while enhancing our capabilities to serve our partners and their patients. amerisourcebergen is well positioned by our key differentiators and we are excited for how the alliance healthcare acquisition will build on our pharmaceutical centric strategy, expanding our reach and further strengthening our global platform for value-added services and solutions. our work around the acquisition remains on track and we look forward to welcoming the alliance healthcare team. these past several quarters have proven the importance of pharmaceutical innovation and access and i have spoken in great detail about the resilience of amerisourcebergen's business.
clearly, our results and expectations show that the word resilience understates the strength of our business as our purpose driven teams are leveraging our capabilities and expertise to provide important value-added solutions to help contribute to positive patient outcomes globally.
we are making positive contributions to the people, planet and communities where we live and work by being responsible business and in our upcoming global sustainability and corporate responsibility report, we will be providing an update on our commitments in these areas to show how our business practices align with many of the leading global sustainability frameworks. we know that by doing business thoughtfully and with long-term perspective, amerisourcebergen can drive sustainable growth, while creating value for all our stakeholders and fulfilling our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.
thank you for your interest in amerisourcebergen. now, i will turn the call over to the operator to start our q&a. operator?

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from glen santangelo with guggenheim.
glen santangelo -- guggenheim -- analyst
yeah thanks. good morning and congrats and thank you for taking my question. steven and jim, i'm guessing you've heard by now, but earlier this earning season, we've received varied reports from different companies with respect to changes in generic pricing. could you maybe comment on what you've been seeing in your generics business both in terms of pricing and the supply chain any notable changes worth calling out and thanks in advance. hello?
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
(technical issues) are trending relatively in line with our original expectations for the year. with regard to generic deflation. yes, about the overall deflation rates are relatively in line with the last couple of years. there are currently a few specific pockets of pressure, but overall the rate is still relatively in line with our expectations for the year supply and demand dynamics remain balanced and for the balance of the year, we expect overall deflation to be generally consistent with year-to-date.
and then on the generic cells glen debt markets continues to be competitive by with no significant update. the next question comes from eric coldwell with baird.
eric coldwell -- baird -- analyst
hey, thanks very much and unfortunately i joined a little bit late, but i thought i heard you mentioned something about two less selling days. i was hoping to get a little more specificity on that, what that was, in relation to and a selling day and distribution is obviously a tremendous amount of money if that's what that was, in relation to, so i'm just curious if that was one of the factors in the revenue update versus the street, which was a bit higher.
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, let me comment on that -- i mean those of us who have been distribution for a long time, which includes about everyone on the call and exposed to a selling days are sort of the things that we tend to [indecipherable] two less selling days this quarter for amerisourcebergen versus the same quarter last year. one was simply due to the calendar, the other was due to the fact this year we not operating part of distribution centers on mlk which we felt was important, and so that was why we had a second, less selling day during the quarter. and selling days -- will probably have some impact on the revenues during the quarter, i would say, overall we feel quite good about the revenue growth during the quarter we're comping against the quarter last year where there was a real uptake in revenue during the month of march during the onset
and so, we work at least with the revenue growth during the quarter end, that we were comping against revenue growth quarter last year and that's also [indecipherable] keeping our revenue growth guidance the same, which is strong in the high single-digit percent range for the fiscal year.
operator
the next question comes from lisa gill with jpmorgan.
lisa gill -- jpmorgan -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my question. jim, i just wanted to go back to your comments around the higher interest cost, tax cost and share count. so, by my math, it looks like those three things combined would be somewhere in the neighborhood of close to $0.10, am i doing the math correctly? when we think about the fact that you raised your numbers today, but that lower end by $0.05 was there -- if everything else were equal would there been another incremental upside to your numbers and the guidance?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thank you very much for the question. you know, obviously we don't give quarterly guidance, but we thought it was important to give that color and what we've indicated is that we're expecting for our adjusted eps to be up only slightly during the third quarter and i think really the key thing is we're expecting revenues to continue to be strong, the gps to continue to be strong and we're expecting very solid operating income growth. so it's really well the line items that are driving it; the higher tax rate year-over-year because we had discrete tax item that benefit the third quarter of last year. we have the higher interest expense during the third quarter because we've done the alliance acquisition financing before closing the acquisition. so, we have the interest expense related to it in our guidance, but of course, we won't have to [indecipherable] operating income in our guidance until we close the deal and then we have some sort of the higher share count also, and so [indecipherable] things that are driving what i said in the third quarter, but i think from an operating standpoint, -- and in our guidance is we expect the business to continue to perform well and we have operating income guidance overall [indecipherable] in high single-digit percent growth rates.
operator
the next question comes from robert jones with goldman sachs.
robert jones -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, thanks for the question, i guess jim, maybe just to follow up on that. you talked about 3q eps being up slightly. just to be clear is that mostly below the line that would maybe have that eps growth looking a little bit more subdued. and then, last quarter you called out the treatment benefit in the quarter. specifically, i was wondering if you'd be willing to share that specific contribution for this quarter as well. thanks.
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so, there are two things, i'll address both of those. the first one was that the detail we did on the third quarter. yes all of those -- all the things [indecipherable] adjusted eps should to be only slightly in the quarter, they are below the line, [indecipherable] and we are expecting solid sales and operating income growth in our operating income guidance once again for the year as high single-digit percent growth.
and on the covid treatment benefit during this quarter, it was roughly half -- is large and half is impactful and our second quarter as it was during the first quarter of our fiscal year and so while we still have a positive impact it was only about half as much during the second quarter and we do expect it continue to decline over the balance of the fiscal year.
operator
the next question comes from ricky goldwasser with morgan stanley.
ricky goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, hi, good morning. i wanted to focus on pharma segment, you reported about 3.5% revenue growth and 4.5% operating income growth. so, as prescriptions pick up to a more normalized level. should we see more leverage flowing through to the bottom line and along these lines, what are you seeing in terms of utilization trends in april, in early may. thank you.
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. with regard to utilization, broadly speaking, our sales resilience across our businesses during the pandemic, we guiding to last the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. of course, there's been a lot of external noise around, which has been a significant driver of our business. that being said, moving forward, the spread data will compare against past year they had very low coal cost as lou season as there is some lower for ventilators and diagnostic activity, but we're optimistic now. as we look to the bottom. current situation in the balance of the year that with vaccines and lower of covid-19 in many parts of the country before we speculate these diagnostic procedures and getting referrals positions to pre-conditions.

the next question comes from eric percher with nephron research.
eric percher -- nephron research -- analyst
thank you. your comment on supporting farm innovation and commercialization struck a chord and i'm thinking that relative to bringing [phonetic] specialty customers upstream and world courier having a expanded role, is it time to consider the value proposition of working with the cro, a little bit more intently than it was worth a couple of years ago and even if not a large scale combination, are there areas in oncology regulatory affairs to could fit well with the business?
bennett murphy -- senior vice president, investor relations
yes, hi eric so we varied our [indecipherable] commercialization services and helping our helping with particularly specialty physician was market challenges, which would include patient accruals and helping [indecipherable] post and then we expect that they will be full resumption of innovation in clinical trials obviously the fda [indecipherable] very focused on the pandemic in getting those therapies approved. so we think we always do stand willing to serve, but we can feel our portfolio is very adequately position and we don't have any specific needs holds right now and have had a history with our physician customers on analytics and data mining. so we feel we like we're well positioned, but it's important to keep in mind the benefits that could come from using community on [indecipherable] in clinical trial accrual so very important.

the next question comes from charles rhyee with cowen.
charles rhyee -- cowen -- analyst
yeah thanks for taking the question. james, i wanted to talk about a follow up with the question from lisa when you talked about the puts and takes on the rest of the guidance here and some of the offsets. i think you talked about a higher expense related to the alliance financing et cetera. but given that -- in the other segment, you raised the guidance there world courier seems to be doing quite well here, can you talk a little bit more about the trends that you're seeing here and in the rest of fiscal 21 and i guess with world courier built this great infrastructure. have you guys thought about adding more capabilities to support pharma manufacturers in the clinical trial process itself. would you be -- can you see yourself adding more different capabilities besides, maybe the logistics piece. thanks.
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. sure and i think the first part of your question was about the some of the moving pieces in guidance in general and then second part more specifically on world courier and i think one of the key thing is that we are seeing positive trends and across our businesses, particularly in our higher margin businesses. we're also seeing really strong execution across our businesses, both in pharmaceuticals, distribution and admin commercialization and animal health businesses. and so some of these, to have positive trends continued very good performance in specialty physician services, we're seeing strong performance also in health systems. and then as you called out in other, we're seeing strong growth, as well as the world carrier business and the mwi businesses and we expect to see positive trends on there in those businesses, for the rest of the year and beyond these overall positive trends there are a number of moving pieces that we talked about in the prepared remarks and on this call.
we're beginning to lap some significant year-over-year growth rates related to biosimilar utilization, and so the operating income from biosimilars will continue to grow, but probably sustained on a percentage growth rates that we saw as utilization was really increasing during the last three quarters of last year in the first quarter of this fiscal year. our guidance as i said, assume that non-covid therapy sales what we more in the second half, than more in the first half and of course we're very proud of what we're doing there and it is clear that we do feel that of course utilization with covid therapies we do feel will be lower in the second half and then [indecipherable] part of the fiscal year, the very low expense growth at the back half of last year we had in the back half of last year we had less than 1% operating expense growth so we're lapping that operating expense growth.
we also have a 6-month of interest associated with the alliance healthcare transaction and so those are some of the things that are impacting our guidance, but overall we feel very good about the positive trends and execution across our businesses and steve is there anything you'd like to add there?
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
no, i just want to say that we've owned world courier for eight years or so now and i think it's continued to surprise the management team and our board and how reslient and innovative they are. we've talked a lot of parts clinical trial at home. but we keep on finding the new ways for this business to be importantly stakeholders. i think [indecipherable] we were able to facilitate shipments of important anti-infective product for india really using the capability of world courier because it is such a high capability, high target this area that we continue to find new uses. i also do believe that part of our facility is looking at a combination of world courier and alliance healthcare, in different markets, just having more and more presence i do believe of course there's going to be another strong add to the characterics for world courier's opportunities in the future. next question, please?

the next question is from steven valiquette with barclays.
steven valiquette -- barclays -- analyst
thanks, good morning guys. jim, it seems that the first 10 or 15 grants around the first generic pricing question might have been cut off a little bit [indecipherable] you mention the pressure on generic pricing on the buy side size, i yes, i was just curious whether or not the dynamics in relation to that, such that one of the pockets will convert or is that just a permanent reduction [indecipherable] guidance range and the other quick question, just given the covid spike in india [indecipherable] global export, is there any early signal that often generic suppliers in india that there could be disruption to supply engineering to be us is that something on your radar screen or are you not really worried about that.
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, what i will do is i will handle the first part and then steve will take the second part of that and obviously it's a really important question and [indecipherable] questions so let me kind of go through the answer again because obviously it's such an important topic and [indecipherable] so while we don't have specific guidance, broadly speaking, both brand generic pricing are trending relatively in line with our original expectations for the year. overall, as inflation rates are relatively in line with that last couple of years regarding generic deflation.
as i said, as you know there has been few products specific pockets and pressure, but overall, the rate is still relatively in line with our expectations for the year, the supply and demand dynamics remain balanced and for the balanced and for the balance of the year, we expect overall deflation to be generally consistent with year-to-date and with that, i'll turn it over to steve.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes, as far as [indecipherable] obviously heartbreaking of course most of the media's attention will be focused on the high outbreak areas and we've seen this time unfortunately play out [indecipherable] just point you a few a few mitigating factors here. first of all, we believe that manufacturers have had some business continuity planning and the expectation that there [indecipherable] prepared for this. so we don't see any very large interruptions in the supply chain cargo [indecipherable] to be transported as usual operations continue.
china is currently functioning is also very important normal level which is especially important for raw materials and amerisourcebergen history office processes. i would agree, power supply chain, we can. i hope to solutions in almost all situations. so we, feel equation we should get all very cognizant and emphathetic with what's going on. we are just tremendously proud as an organization about the work we were able to do just this meet this very unique in india, so will support [indecipherable] and corporate brands as well.
steven valiquette -- barclays -- analyst
okay, all right. thanks.
operator
the next question comes from kevin caliendo with ubs.
kevin caliendo -- ubs -- analyst
great, thanks for taking my call. you mentioned you're going to start to lap some of the covid therapies and also some of the biosimilar benefit, we're seeing biosimilar uptake continue to increase every month. so, i'm wondering why that's still wouldn't be a little bit of a tailwind for you guys and if you could in any way, shape or form sort of size the benefit you've gotten from biosimilars? i know you've already sort of given us some heads up around the covid therapy sales. but, if we could also include biosimilars will be really helpful as we think about modeling going forward.
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, with regards biosimilars we absolutely believe in our guidance that they will continue to run -- well continue to grow the operating income dollars from biosimilar. so we do expect to have continued meaningful growth there. the point that we were making the growth percentage rate will not be as high as it was last year when biosimilar utilization was growing from a much smaller base, but we absolutely continue to expect, the operating income dollars from biosimilar to continue to grow in our specialty business and we specifically sized the dollar figure, but has been a meaningful contributor to on dollar growth and gross profit percentage improvement.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. we continue to see positive trends in biosimilars [indecipherable] health systems and we began to see significant utilization in biosimilars in the second quarter. the in house systems in oncology where in some therapy we're seeing 40% utilization for biosimilars so very important -- also as we mentioned before to create room other specialties that hadn't been as president adoption not being quite discrete on quality. when it comes to community and when it comes to specialty and james to be on the cutting edge. so we know, we believe that this trend will be oncology will continue into those specialties as well. so, we think customers are and will continue to be very important for our future. with that [indecipherable] one more question please?
operator
the next question is from george hill with deutsche bank. hey, good morning, guys and thanks for sneaking me in. i guess jim, if i could just have to follow-up, kind of, as it relates to volumes. i was wondering if you could talk about the outperformance of specialty versus kind of the regular way business in the quarter, you mentioned the two fewer days in the quarter, which i think explains a lot of the revenue numbers coming in a little bit below street expectations, but i'd kind of love to hear commentary around how things like oncology performed during the quarter?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i'd be happy to address that. we saw continued strong performance in our specialty physician services business and oncology supply and in other parts of the business, including our ion gpo. we also saw very strong performance, as we noted during the quarter during health systems, but i will say, if we look overall, the company we have really strong performance and execution across many of our businesses and focusing in on the revenue growth rate during this quarter of course, once again we were comping against quarter last year, where there was a real surge in business during the month of march during the onset of covid.
so, we were quite pleased by our performance during the march quarter and the trends that we're seeing for the balance of the year, which is included in our, in our guidance.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
okay. i am going to wrap up by just thanking everyone for their attention today, in preparing for this call i was consulting with bennett and his people and they were telling me how many more companies you're [indecipherable] covering as we really appreciate your attention as we focus on a tremendous future ahead for amerisourcebergen. as we said, many time never has our purpose been more clear during this pandemic and i'm incredibly proud of the role that our industries played and we played in that industry. we're very confident in our business and value proposition, we're looking forward in the months ahead closing the alliance transaction, which is a key development in amerisourcebergen's history and we're looking forward to our 20 year anniversary coming up late this fiscal year and to broadening our distribution and global footprint as we are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. thank you for your time today.

now i will turn the all other jim for a more in-depth review of our results. jim?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks steve and good morning everyone. and steve mentioned [indecipherable] over a year has passed since [indecipherable] the covid-19 pandemic and amerisourcebergen's response reflecting on the past year i have been moved by the diligence our teams have shown is supporting our partners during these complex times. our associates have moved our purpose being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures and they are the foundation performance i am appreciative of the hard work of our associates over the past year and i am proud amerisourcebergen continues to focus on cultivating advancing our talent and culture. while the pandemic presented a new challenges on long-term commitment to investing in our businesses allowed us to successfully manage through [indecipherable] and demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model.
as i said on the call this time last year we have been able to leverage significantly internal resources and capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our up spring and downstream partners as we sit here today with our eyes on the future, amerisourcebergen is continuing to invest internally in our businesses and talent to ensure that amerisourcebergen is not only delivering strong results this fiscal year, but will continue to do so over the long term for the differentiated value from our innovative services and solutions.
turning now to discuss our second quarter results, i will review our adjusted quarterly consolidated results, our segment performance and the updated elements of our fiscal 2021 guidance including the increased storage eps guidance. i will note that is financial guidance does not include any contribution from the proposed alliance healthcare acquisition announced in january 2021. my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-gaap financial results unless otherwise stated for the and comparisons are made against the prior year march quarter.
for a detailed discussion of our gaap results, please refer to our earnings release. we finished the quarter with adjusted [indecipherable] eps $2.53 an increase of 5% primarily due to solid operating income growth across our businesses to reflect our continued strong performance, we are raising the bottom end of our full fiscal year eps bringing it to a range of $8.45% to $8.60 up from a range of $8.40 to $8.60. our consolidated revenue was $49.2 billion, up 4% 4% driven by revenue growth in both the pharmaceutical distribution services segment and other which includes our global commercialization services and animal health group of businesses.
consolidated gross profit increased 7% to one 1.5 billion by increases in gross profit in each operating segment. in this quarter, gross profit margin increased 9 basis points from the prior year quarter. this gross margin improvement is due to continued growth and [indecipherable] buyers including covid-19 therapies and growth in some of our higher margin businesses such as world courier and mwi animal health. regarding consolidated operating expenses, operating expenses from 8% year-over-year due to a number of payroll related costs to operate in the current environment and investments in internal initiatives being made throughout fiscal 2021 with a focus on continuing to differentiate our value proposition for future growth.
we are narrowing our operating expense guidance for the year from growth in the mid to high single-digit range to growth in the high single digits. as a reminder, last year in the second half of fiscal 2020 benefited from an opex tailwind from lower corporate administrative costs, notably lower travel and lower healthcare expenses. turning now to consolidated operating income, our operating income was $707 million 5% compared to the prior year quarter. this increase was driven by increased gross profit in both the pharmaceutical distribution services segment and our global commercialization and animal health businesses, which i will discuss in more detail when i review segment level performance.
operating income margins grew 2 basis points to 1.44% as a result of the continued strong performance by our higher margin businesses. net interest expense was $35 million, roughly flat year-over-year. during the quarter we issued $2.5 billion of new debt [indecipherable] closing the alliance healthcare acquisition and new debt is comprised of approximately $1.5 billion of senior notes due in 2023 which has a coupon of 0.737% and $1 billion of senior notes due in 23/1, which have a coupon of 2.7%.
so, we do not [indecipherable] interest expense. i will note that due to the interest and fees associated with the debt raise net interest expense will likely be up roughly 15% for the full fiscal year. our updated fiscal 2021 adjusted eps guidance includes this incremental interest expense but does not include alliance healthcare operating income, which of course would be included in our future consolidated p&l after the transaction closes. moving now to our effective income tax rate second quarter, our tax rate was 21.9% up from 21.5% in the second quarter as of 2020.
our diluted share count was 207.3 million shares, roughly flat compared to last year's share count. we now expect our average share count for the fiscal year to be approximately 207 million to 200. 8 million shares up from approximately 207 million shares. the revised guidance range will adversely impact of dilution from stock comp and does not require [indecipherable] share count impact of the 2 million shares that we will deliver at the close of the alliance healthcare transaction.
as you begin to revisit your model, i will remind you that when we announced to be an alliance acquisition we noted that we would immediately get period of deleveraging following the transaction close, accordingly and through share repurchases we are committed to paying down over $2 billion in total debt over the next few years to ensure amerisourcebergen maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings. turning now to adjusted free cash flow, our adjusted free cash flow year-to-date was $298 million keeping us on track with our adjusted free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.5 billion for the fiscal year.
regarding our cash balance, we ended the quarter with $6.6 billion in cash, including approximately 2.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes that i just discussed. this completes the review of our consolidated results. now, we'll turn to our segment results. first, regarding the pharmaceutical distribution services segments it's important to keep in context the environments last year in the month of march. last year, we experienced increased pharmaceutical demand as many of our customers increased their repurchases at the onset of covid-19 resulting in higher revenue and gross profit, consolidated levels of sales, in the prior-year period does have an impact on year-over-year growth rate comparisons for the quarter.
this year, pharmaceutical distribution services segment revenue was $47.1 billion, up 3% for the quarter driven by increased sales of specialty products including covid-19 therapies. the growth rate may have been negatively impacted by being 2 less business days in the current year march quarter compared to the prior year period. segment operating income increased about 5% to $589 million with operating income margin, up 1 basis point to 1.25% with our continued solid performance related to sales from specialty products, including covid-19 therapies and for our ion solutions business which continues to be a differentiator.
as a reminder, the cash debt reserve that we reversed in the fourth quarter in fiscal 2020 was originally recorded in the second quarter. the reserve and subsequent reversal both happened in fiscal 2020, therefore resulting in a tailwind to the current quarter operating income growth and will be a headwind on operating income growth in the fourth quarter, but will have no impact when comparing to full fiscal 2021 with fiscal 2020. now i will turn to other which includes businesses that focus on global commercialization services and animal health including [indecipherable] amerisourcebergen consulting and mwi. in the quarter, total revenue was $2.1 billion up 12% driven by growth across the three operating segments, particularly for world courier.
operating income for the group was up 14% to $123 million primarily due to the continued growth in performance of world courier and mwi carriers to in-patient capabilities differentiated business and has gained meaningful traction in the market as clinical trials have begun utilizing the whole study additionally, our traditional commercial offerings and industry expertise and voluntary or continue to be by many partners resulting in higher volume and weights and the global logistics continue to be complex endeavor maintained its strong growth trajectory.
particularly in the companion animal market pet ownership has been on the rise for paying closer attention to their our investments across our businesses, including a new and a lot distribution center and then analytics technologies have allowed us to remain in class provider and offer innovative services and solutions to our partners as a result of exceptional performance in strong business fundamentals in other we are raising our operating income guidance for the group for mid to high single-digit growth to low double-digit growth for the fiscal year. i will note that this new guidance range of low double-digit growth [indecipherable] two year compound annual growth rate and the high single digits. helped by the continued performance of world courier and mwi. turning now to touch on the third quarter to provide some color and reminders if you look at your models.
given the continued strong performance across our business and the favorable comparison to last year, we expect revenue and gross profit to be strong and the operating expense growth rate to remain elevated, below the operating income line we expect eps to be only up slightly in the third quarter due to three main factors, first higher tax rate year-over-year as we lap discrete items and the third quarter of fiscal 2020, second higher interest expense due to the debt raise and third, higher share counts.
the share repurchases on hold is the result of the alliance health transaction yet. we expect share count to continue to move up to the stock comp. at this point, the year we are happy to have been able to raise our eps guidance and debt driven by the strong performance we are seeing across our business the new eps range represents growth of 7% to 9% versus 20 and clearly driven by a strong operating income growth expected in both the pharmaceutical distribution services segment and our global commercialization services and animal health per conclude my prepared remarks this morning. i will provide a brief update on the alliance healthcare transaction. we continue to make progress toward closing the transaction and continue to have valuable discussions and the leadership and teams alliance in preparation for closing we remain on track to. so the acquisition by the end of our fiscal year with the possibility closing based on third quarter as a reminder, we expect the acquisition to generate high teens percent increasing to gps and the first 12 months post close this acquisition as an important strategic and financial into the future as it will enhance our scale and margin profile. free cash flow generation and build on our global pharmaceutical manufacturing services and distribution capabilities.

[operator instructions] and the first question will be from charles rhyee with cowen. please go ahead.
charles rhyee -- cowen and company -- analyst
i want to ask, last quarter, there was a lot of concerns around generic deflation and the impact it might be having on you and the other distributors. given the performance of the quarter, how should we think about the issue of generic deflation really in the context here of strong results in distribution, both from a top line and an operating profit perspective.
james f. cleary -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
yes, charles, this is jim, and thanks a lot for that question. generic deflation is trending relatively in line with our expectations and overall generic deflation rates are relatively in line with the last couple of years. but i think the key point i'd like to make in answering the question that you asked is that looking at our business model, our business model is not as reliant on generic pricing that it once was in the past. and several years ago, leadership of the company recognized the need to have more balanced profitability across the portfolio of pharmaceuticals and that rebalancing ensures that amerisourcebergen receives fair compensation for the value we provide across brands, generics and specialty especially, as the market continues to shift to include more specialty. and so our alignment with strategic key anchor customers and our leadership in specialty continue to serve as positive differentiators for our positioning in results. and just like you were saying and asking in your question, it's really kind of evidenced in this quarter's results as we talked about in our prepared remarks this quarter, adjusted operating income was up 24% year-over-year. but we really, in particular, look at pharmaceutical distribution. pharmaceutical distribution operating income was up 13% year-over-year, and we increased our guidance for the full year for pharmaceutical distribution operating income from high single digits to low double digits. and this is just one of the many drivers that enabled us to have the increase in eps guidance of $0.20 to $0.25.
operator
and the next question will be from lisa gill with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
lisa christine gill -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst
congratulations on a great quarter. just want to understand a couple of things. one would be the comments around utilization. did you have any pent-up demand? or do you feel like this is back to more normalization when we think about utilization. and then secondly, jim, when we think about the alliance, the original guidance that you gave around accretion and what we saw in the quarter, i know it was only a partial quarter impact for alliance, but how did that come in versus your expectations?
james f. cleary -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
yes, great. and so i'll answer both of those. and so as we said in our remarks, we're seeing better and earlier-than-expected utilization trends. we're seeing patients are returning to physicians' offices, which is resulting in patient referrals to specialists and new patient starts. when we look at year-over-year retail rx trends, we see that the year-over-year growth rates are higher in our third quarter compared to the year-over-year growth rates in the first half. and so we think it's a combination of pent-up demand and return to normal. and with regard to the alliance question that you asked. alliance had a strong start out of the gate when we initially announced the completion of the acquisition. in early june, we updated our eps guidance to include $0.45 to $0.50 contribution from the business during the last four months of our fiscal year. and we now expect that alliance will contribute approximately $0.50 in those four months of fiscal 2021.
lisa christine gill -- jpmorgan chase -- analyst

and the next question will be from ricky goldwasser with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
rivka regina goldwasser -- morgan stanley -- analyst
so from everything we are hearing today, fundamentals are stable to positive and you have increased visibility, you have the sort of the building blocks across all your portfolios and you referred to a very balanced portfolio. so my first question is, with all this kind of like now in place in the increased visibility, one, how should we think about sort of steady-state ebit or eps growth beyond the 2022 headwinds and tailwinds? and then my second question that relates to that long-term outlook. we just recently saw a biosimilar approval with an interchangeable status. i think that's something that we've been waiting for, the industry have been waiting for a very long time. so how do you see this as kind of like long-term implication of this approval? and what areas do you think interchangeability could impact biosimilar adoption the most?
james f. cleary -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
yes. great. i'll start off. and as we kind of think about the longer term, i think, it's kind of key to look at what we've been seeing in our businesses over the last quarters and several quarters. we're really saying just brand-based performance across our businesses. and we have been talking about some time about specialty physician services and health systems. we're continuing to see really good performance there and also in community and specialty pharmacy, world courier and wi. some of the things that have benefited us and will continue to benefit us are our industry-leading customers. it's really a differentiator for amerisourcebergen, and it's really across most of our businesses that we have these industry-leading customers that help with our long-term growth. it's the leadership in specialty that is really benefiting us, has been benefiting us and will continue to benefit us as we look at market trends, the biosimilar trends, the improvement in utilization, but really just kind of a strong end market trend, whether it be in oncology, biosimilars, companion animals. so those are the sorts of things which will really continue to benefit us over the longer term, ricky.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
ricky, so biosimilars -- amerisourcebergen is proud of the role that we've played in being a really early promotor of biosimilars for patient choice and affordability. it's a clear opportunity for us. part b is the most impactful for us, especially in oncology with now 40% share for avastin and herceptin among other key products. what's interesting, of course, in oncology is the well-developed portfolio, services we have through our ion gpo and the strong access we have to community oncology practices and leaders. also biosimilars, we pointed out, is a positive driver for our services businesses including lash and xcenda, where we focus on patient access, home economics and [hearing] solutions. biosimilars are also becoming more positive in the health systems area. so i just noted and talked about the first interchangeable product. that isn't a part b product. it's in an important therapeutic area, which is diabetes. and of course, interchangeability will be more important for us when there's more than one product, but it's a positive development. and we are impressed on, take note, of the fda's flexibility and willingness to consider interchangeability. we think that it bodes well for the efficacy and the role that biosimilars will play in pharmaceuticals in the future. so again, that part b biosimilars are our sweet spots. thanks.
operator
and the next question will be from steven valiquette with barclays. please go ahead.
steven james valiquette -- barclays bank -- analyst
great. so with the updated free cash flow guidance from $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, do you have any color on how much of that is stemming from the alliance healthcare assets versus the core operations? i might have missed that. also when thinking about the annual run rates, can you remind us of the approximate annualized operating cash flow contribution and also just any capex you expect tied to the just the acquired alliance healthcare assets on a go-forward basis once all the dust settles?
james f. cleary -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
yes. so with regard to free cash flow, we are very pleased that we've raised guidance on so many fronts and one of them that's [coursed] on adjusted free cash flow, which is just a really important metric and value driver for us in the increase from $1.5 billion $1.7 billion. and we're seeing good performance at both amerisourcebergen and alliance, but most of that increase is due to amerisourcebergen because if you look at alliance during the four months, we have nice contribution of free cash flow but that's really largely offset by deal fees and expenses that to a large extent offset the alliance free cash flow during the four months. and so most of that increase is attributable to amerisourcebergen. and as we look at alliance long term on the free cash flow front, the statement that we made at the closing of the deal is that we expect our combined free cash flow to be 1.25 times what it would have been stand-alone for amerisourcebergen. and then on -- you talked about that capex and our capex guidance for the year remains at approximately $400 million.
steven james valiquette -- barclays bank -- analyst
thanks.
operator
and the next question will be from jailendra singh with credit suisse. please go ahead.
jailendra p. singh -- credit suisse -- analyst
congrats on a good quarter. last quarter, you guys called out seeing up to 40% utilization for biosimilars on the oncology side. curious how that trended in the current quarter and what some of your near- to medium-term expectations are for utilization trend.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. we expect that the trends will continue. i just answered to ricky's question. we talked about that same 40% market share for two of the most prominent oncology products. and we believe that this will continue to be a positive trend. and the innovative products continue to play a role and through contracting. and that's where organizations like our ion gpo are very important. but no doubt that the trend for biosimilar adoption is intact and physicians are expecting biosimilars as a key patient opportunity and also financial opportunity to lower costs.
operator
and the next question will be from eric percher with nephron research. please go ahead.
eric r. percher -- nephron research -- analyst
appreciate the initial commentary on fiscal year '22 and the fiscal year '21 considerations. i'm curious, when you look at '21 and think about core growth and core growth as you come out of the pandemic and some of the puts and takes around generics and biosimilars, do you believe that core growth is actually higher as we look into '22 than it was pre-pandemic? and my follow-up there would be, when we look at the other business in mwi, certainly -- or world courier certainly benefited during the pandemic, does -- is there a headwind going forward? or does that begin to -- or does that sustain?
james f. cleary -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
okay. yes. so with regard to growth rates and with regard to fiscal year '22, eric, we'll provide comprehensive guidance at the end of our fiscal year after we completed our year-end business planning process. and we won't be getting into that in any sort of detail today. i went through some puts and takes in my prepared remarks. i won't go through those again. i will just comment that we're seeing good strength and momentum across our businesses and really the special thing is just how broad based it is across our businesses, both in pharmaceutical distribution and in other, being driven by the industry-leading customers, leadership in specialty, biosimilars, improvements we're seeing in utilization, and that will all inform the guidance that we put out at the end of our fiscal year. i'll talk a little bit about other and then i'm sure steve will want to get into more detail. in one of the businesses in other is our mwi business. and i think some of the benefits that we've seen there during the pandemic of increased pet ownership. i mean, that's going to have legs and continue to enable growth in that business over the longer term. steve?
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
yes. yes, eric, thanks for the question on world courier. we cannot underscore enough what a fabulous job they're doing. the environment for them is really challenging. if you think about the global context that they operate in and all the different pandemic restrictions, and a lot of the business that they do there is based on international trade, which is not as easy to obtain as a [indecipherable]. so we recently visited with the team and that there was -- we had a short visit to the u.k. when the restrictions were lifted. it was wonderful to not only meet the alliance team but also to see our world courier leadership team and really give them a pat on the back because they have done a fabulous job growing the business and meeting the needs of their global clients throughout this very difficult period, and, in many cases, shifting the business model to at-home. we've owned the business for 8, nine years now. and i have to tell you that this is a wonderful part of ab that keeps on growing and keeps on finding new ways to maximize their expertise in clinical trial logistics and help the global pharma partners meet their innovation needs. and the last thing i'll say is it's a wonderful opportunity to share knowledge between alliance healthcare and world courier. so we're very positive on that business.
operator
and the next question will be from kevin caliendo with ubs. please go ahead.
kevin caliendo -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
sure. first, i was -- we've got a lot of questions about freight and shipping costs and those increasing. wondering if you're seeing any impact from that in any way, shape or form or how that might impact guidance going forward. and just a sort of a follow-on to the biosimilar question. are you seeing any change in the spreads or the profitability on biosimilars going forward? are you expecting that to happen?
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
i think i can take part of it. on the biosimilars part, honestly, we have -- we've said that somewhere between brand and generic pricing, and of course, every single product is different, depending on the number of competitors, the setting in which the product is administered. so it's a large category. it's becoming a larger and more interesting category for us. and jim can give more comments about that. but as expected, we expect that the positive trends will continue, and this is becoming an important driver for patients and for physicians and for amerisourcebergen.
james f. cleary -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
yes, and you just asked about some of the input costs. and yes, there is some inflation in things like labor and transportation. and that's, i think, evident throughout the economy and something that all businesses are experiencing. and i mean we certainly see it. but i think it's really important to say that that's something that we've been experiencing this past quarter. and of course, this past quarter, we saw the 24% increase in operating income, 13% in pharmaceutical distribution. if we exclude alliance commercialization in animal health, which is a labor-intensive group, the 21% increase in operating income and those sorts of input costs are all taken into account in our guidance increase that we did today.
operator
and the next question is from george hill with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
george robert hill -- deutsche bank -- analyst
steve, i was just hoping that you could talk a little bit more about the opportunities you see in the manufacturer services business and kind of where you think about the white spaces there post the close of the alliance acquisition?
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, george. we're tremendously excited because just meeting with the team after spending so much time, pre close and negotiations, when we get together, the intense discussions we have about opportunities and how do we take all the combinations of businesses that we have and really make one and one equal 3. i mean, that's old fashioned, but that's essentially what we're trying to do. and there's tremendous knowledge. if you look at our corporate team is focused in weybridge in the u.k., and that is the headquarters. the u.k. is also the headquarters for world courier. but if you look at how amerisourcebergen is positioning ourselves with alliance, we have a good mixture of developed european markets and higher-growth emerging markets. it's a very important priority for us to develop the services and innovative lines in those markets. our world courier has a small expertise and a small presence in almost all the markets that alliance is already in. but we set up a lot of our commercialization businesses to help smaller companies launch products globally. and i sincerely feel that this acquisition is going to give us opportunity to really have the presence, have the boots on the ground, the local market knowledge to look at both the innovative side, the distribution side and the commercialization side to benefit the patients we serve and the manufacturers that want global partners with the expertise of amerisourcebergen.
operator
thank you. ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to conference back over to steve collis for any closing remarks.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
so thank you for your time today. amerisourcebergen is a purpose-driven leading global healthcare company with a foundation in distribution, and we continue to advance our role as a key pillar of pharmaceutical innovation and access. our expanded reach and solutions in pharmaceutical distribution and added breadth and depth in manufacturer services further strengthens our ability to provide innovative and global healthcare solutions for our partners. our results and guidance clearly exemplify our performance, the execution and how we continue to benefit from leading with market leaders. our company is well positioned for long-term growth. thanks, again, for your time today, and great job to our worldwide associates.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the amerisourcebergen third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to bennett murphy, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
bennett s. murphy -- senior vice president-investor relations
thank you. good morning, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss amerisourcebergen's fiscal 2021 third quarter results. i'm bennett murphy, senior vice president, investor relations. joining me today are steve collis, chairman, president and ceo; and jim cleary, executive vice president and cfo. on today's call, we will be discussing non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations of these measures to gaap are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.amerisourcebergen.com.
we have also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investors website. during this conference call, we'll make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-gaap basis, including, but not limited to, eps, operating income and income taxes.
forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. for a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer to today's press release and our sec filings, including our most recent 10-k. amerisourcebergen assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. you have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by the management. we ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants as possible within the hour. with that, i'll turn the call over to steve.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president and chief executive officer
thank you, bennett, and good morning to everyone joining us today. before we discuss our results for the quarter, i want to comment on the distribution industry's recent milestone regarding the proposed settlement agreement to address opioid-related claims of u.s. state attorneys generals and political subdivisions in participating states. throughout the litigation process, we have been consistent in stating our desire to address the normalcy of the opioid challenge by bringing solutions to the table. if the industry's proposed agreement and settlement process leads to a final settlement, it would collectively provide thousands of communities across the united states with substantial financial support.
clearly, the process is in an advanced stage, and we will not comment deeply at this time. we take our role in the supply chain seriously and continue to close with stakeholders concerning these complex matters. amerisourcebergen will continue to work diligently and, alongside partners, combat drug diversion while supporting real solutions to help address the crisis in the communities where we live, work and serve. turning now to our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. amerisourcebergen delivered yet another quarter of exceptional results driven by a high level of execution, purpose-minded team members and continued focus on delivering differentiated value. as we announced earlier this morning, we had revenues of over $53 billion representing growth of 18% from the same period last year, and we grew our adjusted eps by 17% year-over-year.
these results reflect continued strong performance across amerisourcebergen's businesses as we capitalize on our differentiated pharmaceutical-centric value proposition and as our team successfully executes on our key strategic initiatives. this strength and execution continue to create value for our shareholders. and today, we are again raising our fiscal 2021 full year guidance, which jim will discuss later in greater detail. i will focus my remarks today on the key strategic pillars that are driving our strong performance, as well as how, with the addition of alliance healthcare, amerisourcebergen continues to be well positioned to create value for all our stakeholders. amerisourcebergen remains next-minded, and we are focused on continuing to enhance our ability to provide global healthcare solutions as we support pharmaceutical innovation and access, both in the united states and internationally. in the united states, our pharmaceutical distribution business continues to benefit from our industry-leading customer relationships, our leadership in specialty distribution and commercialization services and strong end market trends, including an earlier than expected return to pre-covid prescription utilization trends in the june quarter.
our leading customer base includes our good neighbor pharmacy and elevate provider network members. they are proving daily that community pharmacies are at the forefront of providing quality and equitable care and maintaining deep levels of trust with their patients and communities. in fact, for the fifth year in a row, good neighbor pharmacy was ranked highest among brick-and-mortar chain drug store pharmacies by j.d. power. this is the tenth time we have received that honor in the past 12 years, and it is a testament to community awareness of the value of the quality care and experience patients receive at gnp member pharmacies.
we held our annual thoughtspot conference last week, and i was touched and inspired by the stories that our members shared through the entrepreneurship, expertise and deep community roots, community pharmacies prove that they do more than just [draw] prescriptions. they are critical promoters of health equity across the u.s., often driving above and beyond to provide holistic care and health education at the local level, particularly in under-resourced communities. since beginning of the pandemic, community pharmacies have stepped up fearlessly to meet the unprecedented challenges of a global health crisis and show the world why community pharmacies are integral to our communities.
the value proposition of community-based care has never been clearer. another relevant example is on the animal side. the growth in pet ownership has increased demand for our veterinarian customers as pets are a cherished part of the family and the care a veterinarian provides is valued. this positive trend over the last year has long-term benefits for our business as mwi is well positioned with key anchor customers and services. on the human health side, access to local trusted expertise care remains vital, particularly for those dealing with complex health challenges that bring them into the care of specialty physician providers.
as i've said from the onset of the pandemic, we are conscious of the negative impact that restricted measures have on patients when they have less access to screenings and tests that help doctors identify serious health issues. this has particularly impacted patients who are used to a doctor or healthcare facility. but now our customers have begun to see a normalization in new patient trends. and as a result, patients are more effectively being diagnosed and gaining access to treatment.
this is a clear positive for patient care. as the leading provider of specialty distribution and commercialization services, we will continue to play our role in supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access as patients visit volumes continues to normalize. our specialty physician services business had strong performance this quarter and continues to differentiate amerisourcebergen with leading value-added services, such as those through our physician gpos. additionally, bio centers continue to be a positive for our customers, our business and the healthcare system overall as they provide room for new innovative products to come to market. the innovations in car t and cell and gene therapies and the potential applications of the new mrna technology offers the medical community new potential tools in the treatment of serious diseases that previously alluded truly effective care.
amerisourcebergen is well positioned to support all these innovations through our specialty distribution and manufacturer services offerings. our unique ability to provide value-added expertise in conjunction with innovative solutions and quality service enhance our partnerships and grow our business. with strong partnerships, relationships and a leading portfolio of solutions to support a wide pipeline of practices and products, amerisourcebergen is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the market opportunities provided by global pharmaceutical innovation as we drive growth in our business and help our partners tackle some of the most critical challenges based in healthcare. we have a strong foundation in place across our businesses.
and in june, we took another significant step forward by closing the alliance healthcare transaction and welcoming their talented team to the amerisourcebergen family. the acquisition of alliance healthcare is the next evolution of enhancing our ability to provide innovative and global healthcare solutions and is a critical component to our future success. alliance healthcare is a strong and diversified pharmaceutical distribution and manufacturer services company with leading market positions across an attractive portfolio of both established european markets and high-growth emerging markets. in addition to their traditional wholesale business, alliance healthcare operates a range of leading higher-margin innovation businesses serving both upstream partners and downstream customers.
the acquisition of alliance healthcare extends our distribution reach built by our market-leading services capabilities and expands on our key differentiators. specifically, amerisourcebergen's leading portfolio of key anchor customers now includes a long-term relationship with boots in the u.k. and a network of independent pharmacies across europe through the alphega pharmacy network. since the completion of the transaction, we have gotten the chance to know about the business and the people and alliance healthcare better, and we remain very positive about the opportunity that this landmark achievement provides amerisourcebergen as we are positioned for a differentiated global growth platform.
this includes our dedication to further strengthen our portfolio of solutions and customer relationships to lead with market leaders in every segment and to supporting patient access wherever a prescription is needed. second, amerisourcebergen's leadership in specialty is further enhanced with key commercialization services in new markets. by leveraging the expertise and capabilities of our world courier business, along with alliance's alloga and alcura, we elevate our ability to be a differentiated solution provider for global manufacturers as they develop and commercialize pharmaceuticals around the world.
this is complementary to the solutions that we provide at world courier, which continues to play a key role of providing global specialty logistics through growth traditional commercial offerings and direct-to-patient clinical trial capabilities. we remain dedicated to expanding on our leadership in specialty and to enhancing our capabilities to support global pharmaceutical innovation. third, amerisourcebergen focuses on delivering best-in-class services and efficiency, and this transaction enhances our ability to develop innovation solutions that are fundamental to our success operationally and commercially.
our innovative mindset means that we embrace the advanced technologies, data and analytics, and now we can further support positive outcomes through our expanded global platform. this fiscal quarter, we were selected as the industry leader award winner at the 2021 sap innovation awards for our work in developing sap advanced track and trace for pharmaceuticals. this technology tracks millions of daily shipments at the batch level and further strengthens the pharmaceutical supply chain in the u.s. the value of a resilient and sustainable global pharmaceutical supply chain is vital and the ability to support pharmaceutical innovation to a global footprint with broad leadership and local expertise provide differentiated value for our partners.
amerisourcebergen stakeholders recognize the value we create, the importance of our purpose and the critical nature of the service and the infrastructure that we provide. fourth, amerisourcebergen continues to build upon our history of corporate stewardship, which focuses on advancing our people and culture, protecting the company's financial health and ensuring the long-term sustainable value creation. with alliance healthcare, we are now an even more global [indecipherable] company, and we are committed more than ever to advancing the value of our talent and culture. over the past year, we have invested in enhancing our talent and diversity and inclusion strategies to enable more growth opportunities within our increasingly inclusive workplace.
we recently launched our executive leadership initiative to accelerate the advancement and ongoing success of high potential black, hispanic and latinx team members at the mid and senior levels, addressing the most pronounced leadership and representation gaps identified over the last several months, following best-in-class research-based approaches. in the future, we plan to provide dedicated development opportunities for high-potential employees of additional underrepresented groups. investing in our leadership development and talent and culture is important to our long-term sustainable growth, which is supported by diverse and inclusive teams.
this focus is important to ensuring we capture the value of our collective differences and reflect our social commitment as we continue to strategically focus on delivering on all elements of esg. our esg strategy is foundational to amerisourcebergen, our leadership, our board and our people. recently, amerisourcebergen joined the science-based targets initiative as we continue to line our business with best practice organizations around the world. at the local level, we continue to be deeply committed to our communities. this past year, we launched mycommunityimpact, matching gifts and dollars for doers program, and we recently made it available to all global employees. our philanthropic efforts have been recognized by diversityinc, ranking us 8th in their annual 50 [list] in philanthropy rankings. as i closed my prepared remarks today, i remain truly inspired by the commitment and performance of our team members who are now numbering 41,000.
with their unwavering passion and support, amerisourcebergen is well positioned to capitalize on our global footprint to provide leading pharmaceutical distribution services and to leverage our expertise as an innovative commercialization services provider internationally. we remain confident in our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, our capabilities as partner of choice with market-leading manufacturer services and our role in continuing the acceleration of pharmaceutical innovation. by providing differentiated value to our stakeholders, focusing on our customers, expanding on our leadership in specialty and executing, innovating and supporting pharmaceutical innovation globally, we are well positioned to create long-term stakeholder value as we remain united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.
now i will turn the call over to jim for a more in-depth review of our results and updated financial guidance. jim?
james f. cleary -- chief financial officer and executive vice president
thanks, steve. good morning, everyone. before i discuss our third quarter results, i want to comment on the pharmaceutical distribution industry's continued progress toward reaching a negotiated resolution to substantially address the nationwide opioid litigation. the proposed settlement agreement represents an important step toward achieving a broad resolution of governmental opioid claims and aligns with the legal accrual the company recorded in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year ended september 30, 2020. amerisourcebergen appreciates the enormity of the opioid epidemic, and this broad industry resolution is an important step toward delivering a meaningful relief to communities across the united states.
turning now to our business. amerisourcebergen remains focused on our differentiated and innovative value proposition to deliver long-term growth and value creation to our stakeholders. powered by our purpose-driven team members, we will continue to execute on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy on an enhanced global platform to serve both upstream partners and downstream customers. as we recently completed the acquisition of alliance healthcare in the quarter, i would like to welcome the alliance healthcare team to amerisourcebergen. having joined amerisourcebergen myself through an acquisition and experience several acquisitions during my tenure, i have seen firsthand a thoughtful and strategic approach amerisourcebergen takes to successfully integrate acquired companies.
we enjoy working with our incredibly talented new team members and learning more not only about their businesses, but also about how much we culturally have in common. as we have said since announcing the acquisition, alliance healthcare is a strong and efficient business, and we look forward to working together to continue to provide innovative solutions to our customers and stakeholders. my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-gaap financial results unless otherwise stated. growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year june quarter. for a detailed discussion of our gaap results, please refer to our earnings release. i will provide commentary in two main areas this morning. first, i will review our adjusted quarterly consolidated results and our segment performance.
second, i will cover the upward revision to our fiscal 2021 guidance. turning now to discuss our third quarter results. we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted eps of $2.16, an increase of 17%, which was driven by the continued strong performance across amerisourcebergen's businesses and also benefited from the one month contribution from the alliance healthcare acquisition. our consolidated revenue was $53.4 billion, up 18%, driven by revenue growth in both the pharmaceutical distribution services segment and other, which includes alliance healthcare and our global commercialization services and animal health businesses.
consolidated gross profit increased 32% to $1.6 billion, driven by increases in gross profit in each operating segment. in the quarter, gross profit margin increased 33 basis points from the prior year quarter to 3.05%. this was primarily due to the acquisition of alliance healthcare, which has a higher gross profit margin and increase in sales of specialty products in pharmaceutical distribution services and growth in some of our higher-margin businesses. regarding consolidated operating expenses, operating expenses were $996 million, up 38% year-over-year due to the addition of the alliance healthcare business and also includes the internal investments we are making across our business with a focus on continuing to offer innovative services and solutions to our partners.
these investments are important as they ensure we continue to create differentiated value and support our long-term growth. turning now to consolidated operating income. our operating income was $631 million, up 24% compared to the prior year quarter. this increase was driven by increases in both the pharmaceutical distribution services segment and other, which i will discuss in more detail when i review segment-level performance. operating income margin grew six basis points to 1.18% as a result of the contribution from the alliance healthcare acquisition and growth in higher-margin businesses. moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the third quarter.
the net interest expense was $51 million, up 36% due to debt related to the alliance healthcare acquisition. our effective income tax rate was 21%, up from 18.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which benefited from a discrete tax item. our diluted share count was 208.9 million shares, a 1.6% increase due to the dilution related to employee stock comp and the weighted average saving impact of the june issuance of two million shares delivered to walgreens as a part of the alliance healthcare acquisition. turning now to adjusted free cash flow and cash. our adjusted free cash flow was strong in our fiscal third quarter, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow number to $1.2 billion, while our cash balance was $2.6 billion. this completes the review of our consolidated results. now i'll turn to our segment results. pharmaceutical distribution services segment revenue was $49.3 billion, up 13% for the quarter driven by increased sales of specialty products and solid performance broadly across our pharmaceutical distribution businesses.
across our distribution businesses, we are seeing better and earlier-than-expected utilization trends as there have been more normalized physician interaction patterns leading to new patient starts. pharmaceutical distribution services segment's operating income increased about 13% to $484 million. amerisourcebergen continues to benefit in the quarter from our leadership in specialty, where there has been a notable return to pre-covid strength and continued positive biosimilar trends.
i will now turn to other, which includes alliance healthcare mwi, world courier and amerisourcebergen consulting. alliance healthcare is in our results for the month of june and had strong performance out of the gate. in the quarter, other segment's revenue was $4.1 billion, up 128%, driven by the alliance healthcare acquisition and growth across the remaining operating segments. excluding the impact of alliance healthcare, global commercialization services and animal health revenue was up 22%. other segment's operating income was $147 million, up 77% primarily due to the alliance healthcare acquisition and strong performance at both mwi and world courier. excluding the impact of alliance healthcare, global commercialization services and animal health operating income was up 21%, reflecting the solid fundamentals of the businesses. world courier has continued its exceptional performance, providing high- specialty logistics around the globe. despite challenges in global logistics due to limited international cargo space, the team has delivered industry-leading solutions and expertise to support our customers and partners.
looking ahead, the business is highly complementary to alliance healthcare's alloga and alcura businesses, and we are excited to offer an integrated suite of solutions on our enhanced global platform to serve our manufacturer customers. turning now to mwi. the pandemic has truly encouraged all of us to focus on the health and wellbeing of our communities and families. and this includes our animal companions. over 12 million families in the u.s. have gained pets since the pandemic began, and since pet owners view their pets as family members, the focus on health and wellbeing is a positive market trend for our mwi companion business.
in the production animal market, our investments in technology solutions and the unique offering of value-added services position the business to support long-term global demand for protein. mwi's strong execution and customer relationships have allowed the business to remain a best-in-class provider that is well positioned to capture these positive market trends. that concludes our segment-level discussion, and i will now turn to our 2021 guidance. following the closing of the alliance healthcare acquisition back in june, we updated our 2021 guidance for revenue, adjusted diluted eps and weighted average shares to reflect the expected contribution from alliance healthcare and the weighted average share count impacted the two million shares of stock that we delivered to walgreens. given the continued strong performance of amerisourcebergen's businesses, we are again raising our eps guidance from a range of $8.90 to $9.10, up to a range of $9.15 to $9.30, reflecting growth of 16% to 18% from the previous fiscal year. we are also updating other financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2021, including a meaningful increase to our expectations for consolidated and segment adjusted operating income. first, i'll begin with operating expenses.
operating expenses are now expected to be approximately $3.9 billion due to the alliance healthcare acquisition. as a reminder, when you consider your models, alliance healthcare has higher margins for gross profit, operating expenses and operating income as evidenced by the update to our fiscal 2021 guidance for consolidated operating expenses to reflect the four months of alliance healthcare. next, turning to operating income. we now expect operating income to be approximately $2.6 billion. this is a result of raising our pharmaceutical distribution operating income guidance to the low double-digit growth range given the strong trends we have continued to see in our business, including specialty, which was further bolstered by patient referral activity this quarter.
this rate also reflects our expectation for operating income in other of approximately $610 million to $620 million. excluding the contribution from alliance healthcare, operating income growth for global commercialization services and animal health group is expected to be in the low double-digit range for fiscal 2021, driven by the strong performance of the world courier and mwi. finally, turning to free cash flow, we have raised our free cash flow guidance to be approximately $1.7 billion, up from approximately $1.5 billion. as it pertains to fiscal 2022, our corporate planning process remains unchanged. we will provide comprehensive financial guidance at the end of our current fiscal year.
this approach allows for guidance to be fully informed by the output of our year-end business planning process. that being said, we want to remind you three important items from fiscal 2021 as you consider your models. first, through the end of june, the financial contribution from sales of covid-19 therapies has declined in line with the expectations we have shared since the first quarter. covid therapy distribution contributes roughly $0.25 to our fiscal 2021 adjusted eps guidance, and the benefit from that exclusivity is not expected to repeat in fiscal 2022. second, we will have higher interest expense in fiscal 2022 driven by the debt related to the alliance healthcare acquisition. third, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we expect our weighted average shares to be almost 211 million shares due primarily to the fully planned impact of the two million shares of our stock delivered to walgreens at the close of the alliance healthcare acquisition.
our share count will continue to tick higher in 2022 due to normal employee stock comp-related solution and the fact that we have committed to prioritize paying down $2 billion in total debt over the next two years and [lower] shareholder purchases. moving past these modeling reminders. the strength of amerisourcebergen is undeniable and is exemplified by our continued exceptional results quarter-after-quarter. this is the sixth quarter since the pandemic began and our results demonstrate the resilience and strength of our company. i am thoroughly impressed by the execution and performance across our businesses that has positioned us for continued success.
our pharmaceutical-centric foundation, market-leading talent and competitive positioning enable us to capitalize on market trends and continue to deliver strong results. before i conclude my prepared remarks this morning, i would like to touch on our esg and diversity and inclusion numbers. amerisourcebergen remains focused on creating long-term financial value, and we continue to work diligently to build our corporate stewardship initiatives to ensure the work we are doing benefits all stakeholders.
we are focused on continuing to build robust talent development programs so that all our team members feel they have opportunities to grow and learn. in our communities, we're supporting nonprofit partners through our foundation to expand access to quality healthcare, promote health equity and provide resources to ensure prescription drug safety. in addition, we aim to be environmental stewards in the communities where we live and work through initiatives like our commitment to using sustainable packaging to reduce the use of single-use plastics and working closely with our partners to optimize delivery routes to minimize our greenhouse gas emission footprint.
we look forward to providing further updates on our esg progress as we continue to find ways to make a positive impact on the people, planet and communities where we live and work. as we focus in on the end of our fiscal year with strong momentum and continued outperformance across our business, it is important to take a moment to reflect on the important accomplishments we have already had this year. first, our teams continue to execute and leverage our capabilities to create differentiated value for our stakeholders. second, our future growth has been further solidified by our acquisition of alliance healthcare. third, our purpose-driven culture continues to empower our team members that think, plan and act decisively to do what is right for our people, partners and communities.
and finally, we continue our long-term commitment to strategically invest in our businesses and talent to ensure that amerisourcebergen will continue to deliver long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders. as we look to the future, i'm proud of the resilient foundation we have built while we facilitate pharmaceutical innovation and remain united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. thank you for your interest in amerisourcebergen.
now i will turn the call over to the operator to start our q&a. operator?

operator
[operator instructions]. and the first question will be from lisa gill from jpmorgan.
lisa christine gill -- jpmorgan chase & co, research division -- analyst
good morning. jim, i just want to go back to your comments around the u.s. drug distribution. i understand that there's a number of incremental businesses that are now within that segment, but you made a comment about covid-19 therapies. so when we think about 2022, one, is there nothing built into your expectation around that? and two, just given the number of new therapies that are coming to market, for example, i think about the new merck therapy that's just been announced, is it not reasonable to think that there's going to be some benefit as we go into 2022 for covid therapies, would be my first question.
and then secondly, can you just help us to understand the underlying trends? so for example, what are your expectations around utilization trends? what's your expectation around cough, cold, flu, acute scripts kind of coming back and people visiting the physician office again, etc. if you can just help us to better understand that, that would be great.
james f. cleary -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
lisa, thank you. great question. i'll answer that question from a financial perspective, and then i think steve will want to add in and talk a little bit more about the business. but as you know, our guidance for this year for our u.s. healthcare solutions segment, revenue growth of two percent to five percent and adjusted operating income growth of three percent to six percent. and it's based on continued strong performance really across the business, where we continue to benefit from our differentiated position.
now with regard to your question on covid therapies, we don't expect to repeat the benefit that we had in fiscal year 2021 from our exclusivity on the distribution of the main commercial covid therapy. the benefit we got from covid therapies in fiscal year 2021, as i said in my prepared remarks, was $0.30. and kind of let me give you some of the breakdown there. during the first quarter, it was $0.14, second quarter was $0.07, third quarter was $0.03 and fourth quarter was $0.06. so i'm sure that will help you in your modeling.
and as we're looking at fiscal year 2022, we expect the benefit that we get in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 to be $0.03. so we have an $0.11 headwind in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. and so we do expect to have lower operating income growth in u.s. health care solutions in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, but of course, as i said, expect three percent to six percent operating income growth for the full year, which includes, of course, q1. now you asked about other covid therapies. and of course, it's early, but we may very well get some benefit from other covid therapies.
and that's exactly why one of the reasons why we have a range, and we have a $0.30 range in our eps between $10.50 and $10.80. we don't expect a lot of incremental benefit in the first quarter, but it could come later on in the year. now you also asked about utilization friends, which is a great question. and we are seeing strong utilization trends across our business, which has improved sequentially from the positive trends that we noted in our third fiscal quarter. and prescription trends are strong and have returned to pre-covid-19 levels.
and we have seen strong utilization improvement trends across the business in the second half and expect that to continue to benefit us in fiscal year 2022 across our businesses and customers. and i see that steve would like to just add a couple of things on the overall business.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
we're entering 2022 with all of our businesses performing very well, lisa, and benefiting from a somewhat normal environment, but it is the innovation factor that remains. and i saw that the merck [indecipherable], while we're on the call, the merck got approved in the u.k., an oral. so continued innovation and it's possible that we could be working with some therapies in the future, as we have in the past, particularly in the emergency use authorization phase is where we've been successful in working on an exclusive basis.
so we're happy andif i look back on 2021, i think of it as the year that the last deal got done and the year that we responded so well to assisting with the need for corresponding to the covid pandemic and including keeping our people safe. so that's what i think would be the highlights. but jim, i think you gave an exhaustive answer. so we'll probably move on to the next question, please.
operator
the next question will come from charles rhyee from cowen.
charles rhyee -- cowen and company, llc, research division -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. jim, i just wanted to follow up on the guidance, particularly in the international health care segment here. you said, you were planning to sell the profarma specialty business and said there was a two percent headwind. that's two percent headwind to the full year operating income, but it's not going to sell until -- so it's really double that for the back half of fiscal 2022. and did you give a revenue impact as well?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. no, we haven't given revenue impact, but you are right, it is a two percent headwind for the whole year. and we're assuming we're going to sell that business during the first half of the year. and of course, our international healthcare solutions segment is really driven by alliance healthcare being the largest part of the segment, and we feel very good about the performance of alliance. it's operating at or above our deal model. and then the next biggest piece of the international healthcare solutions segment is, of course, our world courier business, which is also performing well.
operator
and the next question will be from steven valiquette from barclays.
steven james valiquette -- barclays bank plc, research division -- analyst
thanks. basically, a lot of the discussion points around freight costs, the ability for drug distributors to pass some of that through or have to absorb that. there's a lot of components to that. it can be higher labor costs. it could just be higher fuel costs, etc. but just curious to hear about how you guys are handling that? and whether there's any impact in your business one way or the other? or can you fully either pass that through or just not have that be as a material impact to the company? thanks.
james f. cleary -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. i think really in the summary that it is fully reflected in our guidance. and in fiscal year 2022, and we do expect to continue to have higher expenses associated with picking, packing, shipping. there are some offsets from certain other fy 2021 expenses that are not planned to repeat in fy 2022. but of course, we keep a close eye on economic trends that can impact our business, and we have seen wage and transportation inflation across our business.
during the summer, we moved quickly to adjust wages to ensure that they remain competitive and market aligned, and that's reflected in our fourth quarter results. and these things, like higher labor and transportation costs, they're fully contemplated in our fiscal year 2022 guidance, and we'll manage these expenses as we do each year and work with our partners and customers to ensure that we're diligent in maintaining our fair compensation for the services we provide.
operator
the next question is from eric percher from nephron research.
eric r. percher -- nephron research llc -- analyst
thank you. i want to take the other side of the u.s. question asked earlier. so this also includes mwi animal, xcenda. is it fair to assume that that's growing more than the three percent to six percent for the total segment? are there any headwinds coming out of fiscal year 2021 we should be aware of? and then relative to the resegmentation, when we look at three percent to six percent, is that apples and apples? are there any changes in corporate expense now allocated to the eu segment or the global service entity in switzerland that would impact the three percent to six percent?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. and so there aren't any changes in the corporate allocation, and when we add businesses like mwi animal health and the consulting businesses to u.s. health care solutions, mwi has had a stronger growth rate, particularly in fiscal year 2021, the animal health business really benefited from the pandemic and the increase in debt ownership. and so that has been a higher growth business in fiscal year 2021, whereas the consulting business has been a lower growth business. and so i think that gives you a little bit of additional color there.
and then one thing that we are doing today is, as i said in my prepared remarks, we are filing an 8-k where we'll show the segments. the two new segments will show that on a historical basis for fiscal year 2021, and how they look in the fiscal year 2021. and i think probably a key thing is that when we look at the u.s. segment for this upcoming year, we're expecting three percent to six percent growth, which is largely apples to apples because of the size of the legacy business that are going into the new segment.
eric r. percher -- nephron research llc -- analyst
that's very helpful.
operator
and the next question will be from jailendra singh from credit suisse.
jailendra p. singh -- credit suisse ag, research division -- analyst
thank you and good morning everyone. i was wondering if you could comment on the potential impacts from the recent changes coming out of washington around medicare, negotiating drug prices, among other components. with your leading presence in specialty products, how do you think about the implications as medicare ramps up a number of drugs it is negotiating?
steven h. collis -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
yes. thank you for the question. so u.s. is -- i think somewhat over fixated on the cost of medications relative to overall healthcare spending. we've been very interested in benefit design, and we also prefer when the market creates their own solutions for problems, such as high copays for adherence products that are so detrimental to the system when a diabetic patient doesn't take the insulin. so we see some real strong benefits if we can remove some barriers that have been officially created on products like that.
on specialty, it's a little bit too early to tell. i think we've been through many changes in reimbursement, including the change to asp, a tremendous growth in the hospital outpatient market for specialty drugs. and the wholesalers are very resilient, and we also do believe that -- understand the healthcare, pharmaceuticals are the most efficient form of healthcare. so there's nothing that tremendously concerns us as a business.
our concern is always with preserving innovation and making sure that our providers have a stable reimbursement environment that they can get, continue to run their businesses and take care of patients. but definitely, i think we spend a lot of time, and i'm not very interested in. thanks for the question.
operator
and the next question will come from kevin caliendo from ubs.
kevin caliendo -- ubs investment bank, research division -- analyst
thanks. just in terms of in the guidance, i just want to understand the capital deployment expectations. you gave us the share count, we understand that. should we just assume that the vast majority of the free cash flow then will be to pay down debt? or how should we think about it?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. and so as we've said before, we do plan to take down about 2/3 of the alliance healthcare acquisition debt by the end of fiscal year 2023. we've started that process, so it's about $2 billion that we'll be paying down during that time frame. we expect to pay down about half of that in fiscal year 2022. and so that is kind of one of the key parts of our capital deployment. we'll also, of course, continue to invest in the business and invest in current future growth in fiscal year 2022.
operator
and the next question is from elizabeth anderson from evercore.
eduardo -- evercore -- analyst
thanks ang good morning everyone. this is eduardo on for elizabeth. just maybe given the walgreens' new expansion toward becoming a provider of healthcare services, how do you envision your relationship within them evolving? and what can you do to support their new strategy?
steven h. collis -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
yes. thank you. we're tremendously proud of the benefits we're getting from the recently announced alliance transaction, including that we have a contract with boots, who's become a very significant customer of our alliance division through 2031. and most importantly, we extended our walgreens contract in the u.s. through 2029. and this is such a fundamental customer for us that helps us establish such a strong base of scale and efficiency. and i think the teams are at a very good state where we're looking to how can we help with one and other priorities.
we have these discussions with all our large customers and the need for the very large customers like walgreens are very different, than say, the independent veterinarians, the community pharmacists. but yes, for example, we're supporting wba with their central fill initiatives, and we're looking to understand better how we can help with their strategies on the institutional side. so i just would say that the relationship is in a good place, and we still go back to that 2013 agreement as being very fundamental to the success of amerisourcebergen over the last decade.
operator
and the next question will come from michael cherny from bank of america.
michael aaron cherny -- bofa securities, research division -- analyst
good morning, thanks for the color so far. so if i could just circle back a bit on the americas growth in the u.s. health care segment. as you think about the moving pieces -- and i appreciate the color, jim, you gave so far relative to the market improvement, but in terms of the upside, downside of the range, what are the macro factors have to look like to get to those numbers? and i'm more just curious because on an all-in basis, you have obviously been tracking higher than that and outpacing the rest of the market. and so whether -- antivirals are one component, but what else are the moving pieces that you think about in terms of what encapsulates the range on the u.s. segment?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
sure. and so one of the key things is something that i've talked about in the prepared remarks and then also in an earlier answer, but i'll just quickly cover it again given the scale. and that's the impact that covid therapies could have. so that really impacts the range. and again, it was a $0.30 of benefit in fiscal year 2021 and $0.14 of that came in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, and we're expecting that the benefit will be significantly less in fiscal year 2022. but steve talked about some of the innovation that's occurring, it could be higher. and so that's something that certainly could impact the range, and that would be one of the larger things.
and then, of course, there's always a number of moving pieces in our businesses. we have very strong performing businesses, but they're moving pieces within the businesses in terms of growth rates. and then there's sorts of things that i've also mentioned, like some higher labor and transportation costs and how those trend. and so those are some of the things that impact us within the range. but i do want to say that we have a lot of confidence in the business, and we are expecting continued strong performance across the business because of our differentiated physician and our strength, both within pharmaceutical distribution and manufacturer solutions.
operator
ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to steven collis for any closing remarks.

operator
good day, and welcome to the amerisourcebergen fourth quarter fiscal year '21 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]. please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to bennett murphy, senior vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
bennett s. murphy -- senior vice president of ir
thank you. good morning, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss amerisourcebergen's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results. i am bennett murphy, senior vice president, investor relations. joining me today are steve collis, chairman, president and ceo; and jim cleary, executive vice president and cfo. on today's call, we'll be discussing non-gaap financial measures. reconciliations of these measures to gaap are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investors.amerisourcebergen.com. we've also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website. during the conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-gaap basis, including, but not limited to, eps, operating income and income taxes.
forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. for a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our sec filings, including our most recent 10-k. amerisourcebergen assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company. you'll have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. we ask that you limit your question to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants as possible within the hour. with that, i'll turn the call over to steve.
steven h. collis -- chairman, president & chief executive officer
thank you, bennett, and good morning to everyone on the call. today, we will focus our remarks on the exceptional progress that amerisourcebergen team has made on our strategic priorities during fiscal 2021, and how we will capitalize on that momentum to continue executing and innovating in fiscal 2022. before i begin, i want to take a moment to comment on the distribution industry's recent milestone regarding the proposed settlement agreement to address opioid-related claims of u.s. state attorney generals and political scout divisions in participating states. throughout the litigation process, we have been consistent in stating our desire to addressing the enormity of the opioid challenge by bringing solutions to the table. if the industry's proposed agreement and settlement process leads to a final settlement, it would collectively provide thousands of communities across the united states with substantial financial support. clearly, the process is in an advanced stage, and we will not comment deeply at this time.
we take our role in the supply chain seriously and continue to work closely with stakeholders concerning these complex matters. amerisourcebergen will continue to work diligently and alongside partners to combat drug diversion while supporting real solutions to help address the crisis in the communities where we live, work and serve. in fiscal 2021, amerisourcebergen advanced its role as a key pillar of pharmaceutical innovation and access, as we look at our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures by supporting our partners, customers and our own team members through challenging times. as the pandemic persists, the importance of our purpose in an evolving environment and an efficient global pharmaceutical supply chain is being felt by all our stakeholders.
we are proud to be able to offer our expertise, capabilities and infrastructure as part of the solution on facilitating the national distribution of covid-19 therapies, to supporting the distribution of more than 75 million vaccines to patients in over 30 countries through our expanded global footprint. our business has leveraged its position of market strength to become an increasingly vital partner of choice through differentiated solutions for our upstream and downstream customers. our continuous investments and ongoing focus on being a strategic partner for our customers have deepened our relationships with all our stakeholders during this time of increased focus on the pharmaceutical supply chain, enhancing our position as a provider of key solutions for our customers, both big and small. we also leverage our core capabilities as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution and a differentiated provider of unique solutions for manufacturers globally and healthcare providers locally.

now i will turn the call over to jim for a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results and to discuss fiscal '22 guidance. jim?
james f. cleary -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, steve, and good morning, everyone. for amerisourcebergen, fiscal 2021 was a momentous year as we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the amerisource and bergen brunswick merger completed, both the acquisition of alliance healthcare and the extension of the walgreens contract through 2029, and our teams delivered another year of strong performance, driven by our continued execution and strategic decisioning. our pharmaceutical-centric business, robust customer relationships and leadership in specialty distribution and services position us to be a partner in supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access on a global scale. before i turn to our results, as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-gaap financial results unless otherwise stated. growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year september quarter. for a detailed discussion of our gaap results, please refer to our earnings release.
i will provide commentary in three main areas this morning: first, i will review our consolidated results and segment performance in fiscal 2021, and then we will discuss our new reporting segments beginning in fiscal 2022 and will conclude with fiscal 2022 guidance. beginning with our fourth quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted eps of $2.39, an increase of 26.5%, which was driven by both a full quarter's worth of contribution from alliance healthcare and the strong performance in our pharmaceutical distribution services segment. our consolidated revenue was $58.9 million, up approximately 20%, reflecting growth in pharmaceutical distribution and other. excluding alliance healthcare, our consolidated revenue would have been up 9% from the prior year quarter. consolidated gross profit was $2 billion, up 51%, driven by increases in gross profit in both pharmaceutical distribution and other, which benefited from the inclusion of alliance healthcare.
this quarter's gross profit margin of 3.4% is 71 basis points higher than the prior year quarter as we had a full quarter of alliance healthcare in our consolidated results. consolidated operating expenses were $1.3 billion versus $795 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the addition of alliance healthcare as well as investments in our talent and initiatives to support the company's current and future growth. this quarter's operating expense margin of 2.23% is 61 basis points higher than the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the full quarter impact of alliance healthcare in our consolidated results. also as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we had a bad debt reversal of $13 million that impacts the year-over-year comparison of operating expenses. turning now to consolidated operating income. our operating income was $694 million, up 31% compared to the prior year quarter. this growth was driven by increases in both the pharmaceutical distribution services segment and other, which i will discuss in more detail when i review segment level performance.
operating income margin was 1.18%, an increase of 10 basis points as a result of the contribution from alliance healthcare and the continued benefit from some of our higher-margin businesses. moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter. net interest expense was $55 million, up 57% due to debt related to alliance healthcare. our effective income tax rate was 20.3% compared to 21.7% in the prior year quarter. the lower effective tax rate was due to a change in the mix of domestic and international income from the prior year quarter. our diluted share count was 210.8 million shares, a 2.2% increase due to the impact of the issuance accumulated shares delivered to walgreens as part of the alliance healthcare acquisition and dilution related to employee stock compensation. this completes the review of our consolidated results. now i'll turn to our segment results for the fourth quarter. pharmaceutical distribution services segment revenue was $51.2 billion, up 8% in the quarter, driven by increased sales of specialty products, strong execution across our pharmaceutical distribution businesses and overall positive prescription utilization trends.
pharmaceutical distribution services segment operating income increased by 11% to $472 million. operating income margin expanded by two basis points to 0.92% in the quarter. amerisourcebergen's continued leadership in specialty distribution allowed us to capture the benefits of strong utilization trends during the quarter. i will now turn to other, which includes alliance healthcare, mwi, world courier and amerisourcebergen consulting. in the quarter, other revenue was $7.7 billion, up from $2 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, driven by a full quarter's worth of contribution from alliance healthcare as well as growth in the global commercialization services and animal health businesses. other operating income was $223 million, up from $105 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the inclusion of alliance healthcare. that concludes our fiscal fourth quarter discussion. now i will turn to a discussion of our full year fiscal 2021 results. our consolidated revenue was $214 million, up 13%, driven by growth in pharmaceutical distribution and other, which includes four months of contribution from alliance healthcare.
excluding alliance healthcare, our consolidated revenue was up 9% from the prior year. consolidated operating income grew 20% for the year to $2.6 billion, driven by strong performance across our businesses and the four-month contribution of alliance healthcare. excluding alliance healthcare, our consolidated operating income increased by an exceptional 12% from the prior year, driven by growth in our higher-margin businesses, strong fundamentals across our business and the important work our team has done to support the covid therapy distribution for hospitalized patients. from a segment perspective, pharmaceutical distribution services had operating income growth of 13% due to strong performance across our portfolio of businesses and customers. in fiscal 2021, we continue to capitalize on our leadership in specialty distribution, both in the physician space and health systems. we saw a significant contribution from health systems as our differentiated solution set was leveraged by manufacturers to meet their complex logistics for the distribution of covid-19 antivirals and therapies to hospitals across the country. additionally, we continue to have strong performance in specialty division services this fiscal year as the healthcare system has become more accustomed to operating in the current environment.
this supported physician diagnosis and related testing and screening processes, resulting in more normal levels of new patient starts. in other, operating income grew 54% year-over-year to $615 million. other meaningfully benefited from the four months of contribution from alliance healthcare results, while world courier and mwi also delivered strong results. as global logistics continue to be challenged by the pandemic, world courier provided its expertise and innovative solutions to manufacture partners around the world, facilitating the movement of temperature-sensitive and other high-priority shipments. world courier's direct-to-patient in home clinical trials continue to be a differentiator as patients and manufacturers saw alternative lower acuity care sites. mwi continued to experience strong performance in the companion animal market as pet parents maintain their focus on their pet health and the production animal market, the reopening of restaurants and return of travel boosted protein demand. turning now to tax rates. our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 21.3% compared to 20.8% in the prior fiscal year, which has benefited from discrete tax items.
turning now to eps. our full year adjusted diluted eps grew 17% and $9.26, primarily due to strong growth and execution across our business, including continued leadership and outperformance in specialty and the four-month contribution from alliance healthcare. adjusted free cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion, which was better than our expectations due primarily to the timing of certain customer payments in september, a benefit that will reverse in the december quarter due to the higher supplier payables. there was also better-than-expected cash flow at alliance healthcare. if you normalize for the timing-related benefit, our adjusted free cash flow for the year would have been roughly $1.7 million. we ended the year with a cash balance of $2.5 billion, excluding restricted cash of approximately $500 million. that completes the review of our fiscal 2021 results. i will now discuss updates to our segment reporting, which will go into effect in fiscal 2022. following the acquisition of alliance healthcare and the subsequent change to the geography of our business, we undertook a strategic evaluation of how we report our segments in order to provide alignment with business operations. following this review, which concluded in october, we will begin reporting our results in two new segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, u.s. health care solutions and international health care solutions.
the u.s. healthcare solutions segment will consist of our legacy pharmaceutical distribution services segment, excluding profarma distribution plus the following businesses, which had previously been reported in other, mwi animal health, xcenda, lash group, and ics 3pl. the international healthcare solutions segment will consist of our non-u.s.-based pharmaceutical distribution and services solutions, including alliance healthcare, world courier, innomar and profarma distribution and profarma specialty. as a reminder, we consolidate profarma's results due to our ownership interest and governance of the publicly traded entity. profarma specialty was previously reported in other. this morning, we are also filing a form 8-k with three segmented financials for fiscal 2021 in order to help your quarterly modeling. our new reporting segments, like amerisourcebergen, are built on the foundation of leading in pharmaceutical distribution and differentiated by complementary higher-margin businesses offering value-added solutions in key markets. turning now to discuss our fiscal 2022 guidance.
and as a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a gaap basis. so all of the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-gaap basis. starting with revenue. we expect consolidated revenue to grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit percent range. on a segment level, we expect u.s. healthcare solutions revenue to be approximately $207 billion to $212 billion, representing growth of 2% to 5% year-over-year. in international healthcare solutions, we expect revenue of approximately $26 billion to $27 billion. moving on to operating income. we expect consolidated operating income to grow in the mid- to high teens percent range. on a segment level, we expect u.s. healthcare solutions operating income to be between $2.325 billion and $2.4 billion, representing growth of 3% to 6% on a year-over-year basis. the only business that was included in pharmaceutical distribution services that is not going into u.s. health care solutions is profarma distribution, which contributed less than 1% of revenues for pharmaceutical distribution services in fiscal 2021 and roughly 1% of segment operating income.
as a reminder, as i said back in february and again in august, we had a significant tailwind in fiscal 2021 related to the financial contribution from sales of covid-19 therapies. we did have higher-than-expected covid therapy sales in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by sales in the month of august with a subsequent substantial decline in september. the final eps benefit from covid therapy sales for full year fiscal 2021 was $0.30, $0.14 of which was in the first quarter. if you estimate the first quarter of fiscal 2022 based on even lower october trends, the contribution from covid therapy sales would be $0.03, which means the first quarter would have an $0.11 headwind for u.s. healthcare solutions segment. while this reduces the segment's growth rate in the first fiscal quarter, we expect full year operating income growth of 3% to 6% in u.s. health care solutions. we expect international healthcare solutions have operating income between $685 million and $715 million. alliance healthcare represents a little over 2/3 of operating income in the segment, with world courier making up the majority of the remainder of segment operating income. as you think about your first quarter models, we expect about 25% of the international segment's operating income to occur in the first quarter. as you look at fiscal 2022 for the international segments, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. first, we have agreed to sell profarma specialty as we focus on our core operating assets.
the transaction is under regulatory review and is expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2022. successful completion of the divestiture is factored into our guidance and represents a 2% headwind to our international healthcare solutions segment's operating income. second, in fiscal 2022, we will have a step up in expenses at alliance healthcare that was fully contemplated when we announced the acquisition and is generally related to it modernization. as steve said earlier, we view technology and systems as fundamental to our operations and business continuity, and this step-up in fiscal 2022 expense will help align alliance healthcare's business technology, operability and infrastructure with amerisourcebergen. alliance healthcare continues to deliver on our expectations for the business, and we expect alliance to be high teens accretive to our stand-alone adjusted diluted eps in fiscal 2022. since closing the transaction, our teams have engaged both in person and virtually and have furthered our strong relationships. most recently, we held a deep dive with leaders across amerisourcebergen and alliance healthcare, focused on alliance healthcare's manufacturer services businesses.
i continue to be impressed by the strong and efficient business and team at alliance and appreciate the collective thoughtfulness around creating long-term value for stakeholders through our innovative solutions. moving on to interest expense, tax rate and share count. we expect interest expense to grow in the mid-teens percent range as a result of debt related to the alliance healthcare acquisition. we expect our tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22% for fiscal 2022, based on current tax rates in effect for fiscal 2022. without the tax rate benefit from alliance healthcare's operations, our range would have been 1% higher on both the top and bottom end of the range. finally, we expect that our share count will increase to approximately 212 million shares as a result of the full year impact of the two million shares delivered to walgreens as part of the closing of the alliance healthcare acquisition and normal dilution from stock compensation expense. as a reminder, as part of our commitment to maintain our strong investment grade credit rating, we are committed to paying down $2 billion in total debt over the next two years in lieu of share repurchases.
we currently expect to pay down roughly half that amount toward the end of fiscal 2022. as a result of these expectations, reflecting the strength of our business, we are guiding for adjusted diluted eps to be in the range of $10.50 to $10.80, reflecting year-over-year growth of 13% to 17%. turning now to capital expenditures and cash flow expectations. capex is expected to be in the range of $500 million as we continue to invest to further advance our business or to buy alliance healthcare's it infrastructure and support additional growth opportunities. for adjusted free cash flow, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, which includes the benefit of alliance healthcare in our results for the entire fiscal year. in closing, fiscal 2021 was another successful year for amerisourcebergen as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities while the pandemic persisted. i am proud of our 42,000 team members, who worked tirelessly to support our customers, partners and patients and drove our strong financial results. given the steps we took in 2021 to advance our business, i'm excited about our 2022 fiscal year as we continue to deliver stakeholder value.
as we continue to drive our business forward, we will maintain our focus on our differentiated capabilities supported by our dedicated team members. amerisourcebergen is guided by our purpose of being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures, built on a foundation of leadership in pharmaceutical distribution and differentiated by complementary higher-margin businesses that leverage our pharmaceutical scale and expertise to create unparalleled value for our manufacturer partners and healthcare provider customers. with that, i'll turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. operator?
