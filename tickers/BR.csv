ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from david togut from evercore isi. please go ahead with your question.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. good morning, tim and jim. just a quick question on organic revenue growth expectations for fiscal 2020, looks like the first quarter came in a little light at 2%. as you look at the 8% to 10% recurring fee revenue growth, which you're reiterating in your 2020 guide, how many percentage points of that growth comes from organic versus acquisitions?
james m. young -- corporate vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, david, this is jim. as i said, we think about 4 points or so will come from the acquisitions, which keeps us right in target for mid-single-digit organic growth contribution. as you point out, we feel really good over the balance of the year, especially as we see these gto onboardings ramp up over the course of the year.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. and i think on the june quarter call, jim, you called out 3 ppt of growth from acquisitions for fy'20. so that's a change?
james m. young -- corporate vice president and chief financial officer
correct, because we just added these four acquisitions, which will add about a point to our revenue growth.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. and then just a final question. so with the organic growth coming in about a point below expectation or else -- or at least looking at the 8 to 10 point revenue growth guide for recurring fee revenue growth, is there anything changing in your expectations? or is it just this delay in the onboarding at gto?
james m. young -- corporate vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. david, when we look at kind of q1 relative to the rest of the year. we definitely see a few transitory items. you had slightly low interim record growth. so we expect that to pick up. we have onboarding come in later in the quarter as opposed to the beginning of the quarter. so we'll get the full quarter benefit next quarter, small quarter, you're going to have things like, we had some equity proxy activity that fell in q1 last year, but now appears to be pushing to later in the year. so those are the types of things that lead us to believe that the 2% organic for the quarter is light and that we pick up the pace starting in q2 and put us on track for that mid-single-digit organic growth rate.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from darrin peller from wolfe research. please go ahead with your question.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks. look, i just want to start off. i mean, it's good to see the m&a activity contributing. but -- i mean, to follow-up on dave's point a little bit about the organic side. what -- i guess, what, first of all, would growth have been if the implementations were more on time on the gto side? and then, i think more importantly, what would you say is the pro forma growth profile of gto now? in other words, had you owned all these deals a year ago, and it was in your run rate, what would the growth profile of gto be?
james m. young -- corporate vice president and chief financial officer
darrin, this is jim. look, i think as opposed to sort of looking at what q1 would have been, we come back to feeling like this year is going to be a mid-single-digit organic growth rate. and that's what we measure. as you know, we can have some ups and downs and especially in a small quarter. so, again, we feel really solidly on track for this mid-single-digit organic growth rate. and as you think about gto, we look at this business actually being above that average for the year. so we're targeting gto to be mid- to high-single-digit organic growth. the acquisitions, as tim mentioned, generally speaking, are accretive to that growth rate. so on balance, as those annualize in, we expect they're relatively small in the grand scheme of things for gto. but on balance, they'll help the growth rate. but again, targeting mid- to high-single-digit growth for gto with a really big revenue backlog behind us feels like that is a good spot.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay.
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. just to add on to that, darrin. i think it's an interesting question. had we owned these businesses a year ago, we probably will be reporting higher organic now because they are experiencing very nice year-on-year growth within those businesses. so, we feel good about the profile, especially on the gto side where we're expecting really good revenue from sales this year.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then just on the brcc side, i mean, i guess, that's been still a headwind. some of that was still transitory from, i think, a year, two years ago at this point, 1.5 years ago. where are we on that in terms of that business? do you foresee that business turning -- leveling off or inflecting at some point soon?
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. darrin, it's tim. we are expecting brcc to be a contributor to earnings growth in fiscal 2020, but not to revenue growth. and we are continuing to, as mentioned, work through the off-boarding of a major client. the good news is that that client is taking longer to go away, which means that we make more revenue and the bad news is we're still talking about it. but we think that's going to actually continue throughout fiscal 2020. we had anticipated it would be done by now.
i think the other point here is that, we do continue to have discussions with large clients about their in-house transactional communications. that was a key part of our mid-term investment thesis. and we are seeing good growth in digital products, which is part of our long-term thesis, not enough to offset the print volumes.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. just one last quick one. i mean, in terms of the backlog, it continues to look strong. can you talk about the flow through of the $330 million revenue backlog? and then in terms of new bookings, also, how much of that was inorganic versus organic? but more importantly, just the timing of the flow through of the backlog over the next few quarters and year and beyond?
james m. young -- corporate vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, darrin. so the -- obviously, the revenue backlog features prominently in our revenue growth. so in that mid-single-digit organic growth rate that we're targeting, we need a number of points of growth. the majority of our points of growth coming from that backlog. so i won't give you an exact quantification of that, but that is our driver every year. so -- but we'll anticipate ending the year with continued healthy backlog as we add to it. but, again, this is a business that always is thinking about how do we add 6, 7, 8 points of growth coming from that backlog, and that can give you a sense of the type of revenue conversion we have going on in any one period.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
all right. that's helpful, jim. thanks, guys.
operator
our next question comes from peter heckmann from d.a. davidson. please go ahead with your question.
peter heckman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen. can you talk about some of the puts and takes of both universal proxy and end-to-end confirms both things that the sec looks like they're relatively serious about pursuing? and how broadridge would work to facilitate that for the industry?
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, peter, it's tim. and that's a definitely good question. and we are -- while i'd say broadly, there hasn't been anything on the regulatory front that is really significant since our last call. the sec is continuing to work on issues around the -- around proxy. they've made some statements around investment advisors. there was a meeting just yesterday and some work on proxy plumbing. and when they talk about proxy plumbing, what they are largely talking about, some of the things that you mentioned, which is end-to-end vote confirmation and potentially universal proxy card. we are well set up to deliver on both of those.
we are introducing end-to-end confirmation for those clients where we're the tabulator this year, which is significant portion of public companies. we are working with the industry to introduce that for all public companies. we need cooperation from others. there is a working group the sec has established, but we think this is a positive development for corporate governance and a positive development for us, not in any particular fee characteristic, but just in terms of increasing everyone's overall confidence.
with respect to universal proxy, that's something that we are definitely able to support and have prototypes around and look forward to implementing whatever is decided by the sec and the industry.
operator
our next question comes from chris donat from sandler o'neill. please go ahead with your question.
christopher donat -- sandler o'neill + partners -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to ask one about the, i guess, sort of this year and longer-term expectations for etf position growth, and this is related to the number of brokers going to zero commissions. it seems to me that part of the proliferation of etfs over the last five to 10 years with some brokers doing -- launching their own etf and then having a promotional pricing on commissions for that. now it seems like the economic rationale for those etfs is going away. and i would think one outcome might be that you see the industry consolidate on a handful of the really large liquid etfs. is that something you think might happen? and would that potentially lead to fewer etf positions? or even how do you think in general about what the -- if the zero commission brokerage fees have any impact on etf ownership?
james m. young -- corporate vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. chris, very interesting question. i think that etfs are a really nice vehicle to have a lot of benefits for clients in terms of their liquidity and other characteristics and intraday pricing. and so, i think they're going to continue to be very popular. it is true that there has been some trend around brokers introducing ones. i don't know how widely held those are, but i think, actually, the bigger trend is with more proliferation of different factor etfs and sector etfs, and now people are talking about active etfs. so there is a lot that is causing change there. i think another interesting sort of analogy is that, while the number of public companies has stopped growing and even gone down, position growth has continued. so i'm not sure that there is a correlation between position growth and the number of choices out there.
i will just -- since you mentioned zero commissions, just let me talk a little bit about that because i think people are actually wondering a little bit about what is the impact of that. and i think that is something that is -- the timing is hard to determine. so the timing may be unexpected, but it's essentially -- it's just the long-term trends that we've seen. the biggest impact is really -- clearly on the online brokers, fidelity, schwab, e*trade, ameritrade, those are not as significant part of our wealth book. we're more focused on advisor and wealth managers. and -- but we are seeing is the change is creating the need for all wealth managers to evolve their business model in terms of how they add value because there's not as much from the asset management side and from the stock picking and trading side. and so, to accomplish that evolution, they need to invest in technology for the differentiation, and i think that is really favoring us as we work with clients to create broad range of services that it helps them, not only take down costs but also support these new sources of differentiation. so it's just one of those clear signals that the world continues to evolve, which is why technology is so important.
christopher donat -- sandler o'neill + partners -- analyst
got it. and thanks for that piece on the evolution of the industry. related to that, i'm just wondering -- and you just said that the online brokers are a small piece of your revenues. but given lower commissions, do you think your pricing or really your contracts might change with -- on the gto side and being more fixed and less volumetric going forward? or is it too soon to tell on that?
james m. young -- corporate vice president and chief financial officer
i think it's too early to tell. it is -- these contracts are all pretty long term in nature. we've had discussions with some wealth managers about the idea of focusing our contracts more on positions and the number of positions than on the number of trades because when you really look at what the cost drivers are and their revenue drivers on their side, it is more about positions, and we're looking for a long-term construct between us and our clients that aligns with their revenue model and aligns with our cost model and positions may be a better way to go on that. but those are long-term discussions, and i wouldn't expect to really see any impact in years.
christopher donat -- sandler o'neill + partners -- analyst
got it. okay. thanks very much, jim.
james m. young -- corporate vice president and chief financial officer
you bet.
operator
and our next question comes from puneet jain from j.p. morgan. please go ahead with your question.
puneet jain -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my question. i know you expect closed sales to contribute to growth acceleration rest of the year. can you also review expected trends in internal growth?
james m. young -- corporate vice president and chief financial officer
sure. as you recall, a couple of key drivers in there are going to be interim record growth, which comes in fairly evenly throughout the year. as we mentioned, little low this quarter. we're expecting it to come back. so that'll pick up in terms of contribution. and then probably the single biggest contributor to that internal growth is our equity position growth, srg, as we refer to it, and that's really back half weighted, even specifically q4. so as those come into play, we expect really nice internal growth contribution as we get to the back half of the year. other than that, there are always puts and takes throughout the rest of the business, little bit of professional services here and there, but the really big drivers are to keep your eye on that along with trade growth, which is always a contributor to some degree in that mix. but really, it's the position growth that we keep our eye on as we think about the sort of full year number.
puneet jain -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. and it's been quite a while since you closed the ubs contract. are you seeing any benefit from flywheel effect from closing the ubs deal with other wealth management clients? or is it too early for that?
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. puneet, it's tim. first of all, just -- we continue to make very good progress on ubs itself, and really excited about the technology there. it has created lots of discussions with other large wealth managers. and when we talk about the pain points and this open architecture platform of the future, there's a lot of head nodding and a lot of positivity. all that said, as you pointed out, these conversations are long term in nature. so there's nothing imminent to report.
what i would say is separate from the creation of the new platform and the conversations about that with other wealth managers is that, we are continuing in other ways to strengthen our wealth capability and our wealth platform. and you certainly saw that with some of the m&a. you're seeing that with moving some of these product lines into gto. when you look at some of our recent onboardings, they do include a significant wealth component. so when we look at the underlying what's happening in our wealth business as we develop that into a third franchise, we're seeing good progress there. so, we think the strategy is on track, and we continue to be excited about the opportunity.
puneet jain -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
and ladies and gentlemen, at this time, it's showing no additional questions. i'd like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks.
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you. i just want to thank everyone for being here today and to summarize, we feel very good about 8% as a recurring fee revenue number, obviously, the record sales and our underlying business trends. as you heard, we're reiterating our full-year guidance, and we continue to have really good confidence in the long-term trend and in investments that we're making to support that growth. so, thank you very much, again, and look forward to talking to you again next quarter.

operator
good morning, everyone, and welcome to broadridge first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please also note today's event is being recorded.
at this time, i'd like to turn the conference call over to mr. edings thibault, head of investor relations. sir, please go ahead.
edings thibault -- head of investor relations
thank you, jamie. good morning, and welcome to broadridge's fiscal first quarter 2020 earnings call. our earnings release and the slides accompanying this call may be found on the investor relations section of broadridge.com. joining me on the call this morning are tim gokey, our ceo; and our cfo, jim young.
before i turn the call over to tim, a few standard reminders. we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding broadridge that involve risks. a summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on form 10-k.
we will also be referring to several non-gaap measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of broadridge's underlying operating results. an explanation of these non-gaap measures and reconciliations to their comparable gaap measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation.
let me now turn the call over to tim gokey.
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, edings, and good morning to everyone on the call today. broadridge had a solid first quarter and is well positioned for the year. we generated 8% recurring revenue growth. we had record first quarter sales, and we continue to feel good about our underlying business trends. we also completed tuck-in acquisitions across each of our franchises that will strengthen broadridge and drive long-term growth. while the largely anticipated lower event-driven activity impacted our results in this seasonally small quarter, we are well positioned to deliver a strong fiscal year 2020, and we are reaffirming our full-year guidance. moreover, ongoing industry trends continue to underline why broadridge is so well positioned for longer-term growth.
this morning, i'll provide you with a brief overview of our first quarter results. and given the increased of -- level of m&a we've seen over the past few months, i'll review how it fits together to strengthen our franchises. jim will then follow with an overview of our financial results, including the shift of our wealth advisor solutions from ics to gto. as always, we'll close with your questions.
let's get started on slide four. broadridge reported solid first quarter results. as you analyze the quarter, keep in mind that q1 is our seasonally lightest of the year. typically, we generate anywhere from 12% to 14% of our full-year adjusted eps in the first quarter, and that's right where we ended up. with that in mind, let's touch on the headline results. recurring revenues rose 8% to $623 million, driven in large part by the acquisitions we made in the fourth quarter, which are performing well. organic growth was light at 2%, but we expect it to accelerate through the year driven by stronger growth in both ics and gto from onboarding of sales that have already taken place. with a $330 million backlog jim mentioned last quarter, we have very good line of sight on our ability to generate revenue from sales.
as expected, event-driven revenues declined significantly relative to the first quarter of 2019. recall that in 2019, we benefited from a proxy campaign at a significant mutual fund complex. the lapping of that large campaign drove most of the decline in the event-driven revenues and earnings. and jim will give an update on how this plays into our full-year forecast.
last point on results, strong sales. closed sales rose more than 100% to $38 million, a first quarter record, which speaks to the strength of our underlying business. our first quarter sales are especially gratifying, coming off our strong fourth quarter and are an indication of the momentum we see in the market. i'm pleased with the investments we've made in our business over the past few months with targeted tuck-in m&a across all three of our franchise focus areas. as i'll discuss in a few minutes, our investments over the past 24 months have collectively strengthened our business and improved our long-term growth profile across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management.
finally, the key takeaway from the quarter is that, broadridge remains on track to deliver another strong year of top and bottom line growth. we continue to expect strong closed sales, 8% to 10% recurring fee revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted eps growth in fiscal year 2020. this outlook positions us to deliver on the three-year growth objectives we shared with you at our 2017 investor day, including at the high-end of our adjusted eps range.
beyond fiscal year 2020, ongoing industry trends have only strengthened my confidence in our growth outlook and the potential opportunity in front of us. the past few months have brought increased evidence that the financial services industry is facing significant structural cost pressures. the moves by online brokers to slash trading commissions and by global banks to realign the strategic focus have driven home the challenges the industry faces.
in addition, regulatory change remains the constant with the sec moving rapidly to implement regulation best interest and the moves in europe toward the shareholder rights directive. these challenges are helping drive our growth. financial services firms need to move rapidly to adapt their businesses and evolve how they serve their clients. and it's causing them to embrace industry solutions to mutualize critical non-differentiating functions, tap into more and better data and raise the effectiveness of their communications. as we see playing out in our record sales and backlog, no one is better positioned than broadridge to provide these solutions. so while the challenges faced by the industry are real, they only reinforce the underlying trends that have fueled our growth, and they highlight why we remain so excited about our outlook.
now, let's turn to slide five for a review of our results. i'll start with our ics segment, where recurring revenues, excluding customer communications, rose 10%, driven by 6% organic growth and the addition of the td ameritrade retirement assets. the biggest organic driver was higher mutual fund and etf revenues, where recent share gains helped drive growth. equity stock record growth was solid at 7%, while fund and etm [phonetic] interim record growth slowed to 1%, dipping early in the quarter before rebounding. temporary slowdowns in interim record growth are not unusual, and we expect interim record growth to rebound over the course of fiscal 2020. our ics segment also benefited from strong demand for our data and analytics products. the acquisition of the td assets added nicely to our growth, and i'm pleased with the progress we're making in integration of that business.
customer communications revenues fell 2%, driven by a combination of client losses and volume attrition. as expected, event-driven revenues declined steeply year-over-year as we lapped exceptionally strong mutual fund proxy activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and revenues returned to more normalized levels. we see event-driven revenue picking up in the second half of the year, driven, in part, by a proxy campaign at a large mutual fund complex. i continue to be excited by the momentum in our gto business, where we grew 15% for the quarter and expect mid-teens growth through the remainder of the year.
organic growth of 3% was held back in the quarter by an onboarding delay, which is now complete, and we therefore, expect organic growth to pick up meaningfully in the second quarter and for the remainder of the year. the acquisition of rpm also contributed nicely to first quarter results, driven in part by strong license sales. while these sales were in rpm's pipeline when we acquired the business, we were able to expand the scope of a particularly meaningful solution for a large client as a result of the broadridge relationship. so it's good to see an early return on our expected revenue synergies.
we also took another step toward the creation of a separate wealth management business within our gto segment by transferring our advisor solutions products from ics to gto. while modest from a revenue perspective, this is a small but meaningful move for pulling together our wealth solutions into a more unified home, and jim will share you the details.
finally and importantly, broadridge posted record first quarter sales. we continue to see strong sales momentum across multiple product lines. notable wins included the sale of our global post-trade management technology platform to a major european bank, as well as an increase in the governance services we provide to a major asset manager. it's early in the year, and we face a tough comp in the second quarter as a result of our landmark sale to ubs last year and we're off to a strong start.
broadridge has been very active on the m&a front the past few months, making multiple acquisitions to strengthen our business. so i want to take a few minutes to review our recent deals and why they will help us achieve our strategic goals. let's turn to slide six to start that discussion. acquisitions are an integral part of our capital stewardship and investment strategy and are tightly aligned with the franchise strategy we laid out at our last investor day.
since the end of fiscal 2017, we've made 13 tuck-in acquisitions, deploying a total of almost $700 million. these investments are tightly linked to our strategic goals. in governance, our strategy is to build the next-generation of governance communications and to expand our services across the governance network. we've invested more than $300 million in the past 24 months to help accelerate that strategy. we significantly extended the data-driven solutions, most recently, with fi360 and the td ameritrade assets. fi360 provides fiduciary focus accreditation, data and analytics to retirement advisors intermediaries that broadens our data analytics capabilities and strengthens our solution set for regulation best interest. we've also added to our issuer product suite, broadened our regulatory communications footprint and strengthened our digital capabilities.
in wealth, we're creating the open architecture solution of the future for investors, advisors and operations. acquisitions are playing an important role in this vision, and we have invested nearly $350 million since the end of fiscal 2017. the biggest acquisition was rpm, which strengthens our wealth business in canada and extends our capabilities to integrate banking into wealth management. we also acquired new capabilities around securities-based lending, and most recently, advisor compensation.
in capital markets, we're driving the growth of our business globally. much of that growth has been organic, but i'm pleased that we were able to acquire shadow financial in october, broadening our capabilities into new asset classes, including exchange-traded derivatives and cryptocurrencies. across governance, capital markets and wealth management, our m&a investments have helped to accelerate our strategic objectives and strengthened our long-term growth profile. it deepened our relationships with key clients, added talent, brought new capabilities and given us additional addressable market in which to invest organically.
these investments have had clear financial benefits as well. in total, they should contribute approximately $175 million for fy'20 exit recurring revenue run rate, adding 2 points to our three-year revenue cagr, in line with our investor day objectives. moreover, we expect them to be accretive to our organic growth, with a blended growth rate well above our corporate average. the past six months have been busy on the m&a front, and i'm excited about what we've been able to execute. we've been talking to many of these prospects for some time, in some cases, for years. with our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we're able to act when the right opportunity comes, even on multiple properties coming for sale over a short period of time. as ceo, it's great to have that flexibility. so, no change for our capital allocation strategy, and we'll continue to look for attractive tuck-ins.
i'll now turn the call over to jim for a review of our financials. but before i do, let me summarize my key messages. first, we reported solid first quarter results with 8% recurring revenue growth and record first quarter sales. second, ongoing industry trends underline why broadridge is well positioned for longer-term growth. third, we continue to make the investments across our business that accelerates our strategic objectives and positions broadridge for that growth. and fourth, we are on track to deliver a strong fiscal 2020 with 8% to 10% recurring fee revenue growth and 8% to 12% growth in adjusted eps. it's an exciting time to be at broadridge. we're on track to deliver another strong year and energized by the opportunity to play a key role in transforming the financial services industry.
before i turn it over to jim, i want to thank our nearly 12,000 associates around the world for their hard work and dedication for our clients and to the service-profit chain. the work they do, strengthens our clients and enables better financial lives for all of us and for millions of others. jim?
james m. young -- corporate vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, tim, and good morning, everyone. broadridge reported a solid first quarter, and we are on track to deliver a strong fiscal year 2020.
before reviewing our results, i'll make a few call-outs. first, a reminder on seasonality. our first quarter is typically our smallest recurring revenue in earnings quarter of the year. consistent with the outlook we provided in august and our historical average, our q1 adjusted eps came in at 13% of our full-year adjusted eps guidance at the midpoint.
second, acquisitions. fiscal year-to-date through early november, we have invested $179 million in four targeted tuck-in acquisitions aligned with our franchise strategy. we expect that these acquisitions will contribute an additional point to recurring fee growth in fiscal 2020. we also expect that these acquisitions will be earnings dilutive in fiscal 2020 after accounting for financing costs. these investments, coupled with our seasonally negative free cash flow in q1 pushed our adjusted leverage ratio up to 2.2 times at september 30, slightly above our long-term target of 2.0 times. this was a temporary spike, and we expect to finish the year close to our target.
third, event-driven activity. as expected, event-driven fee revenue declined notably from record first quarter a year ago, driving a decline in first quarter earnings. at $40 million, q1 event fees were also a bit lower than our expectations. however, this level of event fee is in line with prior periods, normalizing for significant mutual fund proxy activity or notable proxy contest. we now expect event fees to be at the low end of our initial full-year expectation of a decline of 5% to 15%.
fourth, some modest changes to our segment reporting. as part of our strategy of building a wealth management franchise, we have consolidated our advisor solutions products into gto from ics, representing $43 million of annual revenue in fiscal 2019. all fiscal 2019 segment numbers have been revised to reflect this change, and i'll be referring to the revised numbers in my remarks. the supplemental product revenue breakout in the appendix of this presentation shows the revised numbers for all four quarters of fiscal 2019. fifth and most importantly, guidance, we expect to deliver a strong fiscal year 2020 and are reaffirming our full year guidance across all metrics.
let's turn to slide seven for a review of our first quarter revenue drivers. i'll start with recurring fee revenues. recurring fee revenues rose 8% in the quarter. acquisitions carried the load with 6 points of growth coming from our fiscal fourth quarter 2019 acquisitions, rpm, td and rockall. organic recurring fee growth in the quarter was light at 2%. onboarding of new business or closed sales, as shown here, was the largest organic contributor as we continue to onboard sales across both our ics and gto segments and chip away at our healthy revenue backlog. internal growth, which has been a consistent contributor of organic growth, was modestly negative in the first quarter, driven by slower growth in mutual fund and etf interims, lower customer communications volumes and less professional services work. as tim touched on, we expect organic revenue growth to accelerate in the remainder of the year, driven by gto onboardings, healthy proxy volumes and return to more normalized levels of interim record growth, among other factors.
moving down to total revenue. total revenues declined 2% to $949 million in the quarter. strong gains in recurring fee revenues were offset by the largely expected declines in event-driven fee and related distribution revenues, following record event-driven levels a year ago. and finally, the weaker british pound and the acquisitions of rpm and rockall had a modest negative impact on our fx line.
next, i'll cover the performance of our ics and gto segments on slide eight. as i indicated earlier in my remarks, these results reflect the relocation of certain advisor solutions products from ics to gto for both periods. i'll start with ics. recurring fee revenues grew 4%. looking at the drivers behind the 4% increase, solid net new business gains contributed 3 points, inclusive of the impact from known client losses and customer communications. internal growth dipped to slightly negative largely from the impact of the slowdown in interim record growth to 1%, weaker customer communication volumes and some equity proxy activity that pushed to later in the year. the td ameritrade assets acquisition that closed in q4 of fiscal 2019 contributed an additional 2 points of growth. going forward, we expect the acquisitions of fi360 and appatura will also contribute to ics recurring revenue growth.
we expect ics organic growth to pick up over the balance of fiscal year 2020 as we benefit from the full weight of higher proxy volumes in the second half of the year, the return of interim record growth to more normalized levels and the continued contribution from our data and analytics products. ics total revenues declined 7%, driven primarily by the decline in event-driven revenues and related distribution revenues. again, we now expect full-year event fees to come in at the low-end of our earlier estimate of a decline of 5% to 15% from the $244 million we reported in fiscal 2019.
turning to gto. gto revenue growth accelerated to 15% in q1, driven by 12 points of growth from the rpm and rockall acquisitions. rpm included some strong license sales that tim referenced in his remarks. on the organic front, and as tim also noted, we are back on schedule in terms of major onboarding activity, and we expect gto to deliver mid- to high-single-digit organic growth for the full-year. looking forward, we expect that the revenue growth contribution from acquisitions will wane a bit, even with the addition of shadow and financial database services. and that stronger organic growth will fill that gap as we continue to expect recurring revenue growth in the mid-teens for the year.
let's turn to profits on slide nine. adjusted operating income declined $19 million or 16% in the first quarter, driven by the decline in event-driven fee revenues. remember that event revenues carry significant levels of incremental profitability as they leverage an existing cost infrastructure. so when those revenues come down significantly, as they did in q1, income drops, especially in small earnings quarters like q1.
below the operating income line, we benefit modestly from investment gains. and our effective tax rate was 12.4%. included in that number are excess tax benefits or equity compensation of $5.7 million, down from $7 million a year ago. we continue to expect full-year etb benefit of $20 million. adjusted eps fell 14% to $0.68 for the quarter. representing 13% of our full-year adjusted eps guidance at the midpoint, this result is very consistent with the outlook we provided in august and a typical earnings contribution for the seasonally small first quarter.
let's turn to cash flow and the balance sheet on slide 10. free cash flow is typically negative in the first quarter, and that was again the case in fiscal 2020. broadridge generated free cash flow of negative $107 million in the first quarter. as tim noted, tuck-in m&a is an important part of our capital allocation framework and is tightly aligned with our strategic objectives. broadridge invested $179 million in the first four months of fiscal 2020, completing four acquisitions, the two largest deals, shadow and fi360 accounted for $39 million and $120 million, respectively, and closed in the second quarter. we also made two other smaller acquisitions, one in september and one in october. we expect the fiscal 2019 and 2020 acquisitions combined will contribute 4-plus points to our recurring revenue growth in fiscal 2020.
given our typical reinvestment approach and financing costs, we expect modest eps contribution in fiscal 2020 from these combined deals. it's been a busy few quarters, and we are very pleased with our acquisitions. in the quarter, broadridge also invested $20 million in capital expenditures and returned $55 million to shareholders in the form of a quarterly dividend.
again, broadridge's leverage ratio using adjusted debt-to-ebitdar at september 30 was 2.2 times, and we anticipate that it will tick up a bit again in q2, reflecting the $120 million purchase price for fi360. this is a temporary spike above the long-term target of 2.0 times and as a result of the seasonally negative q1 free cash flow and the timing of m&a closings. there is no change to our capital allocation strategy and leverage target. as we benefit from the seasonally stronger free cash flows in the second half of the year, we expect to delever in the normal course and to generate an additional flexibility to pursue attractive tuck-in m&a opportunities and/or repurchase shares, while finishing the year in line with our 2.0 times leverage target.
separately, you will note that $399 million now appears as current portion of long-term debt. this is because we have $400 million in senior notes coming due in september 2020. to support our capital allocation plans and subject to market conditions, we will consider opportunistically raising additional debt capital at some point over the next couple of quarters in order to appropriately manage our upcoming maturities.
let's turn to guidance on page 11. our fiscal year 2020 guidance is unchanged. we continue to expect recurring fee revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%, that includes mid-single-digit organic growth as we expect organic growth at both ics and gto to pick up through the year. we expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 6%, including a decline in event-driven fee revenues of close to 15%. we expect our adjusted operating income margin to be approximately 18%. we expect adjusted eps growth to be 8% to 12%. we expect closed sales to be in the range of $190 million to $230 million.
finally, as you think about q2, please note that we expect event-driven revenues to be in line with q1 results before strengthening in the second half of the year. with event-driven revenues at this level, we expect q2 adjusted eps to be level with the first quarter result and the approximately 26% or so of full year adjusted eps that the first half typically represents.
so to sum up, we're off to a solid start to fiscal 2020, and we remain on track to deliver a strong fiscal 2020 and our full-year guidance. and importantly, we are also on track to meet our three-year objectives, which conclude at the end of fiscal 2020.
jamie, we'll now open it up for questions.

the first question today comes from david togut with evercore isi. please go ahead.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. good morning. i just like to clarify one part of your updated guidance for fiscal '20, jim. i think initially in the fy '20 guide, you were expecting 4-percentage-point contribution from m&a to recurring fee revenue growth. so originally you were guiding to 8% to 10% recurring fee revenue growth, which implied 4 points from an m&a and 4 points to 6 points organic. but with m&a coming in about 6 percentage points to recurring revenue year-to-date, that implies organic about 2 points lower, more like 2 percentage points to 4 percentage points. so is that correct in the way i'm thinking about that? and then my follow-up really is on the internal revenue growth, which you have down 3% on slide 7. is that really almost all just the decline in event-driven, or is there some other components there that that we should focus on?
james m. young -- corporate vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, david, as i said in my remarks, we now see organic growth at 3% to 4%. and i also said that we expect acquisitions to be another 5-plus points, which gets us back to this range of 8% to 10%. as we look at that internal growth, i think it's important to remember that 3% to 4% is comprised of the softer first half, about 2% and we see strength in the second half, especially the fourth quarter, which helps us exit the year at a healthy rate.
and then, specifically, and it relates to your next question on internal growth. remember that event-driven, is not reported in our recurring revenue. so it's not -- the internal growth is not related to event. what you're seeing in that internal growth is a function of trades, some of the weaker mutual fund communications that tim referenced driving that. when we look in the second half and we think about the strength of our proxy season, a couple of comps just easing a little bit, we think that internal growth flips to positive. so that combination of continued strength on revenue from new sales plus positive internal growth helps us exit the year at a higher organic growth level.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
is the weakness in trade volume is just market conditions being soft, or are you concerned there might be some share shift there?
james m. young -- corporate vice president, chief financial officer
no, this is really the equity volumes that some of the industry has seen much weaker. we were down 16%. and so in hindsight, not a big surprise. but clearly, that's something that usually is sort of neutral to positive. so, we were down 16%, that's going to put some pressure on revenue growth at the margin.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.

the next question comes from patrick o'shaughnessy with raymond james. please go ahead.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. so just wanted to drill down a little bit more into the underlying drivers behind lowering the full-year organic recurring revenue guide to 3% to 4%. i know you spoke about about this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but maybe if you can summarize kind of what are the key moving parts to take that down for the year? and then i think building off of that, what are the implications, if any, in terms of your outlook for fiscal 2021 and beyond for organic recurring revenue growth?
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
patrick, i'm going to start. this is tim. and then, i'm going to let let jim add on to that.
i think one of the broad points is really implicit in what we've been saying, but i think it's worth just restating is that we are really an annual company. and so when you think about what are our drivers of organic growth, it's really around position growth and then revenue from new sales. and in the seasonally small first half that position growth -- it doesn't really have a chance to come through and have the impact that it does for the full year. remember that 70% of our proxy business is in the second half. so i think as we see that position growth coming through and having a bigger impact in the second half, turnaround in some of the smaller internal growth factors that jim talked about, that's why we feel good about -- as well as the continued strong performance on revenue from sales. that's why we feel good about the acceleration in the second half.
and then what you're going to see is that building from q3 into q4. so the exit rate in q4 i think is will be the strongest part of the year and that gives us a good feeling about '21.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. thank you, tim. and then you mentioned in your prepared remarks, some commentary about -- in the communications business, i think increased suppressions weighing on growth going forward. can you provide a little bit more detail on kind of what that means?
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
sure. some our large are always looking at how they manage their costs. and as they've been looking at their client experience, and specifically how they handle the treatment of communications to managed account holders. a couple of the larger clients are taking a little different view on that. and that's something that we think will persist over time. and so they're just doing some fine-tuning about who they send, who they said what to. and so that is -- it didn't have that much an impact in the first half. it will have some impact on the second half and that's built into all the forecasts and guidance that we've given.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
great, thank you.

the next question comes from ken hill with rosenblatt securities. please go ahead.
ken hill -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. i had a question on the ibm deal. i know you talked about it a little bit in the prepared remarks, but i was hoping you can maybe walk through any potential changes we can expect on the operating expenses going forward as a result of that agreement. and then also kind of on the flip side of that, maybe talk a little bit more specifically about some the opportunities you're thinking about given the flexibility of this platform might allow you going forward? thanks.
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, ken, thanks for asking that question. and i'll start and let jim add in anything that i missed. but we're really excited about this.
as i said in my prepared remarks, it's a real step forward in the hybrid multi-cloud strategy. we think it's going to enable us to really speed our time to market and offer enhanced resiliency. it is going to allow us to offer new capabilities over time and really we think, improved the strength of our saas offering. importantly -- and i didn't get into this as much, on the cloud is not a substitute for our public cloud strategy. and we continue to invest strongly with aws. we have 80 teams at work refactoring various applications and modernizing them. and we see that as a real modernization approach.
but the nice thing about the private cloud approach is, it doesn't require any change to the applications, it doesn't require any client testing. and also, there were a number of our associates that moved to ibm. so the associates will be able to continue to support us and have a great career tracks. so we think it's a win for our clients, it's a win for our associates. and it does -- when we talk about what's the impact on our operating expense, it is more efficient and that is going to enable us in the near term to increase our investment in terms of moving to the public cloud and in developing our applications. so it really is a nice move away from spending money on running servers and things like that to being able to invest in things that will make a real difference for our clients.so we are excited about that. and then the last piece is, what it will also free up is capital dollars that we're investing. so in addition to the expense today, we have capital dollars that we won't have in the future.
ken hill -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
okay, thanks for the detail there. one quick one though, on closed sales. i think after the first quarter, you guys were up 103% and then the latest update was up double digits year-to-date basis. is there any more color you can provide on just a second quarter activity?
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
second quarter, we felt really nice about. we have ended the first half really where we had hoped to for the first half. and so it was -- if you take out the very large deal from last year, it was about on track with last year. and the timing between first and second quarter, i think some things happened in q1 that it was great that they happen as early as they did. so we feel really on track in terms of delivering on our full-year sales guidance.
ken hill -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
okay. thanks for taking my questions.

the next question comes from peter heckman with d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
peter heckman -- d.a. davidson & company -- analyst
hey, good morning, gentlemen. just a couple of follow-ups. in terms of the m&a that's contributing to fiscal '20, just in terms of a rough number, the $39 million this quarter, you're thinking somewhere around $140 million for the full year?
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the $39 million at peak for this quarter is...
james m. young -- corporate vice president, chief financial officer
the sales contribution.
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
yes, that's revenue from sales, and not specifically the m&a number.
james m. young -- corporate vice president, chief financial officer
peter, sorry, i may have misunderstood. just -- remember, we're thinking about 5 points -- better than 5 points of growth coming from m&a and our recurring revenue for this year.
peter heckman -- d.a. davidson & company -- analyst
okay. 5 points from recurring. okay. and then in terms of a little bit softer revenue and customer communications, are you seeing any acceleration to e-delivery or e-billing that that's playing into that, or is it other issues?
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
we're just -- you're a little soft. we're processing the question, pete. but it is -- i think i would say yes and no as my answer, which is we do definitely see continued traction on digital, and that's a very positive thing. but that's not because of what you're seeing this quarter. so what you're seeing this quarter is really very much around the wholesale business and the change we saw in really volumes there. and again we projected those volumes going forward for the second half. and we'll -- just because i -- if you say digital, sort of get my juices flowing. i can't help but talk about that a little bit. if you look at some of the things that we have going on in digital, over the past two years, we have onboarded more than 100 mutual fund complexes and transitioned from dst onto our next-generation cloud-driven our digital platform.
and we really transferred that like-to-like in the initial instance, but that platform has significant capabilities that those funds aren't using today. and so we think that's a really, really nice digital opportunity for us over time and that will see some nice acceleration there. so we do remain excited about digital, but that wasn't the impact this quarter.
peter heckman -- d.a. davidson & company -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from chris donat with piper sandler. please go ahead.
christopher donat -- sandler o'neill partners -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. tim, i wanted to follow up something you said in your prepared remarks about the volume of new mutual fund etf sales in the quarter. and i know it had a tough comp, but i'm just wondering if you're seeing any impact on new etf sales now that a lot of the online brokers have gone to zero trading fees? it seems to me like you might see some adjustment in some of the etfs that were branded by a large broker that now, maybe there's less interest in or i might be wrong, but anyway, i'm just curious if you've seen any change in end market demand for some etfs?
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i don't think that we are seeing anything related to to the zero trading. i think when we look back and try to correlate this, and you can imagine that we spent if you late nights trying to -- well, not me, but the team here -- as i said, a few late nights trying to correlate that. and we really see -- the best correlation we see is really with the vix and with volatility. and so we had in periods of high volatility, there can be a lot of rebalancing activity. so i was calling it new sales and new purchases, but a lot of this has to do with, we think that decisions that individual investors may not be making themselves but is happening as a matter of rebalancing of large portfolios and managed accounts.
and so i'm not thinking it's on the zero trading side. and i am thinking it's a matter of just with the pretty quiescent quarter that we just passed, there wasn't a lot of that rebalancing activity.
christopher donat -- sandler o'neill partners -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then on the -- just on the acquisition front, as you've done a lot of them. as we think forward to fiscal 2021 -- whatever. i assume you're keeping the same playbook in terms of accretion, but can you just remind us what your expectations are for accretion from the four acquisitions you cited in the press release, for example? what's a reasonable expectation for what they'll contribute?
james m. young -- corporate vice president, chief financial officer
chris, this is jim. as you recall, most of these acquisitions in the first year, which is everything we're talking about because a lot of these were done in q4 and then just this year, are pretty neutral to the year. the only -- so i think the assumption is relatively modest. there -- as tim mentioned, a couple of the businesses are over-performing ready and doing pretty well. so nice contributions. in the grand scheme of broadridge earnings, nothing that moves the needle but nice contributions above our business case, which means that we get a little bit of contribution above and beyond the plan, but nothing that is significant in that respect and worthy of call out.
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think i would say that the -- they are not accretive in the first year. their margins do increase over time. i think that's really built into the 50 basis points per year that we tend to talk about and have delivered on for a long time. so i would really think about it that way. it is this occasion, talk a little bit more broadly about m&a and i've talked before about how we see this as an evergreen opportunity for broadridge because this always change and always teams creating new opportunities. and we've really seen this year that play out in terms of when we can make these companies sort of under our umbrella using our master services agreement, our sales force, our servicing, how that really adds value to them and why it has such good returns from this over time.
and just -- they are not -- we're not buying these and holding them as sort of a separate things and ending up as a collection of stuff there. they're being nicely integrated into our product offers and into our service delivery. so we think this is really something that is an important part of our growth strategy that will continue. this year it is at a higher level than it typically has been. and as you know, we take a lot of time looking at what are the things that we would like to own and we do that well in advance. and many of these conversations and many of these are companies we've been talking to for many years. we don't necessarily control when they decide they want to transact, but it's nice that we have with our balance sheet and and leverage and other things, we have the ability to act when people do want to transact. and then we think we have really nice business cases around these.
christopher donat -- sandler o'neill partners -- analyst
thanks. that's very helpful.

the next question comes from darrin peller with wolfe research. please go ahead. mr. peller, your line is open.
andrew -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning, guys. this is andrew [phonetic], on behalf of darrin peller.
i just wanted to touch upon wealth management briefly. are you guys seeing any incremental interest in the market due to the ubs announcement over the last couple of quarters? and how is that translating into the closed sales you've seen in the last couple of quarters?
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i will take that. it's tim. thank you, andrew. we are definitely seeing lot of good interest. first of all, we're making good progress on the implementation with ubs. we had a very high number of deliverables for the first year, which i'm pleased to say we finished on track. and so we're excited about that. we're seeing a lot of interest from others in terms of -- with the agreement around the pain points that we've identified and the interest and really being part of the open architecture platform of the future. and so that is good. in terms of specifically on the broad platform, the momentum in terms of closed sales, it's really too early for that. these are long conversations and people want to see it further along in the build, but those conversations are very positive.
what we have seen is we do have a lot of component solutions in and around that platform, and those have had nice momentum. i mentioned the sale of advisor compensation solution to a leading wealth manager. that was the largest sale ever for that business and that is a really nicely growing business for us and plays right into things like reg bi, when you think about the number of conversations we're having with clients about reg bi and all the solutions that we bring to the table, communication solutions, the advisory solutions, and with fi360, the ability to help people really looking to their portfolios and make sure that they are suitable.
so lots of good things happening in wealth. it's really nicely growing area for us. and then i have to just do a call out to mike alexander, who just this past week we asked to take leadership of this combined business, which we are now bringing together under one leadership. so we feel really good about it and continue to make good progress.
andrew -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks. and then with regards to the customer communications business, it continues to be a headwind in the ics segment. when should we expect you start to grow over the one large client that you called out in the past? or is it a couple of other clients that you're seeing some declines in?
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'm glad you asked that so we can just clarify this, because in what we talked about externally as customer communications, there are a few different business lines. the largest line is the transactional communications business and that is a business we've talked about quite a bit in previous calls that has had -- was affected by that client -- those departing. this quarter it was not the transactional communications business. and the transition of that client is essentially complete. so you won't hear us talk about that again in the future. and that business was stable, it didn't grow, but it didn't shrink either. and so the 3% you saw -- minus 3% you saw this quarter was related to the post sale business that we talked about. and then i'll just -- i will say on the transaction communications business, just even though -- just to remind people, even though the revenues haven't gone down, it has been a nice contributor to earnings, and because the synergies and other things in the acquisitions, it has been growing earnings over the time that we've been talking about it. so that's where that is. it was stable this quarter. i'm not going to -- i'm not putting out the mission accomplished sign here, but that transition off of the larger client is complete now.
andrew -- wolfe research -- analyst
no, i appreciate the color.

this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to tim gokey for any closing remarks.
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i would just like to thank you everyone being on the call today. we remain very excited about our revenue from closed sales, about the level of sales activity, the backlog, the m&a performance. we're looking forward to increase in organic in the second half, and we just remain really confident and excited about what our long-term opportunity is. and i'll just bring you back to the conversations that i've had since the beginning of january with leaders of our largest clients. and when we look at the challenge that they face and transformations that they are looking to do, and the alignment of what we are doing with what their needs are, i feel very optimistic about the future of broadridge. thank you.

good morning, and welcome to the broadridge second quarter 2020 earnings conference call.
[operator instructions]
please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to edings thibault, head of investor relations. mr. thibault, please go ahead.
w. edings thibault -- head of investor relations
thanks, dana. good morning everyone and welcome to broadridge's fiscal second quarter 2020 earnings conference call.
our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the investor relations section of broadridge.com. joining me on the call this morning are tim gokey, our ceo, and our cfo, jim young.
before i turn the call over to tim, a few standard reminders. we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding broadridge that involve risks. a summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides, and a more complete description on our annual report on form 10-k.
we will also be referring to several non-gaap measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of broadridge's underlying operating results. an explanation of these non-gaap measures and reconciliations to their comparable gaap measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation.
let me now turn the call over to tim gokey.
timothy c. gokey -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, edings, and good morning.
i'll begin today with some key highlights in the second quarter, which are on slide 4. broadridge continued to execute well in a mixed quarter. recurring revenues rose 7% to $648 million, driven by strong revenue from sales as well as contributions from recent acquisitions. i'm especially encouraged by the second quarter record $39 million of revenue from closed sales, which showed the impact of our strong backlog and client demand. lower market-driven activity prevented an even higher result and we expect organic growth to pick up in the second half leading to 8% to 10% year for recurring revenue.
that said, event-driven activity came in significantly below our expectations leading to 5% decline in adjusted eps in a seasonally small quarter. we now expect a lower level of event-driven activity to persist into the second half of fiscal '20. importantly, our recent acquisitions are performing strongly. both rpm and td ameritrade, which we acquired in q4, are significantly ahead of last year and ahead of our expectations. it's great to see the revenue synergies playing out early.
broadridge's value proposition continues to resonate strongly with our clients. we posted another strong sales quarter. and year-to-date, our sales are up double digits, excluding the ubs mega deal from a year ago. looking forward, we have now entered the more significant second half of the year where we typically generate more than 70% of our earnings.
i'm pleased to say we remain on track to achieve our recurring revenue and adjusted eps guidance for the full year. we expect recurring revenue growth of 8% to 10%, driven by stronger organic growth and continued strength in the recent acquisitions. as i noted earlier, we expect event-driven activity to remain soft with event-driven revenue decline of 20% to 30% for the full year. it's a real tribute to the resiliency of our business model that despite that pressure, we continue to expect to deliver within our 8% to 12% adjusted eps guidance, albeit at the low end.
in sum, we remain confident in our opportunities. nothing about the short-term fluctuations in event-activity, which we've seen many times before, changes that. we continue to see strong sales and strong performance, and we continue to invest in new products and technologies, and we see exciting milestones later this year.
with that, let's turn to slide 5 to dig a little deeper into our operating results, starting with our ics segment. ics recurring revenues excluding customer communications rose 9%, driven by 4% organic growth and the addition of the td ameritrade retirement assets and a recent fi360 acquisition. the biggest engine of organic growth was mutual funds and etf interims, where we benefited from strong fund flows which helped drive 6% fund interims record growth. also contributing to our growth was continued demand for data and analytics products, which posted another quarter of double-digit growth.
as i mentioned earlier, the business we acquired from td within our fund processing business is off to a strong start. net growth was offset by drag from customer communications, which declined 3% due to weaker mutual fund communications especially, lower post sale prospectus volumes. we provide prospectuses to broker clients when they purchase their first shares of a new fund to etf. during the second quarter, that business was impacted by a double-digit decline in the volume of new mutual fund etf sales as we lapped the significant purchase volumes we saw during last year's period of market volatility.
we're also seeing a modest impact from increased suppressions, which we expect to weigh on growth going forward. the good news is that the larger transactional communications business stabilized, with revenue from sales offsetting losses and erosion. despite the progress in recurring, the biggest driver of ics results was the event-driven revenues, which declined $17 million or 36% year-over-year. what was striking was the overall low level of event-driven activity. as you know, the largest part of event-driven revenue is related to the timing of mutual fund and etf board elections, which take place every five to seven years. this activity was at a low point for the decade. the long-term underlying positive driver here is mutual fund and etf position growth, which has risen at a high-single-digit rate for the past decade, driven by the importance of mutual funds and etfs as savings vehicles for millions of americans.
a smaller driver of event revenues is activity related to special meetings, triggered by public company m&a and/or shareholder activism. these results are even more volatile and difficult to forecast and were notably weak in the second quarter. given both the low rate environment and the money invested in active strategies, we continue to believe these revenues will grow over any medium term period. event-driven activity is a core part of our governance business and a contributor to our long-term growth in earnings. it is lumpier than the rest of our business, which is why we break it out separately. that said, our adjusted eps guidance shows our business model can withstand a fair degree of pressure here and still deliver attractive returns while continuing to invest for long-term growth. jim will touch on event-driven trends in more detail in his section.
let's turn to gto, where we're growing our business through a combination of tuck-in acquisitions and delivering on our revenue backlog. gto revenues grew 14% to $281 million. our recent acquisitions were the biggest contributor to our second quarter growth. over the past three quarters, broadridge has made five tuck-in m&a investments to help strengthen our capital markets, wealth and investment management product suites. we're making very strong progress in integrating these acquisitions and are seeing good growth that's ahead of our business plan. our clients have reacted positively to broadridge taking over these and we've seen multiple instances where clients upsized new contracts or extended the term of existing ones from one to two years, to four to five years. that's a strong testament to broadridge and to the strategic fit of our recent additions.
the next biggest contributor in q2 was revenue from sales, which was a healthy 8% reflecting our ability to translate our strong backlog and sale into recurring revenue. this is offset to some degree by trading weakness and equities and other pressures, and organic growth ticked up modestly from q1 to 4%. looking ahead, the combination of strong revenue from sales and easing of other pressures puts us on track to achieve stronger organic growth in the second half.
i'll close my review of our second quarter operating results by touching on closed sales. notable sales in the second quarter included an advisor compensation sale to a leading independent wealth manager and an up-sales to a global investment bank. excluding the large wealth management sale from ubs that we closed in october of last fiscal year, year-to-date closed sales are up double digits, which speaks to the appeal of broadridge's value proposition.
let's move to slide 6 for a review of regulatory topics and recent strategic initiatives. on regulatory initiatives, the sec continues to assess a range of topics that touch on our business. i'll start with a change that is well under way. rule 30e-3 are notice & access for mutual funds. this is the rule that was adopted in june of 2018 and will go into effect in calendar 2021 along mutual funds to send their investors a notice that annual and semiannual reports are available instead of saying the full report. we're actively engaged with hundreds of fund families to help them notify the investors their investors for the prospective change and capture their preferences. this regulation will have only modestly positive impact on broadridge, but thanks to our work, mutual funds will be able to realize significant print and distribution savings beginning next year. it's one more instance of broadridge saving the industry time and money.
at the same time the sec adopted 30e-3, it also asked for comments on the future client experience for mutual fund communications. broadridge and industry participants submitted comments a little over a year ago showing how the current format can be streamlined and the critical information investors need around fees and performance can be better highlighted in simpler, easier-to-understand formats. we're now seeing some momentum around this topic. the sec staff has said in public forums that it's considering options for shorter and more engaging report. and in november, this topic of streamline communications has moved onto the sec's short-term agenda.
given the importance of mutual funds to the savings of 10s of millions of households, we favor any step to ensure main street investors to have better access to the critical information they need and the streamlined digital communications can deliver this information more effectively at a much lower total cost.
finally, on the product deployment side, instead of working groups established last summer on various topics including end-to-end confirmation, obo/nobo, universal proxy, fees and future technology opportunities. these groups meet periodically and have no timeline for issuing a recommendation to the sec. that said, broadridge is working closely with [indecipherable] stakeholders to develop an industry consensus around end-to-end vote confirmation, which is a key priority for the sec.
stepping back, the sec has shown that it is clearly engaged and trying to understand how it can strengthen our corporate governance system and make it more cost effective. thoughtfully moving 30e-3 forward while simultaneously seeking information on how to make communications more effective is positive for broadridge. the sec appears to have a clear goal, use technology to help drive down costs and increase shareholder engagement. given our investments in these areas and our long-term focus, we think we are well positioned to help achieve that objective.
broadridge remains committed to investing in our long-term growth. since we reported first quarter earnings in november, we've announced two additional acquisitions. the first, clearstructure strengthens the investment management part of our wealth business. clearstructure broadens our asset class coverage to include more fixed income capabilities. it's well aligned with our strategy of building a true cross-asset platform to enable asset managers to have a single view into their book of business and optimize their investment workflow on a front-to-back basis.
second acquisition, which we announced last week, will further our strategy of building a leading regulatory communications business in europe. combining fundslibrary's capabilities to fund document and data dissemination with broadridge's existing regulatory communications offerings will strengthen our business in europe and elsewhere by helping fund managers meet the regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions. coming on the back of our other recent acquisitions, including rockall and rpm in the fourth quarter, and shadow and fi360 early in the second quarter, broadridge is continuing to push hard on strengthening our core franchise business across governance, capital markets and wealth. these acquisitions will extend our ability to bring value to our clients and are integral part of our capital stewardship and long-term growth strategy.
another key part of our value proposition is helping our clients access new technologies, especially across the abcds of innovation, ai, blockchain, cloud and digital. so i'm excited by the launch of the broadridge private cloud powered by ibm. by transitioning our global distributor technology platforms at ibm, we will be able to accelerate our hybrid multi-cloud strategy. broadridge private cloud will enable us to more rapidly provision additional capacity of services for our global clients, while increasing overall resilience of our network. extending our long-standing partnership with ibm also positions us to use red hat technology to containerize our apps, which enables them to run both in our private cloud as well as on aws. accelerating our hybrid cloud strategy will enable broadridge to further deliver next generation saas solutions.
investing in new products and capabilities is a key part of our formula for long-term success. we're funding these growth investments even in a year when we were seeing pressure from event-driven revenues and technology investments across the abcds [phonetic]. these investments are translating into a very healthy pipeline of innovative new capabilities that create additional value for clients and shareholders, driving top quartile results over time. in governance, we're rolling out modernized proxy templates as we speak. we're launching an industry solution for 30e-3, and we've introduced a new global fund analytics platform. we're bringing enhanced digital capabilities to our communications clients, and using distributed ledger technology to enable european banks and brokers to meet the requirements and the shareholder rights directive. capital markets. we continue to strengthen our global post trade management platform. we're also expecting a soft launch over the summer of our ai-driven fixed income trading capability, and launching a repo market solutions based on blockchain in fiscal '21. we expect both of these internal builds to contribute meaningfully in the future.
and of course, we're making very good progress in building the next-generation industry platform for the wealth management industry, which we expect will come live in 2021. earlier this week, we named mike alexander as head of our newly combined wealth business, an important milestone in the creation of this new franchise. this january 2, i've met with more than a dozen ceos and other senior leaders at our largest clients. these conversations leave me more convinced than ever about the opportunity we have in front of us. it's clear that financial services ceos are very engaged in driving technology and business transformation, and they're are excited about broadridge as a key partner with them on industry solution with next-generation technology that will simplify and improve their operations.
for all these reasons, our technology leadership, organic product investments, continued tuck-in m&a, and healthy sales pipeline, i'm confident and excited about how broadridge is capitalizing on a strong and growing market opportunity to create sustained growth not only in the second half of fiscal 2020, but well into the future.
before i turn the call over to jim, i want to thank our associates for the work they do to help our clients and enable better financial lives for millions by powering investing, governance and communications, is making a real difference.
let me now turn the call over to jim to walk through our financial. jim?
james m. young -- corporate vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, tim, and good morning everyone.
our q2 financial results had some very positive signs, but we're below our own expectations. however, we are on track to deliver against our fiscal-year 2020 guidance and long-term objectives. before reviewing our results, i'll make a few call-outs.
first, event-driven activity. event fees declined notably from q2 a year ago, driving a decline in our second quarter earnings. event fees were also much lighter than our expectations. we now expect full-year event-driven fee revenues to be down 20% to 30% versus last year. second, recurring growth. recurring growth for the quarter was 7% with strong contributions from new sales and acquisitions. third, organic growth. organic recurring fee growth was light at 1.5% in the quarter. new revenue from sales contributed a q2-record of $39 million or 6 points to organic growth in the quarter. that strong result was offset by negative internal growth. we expect organic growth to pick up in the second half as sales contributions remain strong and internal growth flips to positive.
fourth, capital. two updates here. the first is m&a. since our last call, we've announced two additional tuck-in acquisitions, clearstructure and
fundslibrary that brings our fiscal year-to-date m&a investments to approximately $310 million. the second update is our debt offering. we issued $750 million in 10-year senior notes at 2.9% coupon in early december highlighting the value of our strong capital structure.
the fifth call-out is the broadridge private cloud. in the second quarter, we recorded charges of $33 million, representing a non-cash loss on the hardware assets to be transferred to ibm and other related charges. sixth and final, guidance. our overall guidance remains broadly unchanged. however, given the slow start to the year in organic growth, we expect organic growth to have less of a contribution to our total recurring fee growth of 8% to 10% versus contributions from acquisitions with full-year organic growth of 3% to 4% versus our prior view of 5% to 7%. additionally, we expect the weakness and event driven activity to continue into the second half. however, we remain on track to deliver 8% to 12% adjusted eps growth albeit at the low end, given the event pressures.
let's turn to slide 7 for a review of our second quarter revenue drivers. i'll start with recurring fee revenues. overall, our recurring fee revenues rose 7% in the quarter. within recurring fees, we are especially pleased with our sales-driven growth contributing 6 points to growth. this is a q2 record as we continue to make progress against our healthy revenue backlog. acquisitions also contributed 6 points of growth as a very productive nine months of tuck-in acquisition work are yielding meaningful revenue additions. internal growth, which has been a consistent contributor, was notably negative in the second quarter and a drag on organic growth. as tim noted, lower customer communications volumes and lower trading volumes were the chief contributors here. again this negative 3 points of growth dampened an otherwise good quarter on sales to revenue conversion.
we expect organic revenue growth to improve in our seasonally larger second half and to exit the year at a healthy clip. the improvement should come should come from the combination of sustained strong sales to revenue performance and internal growth flipping to positive territory.
moving down to total revenue. total revenues grew 2% to $969 million in the quarter. strong gains in recurring revenues were offset by declines in event-driven fees, which also impacted distribution revenues. and finally, foreign exchange impacts related to growth in our international businesses from acquisitions, most notably rpm, lowered revenue growth by 1 point.
next i'd like to put some context around q2 and year-to-date of event activity. let's turn to slide 8. the biggest driver of event-driven volatility is the timing of a large mutual funds go out for proxy. another driver volatility is large high-profile equity contest, which are generally episodic and unpredictable. we've experienced both large funds going out for proxy and big contests in recent years, especially fiscal '18. year-to-date, we have had no such large events and at the same time, saw very light activity across more run-of-the-mill requests special meetings, various types of mutual fund shareholder communications and capital markets transactions.
to put that in context, comparing our fiscal '20 results to our five-year history shows that q2 total event fees of $31 million were 36% below last year, 42% below our q2 average, and just above the five-year low in fiscal '17. the story is largely the same across both equity and mutual fund types of event revenue. the mutual fund activity slowed and it's certainly more pronounced, especially as we are not seeing any large campaigns. we believe this represents cyclical softness and not some broader secular trend.
looking ahead, we expect that period of softness to extend into the second half. we are expecting activity to pick up sequentially in the second half both as a result of normal seasonality as well as our visibility into a few small-to-medium-size mutual fund proxy campaigns. for the full year, we expect event-driven fee revenue to be in the range of $175 million to $195 million, down about 20% to 30% from last year, well below our five-year average and closer to the five-year low. that implies $104 million to $124 million for the second half. this is down considerably from our outlook a quarter ago, but still at a manageable level.
next, i'll cover the performance of our ics and gto segments on slide 9. i'll start with ics. i've already covered event-driven revenues, so i'll focus on recurring revenues, which grew 3%. looking at the drivers behind the 3% increase, solid net new business gains contributed 3 points. internal growth did negative, largely from the impact of lower customer communications volumes, offset by higher mutual fund interims. recent acquisitions contributed an additional 3 points of growth with td outperforming. we expect ics organic revenue growth to pick up over the balance of fiscal '20 as we benefit from the full weight of higher proxy volumes in the second half of the year, but to be a little below our historical 4% to 6% annual growth rates, as the decline in mutual fund communications that tim referenced will continue to be a drag on growth over the balance of fiscal '20.
ics total revenues declined 2%, driven primarily by the decline in event-driven revenues and related distribution revenues. we expect the distribution revenue decline to abate in the second half of the year, driven by expected higher regulatory communications and other mix shifts.
turning to gto. revenues rose 14%, driven by the acquisitions of rpm and rockall, and more recently shadow and clearstructure. organic growth was 4%, driven by new revenue from sales, which drove 8 points of growth as we on-boarded new clients onto our platforms. this is offset in part by a decline in equity volumes. looking ahead, gto is well positioned for accelerating growth. we expect the continued benefit of strong sales to revenue growth as we continue to work through our large revenue backlog. we also expect internal growth to turn firmly positive on easing pressures. net-net, we expect gto organic revenue growth to be mid-to-high single-digit range in the back half of the year. combined with acquisitions, we expect strong teens total growth for gto in the second half.
let's turn to profits on slide 10. adjusted operating income declined $7 million or 7%, driven by a decline in event-driven revenues. as most of you know, event-driven revenues are highly profitable, so they tend to have an outsized effect on our income when they decline. adjusted eps benefited modestly from a lower tax rate due to the relative size of the excess tax benefit for equity compensation, which was $2 million. with $8 million year-to-date, we continue to expect a full-year etb benefit of $20 million.
pausing to look at our gaap eps, you can clearly see the effect of $33 million charge associated with the private cloud agreement with ibm this quarter. we've excluded this charge from our adjusted results.
next is cash flow and the balance sheet on slide 11. broadridge generated free cash flow of negative $32 million for the first half of the year. this is not uncommon for our seasonal cash flow especially with [indecipherable]. we continue to expect healthy free cash flow for the full year, and good contribution from the seasonally stronger second half of the year. important facet of the private cloud agreement is the reduction in our overall capital spending related to technology infrastructure as we move to a more consumption-based model. we expect to see some benefit from that in the second half.
rounding out free cash flow and as we discussed, in august, we are seeing continued investment commensurate with our revenue backlog related to client-driven work we are doing to build out our global post trade management platform and our new wealth product along with more general client onboardings. this anticipated pick up is evident in our first half free cash flows. as noted, we remain active on the m&a front this quarter. and with three acquisitions representing an aggregate purchase price of about $230 million, that brings our year-to-date investment in m&a to approximately $270 million. this does not include our acquisition of fundslibrary for approximately $69 million announced last week. given two dividend distributions, our capital return to shareholders this year has been $117 million. finally, on capital, our senior notes issuance gives us liquidity to refinance our upcoming $400 million bond maturity in september of this calendar year, fund additional acquisitions if the opportunity arises, and/or return capital to shareholders.
let's turn to guidance on page 12, and starting with recurring revenues. we continue to expect recurring fee revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%. after a slow start to the year, we now see organic growth for the full year at 3% to 4%, down from 5% to 7%. we expect organic growth to pick up in the second half of 2020, as a result of healthy proxy revenue as we enter the heart of the proxy season, continued good growth in mutual fund and etf interims, and gto acceleration as we see continued benefit from new sales additions and an easing of internal growth comps. these drivers will be partially offset by continued weakness in ics customer communications revenue.
in addition, we expect our acquisitions to contribute 5-plus points to broadridge's overall recurring fee growth rate for the year. total revenues. we expect total revenue growth to be in the range 3% to 6% even with this latest outlook for event activities. adjusted eps. our guidance for adjusted eps growth of 8% to 12% is unchanged. however, given lower event-driven revenues, we expect to be at the low end of that range. closed sales. we continue to expect closed sales to be in the range of $190 million to $230 million. finally, we have adjusted our guidance for both gaap operating income and diluted eps to reflect higher acquisition amortization and the private cloud-related charge.
in summary, after a slow start to the year, we expect gto acceleration and a healthy proxy season to drive improved organic growth in the seasonally bigger second half of the year, and we remain on track to deliver our full-year revenue and earnings guidance. and importantly, we are also on track to meet our three-year objectives for fiscal years '18 through '20.
and with that operator, we'll open it up for questions.
",2020-Q2,BR
,1.0,,1.0,":
operator
absolutely, sir. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from darrin peller with wolfe research. please go ahead.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
all right. hey. thanks, guys. jim, first of all, i just want to say congrats to you. we're going to -- obviously, going to miss you, but all the best, jim.
guys, when we think about the structural opportunities you're seeing from this environment and what we saw last quarter was obviously a strong position growth and a very real demand for your gto business, given just demand from financial institutions, i think, and volumes obviously helped. but when we look at your guidance, obviously you're still suggesting low -- 2% to 6%, which is a decel from now, and i know there's tough comps. what i guess i'm trying to figure out is what's already done by bookings? what's already -- what you already know about? and then when we consider what could be sustainable, couldn't position growth being strong be sustainable now in the environment or given how many more retail investors, fractional shares, free trading? so, maybe just start there if you can.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes, sure. darrin, it's tim. thank you. thank you very much. we feel very good about -- let me just step back for a second. we feel very good about the long-term trends supporting our business and supporting our organic growth and our overall growth strategy, and we'll talk about that in december.
and definitely, as we were looking pre-crisis at our preliminary plans, we had a growth rate that was more in the 6% range. and as we have evaluated things and looked at where we are now, we see a few different factors knocking a couple of points off of that.
one is a more cautious view on stock-record growth. that is definitely baked into our plan. i can come back and talk about it in a second. the other is interest rates, which affect our matrix unit. and the third is a little bit lower revenue from sales not because we don't think our sales will be strong, but just focus a little bit on the pace of client implementation.
so, those three factors, just about equally weighted, account for about two points relative to what we would have thought was our initial plan. and we think that is prudent and that will be in a very good position. i think that positions us well to invest and it positions us well to really undertake any variety of scenarios.
i think also on the event side, we're being same as flat to this year, which is pretty muted. and so, i think that takes a lot of risks out of this plan, but it really enables us to focus it on the investment.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
tim, i mean, just to quickly follow on to that, i mean the position growth or the record growth itself, i mean, it looks like we're in this environment where retail investors are obviously more involved. and i think just it's easier to buy, whether it's free trading or fractional shares. so, i guess i'd be curious why you're assuming a low-single-digit growth rate there?
and then just broadly, i guess what i was really looking for -- structurally speaking -- given the environment we're in now with more digital transformation, what are you pointing to as where broadridge is benefiting from this environment now, because it can provide the needs for clients whether it's banks or customer communications?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes, absolutely. so, first of all, on the stock record growth, we don't have a crystal ball. what we saw was certainly good stock-record growth this year, lower interim record growth. so, when you average those two together, this year, it was about 5% and we're going into next year looking at something that's a little bit lower than that.
on the how we benefit from the increased digital demand, we see it really both on the communications side. we're seeing good growth in our digital communications. we're seeing it on the data analytics side. we're seeing it -- we're very excited about the launch of our digitally based fixed income trading platform. so, we're seeing it really across lots of different arenas darrin.
the -- obviously, the strong growth in virtual shareholder meetings, which we expect to continue this year, that's -- was a real nice pickup for us. and so, it's really across the breadth of our product areas.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. it's great to see. thanks, guys. appreciate it.

our next question today comes from david togut with evercore isi. please go ahead.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. good morning, and all the best to you jim in the next chapter.
jim young -- corporate senior vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, david.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
good to see the 55% new sales growth in the quarter and you did callout strong sales in particular in capital markets. can you talk about the propensity of big banks outsourced in this environment, given some of the headwinds and tailwinds that they face?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
sure, david. we are -- we're seeing a -- i think a really interesting tension there because their need is higher than ever. and then, at the same time, because of all the complexity of everything's going on, there's a question about undertaking transformational projects.
and so, i think one of the things that we really saw at the end of this year was a significantly higher demand for lots of smaller projects that can -- that can make a big impact. and so, we saw a lot of those, and then some good medium-sized projects.
and we were pleased that the derivatives deal that i spoke about, very transformational project for that institution and that's something they want to carry forward and move ahead with, even despite the complexity of the pandemic and the complexity of doing everything remotely.
so, we're seeing some institutions really moving forward strongly and taking advantage of this and investing. we're seeing other institutions hang back. we think the net-net of that, though, is going to be continued very positive sales.
we did see really strong pick-up in our international sales. so, our sales outside the u.s. were up more than 50% and we see a continued strong pipeline outside the u.s. as well, so really, really nice progress across the board.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
appreciate that. and then as a follow-up, can you update us on the onboarding and development process around the big ubs wealth management contract? and --- to what extent is -- could that serve as a, let's say, a launch pad in the business given demand you might be seeing from other wealth managers currently?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes, absolutely. so, that project remains really well on-track. we are very-very pleased with the progress there. we're continuing to strengthen our wealth capability, not just with that project but also with the m&a that we've done and with some of the smaller component sales. so -- and i'll come back to ubs in a second, but just to reiterate the recent acquisition, the rpm acquisition, the rockall acquisition performing really really strongly.
i think as we look at ubs and what follows on from it, i think what we're seeing from the largest clients now is interest in seeing that go live. there were lots of discussions, but very, very much wanting to see that go live, which is on-track to do. but what it is doing is it is increasing our credibility overall in the wealth space. and so, we're seeing significant increase in demand across the rest of our wealth portfolio.
as you know, we appointed mike alexander, president, in the third quarter. that's been a key step in making this a stand-alone business and his leadership is really helping us well.
so, across our wealth strategy, we feel really good. the ubs piece is one component of that. our component solutions is another piece of it and the strength of some of the new acquisitions is a third piece.
operator
and our next question today comes from peter heckmann with d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
alexis huseby -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hi, guys. this is alexis huseby on for pete today. thanks for taking our questions. so, you mentioned the distribution revenue would be flat to down in fiscal '21. and i'm wondering if you can help us with the approximate impact to that, that comes specifically from 30e-3.
matt connor -- interim cfo
i will take a crack at that, but i'm looking also at our cfo to see if he has a comment, which he may not. so, i think it is broadly relatively small in this coming year. and as you know, we've said 30e-3 is a very mild positive for us, so not -- we really think about it -- since the distribution piece is really low to no margin, we really focus on the recurring piece.
so, from an overall recurring revenue and profitability, we see it as neutral to slight positive. specifically, on the distribution revenue side, it's a mild negative, but not something that is really materially changing the numbers.
alexis huseby -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. that makes sense. and then i think i heard you mention 1% in recurring revenue, but could you help us with the approximate part of revenue carried into fiscal '21 from prior deals?
jim young -- corporate senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes. this is jim. we -- that's correct. about one point of growth is embedded in our guidance. and if you recall, with a couple of deals come a little bit later in the year like fi360 and fundslibrary, which will carry through. so, it'll be about one point of growth in '21.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
and just as a reminder, so that's the carryover impact in our guidance. never anticipates any m&a that might occur in the coming year.
operator
and our next question today comes from ken hill with rosenblatt. please go ahead.
ken hill -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. quick question on data analytics. you guys had highlighted here in the slide deck that still in really good growth there. i was wondering, just given the covid environment, we're seeing more and more peers really make greater investment in the area. how you guys are thinking about some initiatives here over the course of the next fiscal year to really kind of ramp up the offering there?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. so, there are a couple of areas, ken, where i think this is interesting. so, most of our investment over the past few years in data analytics has been in serving the fund industry. we have a suite of solutions that gives the fund industry transparency into fund flows, their sales, their share performance.
and one of the key things that we've really done in terms of investment is pull together data sets that used to be disparate and that fund companies used to have to acquire from different places and knit together and that was very complex for them. and with our global distribution products, they can now have retail and institutional north america, europe, asia and pull all that into one data set. and that is something that is really helpful, especially for the largest global asset managers.
so, that continues to be a real growth area for us. and in this period of uncertainty and volatility, they're looking for even more transparency than ever.
the other one i will just mention is not -- we don't usually talk about it relative to data analytics, but when you talk about leveraging the data we have, we've been working for quite a while in terms of how do we leverage the fixed income data that we have. and we were making some significant investments in that the past few years and the ai-enabled fixed income platform that we're about to launch this fall is something that is going to really leverage that fixed income data in a way institution by institution. that will bring ai to fixed income traders, allow them to figure out natural counterparties for complex trades and enable them to carry out those trades. and that's one of the things probably in the whole company that we're most excited about.
ken hill -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. one other question i had, you guys -- historically, you've broken out a bit of a live, not live yet recurring revenue backlog. any color on the $355 million, how that looks now?
matt connor -- interim cfo
yes. so, kind about two-thirds of that is not yet live at all. so, we've got obviously, really good visibility and a whole bunch of -- a bunch of this is sort of pure growth as we onboard it, recognizing there'll be a really large piece associated with the ubs deal, which really won't have any impact in '21, more of a 2022 event.
operator
and our next question today comes from puneet jain with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
puneet jain -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question and, jim, all the best and hope our paths cross again.
jim young -- corporate senior vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, puneet.
puneet jain -- jpmorgan -- analyst
so, one question, tim, on pipeline. like, how's your pipeline converting into revenue? any impact -- any actual impact you have seen on implementations from the pandemic and also on the sales cycle? just wanted to make sure like the recession impact on sales guidance, have you started seeing slowdown in the first four months or in the last four or five months was this being conservative given the uncertainty?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. puneet, thank you for that question. so, we -- broadly, the impact has been surprisingly low. and i'll talk about each of the different pieces.
so, first of all, in terms of completing sales, obviously, we just had a terrific sales quarter. and to be fair, a lot of those sales were on the one yard line at the beginning of the pandemic and we certainly saw institutions carrying on and finishing those.
in terms of the sales cycle, obviously, we measure at each of the different stages in terms of pipeline creation and moving things through the pipeline. and we have seen modestly lower pipeline creation in the last 12 weeks. and i'll say it's a modest delta. it's not a huge delta.
part of it puneet, is we can't really be sure, because given the amount of focus that we had on closing that degree of business, it's very hard for us to discern whether lower pipeline creation is just our own capacity or anything that's going on out there in the world.
so, that will develop. that is one of the reasons we're being slightly more cautious. but, again, it's a marginal difference.
on the implementation side, we just finished the year of record revenue from new sales in terms of onboarding. we did see a few delays in some projects, but nothing canceled, just pushed out a few months. and we have built that into our plans through this year, and that is one of the things that was contributing a little bit too to a bit of a detriment, a little bit more caution around our revenue outlook.
that said, this next year is going to be another record in terms of revenue from newly onboarded sales. and as we think about our onboarded -- excuse me, our ongoing growth of the company, that revenue from new sales is a key driver for us and that continues to accelerate and we just -- we see that continue to accelerate in the future.
so, that is a -- remains a very-very positive solid long-term trend. this year will be another record. we just took our foot a little bit off the gas in terms of making sure that we are accounting for any potential delays that might arise.
puneet jain -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. got it. and jim, i know you'll share a lot more info at the analyst day. but 100 basis points in margin expansion, how should we think about long-term margin beyond that, specifically given like some of the margin drivers that you talked about, like how should we think about -- like, are they like the long term cuts versus more being like a near-term cuts? and can you also talk about drivers for long-term margin expansion?
jim young -- corporate senior vice president, chief financial officer
yes, puneet, as tim highlighted -- put this in context, we just finished three years. we averaged 83 basis points per year of margin expansion. that includes ending on a very low event-driven year.
so, i think our ability to generate margin expansion is pretty good. and our -- and clearly, as we look at this year on what is relatively modest recurring growth to sign up for another 100 basis points of margin expansion is an indicator that we constantly have abilities to improve our margins.
obviously, we got a pickup with more digital and less distribution over time. but we think some of the changes that we're making are long term sustainable. if you think about private cloud initiatives, if you talk about real estate, some of those things are very durable.
it doesn't mean that we're going to change our longer-term outlook. the team will go through that in december. but obviously, we continue to feel really good about levers available to us and our ongoing ability to make this business even more efficient.

and our next question today comes from patrick o'shaughnessy with raymond james. please go ahead.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. can i get some more detail on the sales momentum that you guys spoke to in the brcc business? what type of mandates did you win during the quarter?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
it is -- it's tim. patrick, good morning. we had really good sales year for brcc this year. certainly, the strongest sales that we've seen since it became part of broadridge. and lots of solutions across both financial services but other industries as well.
in the fourth quarter in particular, there were two really chunky deals, not megadeals but two quite chunky deals. one from a large global bank and a piece of their business, not their whole business. and one from a large health insurer, which is a very significant part of their business.
and so, we -- we like that. as we have -- as we talked about brcc, as you know, one of our -- one of our theses was really around using it to more deeply penetrate some of our largest clients, to bring digital sales and as well as to drive bottom line.
and you know, if we look at brcc this year, we feel really, really pleased with the performance at a very-very strong bottom line outperformance this year, very good sales, stable revenue. offboarding of that major client that we've always talked about, complete. so, when you look at the different strategic indicators for this business, it is a positive traction on a number of fronts, not too early to declare mission accomplished but very positive developments.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. thank you for the color, tim. and then, i appreciate some of your commentary on the modernization of fund communications. but i want to press you a little bit, how do you monetize kind of the notion of driving more engaging and lower cost content for funds to the extent that it could offset the revenue hit, that $60 million revenue hit from not sending out those prospectuses anymore?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. very well. thanks for that question. look, just before i get to that, just stepping back for a second. obviously, based on what we do before, investor disclosure, and this really reinforces that. and we do well when the communications the clients receive are relevant and when the cost of that whole ecosystem is getting better.
and as we think this change, if it is ratified and goes through, will create more engaging communications and create a better digital experience and lower cost for the industry. and so, it's really a win-win-win, and no one is better positioned than broadridge.
so, if you just get into a tangible example, now first of all, we did want to size for everyone sort of what is the amount of revenue that's sort of in these annual prospectuses, that's not all going to go away. there are chunks of funds that will not -- it's optional to adopt for funds, it's optional for broker dealers. they're closed end funds. there are some funds that won't elect to do it. there are some brokers that won't elect to do it.
and also, because of the fact that people still need to let people know about changes, we think this will lead to higher supplemental.
so, that whole $60 million is not going away, but it does create new opportunity, because this rule is complex to implement. there's a complexity of creating new summaries. a lot of that stuff -- the big documents, they are offset print. a lot of these will be more print-on-demand. and then there's digitally hosting clickable layered content.
and i just want to give an example. so, in january, we're going live with our 30e-3 solution. and this is something we're doing for the industry as a whole. and it's really neat. because we send people a notice. on the notice, there's a qr code. you point your phone at the qr code, and it brings up the document tailored to you directly on your phone. and we're introducing that in january across the industry. the fund industry loves it.
and one thing that's really done is to sort of introduce the idea of how broadridge can help clients with these implementing complex new regulations and it really started the digital conversation in a very serious way. so, it's been very positive.
now, you project that forward three years from now, funds are going to have real complexity to deal with. they have to create these new summaries. they have to host clickable layered content.
and if you think about a solution where in the future where they filed their long form documents, we captured all those data points anyway. within a couple of days, we present them back. here's a summary in your color with your logo, composed and ready to go. do you approve it? and it's ready to be distributed to whatever channel with a hosted solution for clickable solutions.
so, you can sort of really envision, patrick, the kind of industry solution. it's going to solve a big problem for the fund industry. and so, only broadridge is positioned to do that, and we're excited for the way that it is going to help our clients more deeply engage with their clients.

tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
thanks, rocco, and thank all of you on the call for joining us today. i just want to take a moment to reiterate our key messages.
our strong results highlight the importance of what we do and the strength of our business model. the pandemic has and will continue to accelerate the long-term trends driving our growth. looking into 2021, we see continued revenue and adjusted eps growth backed by a record revenue backlog. this outlook includes increased investments in products, platforms, and people. and finally, broadridge remains well-positioned for continued growth.

operator
good day and welcome to the broadridge fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, today's event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to edings thibault, head of investor relations and corporate fp&a. please go ahead, sir.
w. edings thibault -- vice president and head of investor relations.
thank you, rocco. good morning, all, and welcome to broadridge's fiscal year 2020 earnings call. our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the investor relations section of broadridge.com.
joining me on the call this morning are tim gokey, our ceo; our cfo, jim young; and matt connor, our incoming interim cfo.
before i turn the call over to tim, a few standard reminders. we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding broadridge that involve risks. a summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on form 10-k. we will also be referring to several non-gaap measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of broadridge's underlying operating results. an explanation of these non-gaap measures and reconciliations to their comparable gaap measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation.
let me now turn the call over to tim gokey. tim?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
thank you, edings. three months ago, i spoke to you about the twin challenges of the global health and economic crises, and in particular about the impact covid has had on so many in the greater new york area. since then, while the environment is better in many respects, the outlook remains highly uncertain and now includes an increased focus on racial justice.
in this complex environment, i remain incredibly proud of how broadridge's more than 12,000 associates are continuing to step up, supporting our clients, coworkers, and families, while staying engaged in our communities.
as covid continues, our first priority remains the health and safety of our associates. we continue to deploy extensive safety protocols for our essential workforce, which include temperature checks, social distancing, and the use of personal protective equipment. our nonproduction offices have remained closed and no associates will be required to return before january, a date we continue to assess.
despite those challenges, broadridge has not missed a beat in serving clients, closing sales, and developing new products. we have continued to process high trade volumes and record numbers of shareholder communications. as a result, broadridge delivered a very strong quarter that drove strong fiscal year 2020 results, including 10% recurring revenue growth, 8% eps growth and record closed sales.
our outlook for fiscal '21 calls for continued top and bottom line growth: 2% to 6% recurring revenue growth and 4% to 10% adjusted eps growth; as well as increased investment in our people, platforms, and technology. more importantly, i'm confident broadridge is meeting the moment posed by these times, including the near-term challenges of the pandemic and the longer-term opportunities created by the acceleration of the key trends driving our growth.
turning now to the quarter. broadridge reported an exceptional fourth quarter. performance was driven by strong stock-record growth, increased demand for virtual shareholder meetings and elevated trading volumes. strong recurring revenue growth was coupled with a rebound in event-driven activity, leading to 250 basis points of margin expansion and 25% adjusted eps growth. couple that with near-record fourth quarter sales and all in all an excellent performance in our seasonally largest quarter.
broadridge's performance since the onset of the pandemic highlights the strength of our business model and the importance of what we do across governance, capital markets, and wealth and investment management.
in governance, we have ensured that annual meetings to take place and shareholder governance continue by keeping open the lines of communication and facilitating 1,500 virtual shareholder meetings. in gto, our scalable and resilient technology platforms flawlessly processed record trading volumes during periods of peak volatility in march and april, enabling markets to settle and investors to price in the impact of a worldwide shutdown of economic activity. broadridge, our associates and our technology played a critical part in keeping our markets open and every broadridge associate and shareholder can be proud.
moving to the year. our full-year recurring revenues rose 10% to $3 billion, driven by organic growth and strong performance from recent acquisitions. event-driven revenues declined to a five-year low and our low- to -no-margin distribution revenues slipped 1%.
adjusted eps rose 8%, as the strong growth in recurring revenues was offset by event-driven declines.
closed sales of $239 million were a new record due to our second strongest sales quarter ever. keep in mind, that our 2019 closed sales were buoyed by our hallmark wealth platform deal with ubs. excluding that result, closed sales this year rose more than 25%.
all in all, a strong year, especially considering the impact of a sharp fall in event-driven revenues and the impact of the covid pandemic.
thanks to those strong results, our board approved an increase in our annual dividend to $2.30 per share. broadridge has now increased its annual dividend for 14 consecutive years, every year, we've been a public company.
let's move to review of our ics business on slide 4. ics recurring revenue rose 6% in fiscal 2020, driven by strong growth in our core governance products and aided by our recent acquisitions. we benefited from 10% full-year stock-record growth and strong demand for virtual shareholder meeting solutions. we also continue to benefit from strong demand for fund data and analytics.
we made two meaningful acquisitions in fiscal '20, which also contributed to growth. broadridge fi360, which leverages our strong relationships across the mutual fund and retirement ecosystem and adds to our data and analytics suite and funds library, which represents another step toward creating a leading european fund reporting business.
i'm pleased with the integration of both and expect them to contribute to our organic growth next year. after two exceptional years, event-driven revenues declined by $66 million. activity levels over the first three quarters of the year were historically low levels before rebounding in the fourth quarter.
looking ahead, we expect event-driven activity in '21 will remain at muted fiscal '20 levels.
fiscal '20 was also a strong year for our gto segment. gto revenues rose 18%, driven by a combination of strong organic growth and very strong performance from our 2019 acquisitions.
the story of gtos growth was really a tale of two halves. in the first half, we saw strong onboarding growth offset by lower trading volumes and a decline in consulting revenues, which held organic growth to 3%. in the second half, we continued to make very good progress in onboarding clients and trading volumes grew dramatically to unprecedented -- due to unprecedented market volatility, second half organic growth was 10%.
not captured in organic growth was very strong performance from our recent wealth management acquisitions, rpm and rockall. both delivered results well ahead of our acquisition case as clients have been willing to expand the scope and length of contracts because of their confidence in broadridge's ability to support their needs. i couldn't be more pleased with the traction we're seeing in the marketplace.
let's turn our focus to closed sales on slide 5. broadridge reported closed sales of $239 million, up 2% from our fy '19 record. i'm really pleased by the breadth of sales across our major growth opportunities. we're seeing a lot of demand for our next generation governance products with strong sales of virtual shareholder meetings and our shareholder rights directive solutions.
we're also especially active on the capital markets front, with recent client additions including a midsized european bank, the sale of a derivative solution to a major future brokerage; and earlier in the year, sale of our global post-trade platform to another major european bank.
another highlight was the first sale of our blockchain-based repo solution. i was also pleased to see strong sales momentum in brcc, which bodes well for return to growth.
our record sales highlight the breadth of our product portfolio and deep client relationships. they're also a testament to our ability to close on our sales pipeline despite the challenges our clients faced and the challenges of working remotely.
looking forward, we're taking a slightly cautious view of sales growth in fy '21. that view reflects the uncertainty faced by our clients as a result of the global recession and the challenges that may emerge in building a pipeline of new opportunities in a world in which client outreach is more limited.
importantly, we don't need to grow sales to grow revenue in '21. our strong $355 million backlog gives us enormous confidence in our ability to grow our top and bottom line and continue to invest in fiscal '21 despite macroeconomic uncertainty. frankly, it's a great security blanket for a ceo.
let's turn to slide 6, to review our performance against the three-year objectives we laid out at our 2017 investor day. i'm proud to report that we achieved the objective against all of the most meaningful metrics, including recurring revenue growth, organic revenue growth, adjusted operating income, and adjusted eps.
our adjusted eps has grown at 17% cagr, putting us at the high end of our 14% to 18% objective. one target in which we fell short was total revenue growth, which was impacted by a decline in the low- to- no-margin distribution revenues.
since our strategy is to drive distribution revenue down over time to digitization, i'm not at all concerned that distribution was lower than expected.
these targets were anchored in our strategy of growing our governance and capital markets franchises and building a wealth management franchise, both in north america and internationally. they are also grounded in a strong conviction that our growth is being propelled by long-term trends around mutualization, digitization and the importance of unique data and analytics.
i'll talk more about our outlook in a moment. but our success in meeting our three-year objectives despite the pandemic and lower event revenue is a clear indicator that our strategy is on-track and that the long-term trends driving our growth are very much intact.
before i turn to our outlook for fiscal '21 and beyond, i want to provide an update on the modernization of regulatory reporting for the fund industry on slide 7.
last week, the sec voted 4-0 to propose a new rule, 498b, that mandates the distribution of summary annual and semiannual reports in place of the current long form version of those documents. the rule provides guidelines for the proposed summary documents and also encourages interactive clickable content.
it retains a paradigm of two communications per year directly to investors through the channel of their choice and meaningfully simplifies the information fund and etf shareholders receive by creating summary documents and by eliminating the annual prospectus which has high overlap with the annual report.
if enacted as proposed, the new rules would have an impact on the roughly $60 million recurring fee revenue we received today for distribution of annual fund prospectuses. at the same time, it would also create a significant opportunity for broadridge to help our fund and etf clients comply with the new rules.
we believe that opportunity is as large or larger and will create a stronger and deeper relationship with the fund industry. we view this proposal as a positive step for the industry, investors and broadridge. we know investors are more engaged by concise summaries that contain the key information they need.
our research, which is cited extensively by the sec, has shown that providing mutual fund and etf investors with easily digested summary information will keep them better informed and more engaged. it also creates a format that works well digitally on a smartphone or tablet.
broadridge has already eliminated more than 70% of fund paper communications, providing easily digested summary information to those digital investors who'll both keep them informed and will also lead to even more investors going digital in the future, further lowering costs for the fund industry.
the proposal aligns broadridge with its clients and create a sustainable long-term paradigm for these important disclosures with better informed investors and more cost-efficient communications. no one is better positioned than broadridge to make this vision a reality, given our ability to reach our investors and our investment in digital capabilities.
it's important to keep in mind that rule proposals like this historically take years, not months to implement. it's a significant change, which means final passage is uncertain, even more so with the new administration at the sec irrespective of the election. if the proposal does go forward, we anticipate the process would take two to three years to finalize and implement.
so, 498b represents an important potential step in modernizing fund communications. it's final form and timing remains uncertainty, that is an important affirmation of the importance of what we do for the industry and retail investors and it's an exciting opportunity for us to work more closely with funds and eps to help them better engage with and educate the investors.
turning now to our outlook on slide 8. we are seeing that the trends driving our growth are being accelerated by the pandemic. the pressure on financial services firms to simplify their operations and reduce costs in mutualization has only grown.
our extra time at home has been a crash course in digital for us all, and the need to adopt to new technologies and incorporate additional data continues to grow. this urgency around next generation resiliency, mutualization, and digitalization is already starting to show up in our discussions with clients.
clients used to worry about losing a facility. now, they need to worry about losing the country or the globe. the investment required to build the needed resiliency across their entire technology estate significantly increases the logic for mutualization. digitalization and next-generation technology are also in increased demand.
therefore, as we move into fiscal '21, we are upping our investment in our people, platforms, and technology to be ready to further support our clients.
as jim will describe, we're taking a careful view on cost, enabling us to free up resources to invest in our own resiliency, product and technology. our strong fiscal '20 results, we're doing significant part to our track record of investing in our business over time.
we created a virtual shareholder meeting 11 years ago and scaled it this year from 300 meetings to 1,500 meetings. some of our more recent investments are just beginning to bear fruit, like our ai-enabled fixed income trading platform, which launches this fall. and our investment in blockchain, which is starting to drive the sales of dlt-enabled products like our repo and shareholder rights directive solutions.
i'm confident these investments will leave broadridge better positioned than ever to take advantage of the post-pandemic recovery for the long term.
so, while we're cautious about the uncertain outlook in the near-term, i can say that the long-term growth opportunities for broadridge have never been better. we look forward to sharing more details about these trends and our investments when we host our next investor day in december.
looking closer ahead to fiscal '21, broadridge is positioned for continued top and bottom line growth. underlying our forecast is our assumption that the pandemic will continue to weigh on economic growth for the balance of calendar year '20 and well into calendar '21.
despite that headwind, we expect continued organic growth and a modest contribution from acquisitions we made in fy '20.
as i just mentioned, our outlook for fiscal '21 also calls for increased levels of investment in key areas, including improved resiliency, new technology and bolstering product development. we're also continuing to invest in our digital capabilities, our ltx fixed income trading platform and our wealth and global post-trade technology platforms.
our ability to fund these growth investments, even in a challenging year, is a testament to the strength of our business model. we will emerge from the pandemic with greater platform reach and even stronger product development organization and with new digital capabilities and enhanced technology and operational resilience. we will also emerge with a stronger culture.
a core part of our long-term competitive advantage is our focus on the service profit chain that emphasizes highly engaged associates, providing excellent service to our clients, which in turn creates additional growth opportunities and returns for our shareholders.
as we look ahead at the future of work, we're focused on making broadridge a great place for the most talented associates. we are making our work more flexible and engaging and we're investing in the next generation diversity and inclusion that will engage our associates and clients alike. all of this is good for shareholders.
as i close my prepared remarks, i want to take time out to address my fellow associates. even in a normal year, it's your commitment and passion for serving our clients that sets us apart. this has not been a normal year by any stretched imagination. so, i want to say a special word of thanks. it has not been easy.
for all of you engaging in social distancing and getting your temperatures checked when you come to work, for all of you balancing parenting, family responsibilities, while still providing world-class service to our clients: ""thank you for everything you're doing.""
finally, before i turn the call over to jim young, i want to thank him for his contribution to broadridge the past six years. since he joined us from visa in 2014, he has been a strong partner in helping run the business and equally a good friend. i'm sorry to see him go, but excited for him to make an equally meaningful mark in his new role.
jim is leaving broadridge in good hands. i've worked with matt connor closely the past 10 years as he served in important operating and financial roles and played an important part in the reinvigoration of our gto segment. his hands-on ability to balance business, financial, and long-term strategic goals have been exceptional. i know he will continue to be a strong voice in his new role.
jim?
jim young -- corporate senior vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, tim, and thank you for the kind words and your mentorship and partnership. it has been an honor and a pleasure to work so closely with you over the past six years. it is bittersweet to be at my last earnings call as broadridge's cfo.
i'll begin my comments with several callouts on slide 9. first, the strong finish. this was an exceptional fourth quarter, highlighted by record sales and 10% organic growth translating into 6% organic growth for the all-important second half of the year and 4.5% organic for the full year.
second, event-driven revenue. this is the highest event has been all year. but even with a 33% increase this quarter, we still closed fiscal '20 with well below average event-driven revenues.
third, closed sales. our sales team stood and delivered an impressive quarter and another full-year record performance, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the broadridge business model.
this leads to the fourth callout, backlog. the recurring revenue backlog stands at $355 million or 12% of fiscal '20 recurring revenue which gives us fantastic visibility into future growth.
fifth, a strong balance sheet. we exited the year right in our long-term target leverage ratio and with ample liquidity. as we think about uncertain macroeconomic climate we are in, it is great to be in such a strong position.
final callout, guidance. our fiscal '21 guidance calls for another year of top and bottom line growth even in the face of a pandemic and global recession. importantly, embedded in our guidance is meaningful investments to ensure we are well-prepared for the recovery and continued long-term growth.
let's turn to slide 10, to review our revenue growth drivers. total revenue grew 14%. the biggest driver of this was 10% organic growth and in particular, revenue from closed sales, which contributed seven points to our growth.
we saw continued strong onboarding activity and meaningful sales of our virtual shareholder meeting solution. we also benefited from strong internal growth, driven by strong proxy volumes and equity trades.
the quarter was also boosted by the shift of some proxy volumes from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, which added two points to our growth. looking through the impact of those delays on both the third and the fourth quarter, we saw an overall 6% organic growth in the more significant second half of our year. all in, for the full year, organic growth was 4.5%.
let's turn to slide 11, for a closer look at ics revenue growth. ics recurring revenues rose 12% in the quarter. on organic basis, recurring growth was 10% or 6% excluding the impact of the covid-related timing shift.
after a slower start, ics's organic growth picked up nicely in the second half of the year to greater than 4%, which highlights the importance of proxy season and strong record growth.
overall, the economic impact on -- of the pandemic on ics was mixed. on the positive side, we saw strong demand for virtual shareholder meetings and market volatility boosted demand for post-sale prospectuses as mutual fund investors rebalanced portfolios.
on the other side of the ledger, we are negatively impacted by lower interest rates on cash balances we hold for retirement accounts and by lower overall asset values of those accounts. mutual fund interim communications also slowed, likely as a result of the record withdrawals from funds and etfs in march.
turning to slide 12. our governance business also benefited from a welcome rebound and event-driven activity. event-driven revenues, which have lagged all year, grew 33% in the fourth quarter. the key takeaway here is we're not seeing any structural issues. event activity is cyclical.
looking ahead, we have no visibility into a proxy campaign by major mutual fund complex and expect another below average year with overall event-driven revenues essentially flat to fiscal '20.
let's turn to slide 13 for review of our gto segment, which also reported strong fourth quarter results. gto revenues rose 19%, driven by a balance of organic growth and acquisitions. while volatility declined from march peaks, it remained elevated throughout the quarter, driving a 27% increase in equity trades, similar to the third quarter and contributing meaningfully to our organic growth.
i'm also pleased to report that we were able to continue to onboard new clients with no delays even with our associates working from home. we also saw strong performance from our recent acquisitions which have outperformed their acquisition cases.
and even with a modest growth headwind from comping high license activity in fiscal '20, these businesses are expected to continue to outperform their acquisition cases in fiscal 2021.
let's move to slide 14. strong revenue performance in the third quarter, led to 25% growth in both adjusted operating come and adjusted eps. higher revenues from both segments were only partially offset by covid-related expenses and our commitments to support covid response and social justice initiatives.
overall, the earnings result exceeded the guidance we provided in may and the 8% adjusted eps growth for the full year, matched the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year.
moving to capital allocation and our balance sheet on slide 15. broadridge generated approximately $500 million of free cash flow in fiscal '20, down from $544 million in fiscal '19. this was driven by a notable step-up in net conversion costs related to several significant platform builds we are executing simultaneously.
our uses of cash highlight our commitment to balanced capital allocation. first, between capex and client platforms and conversion work, we deployed over $250 million in fiscal '20 to support our organic growth. over the last couple of years, we have ramped up our platform development and new client conversions. a significant portion of this increase is attributable to ubs and the continued development of our global post-trade technology platform.
linking these product development efforts to long-term client contracts, gives us the confidence and ability to accelerate our product development effort. in conjunction with our revenue backlog, we view this spend as a positive sign of our growth and future cash flows. we expect this area of investment to rise modestly in fiscal '21.
our capex of $99 million, represents another year of spend at around 2% of revenue and capture some early savings from our private cloud initiative. we expect to stay at similarly low levels next year.
the biggest use of cash was for m&a. we invested approximately $339 million this year alone. we made acquisitions across our governance, capital markets, wealth, and investment management businesses, broadening our product line, adding new capabilities, and extending our global footprint.
lastly, we returned $269 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. the commitment was underscored by our decision to raise our annual dividend 6%, the 14th consecutive year with an increase.
we closed fiscal '20 with an adjusted gross debt leverage ratio of two times, right in our long-term target. our free cash flow, balance sheet and over $1.6 billion in liquidity, positions broadridge well for a seamless repayment of our $400 million september maturity and continued balance cap allocation in fiscal '21 and beyond.
let's turn to slide 16, to look ahead into fiscal '21 and our last callout of the day. one of the great strengths of the broadridge business model is its recurring revenue backed by strong backlog.
our revenue backlog, which represents an estimate of first-year revenue from closed sales that has not yet been recognized sits at $355 million, equivalent to 12% of fiscal '20 recurring revenue. the visibility that gives us is a key reason we are confident in projecting continued revenue growth despite the uncertain macroeconomic outlook.
our planning for fiscal '21 assumes that we are in a challenging recession with tough macroeconomic conditions extending through the fiscal year. we view this as the right way to approach the year while continuing to invest in the still significant opportunities ahead of us. you will notice that we've also modestly widened our range to reflect an increased level of macro uncertainty.
all that said, broadridge is positioned for another year of top and bottom line growth in fiscal '21 despite the recession.
let me walk through our key guidance points. we expect the recurring revenue growth will be in the range of 2% to 6%, which includes about a point of growth from the annualization of fiscal '20 acquisitions.
we expect both ics's and gto's recurring growth to be at similar levels, driven by strong new client onboardings, offset by the tough trading and post-sale comparables we face in the second half of fiscal '21.
in ics, we expect low single-digit full-year position growth, continued demand for data analytics products and customer communications to contribute to organic growth. these are expected to be partially offset by lower revenues from our mutual fund retirement business as a result of lower interest rates.
regulatory post-sale volumes are also expected to be a drag. our gto business should continue to benefit from strong new client additions and increase trading volatility over the first half of the year.
the benefits of higher volumes are expected to turn negative in the second half of the fiscal year as we start to lap the volume spikes from the peak of the pandemic in march and april. as i mentioned earlier, lower license activity following a strong fiscal '20 will result in a drag on growth also.
next, we expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 0% to 4%, as recurring fee revenue growth is offset by other items.
as a reminder, total revenue is not a particularly meaningful metric for us given the long-term shift to more digital delivery, and we expect that low- to- no-margin distribution revenues will be flat-to-down again.
we also expect event fees to be roughly flat, even accounting for what we believe was a near-cyclical low point this past year. fx is expected to be a one-point drag.
third, we expect our adjusted operating income margin to increase about 100 basis points from fiscal '20 level of 17.5%. given the uncertain economic outlook this year, we have kept a tight rein on expense growth, enabling us to plan higher margins and simultaneously increase investment.
as part of our expense reduction initiatives, in response to the new work environment, we plan to rationalize our real estate footprint by closing some offices around the world. while we're still in the planning phase, we expect these lease termination costs along with other related actions to result in a charge of approximately $20 million to $40 million in q1. we expect to exclude this expense from our adjusted results.
on the investment side and as tim noted, we are increasing our spending and building out our product development team and our technology infrastructure. we've also set aside money to increase our diversity efforts.
i am proud, as a company, we are committed to investing in the long-term, year-in and year-out, no matter the environment.
moving down to income statement. our overall tax rate should tick up slightly to 21% and our core tax rate, which excludes the excess tax benefit should remain at about 23%.
we are projecting etb of $12 million in fiscal '21, a $4 million decrease from fiscal '20. as a result, we expect adjusted eps growth to be 4% to 10%, and we expect closed sales to be in the range of $190 million to $235 million, reflecting both caution in this challenging environment and continued confidence in our value proposition.
finally, as you think about quarterization, our earnings growth will once again be very uneven, caused in part by small earnings quarters in the first half, the unpredictability of event fee timing in this year, tougher recurring revenue comps in the second half.
specifically, for q1, our forecast assumes event fees will be around $30 million, down roughly 20% from last year. that should push our adjusted eps to the low end of 11% to 14% of annual eps we typically report in q1.
before i turn the call to matt, please allow me to share a couple of quick thoughts. it's been a privilege working with such an exceptional team here at broadridge and the decision to step away from my role during this exciting, dynamic time of growth for the company has not been an easy one.
however, i take this step knowing that broadridge, led by tim and the team, will continue to be successful for years to come. we are well-positioned and the longer-term opportunity for broadridge has never been stronger nor more clear.
i want to thank all of our shareholders for their support over the years and say a special thank you to our research analysts, who have kept our terrific ir team -- and you all know how good eddings is -- and me on our toes.
and now, over to matt, in his capable hands i'll leave you. having worked really closely with matt, i know firsthand what a strong and talented steward matt is of broadridge's business, financial strength, and strategy. over to you, matt.
matt connor -- interim cfo
thank you, jim. thanks for your leadership and friendship over the past few years and best of luck in your new role. i know you will do great things at indigo ag.
i'm excited for this new interim role and i'm looking forward to meeting all of you.
broadridge is exiting fiscal '20 in a strong position and poised for additional growth. we have a strong plan to drive growth and my goal is to maintain our focus on disciplined cost management to fund additional investments. we have a lot of momentum and our primary goal is that we continue to put ourselves in position to continue that momentum across each of our major verticals.
and we look forward to sharing what that would mean, not just for fiscal '21, but for our next set of three-year objectives that we will share with you at our investor day this december.
rocco, let's go to q&a.

thank you. we will now begin our question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question today comes from darrin peller of wolfe research. please go ahead.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. thanks, guys. it's good to see these trends and the flow-through to guidance with confidence. when we risk weight this guidance, can you just touch on what you need to see to come through to reach the maybe the low end versus the high end of the ranges? maybe on the underlying drivers of the business and perhaps touch on what you guys have control over as well? thanks.
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
sure, it's tim. i will start, and then i will let matt comment a little bit more. i would say first of all, just in terms of guidance, we were rather pleased with the strong start of the year. and as we said, it really confirms our confidence in the full year. we are -- as i said, we're seeing strong stock record growth and we're seeing good trading volatility as well.
when we think about what it would take for the top and bottom ends of this, it really comes down to continuing to see the growth that we are seeing, darrin, in position growth and in what we're seeing around equity and fixed income trading volumes. so let me just hand it to matt to comment a little bit more on the details of that, and then i can finish up.
matthew connor -- interim chief financial officer
sure. so darrin, we had forecasted, in the first half of the year, that volatility in the equity trade volumes to stay high and kind of moderate a bit in the second half. and going against our higher comps. so i think seeing these next few months come in at where we thought they would be is really important. and as tim said, that stock record growth, kind of the mid- to the high-level single digits in the second half, which is also kind of against a pretty high comparable, would be the two big things.
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
i think the other piece -- is just on the earnings side, is really that we have a lot of investment plans and that we are able to execute on those, because it is -- while it's all planned, it is -- sometimes it doesn't come through all the way. so making sure that we get those executed, which we think is important for our future, is one of the things we're working on as well.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
yes. thanks. i was actually going to make that my next question, which is really just where -- just given the backdrop of this environment, it sounds like you really are trying to capitalize on these tailwinds with investments. tim, can you just give us a little bit more explanation or disclosure on where you want to put the money in terms of, number one, what specific business lines, the way we look at it from analysts, the way you report. and then when we would expect to see returns on those investments, just given that i think you're really stepping up and it's going to impact the margins some degree, at least.
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. i think if you think about our investments around really making sure that we are very well-positioned post-pandemic, they fall in a couple of categories. it's a big category of just, i'll say, very foundational investments in our product organization, in our technology organization and platforms to just really make sure that we have the best foundational capability. i think you've heard me talk about this before in which we believe the opportunity for us is basically unlimited, if we are good enough. and so making sure we -- while we have the ability here to make those foundational investments, is important. and i think the returns on those are more long term in nature.
the third category investments are targeted product investments. and whether that is in accelerating, we're doing with the shareholder rights directive and accelerating what we're doing with virtual shareholder meetings, around some of our wealth products with our digital capabilities, those -- we have a whole road map of -- as all technology companies do have a road map of things we want to do and being able to accelerate some of those things. and i think the return on those, we would begin to see more near term and even see some returns on that next year. and then the last category is in go-to-market. and as you know, we're growing rapidly international, internationally putting money behind that, putting money behind our brand. and again, i think the returns on those things are probably in the 18- to 24-month range.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay.
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
so all in all, i think we feel really good about it, and we feel what we're seeing with the pandemic is just accelerating trends that were already out there. but as you heard from many others on other calls, i'm sure it's five years of change in six months. and we really want to be in a position to help our clients with that.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful, guys. thank you very much.

the next question comes from david togut of evercore isi. please go ahead.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. good to see the first quarter outperformance and the upgraded guidance for fiscal 2021. just starting off on bookings. closed sales were down 13% year-over-year, although that was after a 55% increase in june. can you dig into the new business pipeline a little bit, tim? and where you think you might land in that closed sales range for this year, $190 million to $235 million?
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. absolutely. and the one thing i'd point out when we talk about the comparison to last year is that last year's first quarter had an important strategic sale in it. and so it was, by far, a record. so this is our second-highest ever, first quarter. and if you take out the strategic sale from a year ago, we really -- we like the way the comparable lines up. i think, generally, we are seeing the pandemic, as i mentioned a moment ago, is accelerating the trends that benefit our business model.
and as we look at what's happening on the sales side, certainly, we're seeing continued ability to close sales, so that's good. i think the other piece is just what are we seeing in terms of pipeline generation. and we feel pretty good about that. we are -- we generated a pipeline in the first quarter. if you look at our core deals, taking out the strategic ones above last year and above our 3-year average. and longer-term, probably not for this year, but there's some longer-term more speculative conversations that are very promising. so i think overall, we feel good about sales for the year. we're holding guidance at this point. but i think we'll feel that they'll come in very solidly.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. and just as a follow-up, can you update us on the timeline to onboard the big ubs contract? is that still on track for, call it, july of next year? and then your ability to build on that and bring in other big customers on that platform?
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
sure. and it was great to hear ubs talked about this on their recent earnings call. and it's great to hear their comments reinforcing the positive impact that this is already having. they've introduced a change in advisory billings, which they believe is going to be very positive. and just to be fully aligned with what they said, they talked about next summer. so i'm just going to leave it at that because i want to be aligned with what they said. i think, more broadly, that wealth remains a key focus area. we're continuing to invest in our capabilities. as you know, we've been pretty active in m&a in that arena.
those recent acquisitions, rpm and rockall are really, really performing well. as we look at the interest in -- specifically in the wealth platform and building in ubs, we're seeing very strong interest from our existing clients that want to upgrade and evolve into this new ecosystem. i would say that significant platform sales to new clients at this stage are unlikely before we complete the ubs go live, but there are definitely positive conversations.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thanks so much.
operator
the next question comes from peter heckmann of d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey. good morning. tim, could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about m&a right now and capital allocation? the kind of weighing stock buybacks against m&a, but as well, what you're seeing in the marketplace in terms of valuations and seller expectations?
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. and i'll let matt comment on this as well. let me just say a couple of things and have him comment. but certainly, pre-tuck-in m&a is an important part of our balanced capital allocation framework, and we've been pretty active over the past few years. i think you know that our strategy is very -- or tightly aligned with our franchises, which i think has given us attractive returns.
at the same time, what we're seeing right now is pretty high valuation levels. and so while we continue to look at lots of things, the levels are high. and so we're being very cautious. i think if you do see us transact on the m&a side, you'll know that it's something we have real conviction in and that we think really aligns well strategically. let me just let matt comment a little bit more on overall capital allocation and balance sheet.
matthew connor -- interim chief financial officer
sure. sure. so we're still in a very, very strong place in terms of our balance sheet. we're at that 2.0 ratio at this point. and as tim said, valuations are very high right now, but we are in the midst of talking around a number of different opportunities. so we'll manage ourselves to what's the right thing to do from an acquisition versus buyback, and we're always committed to the dividend delivering that. so i don't think you'll see much of a change in terms of where we have been over the last several years. it's always been a little bit of an ebb and a flow, in terms of where we are from a buyback versus acquisition. so we'll be in that same spot.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. that's fair. and then just the equity proxy revenue growth number just really was very impressive. and definitely heard you call out the other position growth, record growth. anything else that might account for some of that strength within the revenue number itself or just primarily driven by individual investors holding more positions?
matthew connor -- interim chief financial officer
it's generally individual investors holding more positions. and as you look at kind of those internet advisors, the activity that's happening on the retail investors is significantly higher here in the first half than what we had expected. we expect that to continue through the first half, and then we get up against some tougher comps in the second half from the growth that we saw at the end of fy '20. so that will moderate itself down into the kind of mid- to high single digits at that point.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. got it.
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
and i'd just add one thing. the first quarter, it's a small quarter. there's sort of a lot of small numbers. so while the revenue grew 35%, stock record growth was 16%. and the -- there are always a few one-offs sort of in the previous year or this year, they can make the percentage changes in revenue look, sort of unusual in such a small quarter. but i think keying off that sort of greater than double-digit for the first half is the right way to think about it.
matthew connor -- interim chief financial officer
and there was a little bit of shifting from last quarter to this quarter in terms of some of the handful of some of the large-cap companies in terms of pushing out.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. got it. okay. that's all helpful commentary. thanks so much.
operator
the next question comes from chris donat of piper sandler. please go ahead.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i just wanted to follow up on pete's question on position growth. i'm just trying to understand if it's more on the online brokers, and i'll use the name, robin hood, driving a lot of activity? or if it's more robo advisors or call it like a betterment or wealth front, which have the direct indexing that might be causing more position growth as people directly own stocks rather than the index? and this is something we've talked about before, tim, but just want to make sure i'm understanding some of the dynamics of what's driving the equity position growth.
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. i would say, first of all, it has been -- and i'll let matt add on to this, but it's been strong across the board. it has been certainly strong at the large online brokers. and the -- some of the other ones you mentioned are -- while they had very good growth, they're small enough that it doesn't really affect us. and robin hood is, certainly, a phenomenon -- is not a driver for broadridge. but really, if you look at specifically the large online brokers, big changes there, 20-plus percent and -- but really good strength across the board to get this number.
matthew connor -- interim chief financial officer
but i would let you know that the direct index is really not a major driver for us at this point. and i think just to remind also, we don't get paid for less than a single share. so those fractional shares aren't going to drive anything for us in some of those smaller holdings. so it's really more on those long line trades that are happening from the direct consumer.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. and then thinking about on the mutual fund side of positions. in october, we had the announcements of morgan stanley with eaton vance, and then some activist involvement potentially pushing for a janus henderson-invesco merger. can you just remind us how mutual fund mergers have worked out for you in the past? it seems like that's been a driver of campaigns for kind of repapering mutual fund positions. but -- just help us understand how mutual fund industry consolidation might affect you on the position side and maybe anywhere else that could happen?
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. i think on the -- for mutual fund consolidation, we, certainly, are seeing consolidation. i think we would expect there to be ongoing consolidation in the asset management industry. i think we have to disentangle the long-term impacts and the near-term impact. so let me just start with the long-term impacts, which is we get paid, as you know, by position. and typically, the positions don't go away. so when two companies come together, it really -- it doesn't necessarily affect us one way or the other from a long-term perspective. on the near-term perspective, it's definitely true that typically, they have to go to a vote for the shareholders and that, that can create some near-term event-driven activity.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. thanks very much.
operator
the next question comes from puneet jain of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
puneet jain -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. and good quarter. so i understand like -- this is like a small quarter for sales, but can you comment on pace of activity in pipeline? and also on implementations given uncertainty from rising covid cases and the upcoming elections?
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. absolutely, puneet. so on the sales pipeline side, and it's definitely something that we have been monitoring to understand because we had -- clearly had a very strong q4 and many of those had already been originated and run the one-yard line. so what -- we definitely learned is we can close. and so we've been monitoring around whether we can originate new opportunities.
and so now i think the larger opportunities are a bit lumpy. if you look at our sort of core opportunities outside of the strategic sales, what we're seeing is nice growth in those year-on-year and a nice multiyear trend of growth in this quarter being really a continuation of that trend. so i'd say, on track. if you turn it to the implementation side, i think that one of the things that has been surprising to us, although we hear it from others, so it's not, not unique to us. it is being experienced by the industry is that our productivity in a remote environment has been -- really has not been effective. it is -- if anything, it's slightly better.
and in particular, our ability to engage our more remote teams where we have -- maybe have skills that are geographically separate, our india team. all of that is working extremely well. and so we really have not seen any slowdown in the pace of client implementations. and similarly, in terms of clients' ability, the one thing that we've been worried about is would they be able to focus on working with us. and we haven't seen that to be affected either. so our productivity and their productivity really has continued to be solid.
puneet jain -- jpmorgan -- analyst
understood. that's good to know. and how should we think about covid-related cost cuts? could some of those cost actions like facility footprint you talked about be like a permanent cut versus like -- more like a temporary reduction? and as people start returning to office, you'll invest again in facilities?
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. great question, puneet. we are really using this opportunity. let me just talk about sort of the future of work for a second, and i'll come back to the broader cost initiative. we are really using this opportunity to lean into the future of work. and as we talk to our associates around the globe, what most of them are saying is they are looking forward to coming back to the office, but not every day. and i think we have all learned from being on video conferences all day long that it can be very, very effective, particularly as i mentioned, for engaging people from our more remote offices. so when we look at our -- how we're thinking about real estate in the future, we're thinking about it as sort of hub, not home.
and again, when you -- under that whole theme of accelerating things that probably needed to happen anyway, as we have done acquisitions, we have accumulated smaller offices, where it's more difficult to have the sale for associates to have everything they need to operate effectively. and so being able to trim it actually fairly significant number of offices only about 10% of our square feet. but trimming that, moving to hoteling, moving to other things that we think are really the future of how people interact, we think will set us up well for the future. and those changes will be permanent. as we look at the cost changes that we've made, there's certainly some of them, like travel or things, that are this year. but there's a lot of it that is structural that we expect to continue in the future. and just going to see if matt wants to add anything on to that.
matthew connor -- interim chief financial officer
no. i think you got it. and that hub idea, think about in a city where we had three sites before, we're going down to one site. we're consolidating into one. so they're -- some of them are pretty simple kind of actions, but it's not going to change in terms of when folks start to come back to work, are we going to do more? and then we talked about what we've done with ibm and our private cloud.
that is something that's going to be permanent in terms of savings that we're going to get from that. so as tim said, there's a mix in terms of some of which is this year. and t&e, for example, there's definitely a bigger benefit this year, but i do think that we'll have a whole new way in terms of how we look at t&e across, in terms of how we travel and interact with the video that's become so easy to do and for us to get in contact with our clients.
puneet jain -- jpmorgan -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from patrick o'shaughnessy of raymond james. please go ahead.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning. so a handful of major broker-dealers sent the sec a letter during the quarter, recommending that electronic delivery of regulatory documents becomes the default rather than the opt-in. where do you think this proposal might head? and what would be the impact on broadridge if it did, in fact, get implemented?
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. thank you, patrick. that is -- we worked with sifma on creating that letter. we do think that digital delivery is the future as we certainly have talked about. and so we're supportive of this direction. the -- in terms of its near-term likelihood of any change, i think there's going to be a -- it's going to be hard to get anything through the sec in this administration. and irrespective of the outcome of the election, jay clayton has said that he's stepping down, and there's already sort of change at the top there. so i think there will be a slowdown in things going through the sec.
but the longer-term, this is something that we believe can be more engaging for investors save the industry money. now the key is to make the delivery of those documents. if what you're getting is a link to go someplace and log in, you get a big drop-off. if you send a -- send the document directly, it's ok. is it a really long and complicated document? a summary version is much better. so making what people receive as engaging as possible, making it interactive, making it clickable, that's really some of the investments that we talked about that we're doing to really help our clients with what is truly a digital transformation.
when you think about the amount that large wealth management firms and fund companies spend on outbound communications, really making sure that they're getting a strong return on that and that they're using it to really engage their clients, we think, is a big opportunity.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. and then now that the e trade sale to morgan stanley has closed, are you in a position to provide an update regarding the status of your e trade relationship?
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. what i would say on that, patrick, is it is a very complex integration, and it's something that morgan stanley continues to study in terms of what they want the -- their sort of long-term approach to be in terms of how and whether they combine those platforms. and irrespective, we expect that once they do decide that, it will be -- to whatever it is, it will be a multiyear transition. so i think it's still a ways out.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you.

good morning, and welcome to the broadridge financial solutions first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to edings thibault, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
w. edings thibault -- investor relations
thank you, melissa. good morning, everyone, and welcome to broadridge's first quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the investor relations section of broadridge.com. joining me on the call this morning are tim gokey, our ceo; and our interim cfo, matt connor. before i turn the call over to tim, a few standard reminders. we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding broadridge that involve risks.
a summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides, and a more complete description on our annual report on form 10-k. we will also be referring to several non-gaap measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of broadridge's underlying operating results. an explanation of these non-gaap measures, and reconciliations to their comparable gaap measures, can be found in the earnings release and presentation. let me now turn the call over to tim gokey. tim?
timothy c. gokey -- chief executive officer, management
thank you, edings, and good morning. i'll begin with the headlines. broadridge is off to a strong start to fiscal year 2021. we reported 8% recurring revenue growth and record first quarter earnings. our performance, in the face of the ongoing pandemic, highlights the resilience of our recurring revenue business model and the power of the long-term trends propelling our results. i'm especially proud of our cost efforts, which helped drive strong margin expansion and record earnings. these cost realignment initiatives helped slow our overall expense growth and position us to make important investments in our people, products and technology. our strong first quarter results give us more confidence going forward, despite remaining headwinds, and we are adjusting our full year guidance to reflect that more positive outlook.
the investments we are making will further drive long-term growth by enabling us to better meet our clients' accelerating needs for next-generation mutualization, resiliency and digital transformation. as i said, it's a strong start to the year. in my remarks this morning, i'll provide you with a brief overview of the results for each of our businesses, give you my thoughts on the factors driving our growth and discuss how our first quarter start impact our approach to the full year and leave us better positioned to take advantage of the post-pandemic environment to drive long-term sustainable growth. matt will then review the financial highlights, provide additional insight into the measures we're taking to reduce controllable expenses and increase investment and walk you through our guidance updates.
as always, we'll close with your questions. let's get started on slide three. broadridge reported strong first quarter results. recurring revenues rose 8% to $671 million, driven by balanced growth across both our ics and gto segments. we continued to benefit from strong sales onboarding, driven by our record sales results of the past few years. we also benefited from strong stock and interim record growth and higher trading volumes, which offset the cyclical drag through lower interest rates and the tough comp posed by a large license sale in the first quarter of fiscal '20. i was pleased to see event-driven revenues rebound to more normalized levels after a period of lower activity in the first three quarters of fiscal '20. at $46 million, event-driven revenues were right back in line with the six-year average.
adjusted eps rose 44% to a first quarter record of $0.98. broadridge benefited from strong recurring revenue growth, the modest rebound in event-driven revenues, and the impact of the cost alignment initiatives that began last year. these cost initiatives, which include shrinking our real estate footprint, a shift to private cloud, selectively restructuring certain businesses and other measures, help keep our costs in check and drove margin expansion in the quarter. our success in implementing these initiatives puts us in a great position to step up our level of investment in our associates, products and technology platforms going forward. one last point on results, strong sales. we continue to see good sales momentum in the marketplace, building on the strong result in last year's fourth quarter.
first quarter closed sales of $33 million were the second highest on record and ahead of our forecast. in setting our full year guidance a few months ago, we highlighted a wider range of uncertainty as a result of the covid pandemic. now after a strong start to the year, we feel more confident about our outlook for both recurring revenue and earnings and are raising the low end of our guidance expectations for both measures. we are reiterating our guidance for margin expansion and close sales. now let's turn our attention to the performance of our ics and gto segments, which both performed well in the first quarter. we'll start on slide four, for an overview of our ics segment.
ics reported another quarter of strong recurring revenue growth. recurring revenues were powered by new sales, continued strong stock record growth and by a nice pickup in mutual fund and etf record growth. while the first quarter represents only a small percentage of proxy activity, position growth was 16% and remained in the double digits for the second consecutive quarter. we're seeing especially strong position growth at the online brokers, many of whom are seeing 20% growth on the back of their shift to 0 commission trading in a healthy equity market. mutual fund and etf physician growth also picked up to 6%. with travel steel limited, demand for a virtual shareholder meeting solution remains very strong, keeping pace with momentum we saw at the end of last year.
we provisioned well over 200 meetings in the quarter, nearly 5 times more than in the same period a year ago. post-covid, we expect most of these meetings will remain virtual. and thus, this revenue is likely to continue. i was also pleased to see that customer communications and fulfillment revenues rose 2% on the back of new customer communication client wins in 2020. data and intelligence solutions also contributed nicely to growth. these drivers were partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on the cash balances we hold in our mutual fund processing and stock transfer business, which fell by $6 million. the headwind from lower rates will continue to weigh on results in the second quarter before moderating in the third. as i mentioned, event-driven activity returned to more normalized levels in q1, increasing 13% from a weaker period a year ago, ahead of our expectations.
these revenues remain inherently volatile, but it's nice to see two solid quarters in a row after a weak 2020. looking ahead, we see continued strong record growth through at least our fiscal third quarter. one of the drivers of our increased confidence in our outlook is that we now expect full year stock record growth to be in the mid- to high single digits, up from our initial plan of low single digits. turning on slide five to our gto business, which continues to perform well. gto revenues rose 8% to $296 million, driven by the onboarding of new clients. our platforms also continued to process elevated levels of equity trading volumes during the quarter.
while volumes declined from their peak levels in the third and fourth quarters of last fiscal year, they remained well above the levels of the first half of fiscal '20. much of that growth, however, was offset by the tough comp created by a large and strategically important software license sale a year ago. as we look ahead, we see continued healthy growth in the second quarter, driven by higher equity trading volumes. in the second half, we will start comping the record volatility we experienced last spring, which will weigh on gto's growth in the third and fourth quarters. so across ics and gto, broadridge is delivering on new client additions and benefiting from strong stock record growth and trading volumes, which helped our business overcome some of the cyclical and other headwinds, enabling us to deliver strong recurring revenue growth.
before i finish, i'd like to step back and share some overall perspectives. with record earnings, broadridge is clearly off to a strong start to fiscal '21. i believe this start and the overall environment have at least three important implications. the first is that we're more confident in our outlook and full year guidance. as you recall from last quarter, we saw an unusual level of uncertainty and, therefore, set a wider guidance range than normal. now after the strong start, and with more forward visibility, we're narrowing these ranges. matt will walk you through detail of our updated guidance in a few moments, but i want to call out the primary drivers behind our improved outlook. our first quarter benefited from strong equity position growth and a pickup in mutual fund and etf position growth.
we see both these trends continuing in fiscal '21. position growth across both funds and individual stocks have been increasing at a mid- to high single-digit rate over the past decade. recent innovations, including improved user interfaces and the move to zero commission trading, will only sustain these trends and may well accelerate them. for fiscal '21, our testing shows that recent equity and mutual fund position growth trends are likely to remain in the double digits through the second quarter and remain in the mid- to high single digits in our second half. next, our gto business continues to benefit from elevated trading levels, which was an important assumption in our full year plan.
while equity volatility has come down significantly from the levels of march and april, it remains well above last summer and fall. the longer these levels remain high, the less downside risk to our base outlook. we're also executing well on our cost realignment. going into the year, we knew our growth would be impacted by cyclical headwinds, including lower interest rates, which are already having an impact, and by lower trading volumes, which we expect to reduce our second half growth. in order to offset these headwinds, deliver bottom line growth and make critical growth investments in our business, we targeted more than $80 million in cost reduction initiatives for the year.
our ability to execute on these initiatives helped drive record profit growth in the first quarter and gives us additional confidence in our fiscal '21 outlook. finally, closed sales continue to track our expectations which reinforces our conviction in the value proposition to our clients and the ability of our sales teams to negotiate and deliver on new client opportunities. while headwinds remain, and the economic outlook in course to pandemic clearly continue to be uncertain, these factors, a combination of incremental revenues in both gto and ics, expense measures and continued sales traction, give us additional confidence that we are on track and, therefore, to remove the lower range of potential outcomes.
the second implication of our strong start is it gives us added confidence to ramp up our planned investments, and we expect to increase our investment in our people, products and technology beginning in the second quarter. we're making targeted product development investments to position us for future growth. and we're investing in our technology platforms to integrate new capabilities, enhance scalability. you'll hear more about these initiatives in our cost program from matt in a few moments. our first quarter results have also increased our conviction that looking beyond fiscal '21, the covid pandemic is accelerating the long-term trends of mutualization, resiliency and digital transformation that drive our growth.
the investments we are making will strengthen broadridge's ability to serve clients in the post-pandemic world. as we move forward, broadridge will go to market with greater platform reach, an even stronger product development organization, with new digital capabilities, with enhanced technology and operational resilience. in other words, better positioned for long-term sustainable growth. third, and finally, i want to take a moment to focus on that last phrase, ""sustainable growth."" i am proud that as a result of our esg efforts, broadridge was recognized by barron's as one of america's 100 most sustainable companies. at broadridge, we enable better financial lives by powering, investing, governance and communications.
we focus on doing well by doing good. that's not a feel-good slogan, it's a core value that we've adhered to since our founding and especially during 2020 in the face of unprecedented challenges. our approach is grounded in the service profit chain. the idea that success is mutual with highly engaged associates providing world-class service to satisfied clients, which, in turn, creates growth and attractive returns for shareholders. we're proud to have been recognized as a great place to work in the u.s., canada and india. today, as part of that focus on associate engagement, we're investing in next-generation diversity, equity and inclusion.
i'm pleased to note that we promoted one of our senior business leaders to become our chief diversity officer, with a mandate to ensure that broadridge remains a great place to work for all of our talented associates. any focus on doing good has to come with an awareness of the environment and of climate change. according to the epa, paper still accounts for the largest source of u.s. municipal solid waste. we are proud to have eliminated more than 80% of the paper from our clients' fund and issuer communications, and we're determined to drive increased digitization going forward. in addition, we've eliminated almost 1/4 of our own scope one and scope two greenhouse gas emissions since 2013, and we're committed to reducing these emissions by another 15% by 2025. i urge you all to read our 2020 sustainability report, which is available on our website, to understand how we integrate sustainable esg practice into our business.
as esg investment continues to grow, these measures ensure that broadridge remains well-aligned with that trend, and there are another reason to believe in our long-term sustainable growth. before i turn it over to matt, i want to remind all of you of our upcoming investor day on december 10. we're looking forward to showcasing the depths of our management team, providing more insight about our growth strategy across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management and sharing our updated three-year growth objectives.
let me close by thanking our associates. their tenacious focus on serving our clients and their ability to adapt to the new work environment continues to impress and underpins all our operational, client and financial success. matt?
matthew connor -- interim chief financial officer
thanks, tim. i'll begin my comments with several callouts on slide seven. first, a strong quarter. this was an exceptional first quarter of top and bottom line growth, highlighted by our record adjusted eps. second, event-driven revenue came in right at our six-year average first quarter number. this result was ahead of our expectations and 13% above the weaker first quarter of last year. third, cost alignment initiatives. our record earnings this quarter, coupled with strong cost discipline, drove an impressive 390 basis points of adjusted operating income margin improvement. fourth, investments.
that strong focus on cost controls and record earnings enabled us to begin deploying dollars against our planned fiscal year 2021 investments. while we took a cautious approach to fund these investments in the first quarter, we expect our investing activity to pick up meaningfully over the remainder of the year. and fifth and the final call out, our full year guidance. we are updating our fiscal 2021 guidance to reflect our strong results and increased confidence in our outlook for the full year. we remain well on track to deliver another year of top and bottom line growth, even in the face of the pandemic, while making meaningful investments to ensure we are well-prepared for the recovery and continued long-term growth. let's turn to slide eight to review our revenue growth drivers. total recurring revenue grew 8%.
the biggest driver of this was growth from onboarding new business, which contributed five points of growth and the carryover impact of acquisitions, which contributed three points of growth. internal growth was neutral, though we did see an uptick in our gto segment, which tim walked you through earlier, offset by marginally negative internal growth in our ics segment, which, as a reminder, was the impact of lower interest rates. let's turn to slide nine for a closer look at event-driven revenues. we saw an unexpected, yet welcome, rebound in event-driven activity this quarter. event-driven revenues grew 13%, putting this quarter right at the average q1, based on our recent history.
the increase this quarter was primarily due to mutual fund proxy activity, offset by comparative low levels of equity contest and special meetings. looking ahead, we are holding our outlook for event-driven revenues flat with last year. while recent quarterly trends have been encouraging, it's still early in the year, and we have no visibility into a proxy campaign by a major mutual fund complex. given the quarterly ebbs and flows of these revenues, we think this is the most prudent approach. let's move to slide 10. strong revenue performance in the quarter was a big contributor to 45% growth in adjusted operating income and 44% in adjusted eps, our strongest q1 earnings ever. the other big driver of our upside was the progress we are making in executing on the cost alignment initiatives we mentioned last quarter.
as you may recall, these cost measures were put in place in order to allow us to deliver continued growth in fiscal '21, while making investments to position us for future growth. you can see the impact these expense measures are having on our operating expense growth. excluding the non-gaap charges, operating expenses were up only 3%, with most of that coming from acquisitions. as you would expect, we benefited from lower spending on travel and entertainment, but the biggest impact came from our cost realignment initiatives that we undertook at the end of fiscal '20 and beginning of fiscal '21. let me walk through some of the measures we are taking. a key part of these initiatives was our focus on realigning our real estate footprint.
all told, we are closing or shrinking over 40 offices, impacting more than 40% of our total number of office locations around the world, which accounts for approximately 10% of our total real estate footprint by square foot. as a result, we incurred a $29 million charge in the first quarter related to these actions and expect another $5 million or so in the second. we expect to realize meaningful annualized savings as a result of these measures and believe that what we have learned through the pandemic will continue to influence on how we utilize our real estate and offices.
another example of our cost initiatives was our move to the private cloud. in addition, we also took active measures to streamline expenses and reduce headcount in underperforming product lines. in total, we expect these cost realignment initiatives to result in savings of more than $80 million. the progress we have made with our heightened focus on cost controls, coupled with record earnings this quarter, enabled us to accelerate deploying dollars against our targeted fiscal year 2021 investments, and our investing activity should pick up meaningfully for the remainder of the year. we have now greenlit most of our planned investments for this fiscal year, which are focused around our people, platforms and technology.
some of these investments, i'd like to call out specifically, include expanding and broadening our virtual shareholder meeting capabilities, providing additional enhancements and developing new digital products, our ltx corporate bond trading platform and additional wealth capabilities. lower taxes also contributed to our earnings-per-share growth. our effective tax rate was about 2% lower than in the prior year period, driven by etb of $9 million. our revised guidance includes a full year total benefit from share linked compensation of $16 million, up from $12 million. however, we continue to expect our full year overall tax rate to remain at 21%. i'll now touch briefly on our capital allocation and our balance sheet on slide 11. free cash flow is typically negative in the first quarter, and that was again, the case this quarter, as we generate a free cash flow of negative $50 million.
the difference between this and the same quarter last year is primarily due to our higher net earnings, strong working capital management and an $18 million gain from the planned sale of hardware assets to ibm, as a result of the private cloud agreement we announced last year. we also seamlessly paid off $400 million of senior notes that matured this september. our uses of cash highlight our commitment to balance capital allocation. first, capex remained relatively consistent. and second, dividends paid thus far represent our commitment to provide returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.
that commitment was underscored by our board's decision last quarter to raise our annual dividend by 6%, the 14th consecutive year with an increase. as we've mentioned on previous calls, we continue to ramp up our platform development and new client conversions. a significant portion of this increase remains attributable to ubs, and the continued development of our global post-trade technology platform. linking these product development efforts to long-term client contracts gives us the confidence and ability to accelerate our product development efforts. in conjunction with our revenue backlog, we view this spend as a positive sign of our growth and future cash flow, and it will continue through this year.
and just as a reminder, you should expect no change to our capital allocation strategy or leverage targets going forward. and now i'd like to sum it all up what you've heard here today and review our updated fiscal '21 guidance, turning to slide 12. based on the strong performance we've discussed today, we are updating our guidance, as shown on slide 12. i think you all know that first quarter is our smallest of the year, and we typically would not make any adjustments to our outlook at this time. that said, as we went into this year, we saw an unusual level of uncertainty and therefore, gave guidance that was wider than typical.
now, after a strong start to the year and with more forward visibility, we are much more confident in our outlook for both revenue and earnings. as a result, we now see recurring revenue growth of 3% to 6% for the full year, and adjusted eps growth of 6% to 10%. we are also updating total revenue guidance to 1% to 4%. our guidance were approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion and closed sales of $190 million to $235 million remains unchanged. these changes removed some of the more negative potential scenarios from our outlook, and show our confidence in delivering a more typical broadridge year, albeit with more investment to take advantage of accelerating trends that benefit our business model. and like tim said, we also now expect full year stock record growth to be in the mid- to high single digits, up from our initial plan of low single digits.
we remain confident in our ability to grow through the headwinds we discussed last quarter, which still remains, especially the tough second half comps on both the gtl and ics side, and a continued drag on our mutual fund retirement business from lower interest rates. we do expect second quarter earnings to be lower than in the first quarter and more in line with historical averages of 12% to 14% of our full year earnings. embedded in that view are our expectations for event-driven revenues of approximately $40 million, a more normalized tax rate and the impact of the increased investment spend i noted. so let me close where i began.
we delivered strong first quarter results with record earnings powered by higher revenues, including higher event-driven revenues and strong execution of our cost alignment initiatives. those strong results put us in a position to begin to ramp our planned investment spend. last, we are updating our full year guidance to reflect our increased confidence in the outlook for fy '21. all in all, we are well on track to deliver another year of top and bottom line growth, and this is all while making the meaningful investments embedded in our guidance to ensure we are well-prepared for the recovery and continued long-term growth.
and with that, we'll turn it back to our operator to begin the q&a portion of the call. melissa?

[operator instructions] the first question comes from david togut of evercore. please go ahead.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. good morning, tim and edmund. 24% stock record growth may actually be the highest stock record growth that broadridge has posted since spinning out of adp in 2007, and i hear the message about reinvesting the excess growth in products and platforms but as we think about the 2021 proxy season, if 24% stock record growth is a jumping-off point for proxy mailings, will you actually be able to reinvest this excess revenue growth fast enough in the second half to actually keep earnings growth within the 6% to 10% growth guidance?
and then my follow-up question, which is related, as we think about fiscal '22 and recognizing you haven't given guidance yet you've got the strong jumping-off point with stock record growth with a lot of secular growth drivers behind that, you've got ubs contract coming on stream this summer, isn't the setup for fiscal '22 potentially above the long-term growth guide as well?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
sure, david. good morning, and thank you for joining us this morning. i'm going to make a couple of comments and then hand it over to edmund to also comment. first, i think certainly we're pleased with the headline number that sounds like 24% but i do want to caution that the second quarter is small and there are some specific names that really drove that. and as we look to the second half we are seeing certainly a very nice stock record growth but not at that level. so that's just a important starting point.
we are really pleased in the investment side. we think that our opportunity here is essentially unlimited relative to our current size and we see -- we do see many arenas where we're better positioned than anyone to meet real industry need. so you will see us continuing to invest within the confines of those three-year targets, and we do have a lot of ability to invest, dave. so i do think that, that we will be able to do that. really, the only thing that would keep that from happening would be if we had sort of surprising event activity in the fourth quarter.
let me ask edmund to just expand on that, and then i'm going to come back to your '22 question.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
thanks, tim, and i think you're right. david, thanks for the question. we began the investments also in the second quarter and i think we do have the ability to continue to ramp up as we complete the second half of the year that gives us momentum going into fiscal year '22. i'll turn it back to tim and let him talk about '22 but i do think we should expect some modest acceleration and recurring revenue growth and adjusted eps as we -- if our outlook continues as we expect for fiscal year '21, if we're able to make those investments they'll contribute to some modest acceleration as i said in investor day through '22 and '23.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
great. and then, dave, with respect to '22 it is certainly very early to comment on that, so we will be definitely coming back to that later in the year and in the fourth quarter. we do see some really good secular trends here and we do feel very confident in our three-year outlook. i think it's just too early to speculate on anything that's sort of above the long-term trends we see.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thank you very much.
operator
the next question comes from peter heckmann of davidson. please go ahead.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson companies -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my question. wanted to see, tim, if you had any early comments on the sec, looks like -- the nyse is looking at -- i guess, to push some of the regulatory oversight on proxy fees to finra in a few initial comments there, but can you talk about where broadridge sits and how you see that shaping out including a timeline?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes, absolutely. peter, i think this is a really good opportunity to step back and look at the regulatory landscape, and i'll work my way to the fees question but just -- i think as you look at the regulatory landscape we have a long history of working with administrations on both sides of the aisle to promote really effective and cost-efficient disclosure. that's really the foundation of our market and with the increasing democratization that we're seeing there is a real -- the need for efficient disclosure is greater than ever before.
the democrat administrations do tend to be somewhat more inclined to extend disclosures and protections and we're already seeing some of that relative to esg and fiduciary standards. but even with all that background we don't really see a substantive regulatory update relative to the things that are happening in our space. so 30e-3 is now live and it's saving funds money. the comments are in for 498b, and those have been really supportive of the summary concept and -- but people are expressing concerns about a drop in prospectuses. so it's not clear whether that will happen.
there is a big push for moving to e-delivery and that's something that we support, and that's really aligned with the idea of summary documents. and then there continues to be, as you raised this question around fees, ici continues to push for a fee review and is talking about let's remove it away from the nyse, which the nyse would like to move it away.
at the same time finra have responded saying they don't want it either it should go to the sec, so i think there's going to be a lot of back and forth here. we do feel wherever it ends up, it will be fine. we have a strong relationship with finra, a strong relationship with the new york stock exchange, strong relationship with the sec and we really believe that when you look at fees, when you bring all parties to the table, not just the funds but all parties and have good information that we will get to a very good place on that. i think it's -- in terms of speculating on timing, i think it's going to be a long debate about who is the right place for it to do and then if there were to be a review, as you know, the last one took several years to unfold.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson companies -- analyst
got you, got you. and then just can you remind us on the rules that have been formalized like 30e-3 and then potentially maybe some insight on for 498b, the -- kind of the puts and takes that broadridge sees over the next six quarters?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
absolutely. so on 30e-3 as -- so that is live now and that's something that we're really proud of that we've brought that solution to the industry as a whole. we have -- i think over 130 fund complexes on the solution now. that is a modest benefit to us financially.
with respect to -- but not too much really noticeable on the results, it's just a -- it's a modest positive. with respect to 498b it had a couple of components. there is -- the most important component was really around moving sort of a long form communications to summary form. we think that would be good for the industry. we think it'd be good for investors and the economics of that are neutral to us. there was some conversation about dropping the annual perspectives. there was a lot of mixed commentary on that as the comments came back, so that seems less likely to us.
as you recall in -- when we discussed this, i believe, in the summer call what we said is the -- we saw potentially a downtick from the prospectus revenue and uptick from the idea of us being able to create the summary documents for people and really provide an industry solution around that. we saw those balancing each other. if we're to receive with the summaries but not with the prospectus downtick then that would be a plus, but i think this is going to be quite some time for it to unfold. the new administration is coming in. they have their own set of priorities, and so i think really the timing of this is highly uncertain at this stage.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson companies -- analyst
alright. thanks for the update.
operator
the next question comes from michael young of truist securities. please go ahead.
michael young -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
hey. thank you for taking the question. just wanted to ask, you kind of touched on capital return priorities but in the second half just wanted to kind of touch on your desire to engage in share repurchase versus maybe looking at acquisitions and kind of what the environment looks like for the acquisitions at this point.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
absolutely. and michael, thank you for the question. look, our capital allocation approach is really not changed and we believe there is almost unlimited opportunity for us to invest on behalf of our shareholders at really attractive rates of return. at the same time, we believe in a strong dividend. we've got net cash buildup. we only invest when we're confident we can execute well. so that's why you see these priorities around internal investment, dividends, m&a, share buyback in that order.
we are definitely looking at m&a opportunities. we think that's an evergreen strategy for us to supplement our internal product development and bring more value to our clients. in this environment, prices are high and it is unclear whether any of the opportunities that we're looking at will come through with prices that makes sense to us, and we have been on the doorstep a couple of times this year, and not been able to go through at a price that made sense for our shareholders.
so i think m&a is something we continue to really look at. there is uncertainty around it. at the same time we won't let cash build up on our balance sheet. and so if we're not able to execute on m&a, you will see share buybacks.
i'd like to just ask edmund to add on to that if there is anything that i've missed it, so just edmund can add on.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
the only thing that i'll add to that because you have the priorities right, tim, is that the reason that we're able to execute on that model, michael, is because of the free cash flow that we're able to generate. it's a historically capital-light business generate free cash flows that are at a 100% over the past couple of years of adjusted net earnings. it's just a little bit as we've invested in our wealth management platform. but the model, as tim described, is the right one and we'll continue to be committed to that. if we don't see the attractive opportunities that hit the high bar that we have for m&a it seems like we won't let the cash build up on our balance sheet and we'll return it in the form of share buybacks.
michael young -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
great. and for my second question, i just wanted to ask kind of qualitatively maybe where we are now and looking for potentially coming out of this pandemic or a little bit more of a reopening. does that aid sales volume, your closed sales volume? i know it's kind of episodic in the second half but just wanted to get a -- the sense of the ability to convert there, and could there be tailwind if we do get more of a reopening?
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
so the first thing i'd say is, we feel very good about the performance of closed sales so far in the first half of the year, coming off of a record 2020, $239 million. i mentioned in investor day that that's been growing at over 11% over the past couple of years. and for the first half you saw that we're largely in line with the performance that we had at the -- during this time last year.
the back half is always tougher for us. that's not anything new. we still feel good about the range that we have. and this environment might be a little challenging in terms of the focus of some of our potential partners on closing the contracts. and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, a large signing can have us to the top or a delay, which normally means a delay into the next year not the fact that we won't be able to close the sale can be a challenge for us. but as of now, i think we feel good about the back half of the year and coming in the range that we just mentioned.
michael young -- truist securities, inc. -- analyst
okay, thanks.
operator
the next question comes from chris donat of piper sandler. please go ahead.
christopher donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks, and good morning, tim. good morning, edmund. i wanted to go back to the equity position growth issue and ask if you can help us sort of unpack what are maybe some of the longer-term trends going on there and some of the things that are more near term? and i caught the commentary about how maybe we see a deceleration in growth in the future on the positions, but in terms of -- i get that the volatility right now is a serious driver of position growth but the -- like the zero-commission trend is certainly something that's going to be with us forever or the zero-position phenomenon.
and then, is there anything else going on on the sidelines like the number of spacs, is that creating new positions? it's a tailwind or are you seeing particular activity just around certain issuers or is it certain brokerage firms that makes you think that it might be more temporary or more permanent? just kind of help us understand the factors moving here on position growth.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
sure, chris, good morning. thank you for calling in. i think on the spac side it's an interesting -- i'm just going to give a couple of comments here and turn it to edmund but i think on the spac side, it's interesting. i think it's may be too early to us to seeing the impact where clearly -- when there's lots of ipo activity, which is a substitute for it that does help over time, so it's a little bit early on that one.
i think we are clearly seeing the extension of healthy trends around the democratization of retail shareholding. and that is building on the prior trends that are still there toward managed accounts and model-based investing. so i think those two are building on each other. and -- so i do think that it's going to be something that is longer term. now the outlook does have elevated growth for this year and a return to more typical growth thereafter.
but i know, edmund, you've been looking into this in a lot of detail so.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
yes, i mean i think that's exactly right. chris, i'd like to just back it up a step from what tim just said. historically, as i mentioned, 6% to 8% growth in equity positions or so that's accelerated for the reasons that tim just mentioned. so the managed accounts in the model-based investments that was in the mid single to high single-digit growth previously and i don't expect any change there.
the zero-commission trading, i think you mentioned more retail investors coming and i think that's good for broadridge. in fact, they want to engage and interact digitally, so i think that's also a tailwind for broadridge and hopefully that's stable going forward. the newer things, the coordinated buying efforts, the spacs don't exactly yet know exactly how stable that is and we're not counting on that as we look to our outlook going forward. but as tim mentioned, that higher growth that we saw q4, q1 and q2, we expect to moderate but still be in the low double-digit for the rest of this year. after that our assumptions are that we return to mid single-digit growth.
christopher donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. all right. thanks. thanks very much for the detail there. and then sort of related issue. just yesterday we saw january volume from interactive brokers. so one brokerage firm putting up pretty impressive numbers and -- anyway, just as we think about gto revenues and your sensitivity to volumes there, anything you'd say is -- if we think we're in a period of elevated volume what that could do for revenue or just how you think about equity volumes feeding into gto revenues? what's sort of fixed versus what's variable on the revenue side?
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's -- it continues to be -- i mentioned in the opening remarks that we saw during the march and april time period a spike in the equity trading volumes for gto, and i think i showed a slide that showed the equity and fixed income volumes combined there for gto. but it's continued to be at an elevated level through q2 and even after the environment that we are in right now. so it's continued to be elevated. but i think as we go into q3, into q4, growing over that high performance in q3 and q4 of last year we will -- that will be a tough comp for us. and so, as i've mentioned, the q3 outlook will be overall flat to slightly lower relative to where we were last year. and that -- part of that is driven by the trade volumes in the gto business.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
and just one thing i do want to add on top of that, chris, which is to build off this perspective, which is certainly the volatility in january it was -- it did exceed the peaks of last march. and as we look at our wealth strategy we've executed really well through that. and some others have been challenged and i think it just reiterates the power of an industry solution for some of these critical but non-differentiating functions.
christopher donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. thanks, tim. thanks, edmund.

the next question comes from andrew bauch of wolfe research. please go ahead.
andrew bauch -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, everyone. this is andrew on behalf of darren. thank you for taking my question. nice set of results here and i kind of want to dig into the investments into potential new product adjacencies. clearly, derivative activity from a retail perspective has driven a lot of the recent headlines and it's nice to see the gto brand announcement from last year, but i guess my question is, how well positioned is broadridge to step into really these derivative adjacencies and just wondering how many more of those types of deals you think are winnable, and how should we think about the opportunity to take share in that arena outside of typical cash equities?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
absolutely. and we think that the opportunity derivatives is a really nice one that plays on our whole theme of simplification because it's what we've been working on is simplification within cash securities across geographies by bringing derivatives into that a lot of people to simplify with a number of platforms and so it's really cost effective for clients. i think that, that is a very nice opportunity for us on top of the cash securities opportunity. it is -- i think it will take some time for it to unfold as people will be looking for us to to bring r.j. o'brien live. and so, i'm not looking for it to have immediate impact on this but i do think that over the longer term it's going to really increase the power of our argument around global simplification, and it will help on both the opportunity in derivatives and will help with sales on the cash side as well.
andrew bauch -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. and then just a housekeeping point. a lot of conversation about balancing investment and growth here, so i guess was there any -- and how should we think about the margin benefit you saw from your previously announced cost alignment initiatives and is there anything changed from a investment strategy, from just even a month ago at the investor day, and how you think about the investment growth trade-off here.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
so it's a great question. two things i'd say about it. the higher performance on the revenue side and our ability to be able to get the efficiency gains expand operating margins through the initiatives, which i'll touch on that we mentioned in q1, is what allowed us to make these investments. and so in q1, we talked about -- roughly about $80 million in cost initiatives, real estate, cloud migration, product realignment and i think we're well on track. you saw 150 basis points of margin expansion in the second quarter, and i think it's that efficiency that gives us the capacity to be able to make these investments.
the second point i'll make and then i'll turn it to tim to see if he has anything, is that the investments has been a key part of the financial model in strategy for growth, a key part of our capital allocation program prior to my joining and it's going to -- we're going to continue to remain committed to support the future growth. i think we have -- and tim mentioned some of these, we have a number of higher returning investment opportunities as we look across our post-trade platforms, our wealth management platforms.
as we look across products and srd ii and dsm, and obviously our people who are driving sales market strategies, these things help us with growth long-term. might be a little margin compression in the short term but they help us with long-term growth. so this leadership team is going to stay committed to investing, using the efficiency gains that i just talked about and still delivering steady and consistent earnings growth that we were able to post and guide to for the rest of this year.
andrew bauch -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. nice execution on the unique opportunity, guys.
operator
the next question comes from mark palmer of btig. please go ahead.
mark palmer -- btig -- analyst
yes, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. first question, we're already getting a couple of inquiries from clients about this. just given the environment and some of the frenzy that we've seen over the past week plus with the reddit revolution and what have you -- what impact if any are you seeing on the gto side from anything that's going on there, and then i have one follow-up.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes, mark, good morning. i'll just jump in on that, which is certainly and we are seeing record volumes and volumes that are above what we saw last spring. and the broad point is that we are just -- operationally we're handling those really well and it has been a challenging week for the industry. and as i said few minutes ago, i think that really reinforces the logic of a mutualized industry solution.
with respect to what we think the results, the impact on the results will be, i am not sure that we're thinking that these really frenzied things will be sustained. and we think that's a short-term phenomenon. and as edmund remarked as we get into q3 we are going against comparables last year where they were absolute record volumes and so we're not seeing -- we're not expecting significant year-on-year growth in -- from trading in gto. obviously, we saw revenue from sales and other things but even with this activity we think the activity will moderate and -- really against tough comps.
mark palmer -- btig -- analyst
thanks very much and very nice quarter.
operator
the next question comes from puneet jain of j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
puneet jain -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my question. tim, given that we are almost into this new environment, are you seeing any long-term changes in retail consumer behavior as it relates to physical versus digital delivery of communications or investing through an advisor versus on their own?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yeah, absolutely, puneet. so i think that we are certainly seeing relative to physical versus digital, we saw very strong growth in our digital communications in the first half. i remarked on that and that builds on a very nice year last year, and we're seeing very strong interest from our clients in terms of digital transformation and working with us to upgrade their infrastructure for digital communications.
i think i was a bit surprised to to see the increase in distribution revenues this quarter and that's not something that we generally expect. that was really due to increase in both regulatory and event communications. i think we continue to expect that over the long run that physical piece will be a smaller part of our business model and the digital piece will be a bigger piece.
relative to advisor versus digital channels with respect to investing, i think we are just -- we're seeing both. we saw very good position growth across all of our broker dealers, and including both advisor and online. i think perhaps in terms of number of investors we're seeing with this democratization, the new investors being on the digital side, but if you look at where the money is, it's still definitely on the advisor side. and those underlying trends that we've been talking about for the past couple of years, we don't see any change in terms of move to managed accounts, move to model-based investing.
so we think that trend will continue. we do think there is an overlay of a new trend around democratization that will add and bring new investors in, which is why we highlighted the fact that with all these new investors really the need for strong disclosure is higher than ever.
puneet jain -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
got it. thank you.

this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to tim gokey for any closing remarks.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
great. thank you, andrew. i thank everyone for joining us on today's call and persevering through our technical difficulties. just know, this was not conducted on the broadridge platform, so we will put that again. i just want to say that as we finish off here, i think my conclusion looking at this quarter and a half is that we are executing on our growth strategy.
i think you heard us talk about it multiple times that we are investing for future growth, and are on track to deliver at the higher end of our recurring revenue, adjusted eps growth range. we feel really good about the three years as well. we appreciate your support for broadridge. we look forward to updating you in april on our third quarter call.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the broadridge second quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to edings thibault, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
edings thibault -- head, investor relations
thank you, andrew. good morning, everybody, and welcome to broadridge's fiscal second quarter '21 earnings call. our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the investor relations' section of broadridge.com. joining me on the call this morning are tim gokey, our ceo and our cfo, edmund reese. before i turn the call over to tim a few standard reminders.
we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding broadridge that involve risks. a summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides, and a more complete description on our annual report on form 10-k. we will also be referring to several non-gaap measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of broadridge's underlying operating results. an explanation of these non-gaap measures and reconciliations to their comparable gaap measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation.
let me now turn the call over to tim gokey. tim?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
thank you, edings. good morning and thank you for joining us. i'd like to start with a special welcome to edmund reese, our new cfo on his first broadridge earnings call. i know many of you were introduced to edmund during our virtual investor day in december, and i hope you came away as impressed as i have been over the past two months.
this morning i'll provide an overview or the key messages from this quarter and give you an update on our progress against the growth plan we discussed in december. edmund will review our financial results, and we will close with your questions. let's get started.
after a strong second quarter, broadridge is on track to deliver another solid year of top and bottom-line growth. we now expect to be at the higher end of our guidance range for both recurring revenue and adjusted eps growth. that guidance reflects our strong quarterly results. for the quarter, broadridge delivered 7% recurring revenue growth, continued margin expansion and 38% adjusted eps growth in a seasonally small quarter.
we continue to execute against the growth plan we outlined in december. i'll highlight later some of the specific steps we've taken on key initiatives across governance, capital markets, and wealth and investment management.
our strong second quarter results and outlook for the second half of the year have given us the opportunity to step up our investment. i'm pleased to see us increasing our investment in our technology, products and people to meet our clients' growing needs as they face accelerating trends toward next generation mutualization, resiliency and digital transformation.
finally our outlook for the year, means we are off to a strong start toward achieving our latest set of three-year growth objectives including 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted eps growth. we remain focused on long-term growth, which has helped us deliver consistent, sustainable, top quartile total shareholder return. our focus on long-term growth is the reason why i remain excited by our progress against our clear strategy.
let's turn to slide 4 for an update on some recent achievements against these goals. i'll start with our governance franchise where we are delivering next generation regulatory capabilities, building data-driven solutions for funds, delivering end-to-end solutions for issuers and driving omnichannel communications. during the quarter, we made strong progress on each of these fronts.
first, our next-gen regulatory. we're making strong progress on building a european regulatory communications hub for the shareholder rights directive ii. we're winning new clients across the eu including major institutions in both italy and spain. we're also working with other technology providers including a leading danish bank technology player and a leading french governance solutions provider to deliver broadridge's srd ii solutions.
broadridge also made strong progress against delivering data-driven solutions to mutual funds. a key part of this effort is our growing data and insights business. based on our unique data, we enable funds to better understand at an aggregate level who and importantly, where their shareholders are. the compelling value of these solutions was further demonstrated by a multi-million dollar sale in the second quarter to a leading global fund company, who will be using our data solutions for multiple use cases, including enabling the repatriation of tens of millions of dollars of dividends to their u.s. shareholders.
on the issuer side, we continue to see strong demand for virtual shareholder meetings. during the past calendar year, we hosted meetings for 83% of the s&p 100, and we're seeing strong renewal rates as we begin the lead up to the 2021 proxy season. we continue to enhance our vsm capabilities by rolling out the first phase of an enhanced platform, which will enable corporate issuers to leverage our unique capabilities around shareholder validation while using the meeting platform of their choice. finally, in omnichannel communications, we continued with double-digit growth in our digital communications revenue in the first half, building on last year's strong performance.
let me turn now to our capital markets franchise, where we continue to drive important mutualization benefits to our global clients. broadridge is already the leading global post-trade provider for cash securities processing over $10 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day. during the quarter, we took an important step toward expanding beyond cash securities into exchange-traded derivatives.
we announced that r.j. o'brien, the largest independent futures exchange and clearing firm has selected broadridge's global derivatives platform. our scalable and agile solution will enable r.j.o. to streamline and modernize its operations with one unified global technology platform. we're also bringing network value to our clients by extending to the front office in fixed income. as we described at investor day, our ai-driven corporate bond trading platform ltx, remains on track for a broader launch this year.
we're now live in a soft launch with select clients, and we continue to receive positive feedback. pro launch with more than 10 dealers and 35 buy-side clients will be later this year.
turning to wealth and investment management. as we laid out in december, our goal is to build a leading technology and operations provider to the wealth management industry by providing both a growing list of differentiated component solutions and by delivering our next-generation industry wealth technology platform.
first and foremost, we have continued to demonstrate the value of our leading wealth back-office platform by seamlessly processing the recent spike or record trading volumes driven by high volatility and increased retail participation. these volumes have challenged the industry as homegrown systems have struggled to scale. our performance has continued to drive home the value of a mutualized industry solution.
at the same time, we continue to extend our suite of component solutions, working with multiple partners to bring new and innovative solutions to our clients. and we continue to make strong progress toward the launch of our next-generation wealth management platform with ubs. the net of all of this across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management, that we are seeing strong execution on tangible deliverables coupled with unique innovation that gives us confidence on our longer-term growth is on track.
let's turn now to a brief review of our recurring revenue results on slide 5. edmund will cover our financial performance in more detail but i want to share my key takeaways from our 7% recurring revenue growth in the second quarter. first, i was pleased to see balanced growth across both segments, the 7% growth in ics an 8% growth in gto.
second, as i look at the drivers of growth in ics what stands out is the impact of strong stock record growth, which reached 24% and even in a seasonally small quarter drove strong growth in regulatory revenues. our business is clearly benefiting from the long-term technology trends. it has lowered the cost to retail investors of buying and owning individual shares. these trends, which include the widespread introduction of commission free trading are having a broader and longer-term impact on investor behavior. it goes beyond the very recent volatility in a few high-profile names.
stock record growth has been healthy across virtually all of our broker-dealer clients. and it's been especially strong among online brokers who are leading many of these changes. as edmund will discuss, we expect these growth trends to remain favorable in the second half of the year.
third, i'm also pleased to see a strong growth contribution from both our data-driven fund solutions as well as our issuer business. customer communications revenues were flat with strong growth in digital revenues balancing modest covid declines in print volumes.
fourth and last. strong sales onboarding and higher trading volumes are driving the growth in our gto segment. as i noted earlier, much of the impact from higher trading levels is coming on the retail side, which clearly benefited from our wealth -- which clearly benefited our wealth and investment management business in the second quarter. more important from my perspective is that year-to-date growth in both capital markets and wealth has been balanced at 7% and 9%, respectively.
let me wrap up my comments with some final thoughts about how to put our strong second quarter and first half in context. simply put, our performance in the first half of fiscal '21 gives me even more confidence that broadridge will continue to deliver steady and consistent revenue and earnings growth in the years to come. as we shared at our investor day, we have a large and growing $46 billion market opportunity, three strongly going franchise businesses, and a clear targeted growth plan to take advantage of long-term trends around next-generation mutualization, resilience and digital transformation.
we are on track to deliver another solid year of recurring revenue growth, margin expansion and adjusted eps growth at the higher end of our 6% to 10% range. our strong results and disciplined cost actions have put us in a position to deliver against the higher end of our revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal '21 while making investments that will sustain our growth through fiscal '23 and beyond.
we are investing in our technology platforms and strengthening our product development teams. we're also investing in our human capital, are rewarding our associates, increasing our diversity, equity, inclusion and career development investments, and upping our recruiting for new talent, all of which will enhance our talent base going forward. as we enter the seasonally larger second half, broadridge is delivering in the short term and investing for the long term. that's a great place to be and a strong formula for long-term value creation.
before i hand it over to edmund, i want to thank our associates around the world for the important work they do and for their commitment to the service profit chain. whether working from home or socially distanced on the production floor, they are persevering and delivering for our clients at an extraordinary rate. they truly are enabling better financial lives for millions of investors around the globe, and their engagement in this powerful mission is what drives us forward. thank you.
edmund, over to you.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
thanks, tim, and thank you again for the warm welcome to our first earnings call as cfo. during my opening remarks at our december investor day, i mentioned my excitement joining a company with such a strong leadership team and growth strategy. now over two full months and i'm even more excited and more confident in broadridge's ability to execute our simple but powerful financial model. and our strong second quarter and outlook for the full year are great examples of how that model works.
as you can see here, looking at the q2 financial summary on slide 7, this was a strong quarter of top and bottom line growth across all our key metrics. recurring revenues grew 7%, operating margin increased a 150 basis points year-over-year to 11.2%, and we continue to demonstrate our ability to expand margins even a ramp -- while ramping up the investment spend that tim highlighted earlier, which we said we would accelerate during last quarter's call. and adjusted eps grew to $0.73 in the quarter, up 38% over q2 '20.
now let's turn the slide and get into the details of the quarter, starting with some of our key operational metrics. broadridge's recurring revenue growth benefits from underlying volume growth trends, including record growth. over the last 10 years, equity and mutual fund record growth has averaged 6% to 8%, and is a driver of our regulatory revenues. stock record growth in q2 increased 24%, driven in part by a few large issuers. though i'll remind you to keep in mind that second quarter volumes historically make up less than 10% of the full year total.
looking ahead to the seasonally larger second half of the year, we expect low double-digit growth across stock records. looking further ahead, our three-year objectives assume that this increased growth moderates in returns to mid-single digits. touching briefly on trade volumes, which you'll see at the bottom of this slide, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of aggregate double-digit volume growth. this growth reflects the continued volatility in the markets, which as you know spiked last march and april, and remains well above pre-covid levels. as a result, we expect tough trading volume comps for both q3 and q4.
now turning to closed sales, the biggest driver of our recurring revenue growth. our $79 million closed sales year-to-date are in line with our performance over the same period last year. we continue to see strong demand for our ics solutions including virtual shareholder meetings, regulation-driven srd sales across europe, and continued client expansion in cross-selling data solutions to existing customers.
we remain on track to achieve our full-year guidance of $190 million to $235 million for closed sales. historically, the closed sales performance in the back half of the year has been impacted by large signings. a large signing could propel us to the top end of our guidance range and conversely delays could lower our performance. and i'll also note that we continue to feel good about our revenue backlog, which as of q4 '20 was 12% of our fiscal '20 recurring revenue and gives us great visibility into our top-line growth.
turning to recurring revenue growth on slide 10. as i said recurring revenue grew 7% in the quarter well in line with our historical mid single-digit growth performance, and demonstrating the resiliency and consistency of our recurring revenue growth model. with a strong start to the year, we are on track to be at the higher end of our 3% to 6% recurring revenue growth guidance range. now let's look at the drivers of the quarter's recurring revenue growth.
slide 11 highlights that our growth is primarily driven by our internal efforts. organic growth has consistently been the largest component of our recurring revenue growth. in q2, revenue from new sales drove 6 points of growth and remained the biggest driver of our revenue growth across both our gto and ics segments. we continued our long track record of retaining 98% of existing client recurring revenue. and internal growth contributed 2 points of growth driven by higher trading volumes in our gto segment. ics internal growth was neutral as our strong position growth was offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower customer communications print volumes. the impact of acquisitions made within the last 12 months contributed 1 point. barring any new acquisitions, we would expect the contribution of growth from acquisitions to be less than a point in q3 and zero in q4.
and while we're focused on recurring revenue, let me share some insights on the drivers of growth across our updated ics and gto product lines that tim touched on earlier. these categories were introduced at investor day with the goal to better align our external reporting with our growth strategies. [technical issues]
operator
excuse me, this is an operator. there seems to be an issue with the current speaker's line. just one moment, please. excuse me, i have mr. reese to reconnect. apologies for the inconvenience. please go ahead, sir.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
okay, so i apologize for the technical difficulties that we just had. i think i dropped off on slide 11 of our document. so i'll pick up there. slide 11 highlights that our growth is primarily driven by our internal efforts. organic growth has consistently been the largest part of our recurring revenue growth. in q2, revenues from new sales -- i'm not clear that i'm being heard yet.
operator
yes, sir. you are coming through clearly, sir. please continue.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
okay, so in q2 revenue from new sales drove 6 points of growth will remain the biggest driver of our revenue growth across both our gto and ics segments. we continued our long track record of retaining 98% of existing revenue from existing clients and internal growth contributed 2 points of growth driven by higher trading volumes in our gto segment. ics internal growth was neutral as our strong position growth was offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower customer communications print volumes.
the impact of acquisitions made within the last 12 months contributed 1 point. barring any new acquisitions, we'd expect the contribution to growth from acquisitions to be less than a point in q3 and zero in q4. and while we're focused on recurring revenues let me share some insights on the drivers of growth across our updated ics and gto product lines that tim touched on earlier.
these categories were introduced at investor day with the goal to better align our external reporting with our growth strategies. ics recurring revenues rose 7% with strong growth across three of our four product categories. the biggest contribution to growth came from our regulatory revenues, which were propelled by strong 24% stock record growth and 5% interim record growth.
we also benefited from additional growth across our international and canadian proxy volumes. revenues of our data-driven fund solutions benefited from strong double-digit growth in our data and insight product revenues and the acquisition last february of fundslibrary offset by the impact of lower interest rates on our mutual fund trade processing unit.
customer communication revenues were flat in the quarter as double-digit growth in digital revenues was offset by a decline in print volumes. looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect to see the impact of some recent client wins in the fourth quarter, which should put that business on a firmer track to low single-digits growth. issuer solutions revenues rose 14% driven by higher revenues from virtual shareholder meetings, which also helped drive growth across a broader set of issuer products and offset the impact of lower revenue in our transfer agency business.
in gto, recurring revenues grew 8% driven by strong growth in our wealth and investment management revenues. both our wealth and capital markets product revenues benefited from new client onboardings and the impact of the 24% increase in trading volumes versus the second quarter of fiscal 2020, with higher growth coming from the retail side of our clients' businesses. as we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we expect the growth in trading volumes to slowly significantly lap last spring's spike in volatility, which coupled with the lower license activity will put pressure on gto growth.
now i will turn to slide 12 to briefly touch on our total revenue performance. as a reminder on broadridge's revenue mix, 65% of our total revenue is recurring. about 31% is from distribution revenues and 4% from more cyclical event-driven revenue. this revenue mix has steadily improved since 2017. recurring revenue's comprised 58% of the total. our total revenue growth this quarter was stronger than usual reaching 9% with distribution revenues contributing 3 points due to the increased mailings we saw corresponding to the high record growth and increased event-driven activity this quarter.
moving forward, we expect the low-to-no margin distribution revenues to decline over time as we focus on increasing higher margin digital revenues across our governance business. pausing briefly on the debt-driven revenues we saw another quarter align with our historical norms of about $50 million a quarter, and we remain on track to meet or exceed our $180 million outlook for fiscal '21 event-driven revenues. going forward, as i covered in investor day, we expect annual driven event revenues to return to approximately $200 million average that we've seen over the past seven years.
turning to slide 13. this was another strong quarter of margin expansion. we increased adjusted operating income margin by 150 basis points over last year. during the quarter we began to ramp up our level of investment in our technology platforms, product capabilities, and people as we highlighted we will on our first quarter call. while this increased investment is likely to affect margin expansion in the second half of the fiscal year, these investments will support our long-term growth.
and i want to underline that point because it's critical to how we run our business. we're foregoing some of the near-term margin expansion that you get from under-investment in favor of capturing the larger future margin opportunity that is driven by growth. that formula has been a key factor in broadridge's ability to drive long-term sustainable growth.
moving to capital allocation on the following slide. we generated $51 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $82 million over the first six months of fiscal '20 driven by higher earnings and strong working capital management. broadridge remains committed to a balanced capital allocation policy, which prioritizes internal investment, growing our dividend, m&a and returning excess capital to shareholders, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.
during the first six months of the fiscal year we invested $128 million in building out our industry platforms and another $51 million in capex and software spending. turning to capital returns on the right-hand side of the slide, our dividend has grown and remains in line with our historical 45% payout ratio.looking ahead to the second half of the year when we've historically generated most of our annual free cash flow, broadridge is in great shape to pursue attractive targeted m&a opportunities or repurchase shares.
now turning to guidance on slide 15. we expect recurring revenue growth to be at the higher end of our 3% to 6% range with higher full-year record growth and strong first-half trading volumes offsetting the drag that we expect from lower second-half trading volumes. we expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand to approximately 18% from 17.5% in fiscal year '20 as we balance near-term returns with continued investments to sustain long-term growth.
and finally we expect to be at the higher end of our adjusted eps growth guidance range of 6% to 10% putting us well on track to achieve our three-year 8% to 12% adjusted eps growth objective that we presented at our investor day in december. finally, as i noted earlier, we continue to expect closed sales in the range of $190 million to $235 million. and looking below the line, we expect our full-year effective overall tax rate to remain at 21% confirming what we shared on our last call. and one final point in our outlook, we expect third quarter adjusted eps to be flat or slightly lower fiscal year '20 driven by increased investment spend and lower license revenues.
so before we begin to take your questions, let me share some final thoughts. i told you at our investor day that broadridge has a simple financial model based on sustainable revenue growth, consistent investment, margin expansion and balanced capital allocation. that model has produced steady and consistent earnings growth over time and helped drive strong, top quartile total shareholder returns. our second quarter results and expectations for the full year are a great example of how that model works.
we generated strong 7% recurring revenue growth propelled by long-term trends. that growth helped drive the 150 basis points of margin expansion, which in turn is enabling us to make incremental investments to drive long-term growth, especially over the second half of our year. the end result is earnings growth that positions us well to deliver on our three-year financial objectives. it's a great example of how we manage our business to drive sustainable revenue growth, steady and consistent adjusted eps growth, and historically top-quartile tsr.
now let me hand the call back to andrew to take your questions.

operator
[operator instructions] and our first question comes from david togut of evercore isi. please go ahead.
millie wu -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking the question. this is millie wu on for david togut. so my question is the event-driven business continues to shift back to strong growth after several years of decline. how sustainable is the reason turnaround in the event-driven business? and how high were the incremental margins this quarter?
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
so millie, thanks for the question. event-driven revenue, as you know, is about 4% of our recurring revenue. it's a bit more cyclical, but it's an important part of our total offering. it's high-quality revenue at -- it's a strong margin in that business. and as you mentioned, q3 has continued to increase and go back to our historical norms. we've done about -- on average, about $50 million a quarter. you've seen pickup in mutual fund proxy business and contests in capital markets. it's not unusual to see us have an unusually high quarter or an unusually low quarter. but over the long term, i do expect event-driven revenue to pick up and grow in line with stock record growth.
so during the investor day, i came out and said that we've seen 14 years ago, event-driven revenues average for the first seven years, $180 million. over the last seven years, it's been above $200 million. and i feel comfortable that we should anchor in the full year number for event-driven revenue, and we expect it to be at that level as we look throughout our objectives in the '22 and '23 and, again, at reasonably strong margins in that business.
millie wu -- analyst
okay. thank you so much.

the next question comes from michael young of truist. please go ahead.
michael young -- truist -- analyst
hey. thank you for taking the question. i appreciate the guidance on the itiviti growth contribution for fiscal '21. would you hazard a guess or any guidance as to how much you expect that to contribute to kind of the long-term 3-year growth guidance?
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
yes. michael, let me jump in there. and tim, you might have some commentary on the business itself. and we were thinking -- when we were bringing itiviti on, first, we were looking for very strong assets in the capital market space after deploying most of our m&a to wealth management and governance over the past three years. and the thing that looks great from a financial standpoint for itiviti is the strong growth outlook. the core business by itself is mid-single-digit growth from a revenue standpoint. i talked earlier that we committed to about $20 million in synergies by 2025 in that business. so you should see high single-digit growth in that business.
the recurring revenue models are predictable. they're subscription-like revenues, healthy operating margins in that business. and i think that's a great time to finance it in this low interest rate environment. i also said that we expect, because of that profile, to get to double-digit irrs in this business. so i think we'll focus on integrating it, but i do expect it to have that high single-digit revenue growth at 30% margin, so a strong return over a very long time for us in that business. tim, i don't know if you want to add some comments to the profile.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes, michael, just remember at the time that we -- and we announced this, we said we were -- we felt confident that we'd be at the high end of our 3-year guide? so in terms of what the impact would be beyond '22, i think that also gives a bit of a flavor. and just to add on to what edmund talked about strategically, we are really pleased with the way to strengthen our capital markets franchise and really allows us to drive front to back. that has been really emphasized in some of the client conversations that we've had since the acquisition was announced. we've talked to our top 50 clients and have half of them, one, have a conversation about this. and so it's really gratifying to see that level of interest.
but specifically in the vision of front to back, and in the vision of having an alternative in the market with someone like broadridge that is investing in this business. so we feel really good about that piece on the capital markets, and we also feel good about how it adds to our global scale and reach -- and really deepens our relationships with some of our most important clients. so we're excited about it. and we do think it's going to add to our growth and our ongoing organic growth in terms of the rate, specifically bring us to the top end of the 3-year guidance.
michael young -- truist -- analyst
okay. great. and maybe just a bit of a departure from that question. but just as we look to kind of postpandemic and reopening and sales trends, are you seeing any increased conversations or willingness of clients to take on new products, new conversions, et cetera? is that a tailwind at all for the business at this point?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
i would say on the sales side, we are -- it's interesting because we've been this past year, really in the situation where -- i have talked about this before, in terms of originating new opportunities and then working them through the long sort of cycle of business case, requirements and things like that and doing that all remotely. and that's been a very interesting evolution over this past year. i think the productivity has been remarkably good. it is -- we'll see as we get to the end of the year here in terms of timing of some of the larger transactions.
but what we're seeing certainly in the -- as people look out is this real pressure for next-generation technology, the digitization that is happening has just accelerated where people want to be, and you'll talk to client after client about who will say, what they expect it to happen over three years has happened in 12 months, or over five years that happened in 18 months. and so they're really looking to make change. it also means they're very busy. and so it's a matter of getting on their agenda. but we feel very good about our ability to continue to drive our business through net new sales.
michael young -- truist -- analyst
okay. thank you.

the next question comes from chris donat of piper sandler. please go ahead.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
thanks, and good morning, everyone. i had one question. i just wanted to check in as we're thinking about -- as we refine our 2022 fiscal models. with the ubs wealth management platform, can you just remind us on where we stand with that? and once it goes live, how that starts to affect revenues and expenses?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. chris, it's tim. just on ubs, we continue to have a great partnership with ubs. we continue to support their ongoing technology and digital transformation. there are parts of this that are already live and creating benefits for ubs and its financial advisors. we're continuing to invest for both for ubs and for clients two, three, four, and we're having very good conversations with clients two, three, four. and i think our results show the momentum we have in our components. when we get into the timing of specifically when this is going to happen, it is -- that's really ubs' announcement to make. and when we get to august and really talking more specifically about '22, we'll have a further update then. but right now, i can't comment more on it.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. understood. and then edmund, with itiviti, i'm not sure i caught the comments fully on the impact for fiscal 2022. well, i guess, first, did you say that the -- and was it $230 million of revenue? and did that include purchase accounting adjustments? and then if we start thinking about fiscal 2023 as the impact of purchase accounting adjustments paid, would we expect maybe -- but optically, that you have higher revenue growth just without the purchase accounting adjustments just so we're thinking...
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
yes. so yes, understood, chris. thanks for the question. so just specifically on fiscal '22 for a moment, we said we expect it to add approximately $250 million in revenue, and that does include the purchase accounting of about $30 million. i mentioned that about 2/3 of that is in fiscal '22, the other 1/3 is this year in fiscal '21 impacting the revenues that we expect over the next two months. that will be about eight points to the recurring revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and, as i mentioned, about two to three points to the adjusted eps growth. and so you can expect growth on that revenue fully in the fiscal year '23 without any further impact from the accounting adjustment that i was just talking about.
so we feel good about the contribution that it will make as we end the '23, as tim said a moment ago, helping propel us to the top end of our range. i'll also add, chris, when we gave the 3-year objectives, we talked about 5% to 7% organic recurring revenue growth. and we talked about one to two points from m&a and acquisition, and itiviti makes -- i think that's what makes us feel good about the objectives is that itiviti comes on and adds this type of contribution, putting us at the higher end of those 3-year objectives.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
got it. thanks, edmund.
operator
the next question comes from john rodrigues of d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
pete heckmann -- d.a. davidson. -- analyst
this is john calling off for pete heckmann. now that you gave additional time to dig into the itiviti business, i wanted to just see what are the main solutions that you guys see that are best poised for cross-selling? thank you.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes, john, it's tim. and we are -- we haven't closed yet. so we'll be -- but we will be digging in. i think on the cross-selling opportunities, there are several. they have a strong position on continental europe, a stronger position than we do. and so the ability to bring our products to their clients in continental europe and asia, for that matter, that's sort of opportunity one. opportunity two, we have a much stronger position in north america. and so the opportunity to help them better penetrate north america is opportunity two. and so those are sort of the geographic opportunities.
and then we have the asset class opportunities, and they have a very strong position in exchange-traded derivatives, and that's a more nascent area for us. and so we expect that combined offer to be very interesting. and we have a very strong position in fixed income, and they have a building position in fixed income. and so that's another attractive area. so we think that between the geographic cross-sell and the asset class cross-sell, that there's a really nice degree of revenue synergy built into this. and that, as you know, most of the things that we do, we do really for revenue growth. we're not a buy this slow-growing thing and cut costs, and then going to the next one. that's sort of not our model. so we think this will add nicely to our organic growth for a long time to come.
operator
the next question comes from patrick o'shaughnessy of raymond james. please go ahead.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. on ltx can you speak to what sort of participation you have at this point from some of the largest fixed income dealers?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes, patrick. thanks, this is tim. and i'm glad you asked that question actually because it was sort of in the script there, but we have, just in this last quarter, signed -- i'm not sure if it's the largest, but one of the top three in terms of fixed income managers, and so that is not on board yet, but it will be coming on board in the next few months, but that was a real milestone for us. so i think the milestones that we were excited about on ltx, and why we continue to talk about it were the patent we received on the best execution protocol, which really allows aggregation across buyers and sellers.
the first execution of an aggregated trade, which is a real milestone and so important because the electronification of trading, as you know, has been a little slower in fixed income and really hasn't penetrated the larger trades, which are the important ones. and so that aggregation capability, we think, really will help unlock the digitization of fixed income. and then the third milestone was really the designing of one of the top -- one of the very top fixed income managers. and so we think that's just another sign and why we're confident, as we go through this year. we're going to continue to see momentum pick up.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. appreciate that, tim. and certainly, i think one of the interesting aspects of ltx is that it's kind of a dealer-centric solution. so i appreciate that you guys have got alliance did that big trade. you signed up one of the biggest buy-side firms. but on the sell side, are you working with the biggest sell-side broker-dealers at this point with ltx?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
at the moment, i would say we are working a tier below the very largest ones and -- which is a great first mover opportunity for those firms. we're working very closely with them, including raymond james, as you know. and so we're excited about that. we are in conversations with two of the tier one firms, and we'll see how those go. i think what's interesting is when we put -- and as you say, it's dealer-centric, so it really enables them to grow their business, and that is so much about the ai and about enabling them to serve your clients really well. and when you get a trade-in as the salesperson, as the trader, the likely counterparties, the top one or two were sort of obvious but number 25 you might not think of.
and what those firms are seeing and they're testing our ai side by side with their ai, and they're seeing that it adds real value in terms of, well, ""who's the number 25 first,"" and i might not otherwise call it. and so it really increased the efficiency for the salesperson and allows them to serve their clients a lot better. so that ai piece, even independent of the marketplace, has real value. and so i think it really makes us some very interesting conversations.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
yes. very interesting. and then switching gears to an expense question here. to what extent does your updated fiscal year '21 guidance reflect incremental organic investment relative to your prior outlook? and assuming there is some incremental organic investment, where are you directing those dollars?
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
so patrick, i think we've obviously signaled during the q2 call that we would continue to invest in the business, and i'll talk a little bit, and tim, you should jump in on where those investments are going. but again, i'll reiterate that we remain committed to being able to drive adjusted operating margin to the tune of 50 basis points for the year, and i think we'll still be able to do that. but it does include organic investments. i think about them across our technology platforms, tim mentioned in his earlier remarks across post-trade, across wealth management and our infrastructure.
as you think about the network resiliency that we've had over the past few quarters where we've seen record trade volume growth, i would say that organic investment into our infrastructure and technology platforms are starting to pay dividends. you see it in our products as well. tim earlier talked about the vsm solutions and the srd solutions within that regulatory business growth. you saw 28% growth benefiting from the investments that we've been making in those solutions. and i almost added on to his comments about ltx where we have continued investments there. and as we think about our 3-year outlooks, no revenue associated with that.
so that's an opportunity for us as well. and then the final thing i'd say, patrick, is investments in our go-to-market and sales organizations, particularly as we think about expanding internationally, focusing on our premium accounts. these are investments that are really, as i mentioned, think drive recurring revenue growth. so we'll continue -- we have been, and we'll continue to be, committed to these investments while producing margin expansion and delivering the high return that we want to drive.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
and i just can't help but add on because it's a topic that we're real passionate about. so it is -- patrick, i think you know, well, from following us over a long time that it's a key part of our growth model and that we do reinvest when we get the opportunity. and i'm just pleased to be sitting here talking this morning, talking about increased guidance, increased margin, increased investment in our products and our associates. and when i look at the investments we're making in digital, in ltx, in wealth, in multiple areas in governance, including increased investments in data and analytics, and now with itiviti, we have -- we've never had so many paths that are not just the next 18 months but well beyond that.
and so it really gives the confidence to be talking about the upper end of our 3-year objectives but also really what happens after that. and that's why we feel really so good this morning.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
alright. very helpful. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from puneet jain of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
puneet jain -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my question. how do you reconcile strong internal trade volume growth in capital markets with flattish revenue? even if you adjust for $6 million in license sales, it looks like volume growth was much higher than revenue growth.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
yes. so when you think -- thanks for the question, puneet. when you think about our gto business, we show that chart that breaks it up between capital markets and wealth management. and the first thing i'd say is, as we were coming into q2, remember, we're coming in q3 off of record trading volume comps, 26% combined equity and fixed income and 28% for equity. and that was primarily -- you saw that benefit come through in the capital markets business, and we said that would be a tough comp. as we came into this quarter, so in the capital markets business, you had sort of a harder comp on trading volume and the license revenue impact that brought it to flattish revenue.
the trading volumes that you saw, the continued growth, i mentioned, the fifth consecutive quarter of growth was primarily retail trading, and you saw the 7% growth in the wealth management business is the item that was benefiting from that. so you have this tale of two cities in our gto business right now with capital markets coming over higher comps, facing the lower license revenue that i'll remind you was a grow over an issue, an uptick in q3 '20 revenues, but wealth management seeing the benefit of the trade volumes that we saw this quarter.
puneet jain -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got you. and while it might be a little early, but do you expect any changes in regulatory focus under the new administration and the chairman of sec?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. puneet, it's tim. yes. first of all, let me just restate what i said before, which is we always work to support the sec's mission to inform and protect investors, and we've done that for a long time, and we expect to continue to do that. i think when we hear about the focus of the next sec, certainly, one of the things at the top of the list that we hear about in the market is around esg and related disclosures for esg, and how that may be an early focus. and we certainly stand ready to assist and to play the role that we play. i think it's too soon to tell that the business opportunity, but it certainly appears to be an area of focus.
i think the other questions are really around the initiatives from the previous administration and the extent to which they will continue or not. we -- there's a lot of conversation about end-to-end vote confirmation. we're hearing that could remain an area of focus, and that's certainly something that we've been a supporter of. we shared with the sec the result of a successful pilot that we've done with the top 100 issuers showing how that can work. on virtual shareholder meetings, there have been discussions about making the beneficial voting available to all providers, which we've done this season via apis, universal proxy as an area we support and we stand ready to help.
there's a working group that recommended changes there. there were discussions about obo-nobo and a working group that really isn't making a recommendation. and then there's a whole conversation around streamlined communications in funds, which we're focused with the previous sec is unclear. that's going to be a focus for the new leadership, but we support the recommendations, and we'll continue to work to strengthen the industry for the long term. so lots of different things that were on the agenda, that are a little less clear in terms of what their forward momentum is. certainly, the new things we hear about relate to esg.
puneet jain -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got you. thank you.

the next question comes from andrew bauch of wolfe research. please go ahead.
andrew bauch -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. this is andrew on behalf of darrin. thanks for taking my question. tim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're expecting 25% stock record growth in the fourth quarter. could you unpack this a little bit? i mean obviously, that's an impressive acceleration considering-- growth you're at today. and if i'm not mistaken, i believe the comps get harder in that regard. thanks.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. andrew, it's a great question, and it's definitely an interesting time. and we're -- just more broadly, we're seeing this, as i talked about in my prepared remarks, just as part of a long-term trend of the democratization of investing. and what we're looking at as we look into the fourth quarter is -- and we do have a fair bit of visibility at this stage into what's going to happen in the fourth quarter because there's a lag between when the records come together and when they go out. so we have testing, but we have good visibility. what i'd say is just -- what we're seeing is very, very broad-based growth.
we're seeing it across all different types of issuers. we're seeing it across all different types of broker-dealers, although stronger in online broker-dealers. we're seeing it across industries and we're seeing it across both managed accounts and other accounts, and if not, just focused on meme stock. so like a lot of the things that you've been reading in other places in the press, this rise in equity holdings and rise in participation in the market is very significant. we're also seeing, to a less degree but good interim, record growth, which is driven by stronger inflows and healthy markets. so we're seeing very strong q4.
we often get asked about when the market changes or if the market changes, what would be the impact of that? and we have -- we've done a lot of work going back over the last 25 years of history and events like '99 and '09 and even last spring. and what that would really tell us is that growth flattens, could be slightly negative, but that equity investors tend to stay invested and it is -- sort of reaches a new plateau. so we do think that these levels of holdership are sustainable. we're not modeling the same level of growth in the future, clearly. but we see a return to sort of more sort of normalized growth in the future.

this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to tim gokey for any closing remarks.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the broadridge third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to edings thibault, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
w. edings thibault -- investor relations
thank you, andrea. good morning, everybody, and welcome to broadridge's third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the investor relations section of broadridge.com. joining me on the call today are tim gokey, our chief executive officer; and our chief financial officer, edmund reese. before i turn the call over to tim, a few standard reminders. we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding broadridge that involve risks. a summary of these risks can be found on the second and third page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on form 10-k.
we will also be referring to several non-gaap measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of broadridge's underlying operating results. an explanation of these non-gaap measures and reconciliations to the comparable gaap measures can be found on the earnings release and presentation.
let me now turn the call over to tim gokey. tim?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
thanks, edings, and good morning. i'll begin with an overview of our key messages and an update on our third quarter results, including our performance against our strategic objectives. edmund will review our financial results, and then we'll take your questions. it's an exciting time to be at broadridge, and we have a lot to cover, so let's get started. i'm pleased to share that broadridge delivered strong third quarter results. recurring revenues and adjusted operating income both rose 8%. our results in both ics and gto are being propelled by long-term trends, including increasing digitization, mutualization and the democratization of investing.
these trends are driving strong new business growth, record growth in the number of shareholders and higher trading volumes. we're also executing well against our strategic growth plan across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management. i'll highlight some of those initiatives in a few minutes. a combination of those strong results and continued execution against our growth plans is giving us the confidence to continue to invest in our business. we've continued to fund attractive investments in our products, platforms and people, including the pending acquisition of itiviti. we're also substantially increasing our guidance for fiscal year 2021 on both the top and bottom line.
we now expect recurring revenue growth of 8% to 10% and adjusted eps growth of 11% to 13%. while the new guidance reflects the impact of itiviti, the bulk of this raise is organic, as edmund will discuss. the net result of all these points, our strong third quarter results, our continued internal and m&a investment and our outlook for fiscal 2021 is that broadridge is executing well and is on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives, including 8% to 12% adjusted eps growth. we remain focused on delivering long-term growth driven by secular trends and consistent investment across our governance wealth and capital markets businesses and, in turn, generate consistent, sustainable top quartile shareholder returns.
broadridge's ability to generate those attractive returns is driven by executing on our clear long-term growth plan. so let me update you on some highlights of our recent progress on slide five. i'll start with ics. recurring revenues rose 11% to $586 million driven by revenue from new sales and very strong equity record growth. the biggest driver of ics' strong growth was revenue from new sales, and i'm pleased to see the impact of recent investments on our results. let me share two examples of our focus on product investment and strong execution are translating directly into increased revenue growth. the first is the shareholder rights directive ii.
over the past two years, we've created a shareholder communications hub, linking millions of investors across the eu and with hundreds of wealth managers, winning almost 300 new clients along the way. now as we enter proxy season, we're starting to see those efforts translate into new revenues helping to drive 80-plus percent growth in our international proxy business. virtual shareholder meetings continue to be a great example of product investment translating into new revenues. over the past year, we've upgraded our vsm capabilities to include the latest in virtual meeting capabilities, including state-of-the-art video and audio technology, improved q&a functionality, one-click shareholder authentication and seamless proxy voting.
those upgrades have helped retain our existing clients and have driven additional growth. we are now on pace to serve almost 1,900 virtual shareholder meetings this proxy season, up from 1,400 last spring. the second factor driving ics was very strong equity record growth, which was 20% for the quarter. it's clear, the move to reducing trading commissions has triggered a significant expansion in the number of market participants, which contributed to the increase in equity record growth. that strong growth has been broad-based across our broker clients but has been most pronounced at the online brokers. it has also been broad-based across issuers with 20% growth across both widely held stocks and those with more medium-sized shareholder bases.
we did see large increases at a handful of names, including so-called meme stocks like gamestop. but those increases only contributed one point of the overall growth. commission-free trading is the latest step in a long-term trend. it includes the rise of etfs, lower trading costs across all participants and changes in investor interfaces that helps propel high single-digit equity and fund record growth over the past decade. broadridge has invested to scale its capabilities to meet that rise in demand, increase the digitization of critical regulatory communications and ensure that both new and existing investors get the information they need to understand the risks and participate in the governance of their investments.
looking forward, we expect strong record growth to extend into the fourth quarter with our testing indicating 25% stock record growth for q4. to close off on governance. let me touch briefly on regulatory. i want to congratulate commissioner gensler on his confirmation as sec chairman. as we have with every chair and administration of both parties over the past 40 years, we look forward to assisting by investing in the next generation of technology, to help the sec achieve its mandate to better inform and protect investors, all while reducing cost for registers and creating a fair return for our shareholders. let's turn now to our capital markets franchise.
capital markets' recurring revenues slipped by 1% as steady international growth was offset as expected by lower license revenues. we anticipate this period of flattish revenue to continue through the fourth quarter before picking up again in fiscal '22 as we onboard our very healthy backlog. on the strategic front, our planned acquisition of activity represent a significant enhancement of our ability to drive value to our clients. for those who may have missed our call a few weeks ago, let me remind you why we think this transaction is such an exciting step forward for our global capital markets franchise.
as a leading provider of order management and trade execution technology and connectivity solutions for financial institutions, itiviti gives broadridge a compelling opportunity to extend our capital market service offering. the combination of itiviti's front-office trading solutions, with broadridge's leading post-trade back-office capabilities, will allow us to serve our client's entire trade life cycle from order to settlement. with increasing high frequency and algorithm trading, it's increasingly important to serve clients across traditional boundaries.
this combination will bring critical data from the back to the front office to improve trading decisions, and it will enable our clients to simplify and improve their front-to-back technology stack and operating model. the combination also strengthens our joint capabilities across equities, exchange-traded derivatives and fixed income, and it substantially extends our global reach, creating significant cross-selling opportunities and enhancing our relationships with blue chip clients. the acquisition virtually doubles our business in apac and further expands our reach in europe. that expanded footprint and scale positions us to take advantage of growing mutualization trends in both emea and asia.
itiviti adds more than $6 billion to broadridge's total addressable market and will drive stronger growth, margins and earnings, as edmund will discuss in his remarks. early feedback from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive, giving us added confidence that our front-to-back thesis and our near-term medium growth outlook are sound. also of note in our capital markets franchise is the continued development of our ltx fixed income trading platform. ltx recently completed the first-ever multi-buyer digital block trading. enabling a single seller to simultaneously access the aggregated liquidity for multiple buyers is a milestone for the fixed income market, and i hope one of the many steps toward creating a more liquid corporate bond market.
to date, 10 dealers and over 40 asset managers have joined the ltx platform. and an additional 14 institutions are signed in the onboarding process, including one of the world's largest fixed income managers. let's turn next to our wealth and investment management business, where revenues grew by 7%, driven by new client additions and higher equity trading volumes. a key part of our growth strategy is to expand our sales of component solutions. so it's terrific to see new client onboardings across a full range of our wealth and investment management products.
we also continue to make progress on building our industry-leading wealth management platform, which will help clients with the digital transformation of their wealth business. we're already live with our average daily balance billing solution and industry milestone. we're currently in active testing of our phone office workstation with select advisors, setting the stage for a period of extensive testing of the broader platform before going live. our sales and marketing efforts with several new clients to this platform are advancing well.
clients see that using the broadridge wealth platform to drive digitization by seamlessly connecting the back office functions we already provide, with additional select front and middle office capabilities, will drive a stronger top and bottom line by bringing new capabilities to advisors and clients while digitizing financial advisor, branch and back office interactions. another important part of our wealth strategy is developing a robust partner network to ensure that we can integrate cutting-edge capabilities from innovative partners. recent partnerships include fligoo for predictive analytics and anchor bank for securities-based lending; and, a wealth management fintech accelerator.
these partnerships and others represent ongoing steps in building a network that will enable our clients to rapidly adopt new technologies. before i turn the call over to edmund, i want to step back for a moment and reflect at how far we've come over the past year. when i spoke to you at the close of our fiscal third quarter a year ago, the economic outlook was deeply uncertain and from the new york area and much of the world was locked down. my remarks at that time were focused on the steps we were taking to keep our associates safe and meet the needs of our clients in an unprecedented time.
today, after 12 long months, there remains significant challenges and thinking, in particular, of our more than 3,000 associates in india and of their families and friends. but the global outlook is unquestionably brighter, with increasing economic growth marching, hand-in-hand with rising vaccination rates. the pandemic has also accelerated many long-term trends, including digitization, mutualization and next-generation resiliency. and the lower cost and friction for investing is bringing in millions of new investors. these changes are clearly having a significant impact across wealth management, governance and capital markets.
they're causing financial services leaders to rapidly adopt next-generation technologies. and broadridge is building the suite of capabilities that will help them navigate and win this period of change. we do so from a position of strength. we started the fiscal year last july expecting 2% to 6% recurring revenue growth and 4% to 10% adjusted eps growth. our focus then was on driving enough expense savings to assure that we could continue to fund critical growth investments. fast forward nine months, and we are poised to deliver 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth, driven by a combination of strong new sales and healthy financial markets.
after achieving our expense targets, we're now investing heavily in new product capabilities, enhancing our global post-trade platform and building next-generation capabilities across digital communications, wealth management and fixed income trading, among other investments. we're also adding talent and investing in our people to make broadridge the best place for the most talented associates in our industry. last but not least, we're on the brink of closing our $2.5 billion acquisition of itiviti, expanding our capital markets franchise and further strengthening our global footprint. and yet even after those investments and the near-term dilution from itiviti, we're positioned to deliver 11% to 13% adjusted eps growth.
broadridge is at its front foot and leaning into the opportunities we see ahead. it has been a remarkable year. looking further ahead, we're on track to achieve the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives, driving strong recurring revenue and double-digit adjusted eps growth. we see long-term trends continuing to drive demand for our services. and our investments are creating new avenues for growth long beyond our current 2-year objectives. the future of broadridge is brighter than ever. in my 10 years at broadridge, i've never been as confident about our long-term outlook as i am on this call today. before i turn it over, i want to thank our associates. we've asked a lot of our team over the past 12 months, and they're delivering. they stayed focused on clients, and through them are helping to build better financial lives for millions.
let me now turn the call over to edmund for a more detailed financial review. edmund?
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
thanks, tim, and good morning, everyone. as you can see from the q3 financial summary on slide seven, broadridge delivered another strong quarter. recurring revenue grew 8% to $900 million. adjusted operating income also grew 8% to $284 million. margins declined 60 basis points to 20.4% as we successfully made the investments that we discussed last quarter in our technology platforms, in our products, our people. our operating income was partially offset by a higher tax rate in q3 '21 as we grew over discrete tax benefits in q3 '20. so our adjusted eps grew to $1.76 in the quarter, up 5% over q3 '20. now let's turn the slide and get into the details of the quarter, starting with recurring revenue growth.
as i said, recurring revenue grew 8% in the quarter, powered by 7% organic growth, and comfortably within our historic mid- to high single-digit growth performance. demonstrating the strength of our sustainable recurring revenue growth model. as a result of that strong organic growth and an increase in our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're raising our guidance for recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% for the full year, up from our prior guidance of growth at the higher end of 3% to 6%. now let's look at this quarter's recurring revenue growth by business on slide nine. i'll start with our ics segment, where revenues grew by 11% to $586 million.
regulatory revenues rose 20% to $290 million driven by the 20% equity record growth, higher mutual fund and etf communications volumes and net new sales, including from our shareholder rights directive ii solution that tim highlighted earlier. we expect strong regulatory revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter with, our current testing indicating 25% equity record growth. our issuer business also contributed to our overall growth rate, thanks to continued growth in vsms and increased issuer communications.
after a strong 12 months, we now have significant penetration of our vsm solution across the s&p 500, and we expect issuer revenue growth to ease going forward as we start to lap the increase of vsm activity that began in q4 '20. fund solutions revenue was flat as double-digit growth in data and analytics was offset by lower interest income from custodied accounts in our funds processing business. customer communications revenues were also flat with double-digit growth in our high-margin digital products, offset by lower print volumes due in part to the pandemic-depressed activity levels.
we expect growth in both our data-driven solutions and customer communications business to pick up in the fourth quarter as these headwinds ease. turning to gto. wealth and investment management revenues rose 7%, driven by the onboarding of new component sales and higher retail trading. capital markets revenues fell 1% of strong growth from international sales, was offset by $6 million in lower license revenues, which declined as expected. as we said last quarter, this flat revenue growth will continue in the q4 '21 before picking up in fiscal year '22. let's turn to page 10, where we show more detail on volume trends.
broadridge's recurring revenue growth benefits from underlying volume growth trends, including stock record growth. over the past decade, record growth across equity, mutual funds and etf has grown 6% to 8%. recently, equity record growth has accelerated to 11% in q4 '20 and continued to increase through the year to 20% in q3 '21, surpassing the estimates from our january testing. as i said, we expect these growth trends to continue and reach 25% in q4 '21. mutual fund and etf record growth picked up as well to 7%, more in line with our historical growth rates.
we are modeling a return to more moderate mid-single-digit growth across both equity, mutual fund etf records for fiscal year '22, with stronger growth in the seasonally smaller first half and more moderate growth in the second half. touching briefly on trade volumes, which you'll see on the bottom of this slide. this is the fifth consecutive quarter of aggregate double-digit volume growth. this growth reflects the increase in volatility in retail investor engagement over the past year, which continued to be quite strong well into the third quarter. more recently, trading volatility subsided during the second half of march, and we expect tougher trading volume comps in q4. let's move to slide 11 for a closer look at the drivers of our recurring revenue.
organic growth at a very healthy 7% continues to be the largest component of our recurring revenue growth, and new sales remains the biggest driver with strong growth contribution from both ics and gto. we also continued our long track record of revenue retention above 97%. internal growth contributed another three points as growth in ics regulatory volumes more than offset the decline in gto license revenue. and finally, acquisitions. we've now fully lapped all of our fiscal year 2020 acquisitions. looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect itiviti to add three points to fourth quarter recurring revenue growth. now we'll turn to slide 12 to briefly touch on our total revenue performance.
total revenue growth this quarter was stronger than usual, reaching 11%, with distribution revenue contributing three points due to the increased mailings that correspond with the high record growth and the increased event-driven activity this quarter. moving forward, we continue to expect the low to no-margin distribution revenue to decline over time as we focus on increasing higher-margin digital revenue across our governance business. event-driven communications remain an integral part of our client offering. event-driven revenues have climbed over the past four quarters to be more in line with our historical norms of about $50 million a quarter and reached $74 million in the third quarter, well above last year's unusually low $39 million.
broadridge benefited from an increase in mutual fund proxy activity as well as a rebound in proxy contest volumes and capital markets transactions. we expect fiscal '21 event-driven revenue to be more in line with the average that we've seen over the past seven years. for modeling purposes, we're assuming $50 million to $60 million of event-driven revenues in the fourth quarter. turning to slide 13. adjusted operating income grew by 8%. our adjusted operating income margin declined by 60 basis points, reflecting the continued investments that we're making in our technology platforms and product capabilities that we highlighted on our last quarterly call.
these investments, which support our long-term growth, have a short-term impact on margin expansion, but we remain on track to deliver approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion for the full year, right in line with our fiscal year '21 guidance and 3-year growth objectives. this formula, forgoing near-term margin expansion and consistently investing in our technology platforms and products to drive long-term sustainable recurring revenue growth, will continue to be an important part of how we manage our business. as a chief financial officer focused on long-term growth, it's encouraging to see us making these types of investments across all of our product lines, giving us momentum toward future growth.
before i turn to capital allocation, let's turn to slide 14 and spend a moment on another key operating metric, closed sales, which, as i mentioned earlier, is the most consistent driver of our long-term recurring revenue growth. our $124 million closed sales year-to-date are in line with our performance over the same period last year. we continue to see strong demand for our ics solutions, including regulatory and issuer communications and data solutions. we remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of $190 million to $235 million for closed sales, which implies a fourth quarter range of $66 million to $111 million.
historically, the closed sales performance in the last quarter of the year has been impacted by the timing of larger deals. a handful of larger signings could propel us to the top end of our guidance range, and conversely, delays could put us at the lower end. and i'll also note that we continue to feel good about our recurring revenue backlog, which was 12% of our fiscal '20 recurring revenues as of q4 '20 and gives us great visibility into our top line growth. moving to capital allocation on the following slide. we generated $136 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $54 million over the first nine months of fiscal year '20 driven by higher earnings and strong working capital management.
during the first nine months of the fiscal year, we invested $205 million in building out our industry platforms and another $71 million in capex and software spending. our m&a investment through the first nine months of the year was 0, but that will change with our announced $2.5 billion acquisition of itiviti, which i'll touch on in a moment. even after completing the itiviti acquisition, broadridge will remain committed to a balanced capital allocation policy, which prioritizes internal investment, growing our dividend, m&a and returning excess capital to shareholders.
importantly, we are also committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which means we'll prioritize debt paydown over share repurchases and expect to limit ourselves to smaller tuck-in m&a opportunities over the next several quarters. given our strong free cash flow, we believe that we can comfortably achieve our new 2.5 times leverage target by the end of fiscal year '23. turning to capital returns on the right-hand side of the slide, our dividend has grown and remains in line with our historical 45% payout ratio. on slide 16, we are on track to close the itiviti acquisition in the coming weeks.
so let me take a moment to give you some additional clarity about the expected impact that itiviti will have on our financial performance. i'll start with fiscal year '21. we expect itiviti to add $25 billion to $30 billion or one point to our full year recurring revenue growth, which equates to three points to our fourth quarter growth. and the acquisition is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted eps growth. in fiscal year '22, we expect itiviti to add approximately $250 million or about eight points to our recurring revenue growth. and we expect the acquisition to be accretive by approximately two to three points or roughly $0.10 to $0.15 to adjusted eps growth.
please note that itiviti's results in both fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '22 will be negatively impacted by the accounting treatment of acquired revenue, which will reduce revenue recognition by approximately $30 million in total with 2/3 of that impact in fiscal '22. this revenue haircut is incorporated in the numbers that i just shared with you. finally, i want to reiterate the commentary that i gave you when we announced the deal, about the impact on our 3-year growth objectives. we expect itiviti to add 2.5 to three points to our 3-year recurring revenue growth cagr and, after interest, more than two points to our 3-year adjusted eps cagr. now turning to guidance on slide 17.
we are raising our outlook for fiscal '21 recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 3% to 6%, and that includes one point of growth from itiviti. we are raising our guidance for total revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 1% to 4%. we continue to expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand to approximately 18%, up from 17.5% in fiscal year '20 as we balance near-term returns with continued investments to sustain long-term growth. we expect adjusted eps growth of 11% to 13%, up from the higher end of 6% to 10%, and that includes a 1-point drag from itiviti. finally, as i noted earlier, we continue to expect closed sales in the range of $190 million to $235 million.
and before we begin to take your questions, let me share some final thoughts. the broadridge financial model is working. we are on track to deliver strong 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth. that growth is fueling our ability to both invest and expand margins. at the same time, our strong free cash flow business model enables us to pursue balanced capital allocation, commit to a rising dividend, fund investments in our platform and products and step up and make a significant m&a investment to grow our capital markets franchise.
and finally, thanks to our consistent investment in our capabilities, we are on track to deliver another year of $190 million plus of new closed sales, which, combined with our strong backlog, positions us well for additional recurring revenue growth. the end result is that we're on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives of 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted eps growth. it's a great example of how we manage our business to drive sustainable revenue growth, steady and consistent adjusted eps growth and historically top quartile tsr.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from david togut with evercore isi.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. good morning. for your fiscal '22 guidance, could you discuss some of the potential tailwinds that take you to the high end of the 12% to 15% recurring revenue and 11% to 15% eps growth range and the headwinds that might land you toward the lower end of that range?
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
yeah. hi, david. thanks for joining this morning. look, first i'd start off by saying that the fiscal '22 growth is strong across both our organic business and the contribution from acquisitions, and i think positions us well for the three-year -- against the three-year objectives that we have positions us well to be toward the high end of that. we still need to execute on sales, converting our sales to revenue and the itiviti integration. we feel very confident with that and i think that will actually position us well.
i think as we think about some of the areas, you heard us say earlier that we're positioning volume growth to return to mid-single digit levels. that obviously can be a tailwind, but we feel confident based on our view into the first -- the next two quarters that that is -- that we can expect that level of event driven revenues i think is also something that on a quarterly level has been quite cyclical. we've returned to more historical levels this year in fiscal year '21 and i think that growth was broad-based. so we feel confident about that as we go into -- as we go into fiscal year '22 as well.
and i'll tell you that we feel good about the margin expansion that helps us get to a strong point from an adjusted eps growth standpoint as well, that's driven both by itiviti and the continued scale of efficiency gains that we get in our core business as well. so as you think about the variability in our model going into fiscal year '22, i think we will continue to focus on executing on sales, converting that sales to revenue, driving the itiviti integration, i think event driven revenue is more in line with what we've historically seen and volumes are back to mid-single-digit levels. and i think that's what drives the range for us.
and tim might want to add a point just about the strategy there.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yeah just to add into i guess how edmund started which is, as we are looking at the strong year we're having this year, i -- actually i was initially thinking will we be able to keep that same momentum going. and as we saw the trends coming together in the second half of the year and putting together our plans for next year, it just became apparent, the strong underlying momentum in the business and -- so we're definitely benefiting from itiviti, but you peel itiviti out and the organic growth that's underneath there is right in line with our with our three-year metrics. so, we feel really good about the guide for this year and about what it says for our momentum as an overall company.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
appreciate that. and just as a follow-up, tim, in your prepared remarks you underscored your focus on near, intermediate and long-term growth. that's a bit of a shift for broad, which historically is focused more on intermediate and longer-term growth. is it just the strength in the underlying metrics that you referenced or are there other factors that give you more conviction in the near-term growth prospects of the company?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yeah, thanks david. i didn't mean for that to sound like the shift that it might have sounded to you. i just think that with the volume increases that we've been seeing that -- making sure that we have everything in place in all of our facilities with all of our technology to support those you know really the organic numbers that we're seeing. that was really what we're referring to. and so really as -- and you're very familiar, we take a long-term view. we invest for the future. that's what we're doing and -- but there are some near term tailwinds and we need to make sure we provide great service to our clients.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. thanks so much.

our next question comes from michael young with truist securities.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking the question. wanted to maybe just start kind of high level, things last year were ahead of schedule. i think this year we'll be -- the outlook is that it will be the same. so, maybe just big picture, tim, what areas have you been able to invest in maybe more on a strategic basis to accelerate some of those medium-term growth dynamics that might sustain this kind of growth rate beyond some of maybe the macro support?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yeah, absolutely, michael, and we were really pleased to be able to invest in our products and platforms this year and in our people and we have real money in our budget for next year from these investments we made this year. so we see these things coming to life. i think you can almost tick down the strategies and you see investments really almost across the board because you look at the regulatory business we're investing to really build that out in europe between the shareholder rights directive and our european fund communications business.
you look at our funds business and the investments that we're making in our data and intelligence business, that continues to be a very strong growth for us and we see a lot of future runway there. we've been investing clearly in our vsm capability, but also in our disclosure business for corporate issuers, and of course, our ongoing investments in digital communications.
so, right across the whole governance suite you see investments in each of those areas. and when you look at the product roadmaps, we're able to accelerate some of those product roadmaps and you look at the number of innovations that we have delivered over the past 18 months in things like core proxy and core distribution regulatory communications, it is markedly up.
and then on the capital markets and wealth management side, really there, the investments in things like digital ledger repo, things like ltx, applying ai to fixed income trading are making a big difference and so we're just excited across the whole portfolio and you are -- that's why you're seeing strength in the underlying growth into each of those areas.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
and tim, i'll just add, we're able to make those investments that you're talking about and continue to expand margins in line with our three-year objectives and do that while continuing to deliver this double-digit eps growth here. so it really is the right time for us to invest for growth now.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
great. and my follow-up is on sales. the sales backlog obviously being up 13% from where it was at the end of last year, but closed sales were pretty similar year-over-year. so, is there an expectation that more of that is going to come to fruition in 2022? and then, would that be sort of pull forward or additional closings as a result of may be reopening from the pandemic versus -- and so we should expect maybe a slight reduction in the size of the sales backlog or do you think that the things are in place to continue to drive growth or stability of that sales backlog into 2023?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yeah, michael. thank you. look we are really excited also about our sales guide for next year at $240 million to $280 million. i think that really shows how, as we continue to add on new solutions like itiviti, we see an increased market for us that brought to us a lot of additional sales resources. and so we do see higher sales for us. in terms of how that will affect the backlog, it is, when you look at the mix of sales, we had a lot of sales this year that were not strategic sales, they were a lot -- and we had a lot of singles this year.
and as we bring on the itiviti sales, those also tend to be a little bit smaller, a little bit faster to implement. so i think sometimes when you see the mix between some of the very large strategic projects and the singles and doubles, the singles and doubles come online usually sort of within a year versus within two years. and so, i think we may see some fluctuations in backlog, i'm not sure how to imply what that means for the momentum of our business. it does flex a little bit based on the product mix.
what i will say though is seeing that backlog grow again this year, having $400 million of revenue that we know is going to come live over the next two years, it gives us a lot of confidence in the revenue from sales portion of our growth formula and that is the largest part of our growth formula. and so it is -- as ceo and when you think about the environment that we have out there and all the concerns we have to know that that revenue is already been sold, the projects are in flight, is happening, it gives a lot of confidence in that and it makes me sleep just a little bit better at night.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
fair enough. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from darrin peller with wolfe research.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks guys. i want to start off with the record in the position growth we're seeing being so dramatic and really the infrastructure you guys have said you expanded and built out to handle the capacity from a physical standpoint. but then, if you can also just remind us the difference in the margin profile of digital versus physical what that's going to be for you guys going forward both from a revenue yield and a margin standpoint?
and then just as a quick follow-up on that same segment, when you think about your assumptions for next year, i think you said, back to the mid to high single-digit record growth, you just alluded that i think in david's question also being probably conservative. it does seem conservative when you look at the growth rates now. so if you could just expand on that, is that really what you think is the likely outcome or is that really just conservatism in your outlook. thanks.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yeah. darrin, it's tim. let me just -- just a little bit of step back and then i'm going to let edmund add on to things. i do think it was a really remarkable year from the standpoint of position growth and we do see it though as part of the long-term trends that are driving position growth across equities and funds and etfs. and those as you know, are the democratization investing, managed accounts, more nascently, direct indexing.
and so we see -- we see those trends continuing in the future. the record growth this year, very broad based, which really reinforces our view that it's part of these -- of these long-term trends. in terms of the investments to support it, it was really around ensuring the resiliency of the network and being able to produce sort of all output from multiple places and that -- it just is not a major thing, but it was just something that we thought we needed to do.
so, not really almost with an even interim model, but just to show the ongoing investments that we always make in our business. i'm going to let edmund comment on the margin profile, and sort of our confidence about next year and sort of why we believe that and then i'll add on at the end.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
great. so let me first start with the confidence in the next year, darrin. we look at -- we have some insight into stock record positions for companies that we expect to proxy in the next one to two quarters and when you look at that testing, which i would say, covers the large majority of distributions and maybe there is some movement between the time that we test and the time that we actually mail, but the information has been quite reliable. and when you look at that, you see what we said in my prepared remarks, low-teen growth through the first half of the year, and mind you that's coming off of 16% growth in q1 last year and 24% growth in q2 of last year. so low teen growth coming off of that.
and that's helpful, that gives us great insight but i'll remind you that the first half is our seasonally light period of the year. if you look at '21 or look at '20, the first half of the year was 13% of overall volumes. so what really is more important is the back half of the year and we are assuming and modeling more normal levels in the second half of the year that we return to historical levels and you combine that and that's what gets us to the mid-to-high single-digit growth level.
so you're not -- i don't expect to see 33% and 26% coming out of the fourth and full-year numbers that we see. but we have good insight into the next six months or so and i think what we have modeled positions us well, first of all, for fiscal year '22 and gives us confidence in that.
as we think about the margins of the business. clearly, overall in our business, what we're able to drive bringing on new customers without a new business, without incremental cost to scale in our business, the efficiency gains that we're able to get, i think helps us be able to expand margins, but specifically on print and digital.
it was good to see our customer communications business not just driving the earnings growth that we've seen there. but now to see digital, which is a higher margin business because there is very low to no margin in the distribution revenue starting to grow in recurring revenue, which is a higher business for us. so you might see lower revenue in that business but it comes at a higher margin and we feel good about the progress we're making on that.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
and then...
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
alright, that was very helpful. go ahead, tim. sorry.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yeah darrin, just i think the other piece that sometimes people think about is, when we've seen this, this very large growth, is that -- does that tend to fluctuate? do it go up? and then what happens when the markets really goes through different place? and if you -- if you really trace back to sort of previous times of high growth, we have -- what we haven't seen is big fall backs after that.
what we've seen is position sort of consolidating at the new level, and then beginning to grow again at more modest pace, and that's -- if you look back to all the market cycles really over the past 20 years or even almost 30 years, that's the pattern that we've seen.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's helpful, thanks. my very -- just quick follow-up on gto for a minute. how should we think about the growth of the components of this segment, when -- just looking at the current quarter, i mean i know -- like i guess organically, excluding the deal, it looked a little lower than we expected, but the -- i know the underlying trends are obviously strong and the bookings are strong. so if you could just touch on that for a minute. [speech overlap].
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
darrin, i don't spend a whole lot of time looking at the quarterly numbers for the gto components. if you were to look back at q3, you would have seen the opposite of what you saw in the fourth quarter in terms of more of the growth being in wealth management and less being and capital markets. we're coming off a year of 7% growth in gto. that i think is the important thing. now 3 points of that is driven by the itiviti acquisition and 4 points of that was organic.
so i think as we think about the growth going forward, trading volumes coming off at still 12% in fiscal year '21 over tough comps and maybe less volatility going into fiscal '21, i think we expect to get back in our organic core business back into the 5% to 7% growth range across both of those business is really driven by net new sales, as tim talked about earlier in both our capital markets business and wealth management business.
in q4, we were growing over some license revenues -- higher license revenues in fiscal year '20 and lower trading volumes. but i think you'll start to see driven by new sales, us getting back to the 5% to 7% three-year objectives that we have across both of our businesses.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. all right, well, thanks guys.
operator
our next question comes from chris donat with piper sandler.
christopher donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. tim, wanted to ask one more question on position -- equity position growth, and i appreciate the color you've given us on the different types of stocks involved and the trends like democratization and managed accounts and direct indexing. can you give us some color on the -- from the perspective of the brokerage firms that are involved, any generalities you can make there? i imagine with democratization we're seeing more sort of the start-up kind of brokers or is there a lot of activity coming out of the traditional wirehouses also?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yeah. i'm glad you asked. we are definitely seeing higher growth rates in the online brokers. however, we are seeing very strong growth across all segments and brokerage firms and the traditional firms are also seeing double-digit growth. and given your exercise, the absolute amount of positions is actually bigger in that channel, while the percentage might be bigger in some of the online ones.
so it is really -- it is one of the things also that we think is very interesting. we did a really landmark study of investing patterns and investor's base looking at across $7 trillion of assets that we concluded last year and it really did show how the millennials are here and their proportion of positions and growth is really interesting. but nevertheless we are seeing really strong growth across all segments of brokerage firms.
christopher donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then just one sort of on recent news in customer concentration. with the news that robinhood is acquiring say technologies, which has some sort of, what i think are kind of interesting solutions on the investor communication side. i don't -- i'll ask if you'll quantify robinhood as the size of a customer, but i imagine it fits in the context of what i see in your 10-k that like your -- i think, yeah, your largest customer was 6% of revenues in the last couple of fiscal years and your five largest were about 20% of revenues. is there any way to help think about robinhood and if they're customer, any risk to that business?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
absolutely. so, first of all, i would say just -- we view this acquisition as a positive because it really validates the importance of retail shareholder engagement. robinhood has been a big leader in that area and their investment in it is, i think will be a wake up to other firms, and i'll come back to that in a second. so just to be very clear, robinhood is a broadridge client, but it's not a proxy client currently. so we really don't see any impact on our -- direct impact on our business.
what we do see though, chris, is we've been really leading in innovation in proxy communications, creating apis, i talked about that product's rollout and the acceleration of road map, creating opportunities for our clients to leverage that event as an opportunity to really engage their retail clients and for corporations to engage their retail clients.
and so we think this is going to create sort of heightened interest in a wide range of communications and engagement topics, all of which we really welcome. i think the thing that we bring is, we have this unique role at the center of the network linking tens of millions of investors, corporate issuers, broker-dealers and that network can be really powerful to help corporations engage with their retail shareholders.
christopher donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. thanks very much, tim.

our next question then comes from patrick o'shaughnessy with raymond james.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning. if i recall correctly, the ubs go live was supposed to be originally completed during this summer, and i think you said today 18 to 24 months is what you're looking at right now. what's driving that extended implementation timeline versus your prior expectations? and how does that impact opportunities in your ability to win other wealth mandates?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
sure. thank you, patrick. and just as a step back, it is -- the wealth management industry and the trends that we're seeing there is -- just continuing to undergo significant change with everything that's going on in asset management and fee compression and then how that plays into wealth management. and so wealth managers are continuing to evolve their strategies and their technologies to compete.
and so, this digital transformation that we're working on, it is one of the most exciting initiatives and the ubs partnership is part of that -- is part of their transformation and our mandate with them has grown since our initial agreement. so we are live with components. we're working with them in terms of how we optimize that to align with the pace of their broader digital transformation.
in terms of how that affects the -- our ability to bring on others, i think we are excited to announce rbc and i think that really validates the needs that others see for a similar [phonetic] digital transformation. we have a lot of ongoing discussion with other clients and the guidance that we've provided fully incorporates all of that. it doesn't have any revenues from ubs in this next fiscal year, but we're still continuing to grow and ubs knows we'll come on top of that.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. appreciate that. and then speaking of rbc, can you speak to the implementation timeline for that install?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. and one thing on rbc that i think is an important context, first of all, rbc, just backing up, it's a very important client for us. it's a client across our businesses in u.s., in canada, in wealth management, in capital markets. so it's very broad and deep relationship. and really pleased to be able to help them with the transformation they're engaged in their u.s. wealth management business.
we expect that to go live over the next 18 to 36 months and since it's already a back office client, the scope of incremental services and scope of incremental investment is more limited than ubs, but it's very exciting for us. and patrick, it's particularly interesting because their business, it's a unique. they have a high net worth business, it's what they've done with city national; they have sort of traditional regional broker dealer and then their correspondent as well. and so it really hits on a lot of different segments of the industry that make it pretty interesting.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from peter heckmann with d.a. davidson.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson & company -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i missed a little bit of the call, but i believe you expect a roughly 6% decline in event-driven proxy in 2022 to about $220 million. would you expect about a normal level of event driven proxy revenue in the fiscal first quarter, may be something in the $45 million range?
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
hey, peter. thanks for joining this morning. so you're right, we said, if you look at the last seven years, the average has been about $220 million. if you look at that on a quarterly basis, you're going to see movement and cyclicality each quarter. i think on the slide we showed that the average has been roughly $50 million to $55 million per quarter. and i think that is a good range to think about your modeling on a quarterly basis.
i think the key thing about event driven revenue though is that as i looked at fiscal year '21, the growth, as i said in my prepared remarks, was broad based. so, it wasn't any one particular contest that drove the growth. it was across the mutual fund proxy, it was across contest, it was across capital markets. and i don't think we're looking for any big one item in fiscal year '22 either. so i think that gives us confidence that we'll return back to the type of average full year numbers that you've seen over the last seven years.
operator
our next question comes from puneet jain with j.p. morgan.
puneet jain -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my question. so my question is on margins, can you break down expected margin expansion into ics and gto? it seems like there are going to be lot of segment-specific dynamics like record growth in ics and itiviti in gto segment this year?
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
yeah. so maybe i'll start, puneet, with one or two comments and tim might want to jump in on just the business itself. but you look across our businesses, particularly for recurring revenue in our ics business across regulatory that is volume-driven, across our data driven-solutions, across our issuer businesses; those businesses really are scale businesses, so as we bring on new volume, as we bring on new customers they do come on at attractive and accretive margins in those business and the same thing as we think about our saas platforms in capital markets and wealth management as well. so, the margins are quite high there.
as we think about the customer communications business, you see a margin dynamic as you move from the lower no margin print business to higher margin digital business as well. but overall, i think as we think about what we expect to do in fiscal '22 and going forward, you can expect collectively we'll balance the growth in each of those businesses with our investments and being able to deliver margin expansion overall in that 50 basis points type range. but tim, you might want to add.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
i just want -- obviously i was going to add on almost that last point, which is just, we really do think about our margin delivery on an overall basis and it really can be affected particularly in any quarter, but even in any year across businesses by where investments fall in that year and -- but both these business have very attractive margin characteristics -- margin profiles and also underlying characteristics as they grow, it creates additional margin and that is something that really does allow us to continually reinvest in the business to provide more value to our clients, to provide great careers for associates and long-term growth for our shareholders.
operator
this concludes our question-and-answer session, i'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
well, i'd like to thank everyone this morning for participating in our call. before we conclude, i do want to highlight two directors who recently joined our board. as you know, our board plays an important role in the oversight of broadridge and i'm pleased that we have continued to add valuable insight and diverse experiences. melvin flowers brings along invaluable experience in both technology and finance; and annette nazareth brings deep experience at the confluence of corporate governance, financial markets and regulatory matters.
broadridge's ability to continue to attract this kind of talent to our board, i think, highlights the important role that we play in governance, in financial markets. we're really excited to have melvin and annette joining the board. we just had a meeting earlier this week and was able to be with them at least virtually. so, welcome annette and melvin.
and with that final note, i just want to thank all of you for your interest in broadridge. we look forward to updating you again in a few months. and just are really excited about what we talked about this morning and about the opportunity going forward to really continue to make a difference for our industry and for millions of investors. thank you.

operator
good morning and welcome to the broadridge fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to edings thibault, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
w. edings thibault -- vice president and head of investor relations
thank you, eily. good morning and welcome to broadridge's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings call. our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the investor relations section of broadridge.com. joining me on the call this morning are tim gokey, our ceo and our cfo, edmund reese.
before i turn the call over to tim, a few standard reminders. we will be making forward-looking statements regarding broadridge on today's call that involve risks. a summary of these risks, can be found on the second page of the slides, and a more complete description on our annual report on form 10-k. we will also be referring to several non-gaap measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of broadridge's underlying operating results. an explanation of these non-gaap measures and reconciliations to their comparable gaap measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation.
let me now turn the call over to tim gokey, tim?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
thank you, edings. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. i'll begin with our key messages and then provide an overview of our performance against our strategic objectives across governance, capital markets and wealth & investment management, then i'll close with some thoughts about our future before edmund reviews the financials. let's get started.
i have four headlines. first, broadridge delivered a strong fiscal year '21. recurring revenues rose 10%; adjusted eps rose 13% and our sales teams delivered a 10th consecutive year of record sales. our results demonstrate how well positioned broadridge is to take advantage of increasing investor participation and the growing need to digitize and neutralize financial services.
second, we're executing against the strategic growth plan we laid out at our investor day in december. we're building the next generation of governance products, growing the scope of our capital markets business across the trade lifecycle, and building our wealth management franchise.
third, we remain committed to balanced capital allocation. in fiscal '21, we increased our level of investment on our internal platforms, completed the largest acquisition in our history, and returned nearly $250 million in capital to shareholders. yesterday, our board approved an 11% increase in our annual dividend per share. broadridge has now increased its annual dividend every year since becoming a public company with double-digit increases in eight of the last nine years.
fourth and last, we expect another strong year in fiscal '22. our guidance calls for 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth, further margin expansion, 11% to 15% adjusted eps growth, and another year of record sales. a combination of strong fiscal year '21 results and our guidance for fiscal '22 leaves broadridge extremely well positioned to achieve the higher end of our three-year growth objectives.
as we close out the first year of our current three-year cycle, i want to give you an update on our progress against our strategic growth plans for each of our three franchise businesses, starting with governance or ics, on slide 4.
ics recurring revenue rose 11% in fiscal '21 to $2.1 billion, driven by both new sales and internal growth. strength of our governance franchise comes from its position at the heart of a network linking broker dealers, corporate issuers, asset managers, and tens of millions of individual and institutional investors. our fiscal '21 results highlight how our strategy of innovating at the core while providing incremental value to all network participants drives incremental and sustainable growth for broadridge.
i'll start with our core regulatory business. the big story here is the very strong position growth we're seeing across equities. equity stock record growth, which is our measure of the number of positions held by shareholders grew 26% in fiscal '21 including 33% in the seasonally strongest fourth quarter. we continues to be struck by the broad based nature of this growth. we're seeing growth across large and small issuers not simply a handful of mega-cap tech or main stocks.
looking at industry sectors; tech and consumer cyclical stocks are leading the growth with 42% and 37% growth respectively. we're also seeing double-digit growth across virtually other sector including 33% growth in healthcare needs and 20% plus in basic materials and industrials. this broad based participation is a key reason why we believe that fiscal year '21's strong growth is an extension of the long-term trend that's been driving higher equity and fund position growth over the past decade and why we're forecasting continued growth in fiscal '22.
at broadridge, we're able to meet this increased demand because we've invested in scaling our capacity. after the initial covid surge last spring, we invested in new distribution capacity to build incremental flexibility across our network, enabling us to seamlessly ensure that holders of more than 500 million positions got the communications they needed to participate in corporate governance.
we've also invested in new digital capabilities, including qr codes that make voting on your mobile device easier than ever. our governance franchise is also increasingly global with gains from our shareholder rights directive ii solution and the continued expansion of our european fund communications business. we're also expanding the suite of data driven solutions we provide for our fund clients, driven in part by another year of double-digit growth across our data and intelligence products.
we're growing our relationships with corporate issuers. we conducted almost 2,400 virtual shareholder meetings in fiscal '21, up from 1,500 a year ago. we become the clear choice for america's leading companies with more than 75% of s&p 100 companies using broadridge to host their annual meetings in 2021.
in turn, increased demand for our vsm capabilities has enabled us to deepen our client relationships, leading to strong growth in our suite of other annual meeting services and disclosure solutions products.
finally in customer communications, our strategy is focused on using our print capability as a door opener for growing our digital business. so, it was encouraging to see strong double-digit growth in digital revenues which offset lower print revenues and helped to drive higher earnings. all in all, it is a very strong year for our governance franchise.
now let's turn to capital markets on slide 5. in capital markets we're driving trading innovation across the front office, enabling our clients to simplify and improve their global post-trade technology, providing strong enterprise and data component solutions, and building new network enabled solutions using ai, digital ledger and other innovative technologies.
capital markets revenue grew 8% to $701 million, driven by new client additions and the acquisition of itiviti, which has given us a new capability to drive innovation across the trade lifecycle. while the itiviti integration is only just beginning, i'm excited by the progress we've made. itiviti recently closed its largest-ever sale and we're on track to leverage broadridge's relationships to drive more meaningful sales in the quarters ahead.
client feedback has continue to be positive and the sales pipeline, especially in emea and apac, is strong. a key driver of our revenue growth is our continued success at bringing clients under our global platforms, enabling them to simplify their global technology. we're also enhancing those platform capabilities. a great example is the exchange-traded derivatives platform onto which were on-boarding r.j. o'brien.
i'm also tremendously excited by the continued progress in developing new capabilities based on next-gen ai and dlt technology. our ltx fixed income platform continues to progress well. we have more than 70 buy and sell side users in the platform and we're adding more every week. and the average initiated trade is north of $3.5 million, indicating demand for increased liquidity in fixed income markets.
we also recently launched our digital ledger repo platform and are averaging $35 billion worth of transactions daily, a number which will grow as more clients, including ubs, come onto the platform. while both of these products are small today, each is bringing an innovative and differentiated solution to a multi-billion dollar market.
now let's turn to wealth & investment management franchise on slide 6. in wealth, we're extending our services around our core back office capabilities, growing our suite of component solutions and building a modular platform that will link our individual capabilities across a modern technology architecture.
the biggest driver behind our 6% growth in wealth & investment management revenues was revenue from new sales. during the year, we added new clients to both our core back office platform and saw strong demand for our digital solution suite. our work with ubs on the digital transformation of the wealth management industry remains one of our most exciting initiatives. broadridge -- the broadridge wealth management platform is an important part of ubs' own multi-year transformation plan for its north american wealth business.
as we line around ubs' goals around sequencing, we're already rolled out select components and we expect to rollout the additional platform components over the next 18 to 24 months. based on the terms of our contract, we'll begin recognizing revenue when we complete the delivery of the full suite.
meanwhile, this platform continues to draw attention from other clients. we are pleased to announce last month that rbc wealth management will become our second client on the broadridge wealth platform. rbc is pursuing its own digital transformation journey and our platform will accelerate their ability to enhance the client experience, optimize advisor productivity and digitizes back office. we're excited to be a key technology partner in that journey.
beyond our work in the wealth platform, we continue to make progress in expanding our digital solutions with the advisorstream tuck-in acquisition and by extending our partner network. lastly, i was pleased to see strong growth in our investment management technology revenues, which grew by 12%; strong revenue from sales of existing solutions; continued platform development; and new product additions. we're making solid progress on our wealth & investment management growth strategy.
as i wrap up my strategy update, i want to highlight the common denominator behind our execution across governance, capital markets and wealth & investment management. broadridge is investing in driving near, medium and long-term growth. we've investing to process higher position counts, more virtual shareholder meetings and handle surges in trading volumes which are critical in fiscal '21 and will remain important in fiscal '22 and '23.
at the same time, we're investing in initiatives that will carry our growth momentum forward, including our data intelligence products, the emergence of a european governance hub, itiviti, and our wealth platform. and finally, i see tangible signs of products that have the potential to extend our growth runway well into the next decade like digital communications, digital ledger repo and fixed income ai. these are solutions that our clients value, as evidenced by the traction that we're gaining in the market for each of them.
this mix of near, medium and long-term growth businesses across the company are exciting. what does that mean for broadridge? let's turn to slide 7. as we enter fiscal '22, i've never been more optimistic about broadridge's long-term growth prospects. when i look across our company, i see a leadership team that's stronger than ever, focused on how we engage our associates, better serve our clients and create value for our shareholders. that team is executing against our growth plans across governance, capital markets and wealth & investment management.
we're finding ways to help our clients accelerate digitization, drive mutualization benefits and enable the increasing democratization of investing. even more tangibly, we are on track to deliver another strong year. our strong backlog gives us visibility into new revenue over the next 12 to 24 months and we see continued position growth as new investors enter the market and current investors continue to diversify their portfolios.
in short, we see another year ahead of low teens revenue and adjusted eps growth. the net result of strong fiscal year '21 results, continued execution against our growth strategy and an outlook for continued growth in '22 means that broadridge is well positioned to deliver at the higher end of our three-year growth objectives including, 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted eps growth.
before i conclude, i want to thank all broadridge associates for their work over the past year. little in the past 12 months has been easy, but they have found the way to adapt to the new virtual environment. they stayed focused on our clients and they are helping drive the transformation of the financial services industry that is enabling better financial lives for millions. thank you.
let me now turn it over to edmund.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
thank you, tim, and good morning, everyone. as you can see from the financial summary on slide 8, broadridge delivered strong fiscal '21 results, capped off by a strong fourth quarter and demonstrating significant progress toward our three-year objectives. fiscal '21 recurring revenues increased 10% to $3.3 billion, driven by strong growth in both ics and gto.
that strong growth enabled us to make the near, medium and long-term investments in our technology platforms and our digital products while driving 60 basis points of aoi margin expansion for the year. higher revenues and higher margins drove 13% adjusted eps growth to $5.66.
in the fourth quarter, revenues rose 15% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, driven by growth in ics and the acquisition of itiviti. adjusted operating income rose 4% as we continued our ongoing investments and adjusted eps grew 2% to $2.19. our results came in at the high end of our latest full-year guidance range and above our three-year recurring revenue and adjusted eps growth objectives.
and as tim has highlighted, our sales team closed the year on a high note and pushed us modestly above our closed sales guidance range. so let's get into the details of those results starting with recurring revenue on slide 9. the momentum in our business driven by the trends in increased investor participation in digital solutions continued into the fourth quarter and helped broadridge post another year of 10% recurring revenue growth.
our recurring revenue growth was powered by 8% organic growth, which came in well above our 5% to 7% three-year growth objectives. the combination of organic growth coupled with 2 points of growth from our acquisition of fundslibrary and fi360 in fiscal year '20, and then itiviti in may, pushed our fiscal year '21 recurring revenue growth above our 7% to 9% objective as well. so a strong start to our three-year recurring revenue growth objectives.
now let's look at this quarter's recurring revenue growth by business beginning with ics on slide 10. ics revenues grew by 17% to $719 million in the fourth quarter. all of that growth, organic. the biggest driver of that growth was in our regulatory business, which grew 27% to $381 million. fourth quarter stock record growth was 33% and mutual fund record growth was 11%, both key drivers of growth in regulatory.
we also benefited from strong growth in international and our investment in the shareholder rights directive ii solution is paying back and contributing to recurring revenue growth. for the full year, regulatory revenues rose 20%.
issuer revenue also contributed to growth, rising 20% in the fourth quarter to $106 million and 21% growth for the full year. as tim noted, our continued success in providing virtual shareholder meeting services has helped drive revenue growth of our other annual meeting services and document disclosure products.
fund solutions lapped the drag from lower interest income and recurring revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter. full year revenues rose 5% driven by the fiscal year '20 acquisitions mentioned earlier and revenue from net new business.
customer communication revenues was down 1% in the quarter as declines in the low margin print revenue offset digital growth. for the full year, customer communications revenue growth was slightly positive, but more importantly, higher margin digital revenues within customer communications grew by 15%.
turning to gto on slide 11; gto recurring revenues rose 10% to $346 million in the quarter driven by 18% growth in our capital markets business and 1% growth in wealth & investment management. across both capital markets and wealth, solid revenue growth from new business was offset by $7 million of lower license revenue, which declined as expected, and modestly lower trading volume. our acquisition of itiviti closed in mid-may and contributed $29 million to revenue growth in the capital markets franchise.
for the full year, gto revenues rose 7% to $1.3 billion, driven by 4 points of organic growth and 3 points from acquisitions. organic growth was driven by new sales and internal growth was essentially flat as the benefit of higher full year trading volumes was offset by lower license revenue, which declined relative to an unusually high fiscal year '20 level. we expect modest growth in license revenues in fiscal year '22.
so broadridge's recurring revenue growth benefited from strong volume growth both in ics and our gto business segments. so let's turn to slide 12 for a closer look at volume trends. equity stock record growth rose to a record 26% in fiscal '21, well above the 6% to 8% trend in the past decade. fourth quarter proxy volumes which accounted for 55% of full year distributions benefited from 33% stock record growth. we also saw strength in mutual fund and etf regulatory communications, driven by strong fund inflows as we lap last spring's covid driven withdrawals.
looking ahead to fiscal '22, we continue to model stock record growth growing at a healthy low-teens pace, though the seasonally light first half before reverting to more trend line mid-to-high single digit growth in the much more meaningful seasonal second half. we're also expecting mid-to-high single-digit fund record growth.
turning to trading volumes in the bottom of the slide, fourth quarter volumes slipped 1% driven by a combination of tough year-over-year comps and lower overall market volatility. fourth quarter volumes also declined on a sequential basis as elevated levels in q3, '21 driven by market volatility subsided. trading volumes rose 12% for the full year. as we look ahead to fiscal '22, we expect trading volumes to be essentially flat for the year with modestly higher volumes in the first half of the year offset by lower volumes in the third quarter.
shifting to a view of growth drivers of recurring revenue on slide 13, organic growth rose to 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by a combination of new sales and the seasonal impact of higher proxy volumes. new sales contributed 6 points to growth with balanced contribution from both ics and gto. internal growth of 7 points was primarily driven by proxy volumes as is typically the case in our fourth quarter. acquisitions contributed 3 points, almost all of that came from itiviti with only a modest contribution from our mid-june acquisition of advisorstream.
client losses subtracted 2 points of growth in both the fourth quarter and for the full year, marking another year of 98% client revenue retention rates. high retention rates reflect the value of the services we offer, our commitment to client services and/or a tangible outcome of our service profit chain culture. i'll round out our revenue drivers discussion on slide 14 with a look at total revenue.
total revenues rose a healthy 12% in the fourth quarter. recurring revenue was the primary contributor to that growth and broadridge received a further boost from an uptick in event driven revenues as well as 2 points of growth from higher distribution revenue. while higher distribution revenues contributed to our overall growth, their share of the full-year total revenues declined to 31%, down from 32% in fiscal year '20 and 38% five years ago. we expect that the share of low to no margin distribution revenues will continue to decline as we remain focused on growing recurring revenues, fx was a modest positive, reflecting the weakening of the u.s. dollar.
looking down the slide, event driven revenues rose $5 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter to $73 million, driven by higher proxy contest activity. for the full year, event driven revenues rebounded from a cyclical low to a healthy $237 million. that rebound was broad based across the full range of event driven activities. higher mutual fund communications contributed roughly a quarter of the growth as did higher revenues from proxy contest as well as higher revenues from capital markets activity and other communications.
going forward, we're not forecasting that the major fund complex goes to proxy. and while there might be some quarterly cyclicality, we expect full year fiscal '22 event driven revenues to be approximately $220 million, in line with the fiscal year '15 through fiscal year '21 long-term average.
turning to slide 15, for the full year, adjusted operating income margin expanded 60 basis points to 18.1%, slightly ahead of our latest guidance and multi-year objectives. aoi margin declined 180 basis points to 22.8% in the fourth quarter on the back of our planned fiscal year '21 investment spend. we have a strong track record and high confidence in our ability to make growth accretive investments while still expanding margins and delivering near term profit growth in line with our adjusted eps three-year growth objective.
before i move to our uses of cash and our balance sheet, let me touch on closed sales in our revenue backlog on slide 16. thanks to a strong fourth quarter, broadridge recorded another year of strong closed sales with balanced growth across both our icf and gto segments. i was especially pleased to see strong growth in our smaller sales, those under $2 million in annualized values which rose 11%. these small sales represent the bread and butter of our long-term growth and reflect the broad demand we are seeing across our businesses.
our sales performance pushed our overall backlog, a measure of past sales that have not yet been recognized into revenue, to $400 million, up from $355 million last year and steady at 12% of recurring revenue. as a cfo, i appreciate the added visibility into our future revenues that our backlog gives me.
moving to capital allocation on the next slide. broadridge remains committed to a capital allocation policy that balances internal investment, m&a and capital return to shareholders. in fiscal year '21, we generated $557 million of free cash flow, up $58 million from fiscal year '20. given the size of the market opportunity we see in front of us, we're continuing to prioritize making investments in our business, both internal and external. the biggest use of our cash was the $2.6 billion acquisition of itiviti, which was completed in the fourth quarter.
late in the fourth quarter, we also completed the additional tuck-in acquisition of advisorstream. since the close of the quarter, we've made two more very small tuck-in acquisitions for the assets of jordan & jordan and the remaining share of alpha omega. we invested almost $300 million in continued platform build-outs, as we add to our capabilities across wealth management and capital markets, and another $100 million in capex and software development.
total capital returned to shareholders was $248 million. the 11% increase in our annual dividend approved by our board was in line with our long-term 45% pay-out ratio policy and will increase capital returns in fiscal year '22. as a result of the itiviti acquisition, our total debt rose to $3.9 billion, up from $1.8 billion at the end of fiscal year '20. our leverage ratio at year end was 3.5 times. we remain focused on an investment grade credit rating and target a 2.5 times leverage ratio by the end of fiscal '23.
i'll close my prepared remarks this morning with some comments on our fiscal year '22 guidance, which is on slide 18. our guidance for fiscal '22 calls for low teen recurring revenue growth, healthy margin expansion and another year of strong adjusted eps growth. let's take each point in turn starting with recurring revenues. we expect to grow recurring revenues by 12% to 15% in fiscal year '22. that includes organic revenue growth of 5% to 7% with growth balanced across both ics and gto. we're not modeling in any revenue contribution from the ubs contract in fiscal '22.
as tim noted, we expect to complete the rollout of the full wealth management platform suite over the next 18 to 24 months and will begin to recognize revenues at that time. we expect the contribution from acquisitions to add an additional 7 points to 8 points, with most of that coming from itiviti.
our more recent acquisitions of advisorstream, j&j and alpha omega should contribute less than $10 million combined to fiscal '22 recurring revenues. as always, we do not forecast the impact of any future tuck-in acquisitions that we might make.
in addition to recurring revenue, we expect mid-single digit distribution revenue growth, driven in part by a postal rate increase. event driven revenues should, as i indicated earlier, be more in line with our fiscal '15 to '21 seven-year average level of approximately $220 million.
for modeling purposes, between recurring revenue, distribution and event-driven revenues, total revenue growth should be in the range of 9% to 13%. we are expecting our adjusted operating income margin of approximately 19%, up from 18.1% in fiscal year '21, driven by a combination of incremental scale, digital, and efficiency gains as well as the addition of the higher margin itiviti business.
finally, we expect adjusted eps growth to be in the range of 11% to 15%. included in our eps outlook is an expectation that our tax rate will essentially be flat at approximately 21% and that we'll see a modest increase in our overall share count. on our last guidance point, we expect another year of record closed sales. our outlook calls for closed sales in the range of $240 million to $280 million. this guidance emphasize the strength of our financial model and our ability to drive sustainable revenue growth, expand our margins while maintaining a balanced capital allocation policy in delivering steady and consistent adjusted eps growth.
that concludes my remarks on our fiscal year '22 guidance. but before i turn the call over for your questions. i have one more final administrative note. beginning with our first quarter results, we'll be updating how we report foreign exchange. as you know, we've historically used a fixed exchange rate for our segment revenues and for recurring revenue. the difference between the fixed internal rate and the actual rate are recorded in our fx revenue line, which was negative $132 million in fiscal year '21.
with the continued growth in our international revenues, especially after the acquisition of itiviti, the time is right to adjust our reporting. going forward, we will be changing our internal rate to one that is much closer to the actual rate. this will have the impact of shrinking our reported negative fx revenue to a much smaller number and lowering our segment and recurring revenue numbers by the same amount. these changes will have no significant impact on our reported recurring revenue growth rate nor will they have any impact on our reported total revenue or profitability metrics.
we intend to publish our historical revenue results at a restated rate ahead of our first quarter earnings so that you have a chance to adjust your models. again, this is a change that will begin with our first quarter earnings report. it will lower our reported recurring revenue with little if any change to growth rates and will have no impact on total revenue, operating profit or adjusted eps.
with that administrative note out of the way, let's open up the call for your questions, operator?

[operator instructions] and the first question will come from darrin peller with wolfe research.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi guys, thanks. look, i just want to start off on the gto side of the business for a minute. when i look at the underlying growth trends, excluding the acquisitions, it was more -- i think it was up 1% or flattish and i know there were tough comps on volume. can you just remind us of how it's going with, first, on the wealth management side and the initiatives with ubs, timing and investments necessary that we should expect there. and then more importantly, just the overall opportunity on the pipeline on the capital market side as well. it's been an area that i know we focused on that should have a long runway. so i'm curious to hear where the bookings are coming in that category and what kind of play out that could be in the next couple of years?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
darrin, it's tim. let me give a little bit of background on where we are on the wealth management side. and then i'll let edmund take you through sort of the broader pipeline and momentum in capital markets. so on the wealth management side, and i think as we said before, this transformation of wealth management is one of our most exciting opportunities. and we continue to drive with ubs on bringing that forward. we've had -- just last week, we spent time with the senior leadership and really feeling good about how the partnership is working. and making really strong progress in building the new capabilities and the pretty complex work of decommissioning was a very tenured platform. so we are, as you know, already live with some applications.
we're working with ubs to sequencing, bringing forward the additional solutions that will align with the pace of their broader digital transformation. we expect to implement that in phases over the next 18 to 24 months. as you remember, the way we do our revenue recognition, we'll begin recognizing revenue when that becomes fully live. and so in the meantime, the net of that goes on to our balance sheet, which you'll see in coming quarters. so we feel good about it. we think, though, on the revenue side for that particular initiative, it will be a ways out before you begin to see it. but we're continuing to hear validation with other clients, good progress with rbc and good discussions with others. so that's sort of the update on the wealth management piece. obviously, in the mean we continue to make strong progress with our component sales on the wealth management side. for a review of where we are in capital markets and sort of the overall momentum, let me just let edmund comment on that.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
thanks for that, tim, and thanks for the question, darrin. i want to start with just saying that gto continues to be a very healthy franchise with over $30 billion when you look at capital markets and wealth management inside of that $30 billion in market opportunity. we're coming off a strong year in gto overall at 7% in fiscal year '21 and now, 21% this year. a lot of that is itiviti, of course, but the organic business in gto was 2% growth. and it's just -- as tim just talked about the wealth management business, if you think about that component, it grew at 6% for the quarter. that's well within our 5% to 7% organic growth objectives, and that's coming from continued onboarding of new sales and the retail trading that we've seen.
the organic business in the capital markets in the first quarter was slightly negative. i mentioned in my remarks that lower license revenue and lower consulting revenue was the driver of that. but to your question, we have a strong pipeline to onboard. and we've mentioned earlier our recurring revenue backlog of $385 million, a large chunk of that is gto. so we look to have license revenue growth in the back half of the year, flat trading growth and continue to onboard that pipeline. that puts us in a position where we expect the capital markets business to also be within our five- to seven-year growth objectives. and i think that's a great place to be with both of these franchises well within our organic overall growth ranges.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. that's helpful, guys. a very quick follow-up. when -- obviously, there's been strong position growth on the mutual funding on the equity side, in particular. but without that, i mean, even without that, i guess, you can say you've had decent growth in the other parts of the non-regulatory side and customer communications, it's good to see it being consistently positive now. so what are your -- what are you thinking on that piece of business, the customer communications, which i know had been a little bit of a challenge seems to have deflected?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes, darrin, thanks for noticing that and bringing it up. it is -- obviously, we had that long story of a large client that was going away, that took longer to go away and sort of created that negative headwind for what seemed like many, many quarters. so glad to have that behind us. i think the important story within customer communications is a little bit sort of deeper than this top line number, even though it's nice to see that top line number positive. it's really around the transition within that business, from paper to digital. and as you know, we've grown the digital business inside that at double digits the past two years. that continues to have nice momentum. and so -- it's nice to see the overall number be positive. it is pretty muted at 2%. it will continue to be muted. but inside that, we really like the transition we see going on.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
and i'll only add to tim's comment that, that higher growth in digital comes on at higher margins as well. the customer communications has been a strong earnings driver. and now you're starting to see that translate into the top line as we grow digital with higher margin business as well.
operator
the next question will come from michael young with truist securities.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, thank you for taking my questions. wanted to just start with an update on itiviti. i know you guys have been working pretty hard at that and pretty hands on there. so just kind of an update in revenue generation, sales opportunity and anything on kind of the cost or operating margin side?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
sure. thank you, michael. and really excited to talk about itiviti. it's a strong complement to what we're doing. and as a reminder, its strength in front office and europe and asia really complements our strength in back office and north america. and we're really pursuing three growth opportunities there. there's an ongoing opportunity sort of -- itiviti, without broadridge, has just continued to take share in front office and its existing markets and solutions really based on the fact that the competitors are disinvesting. medium term, we think there's a really nice opportunity to bring itiviti to broadridge clients in north america, leverage our strength in fixed income and other new asset classes.
and then longer term, we talked about linking front and back office and really bringing data from the back office into the front and also making that whole front to back office more seamless and cost effective. so we are seeing really nice signs of affirmation of that. we're seeing really nice demand from clients to have discussions about that and continued interest in having alternatives to existing providers. so really high client engagement around that long-term thesis. and in the meantime, the integration is going well. the combined capital markets team, as i said in my remarks, is making great strides in the integration. we're seeing results that are on track with the expectations, including good contributions of sales revenue and bottom line. i'll just ask if edmund wants to...
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
yes, the only thing i'll add just to your question specifically, michael, is on the margin side. this is largely a recurring revenue business. we said that it would come in at over 30% margins and be accretive. you heard in my prepared remarks that it was accretive to our overall aoi margin for the quarter. and to tim's point about front to back, this is something that we are investing in. so the investments that we're deploying in this quarter and for the rest of the year will go toward activity as we look to build capabilities front to back as well. so we feel good about the progress. the last thing i'd say about it is i've mentioned to you that acquisitions would be 7% to 8% of contribution, and you saw strong reaffirmation of that in the first quarter with nine points of our recurring revenue growth from acquisitions. and for our three-year objectives, i think since we brought itiviti on, we'll see two points of contribution to adjusted eps growth. so i feel good about itiviti and the acquisitions that we've been making over the past two quarters.
michael young -- truist securities -- analyst
and maybe kind of following up on that, just on sales opportunities internationally. i know this was potentially a nice foothold with some clients on a more international basis. it seems like that may take a little more time as you focus on integration. but when could we see some benefits from kind of the itiviti customer book? and then also maybe just a more broad kind of update on what's going on internationally as maybe the pandemic subsides. are you seeing any more success there?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
sure, michael. first of all, i think we do expect a strong contribution from sales from itiviti this year. as you know, we went from where we landed last year, around $240 million, a little bit above that to guiding to $240 million to $280 million this year. and a significant chunk of that is some itiviti, and we're seeing nice traction on that. so i do think you'll see contribution to closed sales from itiviti. if we think specifically about international. we've had pretty significant growth in international sales. it's lumpy year-to-year, but if you look at the trend, it's been very consistently up with some really nice opportunities that we're in the midst of pursuing now. so i expect that to be an increasingly strong contributor to our overall sales mix over time.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
and michael, i'll just add one comment to tim's, which is we said that we expect strong revenue synergies from itiviti as a result of those sales. we said $20 million by 2025, and we're still pursuing that.
operator
the next question will come from chris donat with piper sandler.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
good morning everyone. it's chris donat. i wanted to ask one more question on the -- on the wealth business and just to make sure i understand sort of the quarter-on-quarter dynamics there because it's the second consecutive year we've seen a decline in revenue in your september quarter. and i'm just wondering because, edmund, you made the comment about the license revenue and consulting. is there a seasonal factor there? or is it just coincidence that we've seen sort of this happen two years running on a quarter-on-quarter thing?
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
chris, you might -- sorry to interrupt. thanks for the question. you may be referencing the capital markets business and not the wealth management business. what we saw was some big clients signed in fiscal year '20 that drove up license revenue. we were growing over that in fiscal year '21. we sort of have a plan that suggests flat in the first quarter and growing license revenue in the back half of the year that will help the capital markets reach sort of our normal 5% to 7% organic levels. wealth management, that's continued to grow. i think the four-year cagr on wealth management is about 8%. it grew 6% in this quarter, and that's a contribution of both continuing to bring on closed sales and having strong retail trading growth help drive that business as well. so that's the dynamic between the two businesses. i'll see if there's anything else tim would want to add.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. the only thing i'd add, chris, is, first of all, there's no -- there's nothing seasonal about it. so to the extent there's something you're seeing, it is sort of idiosyncratic. and there were, a couple of years ago on the license side, some significant business in canada, and that created a little bit of lumpiness and up and then down the next year. but we don't see anything of that magnitude going forward, and i wouldn't think that there's really any systematic seasonality.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
that's right.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
yes. okay. yes. just it was on the -- i appreciate the comments on the capital market. just on the wealth side, and it's a small piece, but the quarter-on-quarter change, fourth quarter, $136 million in wealth revenue and then it slips to $131 million. i guess i was thinking of that business is highly recurring. but can you just remind us what the revenue drivers are? i thought it was something that -- whatever, not a big percentage change from the june quarter. but anyway, just trying to make sure i understand what's going on.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
in this quarter, chris, you're going to see about a 6% growth of that, about five points of it is on the organic component, one point is from new revenue from new acquisitions that we had still showing up in that business. and on the organic side, very much like the other components of our business, you see us being able to retain our clients at 98% of the recurring revenue that we have with them in new sales being the largest driver. and recently, the retail trading being the uptick that we've seen on wealth management, it really does boil down to those drivers.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
and chris, i would say we can come back on any sequential comparisons. but i think if you step back and look at what is our -- what we're seeing for the full year, we're seeing that nice sort of within our range organic growth for the full year. so i wouldn't take any information out of that sequential quarter number.
chris donat -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then just thinking about the cadence of earnings for the full year. i thought you had some comments, edmund, about some pieces, but just thinking about that, like the eps by quarter over the course of the year, should we expect it to be like it has in prior or at least since broadridge had a change in revenue recognition that kind of affected timing of fiscal third quarter and fourth quarter revenues?
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
i do. i like to point out the comments about the components of the businesses have some seasonality in it. but in my prepared remarks, i made a comment about the first half of the year being typically just under 30% of the full year adjusted eps. and i think fiscal year '22 is going to continue with that trend.
operator
the next question will come from david togut with evercore isi.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you. good morning. the 39% equity position growth is probably a record since broadridge spun out of adp in 2007. so my question is, what are you assuming for stock record growth for the critical spring proxy season?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes, dave, it's tim. i'm going to just make a couple of broad comments on this. and then edmund will a little bit of detail about what we're seeing in our testing right now because we do have a little bit of a forward view on that. and it is -- those certainly, as you correctly noted, are some eye-popping numbers. obviously, it's a small quarter, so it's hard to really draw anything from that one data point. i think the thing that i want to come back to, just at the broad level, is that this whole trend i talked about in my remarks, the democratization, it's a long-term trend that's made investing more accessible and cost-effective and those drivers have been consistent over time in the mid- to high single digits. it certainly is elevated now. we don't see that elevated level as something that continues over the long run. we do see return to that mid-single digits. it will still be elevated a bit this year. but we feel really good about those long-term drivers, including new things like direct indexing. so edmund, then maybe just give us a little bit more color on that.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
yes, i'll give some color on the -- what we think about moving forward. so as tim just said, david, mid-single-digit growth over the last 10 years in both equities and fund and etf positions, to the point that tim just made, that has elevated, i'd say, beginning with the fiscal '20 q4 time period and ended at 26% last year, up to the eye-popping numbers at 39% in q1 '22. our recent testing shows that q2 is normalizing a bit to be closer to 20%. now that's a nice uptick from the low teen growth that we saw in testing just a few months ago. i will mention that you should keep in mind that the first half is a much lighter component of the volumes. last year, i think we showed in the slide that last year, the first half was about 13%. over 80% of the volumes are in the back half of the year, the third and the fourth quarter, and our mid-october testing for that suggests high single-digit growth for the second half of the year. so i think we feel good about where that positions us for '22. and more importantly, the trends that tim mentioned earlier, like direct indexing, i think that gives us confidence that we should expect to see mid- to high-single digits for many years to come. and as is our history, we'll come back to you in february as we get closer to proxy season and do more testing with an update on where we stand.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes, the visibility at this stage, we are pulling the records of the companies that will be having meetings in the second half. and so the upper single digit is what we're seeing in october, but we'll redo that and that obviously continues to change as the year progresses.
david togut -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. just as a quick follow-up. on darrin's earlier question, a lot of incoming questions on ubs. so when you talk about 18- to 24-month time line to complete the contract fully, how much of that is driven by ubs and their own internal time lines, i.e., decommissioning of their platform versus your delivery on the platform itself?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
dave, i think that is very hard to disentangle. it's just very complex. and as we get into bringing components that are being built and then testing them and this is all being done agile. so in comparison to functionality, a lot of it is just because that -- remember, ubs, $1.7 trillion assets, ultra-high net worth, really the highest net worth clients of the large competitors out there. and so the complexity of what they're doing does lead to discovery of, oh, it also does this. and so it's an ongoing process. but i think we feel really good about some things we're going to be doing that will be out in the first half of next year and then additional releases over the coming quarters.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question will come from peter heckmann with d.a. davidson.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i think most of my questions have been answered, but just two quick follow-ups. one on the customer communication and customer reimbursables piece, noting the mix shift there where the decline in some of the print and postage is masking strong growth in digital. over the last few quarters, have we seen much impact from that regulatory change around 30e-3 and 498a? or do you expect that to occur over the next couple of quarters?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
i would say, and i'll let edmund add on, but we are seeing -- beginning to see a positive benefit from 30e-3. that is -- has been a modest benefit. the 498 piece, i'm less certain about. i think that is still in the -- i guess, the 498b is the piece that is not yet approved. the 498a, i think is -- we're not -- i'm not seeing that come out as a driver significantly one way or the other.
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
tim, you're exactly right. we have been seeing an uptick in recurring revenue from 30e-3. and i think we still have a couple more quarters in fiscal year '22 where we'll continue to see incremental benefit from that. the offset is in the distribution revenue, which is passed through and low to no margin. so overall, that's a benefit for us that we're picking up now and not much from the 498b.
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. and remember, pete, that -- or i know you know this, but for everyone listening, all that appears within the regulatory line. and there is an ongoing substitution from paper to digital within regulatory. and then when i was talking earlier, i was talking about within the brcc customer communications line, where that same thing is happening.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. got it. and then just a follow-up on the -- within wealth management, i mean, is it possible for the rbc deployment to go forward while you're still finishing up some of the ubs? or is some of that development that you're doing with ubs going to be required to then convert rbc?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
that is a great question, and we are deep in discussion with both clients on that very topic because some of these components are -- maybe ready. and it may be simpler in rbc where they're already on our back office to implement some of the components and get them going. but we really need to work that through with both clients at this stage. it has always been our plan that it would be after ubs, but it's -- i think the order of that is something that is -- continues to evolve.
operator
the next question will come from patrick o'shaughnessy with raymond james.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
hey good morning guys. i was wondering if you could size the potential revenue impact of that pass-through voting initiative from blackrock. and then as you kind of think about pass-through voting as a topic in general, is the ability to expand that to mutual funds and etfs and other products over time? or do you think it's kind of limited to a subset of blackrock's products?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
thanks, patrick. thanks for asking the question because i think this is a development that we are really excited about. it is -- and it just -- stepping back, it combines a lot of the things we've been talking about. it combines democratization, it combines esg, it combines innovation, it combines the power of the network and our infrastructure. so a lot of the things that we've been working on. this really brings them together and it's something that we have been working on for a while. so near term, as you pointed out, it's not a revenue driver and to the extent that it's on the institutional side, it's not really a revenue driver.
i think the interesting question is as others look at this, would it come to the retail and etf side. and in which case, it could become a revenue driver. i would think that would be a long term that kind of thing. so i'm not -- i wouldn't be thinking about anything at all near term. but as you think about the kinds of things that continue to support that high mid-single or high single-digit position growth, it could be a factor over time. i do think that topic around increasing importance of governance, that's a clear positive for broadridge, whether it's institutional or retail and the fact that blackrock, the world's largest global asset manager, is taking a step, i think, is really making people take a hard look at this.
patrick o'shaughnessy -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. and then on your closed sales, can you remind me about the underlying reasons for the seasonality in your closed sales? is that because your client budgets are, hey, we want to get this deal done before the end of june? or is it more on your end?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
yes. great question, patrick. it is -- most clients closed their budgets in december and they're trying to -- so if you look at a lot of companies, it would be -- they would have their big sales sort of at the end of the calendar year. so this, i do think is driven more by our fiscal year. it's not driven because we cut a lot of deals at the very end. it just is -- we have very good relationships with clients. and so many of these things are sort of already decided, but then they get caught in the contracting and there's a big pipeline of things. and because of the relationship we have with our clients, they know it's coming up and they tend to sort of bump us up to the top of the heap and create this big backlog in q4. so we are trying to get it a little more like we'd -- we'd like to have two big bumps, one in december, one in june, but we'll keep working on that.

this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to tim gokey for any closing remarks. please go ahead.

yes, i would like to just thank everyone for participating in all this morning for your interest in broadridge. we're off to a strong start for the fiscal year. we are continuing to execute on our growth strategies across governance, capital markets and wealth management. we're reaffirming our guidance for the year and our expectation to be at the upper end of our three-year objectives. and we look forward to updating you again in a few months.

good day, and welcome to the broadridge first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to edings thibault, head of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
w. edings thibault -- head of investor relations
thank you, chuck. good morning, everybody, and welcome to broadridge's first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the investor relations section of broadridge.com. joining me on the call this morning are tim gokey, our ceo; and our cfo, edmund reese. before i turn the call over to tim, a few standard reminders. we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding broadridge that involve risks. a summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on form 10-k. we will also be referring to several non-gaap measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of broadridge's underlying operating results. an explanation of these non-gaap measures and reconciliations to their comparable gaap measures can be found in the earnings release and in the presentation. let me now turn the call over to tim gokey. tim?
tim gokey -- chief executive officer, management
thanks, edings. good morning, and thank you for joining us. i'll begin with an overview of our key messages and some highlights from our strong first quarter. next, i'll provide an update on execution against our growth strategy across our three franchises. finally, i'll close with some thoughts on how broadridge is continuing to drive long-term sustainable growth. let's get started. our first quarter results marked a strong start to the fiscal year. recurring revenues rose 16% and adjusted eps rose 9%. second, our top line growth continues to be propelled by a combination of our own actions and strong underlying market trends. the biggest driver of our 7% organic growth across all three of our businesses was the onboarding of closed sales as we continue to convert our $385 million backlog into recurring revenue. we also benefited from the continued tailwind of very healthy position growth in governance, driven by ongoing trends.
third, we continue to execute on our long-term growth plans across our governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management franchises. i'll provide an update on our execution steps in a few moments. finally, our strong start to the year puts us in a very good position to reaffirm our full year guidance, including 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth and 11% to 15% adjusted eps growth. it also keeps us on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives. beyond those three-year objectives, we are focused on delivering sustainable long-term growth driven by ongoing industry trends and investments across our governance, capital markets and wealth franchises and in turn, generating consistent top quartile shareholder returns. generating those returns requires consistent execution. so let's turn to slide five for an update on our growth strategy, starting with governance. our governance business had a very strong first quarter. ics recurring revenues rose 11% to $410 million. as i noted earlier, the biggest driver of that growth was revenue from closed sales.
the other key driver continued to be position growth, which reached 39% for equity proxies in a small quarter, and 9% for funds and etfs. in equities, the growth continues to be broad-based across all market caps in multiple industries. in funds, much of the growth is being propelled by etfs. over the past decade, the number of both equity and funded etf shareholders has risen at a high single-digit rate, propelled by the ongoing democratization of investing. we're also extending our governance franchise to enable voting choice. many of you saw the announcement from blackrock a few weeks ago that they will implement pass-through voting for their institutional investors. climate change and esg more broadly are becoming increasingly important to investors, and they're demanding to have greater transparency and voice in the actions that companies they own are taking to address these issues. broadridge is playing a key role in helping blackrock implement this important change. we have been working with them over an extended period to leverage our infrastructure to enable pass-through voting.
it's a great example of how our expertise in managing preferences and voting and our 24/7 saas platform is helping our fund industry clients. given the increasing importance of esg, we're hearing from others in the industry, seeking to offer a similar service to their clients over time. moving to capital markets. we continue to make progress in growing our franchise with revenues rising 34% to $209 million driven primarily by the integration of itiviti, which is going well. our newly combined capital markets team has hit the ground running in finding complementary product opportunities that leverage our pre and post rate expertise and client reach. for example, we recently announced the integration of itiviti's nyfix solution with broadridge's buy-side portfolio order and investment management system. this will enable broadridge's clients to achieve greater automation in their post-trade workflows and is a tangible step toward integrating our solutions across the trade life cycle. outside of itiviti, we brought live another large u.s. bank with a global business to our gptm capital markets technology platform. the first phase of this onboarding, covering global fixed income, is a result of over two years of platform investment.
we expect to roll out additional phases, including the expansion of equities over the coming quarters. in wealth and investment management, revenues rose 6% to $131 million. we continue to make steady progress in developing our broadridge wealth management platform, while also delivering component solutions. for example, we were recently selected by a leading canadian pension plan to leverage our investment management private debt and loan solutions to help them manage their alternative asset portfolio. i want to wrap up by giving you my perspective on what our continued execution means for broadridge and our investors. so let's turn to slide six. our strong first quarter results reflect the underlying growth trends powering our business and the execution of the clear growth plan we laid out at our investor day 11 months ago. we're extending our governance capabilities to cover more investors, more geographies and more issuers.
we're building the data-driven solutions for the fund industry and the digital communications infrastructure that helps companies increase the effectiveness and lower the cost of their client communications. we're growing our capital markets franchise by adding new clients under our platforms and integrating the front office capabilities we acquired in itiviti. and we're building our wealth and new management franchise by adding more component solutions and creating a next-generation wealth management technology platform. the critical factor underlying all this execution has been and will continue to be investment in our technology and digital platforms. we're pursuing a $52 billion market opportunity that's continuing to evolve. the long-term trends driving that evolution, including the ongoing democratization of investing, which in turn is driving and being driven by greater digitization, were only accelerated by the pandemic. those same trends are powering our growth and creating an imperative for investment by our clients in the next-generation technology we provide. we're all hearing a lot these days about the ""democratization"" of investing.
but what we are seeing now is a continuation of a 50-year trend driven by the ongoing combination of new technology and reduced trading costs. these forces have led to continued innovation from discount brokerage to online trading, to 401s, etfs and managed accounts. more recently, modern user interface, 0 commission trading and the pandemic have accelerated this long-term trend. together, these forces have made investing consistently more cost-effective and more accessible for more people. for broadridge, this has supported high single-digit growth over the last decade in the number of positions we serve. going forward, more innovations, including direct indexing, will support continued growth. so we expect that same high single-digit growth for many years to come. it's worth noting that democratization is also playing a part in the increasing importance of esg, which further underlines the importance of what broadridge does. as new investors come to the market and new innovations drive increased diversification, it's critical that investors get to shareholder disclosures and other communications they need to make informed decisions. investors are also seeking to exercise their vote on how issuers and funds should approach esg issues. our 24/7 saas technology platform plays a critical role in powering that system of corporate governance.
and these trends are making governance, voting and disclosures an even more important part of the investment process. we have built that platform through continuous innovation and investment to link tens of thousands of corporate issuers and funds with hundreds of banks and broker-dealers and tens of millions of institute individual investors. our platform is constantly monitoring and validating positions across more than 100 million retail and 270,000 institutional accounts. every day, we collect, maintain and manage the investor preferences that are critical to driving digital distribution. doing so effectively and securely requires investment in continuous monitoring to provide the highest levels of data security. it also requires us to serve our bank and broker-dealer clients with co-branded communications, client service and integrated billing and collections that greatly simplify the entire ecosystem. as a result, we've built a 24/7 proxy and fund information infrastructure, which delivers highly accurate voting for thousands of annual meetings and whose efficiency saves funds and corporate issuers hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
thanks to our investments in digitization, it's also increasingly green, driving down paper and mail volumes and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. so we will continue to invest in extending that network to enable expanded voting, enhance shareholder communications and to better gather and share data analytics that helps funds and issuers better understand changes in their investor base. digitization is the second trend that's been accelerated by the pandemic and which is driving our growth. it's reducing costs for our clients, broadening their reach and accelerating processes from account opening to trade settlement and communications. it's being facilitated by the rapid adoption of next-generation technologies. the move to the cloud enables a scalable and variable cost computing architecture, which is changing our clients' business models. data, analytics, and ai are transforming how clients make decisions and power their investment processes. the move to digital technology and financial services has been both a driver and beneficiary of market democratization. financial services need technology and scale to compete in today's complex markets, and broadridge provides both.
our saas technology is an on-ramp for accelerated digitization with next-generation technology. we're delivering blockchain solutions to the repo market, ai-driven trading to fixed income and enhanced virtual and new meeting experience among many other examples. bringing new technologies to our clients with mutualized solutions at scale is a core part of our strategy. past investments have put broadridge in a position to help our clients today. with the acceleration of democratization and digitization, the opportunity to invest for the future is as high as ever. we're investing to build new platforms and solutions, including our broadridge wealth platform. consistent with our history, we'll also actively seek out m&a opportunities that meet our strategic and financial criteria. collectively, this investment strategy has and will continue to extend our capabilities in governance, including data analytics, capital markets, including most recently phone office trading and wealth and investment management. i'm confident that these investments will only further strengthen our position as an innovation enabler for our clients and reinforce our long-term growth. finally, any focus on sustainable, long-term growth must be grounded in meeting the needs of all stakeholders.
at broadridge, that focus starts with our culture, anchored in the service profit chain that puts associate engagement at the core of our business approach. it extends to our clients and communities as well as our shareholders. i encourage you to read our recently released sustainability report. you'll learn about how we are building the most engaging workplace for the most talented associates in our industry, the efforts we make to keep our clients' data secure, our success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and much more. before turning the call to edmund, i'd like to thank the thousands of dedicated and talented broadridge associates that have made these results and future opportunities possible. they are the foundation of our success. let me briefly sum up. broadridge delivered a strong quarter driven by continued execution and powerful underlying growth trends. we are executing on our long-term growth strategy and are committed to making investments that will create additional opportunities. and we're doing it the right way by also driving associate engagement, making a positive impact on our communities, reducing our environmental footprint and improving the financial lives of millions. i'm confident that broadridge is on track to achieve the higher end of our three-year growth objectives and is well positioned to drive sustainable growth for the long term. and now let me turn to edmund for a review of our financial results. edmund?
edmund reese -- chief financial officer
thank you, tim, and good morning, everyone. as you've just heard from tim, we are pleased with how our strategy is progressing. it's good to be here to discuss another quarter of strong financial performance, driven by new sales, strong underlying volume trends and the acquisition of itiviti. you can see that strong performance in the financial summary on slide seven, which shows that recurring revenues grew 16% to $751 million. adjusted operating income rose 17% to $177 million, with aoi margins flat to last year at 14.8%, reflecting our continued ability to find efficiencies and gain operating leverage through our scale, allowing us to invest in our technology and digital platforms. that growth in operating income was partially offset by higher interest expense related to financing the itiviti acquisition. as a result, adjusted eps rose 9% to $1.07. let's get into the details of those results, starting with the recurring revenue on slide eight. recurring revenues grew from $650 million in q1 '21 to $751 million in q1 '22, an increase of 16%.
organic recurring revenue grew at 7% and came in at the high end of our 5% to 7% three-year objectives, reflecting the continued momentum from our sales and revenue backlog and increased investor participation. the contribution from acquisitions, primarily our continued success integrating itiviti, added another nine points to recurring revenue growth. now let's turn to slide nine and look at the growth across our ics and gto businesses. we reported double-digit recurring revenue growth in both of our segments. ics recurring revenue grew by 11%, all organic, to $410 million, propelled by a combination of new sales and strong volumes. regulatory revenues rose 23% to $165 million, powered by higher mutual funded etf communications, strong equity position growth in the u.s. and closed sales revenue. growth was also strong in our international proxy business led in part by strong performance in canada. our issuer business also contributed to our overall growth rate to strong sales of our disclosure products. and as expected, we are also benefiting from high retention of our virtual shareholder meeting solution. data-driven fund solutions revenue grew 5% to $83 million, boosted by an increase in revenue from assets under administration and revenue from new sales of our data and analytics products.
finally, customer communications revenues rose 2% driven by new sales and growth in digital. in turning to gto, recurring revenues grew 21% to $341 million and 2% organic. wealth and investment management revenues rose 6%, driven by the onboarding of new component sales and higher retail trading. capital markets revenues increased 34% as we benefited from a full quarter of itiviti revenue. excluding itiviti, organic growth was slightly negative as lower license and consulting revenue was offset by strong revenue growth from new business, including revenues from onboarding of the major u.s. bank that tim mentioned. going forward, we expect revenue from closed sales, fueled by our healthy revenue backlog, will drive strong growth over the balance of the year. so let's turn to slide 10 for a closer look at the volume trends. broadridge continued to benefit from strong volume trends in the first quarter. the biggest driver of our internal growth was mutual fund and etf record growth, which rose 9% driven by healthy markets and strong inflows. equity record growth was 39% in a seasonally small quarter.
so keep in mind that the first quarter historically represents approximately 5% of full year equity communications with more than 80% coming in the fiscal third and fourth quarters while mutual funded etf communications are more balanced through the year. looking ahead, our testing of record positions is showing continued strong growth trends in the seasonally larger second half with high single-digit growth indicated for both equities and funds. on the bottom of the slide, we saw a modest 2% increase in our trading volumes as higher fixed income volumes were offset by lower equity volumes. our outlook for the balance of the year assumes flat trading volumes. turning to slide 11, where we summarize the drivers of recurring revenue growth. recurring revenues rose 16%, powered by 7% organic growth and nine points from acquisitions. revenue from closed sales was the biggest driver of our organic growth. we saw strong contribution from sales across both ics and gto. our recurring revenue retention rate remained unchanged at 98% and internal growth contributed another two points as growth in ics outpaced the decline in gto.
itiviti was the biggest driver of our acquisition growth, contributing $54 million of growth with a much smaller contribution from the tuck-in acquisitions we made late in q4 and in early q1. now we'll turn to slide 12 to review the drivers of total revenue and for some additional color on our strong event-driven revenues. total revenue growth was 17% as strong recurring revenue growth was accompanied by four points of growth from higher distribution revenue and three points from event-driven revenues. low to no margin distribution revenues grew 11% year-over-year, primarily resulting from the higher customer communications mailings. higher postage rates were a small factor in the first quarter but will be a more significant contributor to distribution revenues for the remainder of the year. so we expect continued high levels of distribution revenue growth for the full year. and as i've previously noted, over the long term, we expect that the share of distribution revenue as a percentage of total revenue will continue to decline as we remain focused on growing recurring revenue.
event-driven revenues rose to $76 million in the quarter, driven by higher mutual fund proxies. q1 '22 did benefit from a large fund proxy that was originally expected in q3 '22. despite this timing benefit and given the strong start to the year, we now expect event-driven revenues for the full year to be modestly ahead of our $220 million seven-year average. for modeling purposes, we're expecting q2 to q4 to be in line with our $55 million seven-year quarterly average. rounding out revenue drivers, changes in fx contributed one point to our growth. as previously disclosed, we changed our fx reporting methodology to better align the presentation of our key metrics with current fx rates. you can find our comparable revenue, segment profitability and closed sales numbers for fiscal '20 and '21 in the eight-k we filed at the end of september and in the appendix to these slides. so let's now move to margins on slide 13. adjusted operating income margin was flat at 14.8% in the first quarter.
the positive impact of strong recurring and event-driven growth was offset by growth investments and an increase in low-margin distribution revenue. we continue to expect aoi margin of approximately 19% for the full year as we benefit from the higher-margin itiviti revenues and continued margin expansion in our organic business, offsetting the greater-than-expected higher growth and low margin distribution revenues. moving on to close sales on slide 14. closed sales of $30 million were essentially flat year-over-year. and closed sales were balanced across both our ics and gto segments, and we continue to see over 2/3 of our sales in smaller core deals, those under $2 million in annualized value. that gives us confidence in the broad demand and long-term growth of our digital products. we remain on track to deliver $240 million to $280 million in closed sales for the full year. and finally, cash flow and capital allocation on slide 15. broadridge's cash flow generation is typically negative in the fiscal first quarter and strengthens throughout the year, and q1 '22 was no exception with negative free cash flow of $151 million. turning to uses of capital, we continue to invest in our long-term growth.
a big part of that investment is the technology platforms we're building in capital markets and wealth. these new platforms require upfront investment to build new capabilities and convert new clients. we invested $82 million in our platforms during the first quarter. our investment in our next-generation wealth management platform is an important part of that, but we're also investing in other platforms such as our global post-trade management or gptm solution. all of these investments are tied to long-term client contracts and strengthen our capabilities across capital markets and wealth management. we will continue to prioritize these internal investments in our technology platforms as part of our capital allocation model. and we're excited about the growth from new client revenues as we convert clients onto the new platforms. as we integrate itiviti, continued m&a remains a focus. during the quarter, we had a modest minority investment and invested $13 million in a pair of tuck-in acquisitions within our capital markets business.
looking forward, you can expect us to continue investing in our platforms and allocating capital to targeted m&a opportunities that meet our high strategic criteria and financial profile. and we will continue to return capital to shareholders, primarily through our dividend, as we remain focused on paying down debt and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. i'll close my prepared remarks with a quick review of our guidance and some final thoughts on our first quarter results. we are reaffirming our full year guidance on all of our key financial metrics. we continue to expect 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth, adjusted operating income margin of approximately 19% and adjusted eps growth of 11% to 15%. i'll note that over the last five years, the first half has typically represented less than 30% of our full year adjusted eps, and i expect that trend to hold in fiscal year '22. finally, as i noted earlier, we expect closed sales in the range of $240 million to $280 million. and with that, let me reiterate today's key messages. broadridge delivered strong first quarter results with 16% recurring revenue growth driven by new sales, strong underlying volume trends and the acquisition of ltiviti. we are reaffirming our guidance for a strong fiscal year 2022, and we are investing in our business as we pursue our $52 billion addressable market. as a result, we are well positioned to deliver at the high end of our three-year objectives, and we see a long run rate for continued growth. so with that, let's take your questions. let me turn it back to the operator.
