[operator instructions] and the first question comes from leo mariani with keybanc.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys. just wanted to follow-up a little bit on that last comment that you guys made. in terms of the shares, the reserve for unsecured claimants out of the bankruptcy, you just talked about 900 and something thousand there that were issued. are all those claims resolved? or are there other potential issuances of shares related to unresolved claims?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
good morning, leo. i'm going to let jimmy to address that, please.
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
hey, leo. yeah, i think we've got a good disclosure about this in the 10-k, but we reserved 3.1 million shares for these types of claims, and we still have some remaining unsecured claims to be cleaned up, and it will take some time to go through that process. this one was -- we were -- both sides were equally motivated to get it solved so that we could continue to work together going forward. and -- but we have some other legal claims that we'll continue to work through for the remainder of the year, basically.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and i guess just with respect to m&a, i think you guys have been fairly vocal about maintaining just a very strong balance sheet and improving it back in order to potentially do some acquisitions at some point in time. i guess we've seen a couple of deals out of the bakken recently. just wanted to get a sense, are those deals that you guys have looked at? are you very focused on the bakken? are you also kind of looking at other basins? maybe just any kind of status update on m&a?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah. we're very familiar with the transactions that occurred. they're both a little bit unique in certain respects. so we chose, at this point, we're going to continue to look at our opportunities.
whether it's bakken or wherever, i mean, leo, we're looking for the right opportunity. we do know the bakken, and that's where our focus is, and i expect it to remain. so yes, we can't comment too many items there.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
understood for sure. no, that's helpful. you guys talked about a second rig potentially late this year. is that really just to kind of set up a two rig program potentially in '22? what's the thought process there?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah, the whole thought is to build our drill the uncompleted count up, so we can maintain our '22 production level. otherwise, everything starts to drop around the end of the year and the first part of 2022. so i think we've got to kind of plan late third quarter, early fourth-quarter time frame to bring it in.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok, thanks guys.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
you bet. thank you.
operator
and the next question comes from neal dingmann with suntrust.
neal dingmann -- truist financial -- analyst
good morning, all. lynn, my first question is your thoughts around whiting's inventory. you all recently lead -- kind of laid out that showed, i think, if i recall, as many as about 432 core locations at $55. so really have one, obviously, nice increase there at $55.
and so my question is, what type of -- kind of increase where we continue to see now that we're at $60, running to $65. and maybe could you talk about how -- i'm just kind of wondering, again, when they look at these locations, are they pretty widely spread throughout? or is it a couple of the other ones that tarp on some of the others that are more centrally located?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah, and i'll let chip jump in here as well. but i think, generally, we put $55. we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here. so i think you do see that inventory number growing.
and certainly, as we get to $60, we see an increase as well. but chip, you mind walking through kind of where we see all these locations in general?
chip rimer -- vice president of commercial
yes. so you got to -- and i appreciate the question. so of course, our core at sanish, and we'll see probably over close to 200 locations in sanish that we see. as we get in that $50 range for sanish kicks in around $40 or so.
and then as we get to foreman butte at $55, we're seeing 100, 120 locations as we go. and so as prices go up, we continue to see that -- continue to grow.
neal dingmann -- truist financial -- analyst
not as much in pronghorn, chip, anything down? i'm just wondering if you're going out there?
chip rimer -- vice president of commercial
no, our pronghorn's going to be a lot -- has to activate a lot higher.
neal dingmann -- truist financial -- analyst
ok. ok.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
and all of our focus in on just the core area there, neil.
neal dingmann -- truist financial -- analyst
yes. got it. got it. and then just one more for jimmy.
jimmy, can you remind...
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
neil, just let me add one comment. i mean we did state that these are economic conditions at these dollar prices. it's important to know. there's obviously a lot of locations out here, given certain levels of oil pricing.
chip rimer -- vice president of commercial
so yeah, this hurts our rate of return level. and also, there's a little bit in redtail that takes off also in that $50, $55 oil.
neal dingmann -- truist financial -- analyst
no, i think we all appreciate that, lynn. that i think it's a number that i don't want to say before we didn't trust, but it's a number we could definitely hang out hat on now. i really appreciate that, lynn. and then, jimmy, just a follow-up is, can you remind me post kind of when you came out of restructuring, i think there was some sort of stipulations in there regarding your rbls, what the repayment needs to be? is it before you can do shareholder buybacks or other shareholder returns or different things like that? i just -- i'm not sure if i'm clear on that.
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
yeah. and our rbl that our exit facility, if you will, does have a requirement to get to basically september. and so as the history of free cash flow before we would be able to make dividends or buy back stock. i think if we were in a position and desire to, we could probably push on that a little bit, but that's kind of what we've been adhering to.
and we wanted -- as we've said in the script, we want to continue to pay down debt because that is our liquidity to pursue opportunities going forward. and so that's still our preferred use of free cash flow at this point. for the short and medium term, i'd say that's a -- that would be our focus.
neal dingmann -- truist financial -- analyst
you show them, jimmy, when you get down to 0 debt, you can't do much better?
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
no. we're not there. but we'll get there pretty quick. we hope to not get to that point because we hope opportunities present themselves that we can reinvest this liquidity.
but at some point, with just going status quo, you get there pretty quick. you guys have done the modeling and kind of think everybody knows the pace of our ability to pay down that debt.
neal dingmann -- truist financial -- analyst
great job guys. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. and the next question comes from david deckelbaum with cowen.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
good morning, lynn and jimmy -- everyone. thanks for taking the time.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
good morning, david.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
i wanted to follow-up real quick just on the fourth quarter. in the ops update that you guys put out before you reported the quarter, you highlighted that production was a little bit better-than-expected on a more favorable base decline. can you elaborate a little bit on that? or is this a case of just having more uptime? or are you seeing some improved reservoir performance? and i guess, what would you attribute to that to?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
i'll let chip address. i mean, generally speaking, i think we had some nice weather in the fourth quarter, and we are a little bit ahead on our activity pace, but chip?
chip rimer -- vice president of commercial
yeah. i appreciate the question. so we created a base management team here. i guess, it was just coming out of chapter 11 there and wound up.
they've really been focusing on downtime. and so part of that is good weather. we had our lowest downtime in three years in the fourth quarter, which really helped us going forward. so some of our run times also extended.
so we manage our run times on our -- see how long our artificial lift is going. and those extended almost 7% over -- year over year from fourth quarter to fourth quarter. some of the runtimes going longer, you've got the downtime better and then you get better oil.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
and just to ask on activity. i know you're working down some of the ducs in the foreman butte hidden bench area. and i know you had some ducs in the sanish partial area. should we assume that, that second rig kind of floats around? or is this going to be mostly a sanish partial field program?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
i think we'll initially move it into the sanish area, david. that where our goals are right now, at least.
chip rimer -- vice president of commercial
that's correct.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. and lynn, i just wanted to follow-up on some of the m&a discussions. i know you can't say a lot, but i guess, one, can you characterize, i guess, how many opportunities are out there now? and you all can just elaborate a little bit on the pipeline. and i guess i would wonder as well as you've evaluated some of the deals, we note that many of the deals, especially in the bakken, have a very heavy pdp component.
when you look at value creation for whiting right now, are you looking for something that has a bit more of an undeveloped tail to it?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
it's a good question, david. and we're trying to look at everything, i guess, i'll start there. you're right, the basin is older. it's one of the more mature basins.
so most of these do have a very high component. frankly, most of them don't have a lot of inventory going forward. so i think that's one of the challenges we're faced here is how do we try to get both of those situations. location of the acreage is also important.
do we want to be on the reservation? do we want to be off the reservation? these are questions that we have to ask ourselves. so it's a myriad of questions. and i think we look at every pdp deal and we are trying to find some pockets of undeveloped. but again, i think we're all probably limited in this, call it, five to eight year range of inventory here and depending on what oil prices do.
i mean we look at a $55 oil price. i think every package you look at is kind of similar in nature.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
i guess it would stand that with so many of those types of deals out there, there's nothing that really jumps off the page that would incentivize you to chase because it looks too similar to what you already have?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah. no, it's an interesting environment. but again, i also think if we can find the situation to double where we have today, we're better shaped because, again, some of this will be to the cost. we can work on overhead costs and these type of things, which will be -- bring value to the bottom line.
so i think there's definitely merit in looking at all these. and i do believe size and scale matters. i haven't changed my mind there at all. we've got to grow here.
and we've got to figure our path forward here.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
good luck guys. thanks for the answers.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
good to hear you david. thank you.
operator
hey, good morning. and the next question comes from noel parks with tuohy brothers. please go ahead.
noel parks -- tuohy brothers -- analyst
hey, good morning.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
hey, noel.
noel parks -- tuohy brothers -- analyst
i just wanted to touch back on the workover program that you're putting some capital into this year. can you just talk a little bit about the cost of what sort of productivity or returns you think you might get out of them? and how you come up with the priority of which areas or which wells to tackle first?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah. we think it's our best dollar spend, and i'll let maybe chip walk through our focus and how we go about this process.
chip rimer -- vice president of commercial
yeah, noel. let's start it. we have two meetings a week on the production side with all our operations. and we're looking to see what the best opportunities are out there in all of our fields.
and so we have a team that manages our workover rigs. we have about 25 plus or minus rigs that work out there. that team goes to our most economical wells. they are our best returns.
and so that's what we focus on. the guys will look at it and where do we need rigs do we need rigs up in williston or down in watford city or where that might be. and that is on a daily basis. that wasn't always the case a couple of years ago.
and now i love the way the teams are working, they operate together, managing their business. our team inside here down in denver manages -- runs economics, which wells to go. and then we focus on those. we focus on the cost, managing the cost across the board to make sure we're getting the best bank for the buck.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
it's also an area where the weather hits us. this february, the weather is pretty tough. a workover rig is not protected. so the workers are out in the exposure, so.
chip rimer -- vice president of commercial
yes, to your point, the weather, it was brutal in february. the joined rig doesn't lose a beat. the completion is just a little slower. so the workover rigs just can't work in that.
and so we're going to pick up a couple of additional rigs to manage that, but it's easily managed.
noel parks -- tuohy brothers -- analyst
great. thanks for the detail. and just from an accounting standpoint, will most of what you do this year wind up as capex? or will it wind up in loe?
chip rimer -- vice president of commercial
get a component of both. it just kind of depends on what the work is involved. generally, you can -- if you're improving reserves or adding reserves, then we would call it capital, but for the most part, these are repair type operations, so primarily going to be in loe.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah. of the 25, probably 20 of those are work in loe.
chip rimer -- vice president of commercial
in our prepared remarks, noel, we mentioned that we expect loe to increase from the low levels that we saw in the last part of 2020, and a lot of that is due to increased work we've experienced just keeping these wells maintained and up and running.
noel parks -- tuohy brothers -- analyst
all right. thanks. you made the connection before. that's helpful.
thanks a lot.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
all right. thanks, noel.
operator
ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. i'll turn the floor back to management for closing remarks. thanks.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
all right. thank you, everyone. we'll be attending some virtual conferences over the coming quarters. i sure hope at some point we can have some face to facing.
for now, everything will continue to be virtual. i'd like to thank everybody for joining us this morning, your interest in whiting. once again, i want to thank the staff here at whiting for the work that's gone on over the last 12 months. it's been certainly a change of working remotely in a large part of this, so just a huge shout out to the staff for what they've done here.
and we're really looking forward to 2021. we think we're starting the year in a great spot. certainly have seen a nice boost of oil the prices here, and we're excited with lies ahead of us. so thanks everybody.
stay safe and enjoy your day. thank you.

operator
good morning. my name is keith, and i will be your conference facilitator today. welcome to whiting petroleum's fourth-quarter 2020 conference call. [operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to brandon day, whiting's investors relations manager.
brandon day -- investor relations
thank you, keith. good morning, everyone. this is brandon day, whiting's investor relations manager. thank you for joining us to discuss whiting's fourth-quarter results for the period ended december 31, 2020.
with me today is whiting's ceo, lynn peterson. also available to answer questions during the q&a session will be our cfo, jimmy henderson; coo, chip rimer; and vp of commercial, jo ann stockton. please be advised that our remarks today, including answers to your questions, include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to materially different from those currently anticipated.

following the prepared remarks, time permitting, we'll open the call to your questions. i would like to remind everyone that a replay of this audio webcast will be available via the company's investor relations page at www.whiting.com. i'd now like to turn the call over to the ceo of whiting petroleum, mr. lynn peterson. 
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
thanks, brandon. good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. i hope everyone continues to stay safe and healthy. we filed our 10-k yesterday, and you can refer to it for detailed information, so i hope to highlight some of the significant items.
let me begin with a huge understatement. that if nothing else, 2020 brought change and as we embark on a whole new year, the company is in excellent shape, both financially and operationally. the whiting team has done a wonderful job scrubbing and challenging every cost throughout the company. we have reduced staffing, cut salaries to reflect the current state of the industry and forged a compensation plan for the executive team that more closely aligns with our shareholders as we look to reset the company.
our results in the fourth quarter begin to reflect these efforts as shown by our free cash flow. this call marks the end of the road for the year 2020, and now we can truly focus on a future for whiting as we are all well positioned to take advantage of a solid asset base, a strong financial position and a team of talented employees. before getting into the financial and operating results, i would like to give a shout out to our staff for the safety record in 2020. the company reported its lowest total recordable incident rate in the history of the company.
the company also exceeded the state of north dakota's gas capture rate without any exemptions, and will continue to strive to improve in all areas. since many of the comparisons between 2020 and 2019 numbers are not meaningful due to the restructuring and curtailment of activity beginning in april of 2020, we will try to comment on the comparisons that are significant -- have significant implications moving forward. adjusted ebitdax was $120 million for the quarter and $382 million for the year after adjusting for the nonrecurring items related to the restructuring and reorganization compared to $241 million and $979 million for the respective periods of 2019. despite the lower activity level and commodity price environment, the company generated nearly $90 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to approximately $86 million in the same period of 2019.
the free cash flow generated since emerging from bankruptcy has gone toward paying down debt. on september 1, 2020, the company emerged with $425 million drawn on its $750 million facility. as of december 31, 2020, the company's debt was down to $334 million net of cash on hand, and is projected to be paid down to approximately $275 million as we exit february. we would've paid down $150 million since september 1 and as we generate free cash flow, we'll continue to reduce our borrowings as that is part of our credit facility that was set up at emergence, and is our liquidity and dry powder as we think about future opportunities.
our production for the quarter averaged 91,700 barrels of oil equivalent, of which 61% was crude oil. the company's production continued to decline through the quarter and into the end of the year. our capital program and guidance is designed to essentially hold 2021 production flat from our december 31, 2020 exit rate, and we estimate full-year 2021 production to be in the range of 82,000 to 88,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and oil to be in the range of 48,000 to 52,000 barrels of oil per day. we spent $21 million on capital expenditures during the fourth quarter to bring five wells onto production and commenced completion operations on an additional six wells.
in 2021, we expect to spend $240 million at the midpoint of our capital expenditure guidance. we currently have one drilling rig running in our sanish field in north dakota and anticipate a second rig could be added in late 2021. we also have one completion crew operating in the foreman butte area. we plan on turning 56 wells to production in 2021, of which 13 are scheduled for the first quarter that were drilled and uncompleted wells as of year-end.
lease operating expenses were $55 million or $6.57 per boe for the fourth quarter. the benefit of our cost-cutting measures, along with better-than-expected weather and extended esp run times, positively impacted the quarter. i will note that winter has since returned to north dakota in early february, where temperatures have been below 0 for the most consecutive days since 1936, with temperatures frequently reaching negative 20 degrees fahrenheit. the operation team continues to perform well despite these harsh conditions, but we do expect operating cost to increase somewhat in the first quarter of 2021, as has been shown historically.
we anticipate an active workover program throughout the year to keep production flowing on our base portfolio of older wells. moving to some of the recent regulations of federal appeals court ruling in january affirmed the district court's order to vacate the dakota access pipeline easement and directed the court to prepare an eis, of which was previously under way. u.s. army core requested a two month continuance of the february 10 status conference ordered by the district court to allow additional time to brief the new administration and confirm where the pipeline will continue to operate while their environmental impact study takes place.
we have and will continue to secure alternative market arrangements to help mitigate the potential impact of an unfavorable outcome. we continue to believe that even with this exposure, our 2021 average oil price differentials will be similar to what we experienced in the second half of 2020, both in average and variability. there has been a focus on exposure to federal acreage as the biden -- as part of the biden administration. we have very limited exposure in north dakota and expect very minimal impacts to our future plans because of any potential restriction to be put in place.
to ensure our ability to fund our capex program and generate free cash flow, we have continued to layer on commodity price hedges. as a reminder, under our credit facility, we are required to hedge certain minimum levels of our pdp production, and we have exceeded those levels for the coming year. we currently have 70% of our total forecasted crude oil hedged in 2021 and 75% of our natural gas. we have utilized a combination of fixed price swaps and collars, which are further detailed in our 10-k.
as we have guided previously, we believe we will generate over $150 million of free cash flow in 2021 at a $45 wti crude oil price and a $2.50 nymex natural gas price. as a rule of thumb, for every $1 move in wti, we expect approximately $10 million change in cash flows, but this will be affected by hedging at varying price levels. during 2020, we made a concerted effort to overhaul our internal reservoir engineering team as well as engaging netherlands tool & associates as our third-party independent engineering firm. our estimated proved reserves were 260 million barrels of oil equivalent with a pv10 of $1.2 million at december 31, 2020 compared to 485 million barrels of oil equivalent in 2019.
the two most significant components of the reduction in the and reserves were pricing and activity level. the pricing per barrel under sec rules for december 31, 2020 was approximately $40 per barrel compared to december 31, 2019, which was approximately $56 per barrel or a total reduction of just over $16 per barrel. gas per mcf decreased to $1.99 from $2.58 for the same two periods. the reduction in the company's activity from early 2020 to late 2020 had a ripple effect throughout the -- through the inability to book proved undeveloped locations that fall outside the sec five year rule, combined with a more conservative approach to pud bookings going forward.
interestingly, since we have experienced a significant change in wti pricing over the last few months, we wanted to internally run our reserves at $50 per barrel and $3 natural gas to see the impact on our reserves. this pricing increased our proved reserves by approximately 20% and doubled our pv10 values. the commodity price increase also has a positive impact on our future drilling locations, expanding our economic drilling inventory to over six years modeling a two rig program. we remain steadfast in our strategy of generating free cash flow, while mitigating the impact of production declines.
in the near-term and in accordance with our credit facility, we will use our free cash flow to continue paying down debt, to ensure continued liquidity. longer term, we will look to our options of returning capital to shareholders. lastly, one housekeeping item. as you may have seen in the prerelease, we agreed to a settlement with a general unsecured claimant where we released approximately 949,000 shares from the bankruptcy settlement pool in exchange for a release of claims, which eliminates certain obligations in our redtail project.
these shares have a lockup feature, preventing to sell more than 50% of the shares during any 30-day period. after the settlement, our share count is approximately 39 million beginning in the first quarter of 2021. with that, i'll turn it back to the operator and open it up for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from david deckelbaum of cowen. please proceed.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
good morning, lynn and everyone. thanks for taking my questions.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
hi, david.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
the last comment you're probably going to get the most feedback on today. as we look out here, you mentioned, obviously, you're going to be debt free by the end of the year. the strip sort of as you guys earning your entire enterprise value in five years. how do you kind of square that with the types of opportunities you should be looking at vis-à-vis m&a.? obviously, there's been several deals in the bucket, and transaction values are moving higher.
what sort of has this sort of secret sauce or recipe changed versus what you would have been looking at when you guys took over the company?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah. david, without a doubt, i think things have changed dramatically. i mean, when you think back eight months ago, we were in a $35, $40 environment. and i think there was several opportunities to combine our clean balance sheet with maybe somebody had some debt whereas prices moved up.
people have been able to improve their balance sheets, and so you've seen a change there. i think what we continue to look for is really some type of transformational acquisition that will bring, not only pdp production, but also inventory. i think the bakken was one of the more mature players out there, and i think all companies are kind of facing this for the most part. and so this is what we continue to focus our attention on.
i think the transaction that was announced earlier this week was interesting, and i think when we read through that thing for equity, i think this is what was interesting to me. as you can see from our most recent q, we have over three times the production from a barrel of oil, from a barrels of oil equivalent, certainly a much greater runway of inventory. yet, when you look at three times the price that was paid in cash and compare that to our current market cap, you can see a significant implied upside to our share price. so, i mean, these are some of the things that we're trying to work through as we look at opportunities here.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
so telling me you picked up the phone and offered the company up for sale?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
no. didn't said that. i said you can see the implied ups, right to our share.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
there's an arbitrage, for sure. i guess you mentioned inventory as well. is this commodity environment causing you guys to kind of pick up the magnifying glass a bit more about what you have organically right now, either looking at, including perhaps more secondary zones? are we testing some concepts? or do you feel like everything under the hood is pretty well fed at this point?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
well, i think one of the things maybe different jump in here with me, but one of the things we're looking as longer laterals in some of our areas that maybe are not quite our top-tier one or two-type anchorage. like we're doing some of those things. chip, you want to comment?
chip rimer -- chief operating officer
yeah. thanks, lynn. we're looking at those some three-mile laterals versus your typical two miles. we're tweaking some of our completions and seeing what that does for us in some of our areas, especially in the foreman butte areas, and so additional sand and water.
we'll see how those turn out this year. so we're tweaking a few things and hopefully get some upside, especially in these prices.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks for the answers, guys. best of luck, lynn.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, david. i think we want to reiterate again. our board is totally focused here where we've had a lot of discussions.
i think there will be a dividend or a stock buyback combination of both as we look to the-exit the year here. again, we're just trying to comply with our revolver. but stay tuned, i'd say, i think you'll be pleased.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you, lynn.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from neal dingmannhend of truist. neal, please proceed.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
knowing your inventory, i'm just wondering, could you walk through that again? it seems like you still have a long runway. i'm just wondering, could you talk about current inventory, including the ducs, as it sits today?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think if you look back at the presentation on our website, we show over 400 locations at a $55 level. and again, we kind of keep conservative at that $55 range. but i think you can see as we look the next three years, it's highly focused in the sanish area.
chip, do you want to add anything to that?
chip rimer -- chief operating officer
no. that's correct. we've got probably three-quarters of those are bakken in the sanish area. quarter of those are three-quarters, so we'll continue to focus on that area, that's our best area.
we know that area very well, and we're seeing great results from that. and then there is stuff down at the [inaudible] point of view areas that we think also make that level and looking forward to getting some of those areas to get better than what we've seen in the past. and so like i said before, we're tweaking some of our completions. we're looking at three mile.
i think we regret some great value out of some of those areas that we have explored before in the past.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
great details. and lynn, just that kind of brought up my follow-up. what chip was saying for you or chip? are you doing, i guess, going forward, i don't know either sanish going forward more co-development. you obviously have some other zones you mentioned besides bakken and a lot of that.
so is today or in the future you'd be doing more co-development we're thinking about that?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
i mean, it's more bakken, and that's majority of our-that we're chasing right now.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. and if i could take one last one. and lynn, just on service costs today. any inflation yet up in the north?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
we're starting to see some pressures. we've been able to hold them pretty much to bay right down. but i think if we look at the second half of the year, we've talked about this. i think you can see and i wouldn't be surprised to see a 5% to 8% increase over time.
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
yeah. i really appreciate what our team has done. our supply chain or operations folks, they've locked in contracts and service providers. we've done a lot of strategic partnership to allow our prices to stay pretty constant, like lynn said, through the first three quarters may seal upside pressure on the back side.
you're seeing a little bit on fuel side. you're seeing a little bit on the steel side. we've locked our steel in a little bit on the labor, but i think you're right, lynn. it will be single digit.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
but to the team's spread, i mean, we actually try to think through this when we were doing our budgeting, i think a lot of this has been built in. i mean, you're never perfect on these things, but i think we've actually thought through that pretty clearly. so i don't think we'll have any big surprises as we go down the year here.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks, guys.

thanks, neal.

and our next question comes from noel parks of tuohy brothers. please proceed.
noel parks -- tuohy brothers -- analyst
good morning.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
good morning, noel.
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
good morning, noel.
noel parks -- tuohy brothers -- analyst
i just wanted to get your thoughts on sort of just the basin as a whole with different deal activity and so forth. it seems like it's kind of a glass half full, glass half empty. you look at some parts of the basin, and it seems like it's maturing, not a lot of running room left. look at other parts, and there is still more, more inventory out there.
and i guess if-could you just talk a little bit about the-, i guess, unevenness that their basin has been developed at? of course, you're being early in the sanish area. and just what you think might be revisited from early vintage drilling out there that with your scale could maybe offer you an advantage that like a smaller operator or a smaller consolidator might not be able to match.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah. i would say, as you look at the basin, a lot of the remaining inventories are in the hands of the bigger companies, the majors. i think as the pace of activity -- think back over the last 10 years of our industry, companies were driven for growth. that's what everybody wanted.
so there was a lot of drilling by the independents, where the majors, i think, took a different pace. so i think when we sit there and look today that's where we see a lot of the remaining inventory. these things change over time, and i guess we're aware. we know what we want to do, but we can be patient doing it.
we don't have to a knee-jerk here by any means. i think we're in really good shape. and we just got to keep pushing forward here and try to find some of those areas where we can peel off some inventory. so --
noel parks -- tuohy brothers -- analyst
and just to follow up, i am sorry.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
no. i'm just going to ask chip. have you got any other thoughts in that regard?
chip rimer -- chief operating officer
no. i think you're right. i think you're right, spot-on.
noel parks -- tuohy brothers -- analyst
and just sort of explain the discussion to include the midstream part of the equation. we-with the pipeline and the sort of federal issues, that's kind of a different uncertainty introduced into the mix. but it is on the spectrum of further investment in midstream versus trying to consider-well, i guess, consolidate up or consider spinning off your assets. just where do you think the-where do the best hands for the midstream operations to be in these days, would you say? and does that play into your thoughts about consolidation?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
i think when we look at the infrastructure, the basin, i think we're in pretty good shape. i think you'll continue to see some consolidation on that side of it. we've always set ourselves up to be operators of the e&p side of it and stayed out of the midstream. we do have some gas plants and stuff like that that we'll continue to evaluate and operate.
but i think our whole industry, whether it's upstream or midstream, it's going to go through some additional consolidation here. jo ann, do you have any thoughts on that that you're hearing in the field or anything?
jo ann stockton -- vice president of commercial -- analyst
hearing anything differently, i mean, i think as you alluded to we're going to evaluate it on a situational basis as it relates to, for example, the specific plants and what our plans are layered on top of that.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
jimmy, you got any comments?
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
no. i think that's-your initial question about is the glass half full or half empty in a matured basin like this, i think that you could say that's one of the positive things as you do have good infrastructure in place, especially at production levels that a basin is currently experiencing. we're in really good shape. as jo ann has talked before about where we are with dapl down and how that turns out based on production levels in this-in the basin, generally, we're in a good shape.
and i think you'll continue to see gathering, put in the ground to service our operations. but for the most part, we've got some-we've got pretty good level of service providers and good partners that we work with on that side up there.
noel parks -- tuohy brothers -- analyst
great. thanks a lot for the perspective.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer

good morning. my name is ian, and i'll be your conference facilitator today. welcome to whiting petroleum's first-quarter 2021 conference call. the call will be limited to 45 minutes, including q&a.
[operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to brandon day, whiting's investors relations manager. please proceed.
brandon day -- investor relations manager
thank you, ian. good morning everyone. this is brandon day, whiting's investor relations manager. thank you for joining us to discuss whiting's first-quarter results for the period ended march 31, 2021.
with me today is whiting's ceo, lynn peterson. also available to answer questions during the q&a session will be our cfo, jimmy henderson; coo, chip rimer; and vp of commercial, jo ann stockton. please be advised that our remarks today, including answers to your questions, include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to be materially different from those currently anticipated.those include risks relating to commodity prices, competition, technology, environmental and regulatory compliance, midstream availability and others described in our filings with the securities and exchange commission, which are incorporated by reference.
we disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. in addition, we may provide certain non-gaap financial information in this call. the relevant definitions and gaap reconciliations may be found in our earnings release, which can be found on our website at whiting.com in the investor relations section. following the prepared remarks, time permitting, we'll open the call for the questions.
i would like to remind everyone that a replay of this audio webcast will be available via the company's investor relations page at whiting.com. i'd now like to turn the call over to the ceo of whiting petroleum, mr. lynn peterson. 
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
thanks, brandon. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. we followed our 10-q yesterday, and you can refer to it for detailed information. this morning's prepared remarks will be relatively short as the quarter went pretty much as planned, and our expectations were achieved across the board.
i wanted to thank our staff for their work done during the quarter and our progress today. the work that was put into our planning and budgeting process late last year was executed very well by our field team, despite difficult and adverse conditions caused by the winter weather. one constant that we have working in north dakota is acknowledged that winter will return each year. bringing our production levels at the top of our guidance for the first quarter sets the company up for continued success through remainder of the year.
as i look back on the past eight months, it's striking how quickly the industry has changed as oil prices have increased significantly. now that oil has been trading in the range of $65 per barrel, financial conditions have risen across the board. to reflect the impact of this change on our company, we chose a conservative $55 per barrel crude price to reset our outlook. using that price for oil, we now expect whiting to generate approximately $550 million in ebitdax and approximately $300 million in free cash flow in 2021, choosing our current market cap results in an approximate 20% free cash flow yield.
keep in mind that this is after the effect of hedges that we're required to execute upon emergence that are now obviously out of the bunny. to put some context around those numbers, we reported $39 million hedging loss for the first quarter and project over $180 million for the full year at current oil prices. the first quarter of 2021 exemplifies the effect of this price environment and our strong asset base. the company generated $108 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2021, compared to approximately $89 million in the previous quarter, again, net of hedge settlements.
the free cash flow generated since emerging from bankruptcy has gone toward paying down debt. with oil prices above $60 per barrel, we clearly expect whiting to have a zero outstanding balance on its rbl at the end of the year. looking closer at our financial results, we had a net loss on a gaap basis of $1 million or $0.02 per share during the quarter as compared to a loss of $1.2 million or $0.03 per share for the previous quarter. adjusting for certain items but primarily the mark to market of hedging instruments, we had adjusted net income of $108 million or $2.79 per share, compared to $56 million or $1.46 per share for the previous quarter.
notably ebitdax was $171 million, compared to $154 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to the price changes as our production was relatively consistent. turning to operations. it's been great to get back in the oil industry through drilling and completing activity. as you recall, we brought in a completion unit in late 2020 and started up our first drilling rig back in february of 2021.
the team has done a great job returning to a more active level of operations while maintaining our safety-first goal. our production for the quarter average 89.9 thousand barrels of oil equivalent, of which 60% was crude oil, representing a flat line to our exit rate of december 2020 and at the high end of our corporate guidance. we spent $56 million on capital expenditures during the first quarter to bring 14 wells onto production, drilled six gross operated wells and completed 15 operated wells. we ended the quarter with 31 drilled uncompleted wells that will be completed throughout this year.
currently, both our drilling and completion activity is in our sanish field in north dakota, as was planned. lease operating expenses were $59 million or $7.34 per boe for the first quarter of 2021. as expected, winter did return to north dakota, and we increased our work over program for well maintenance during the quarter. as always, i want to express my appreciation to the operations team for working through the challenging conditions in such a safe manner.
turning to oil differentials. in the first quarter, our oil differentials have been at the lower end of our guidance range. as the dakota access pipeline has remained operational with the army corps of engineers electing not to take enforcement action with regards to its policy on encroachments while continuing to monitor the ongoing eis bindings. as we look ahead and await the pending district court ruling, we estimate that even with the possibility of a near-term negative outcome, our 2021 average oil price differentials will fall within the full guidance range.
during the quarter, we secured additional crude sales and transportation arrangements that serve as flow assurance and price protection in a dapl shutdown scenario. in addition to supporting longer-term value, we believe we are well-positioned, regardless of the outcome. as a reminder, under our credit facility, we're required to have certain minimum levels of our pdp production, and we have exceeded those levels for the coming year. we currently have approximately 68% of our total forecasted crude oil hedge in 2021 and about 75% of our natural gas.
we have utilized combination of fixed-price swaps and callers, which are detailed in our 10-q. on april 7, whiting's revolving credit facility was reaffirmed at 750 million by unanimous consent of the lenders of our rbl facility. we appreciate the continued support from the lending group. the company ended the quarter with $245 million drawn and $25 million of unrestricted cash, resulting in total liquidity of $527 million. we remain focused on our strategy of generating free cash flow while mitigating the impact of production declines. in the near term and in accordance with our credit facility, we will use a free cash flow to continue paying down debt to ensure continued liquidity.
our credit facility precludes us from making any restricted payments before september, and we want to continue to focus on pursuing accretive acquisitions. currently our board and management are evaluating all options for returning capital back to shareholders, including dividends and stock buybacks, and we intend to layout our plans later this year. last but not at all least, our commitment to operating in an environmentally conscious and safe manner continues to be a priority of whiting. towards us we have established an esg committee under the board of directors that is focused on oversight of our efforts in meeting best practices.
further, we have tied elements of esg to compensation, including safety, human capital management and gas capture. we continue to work toward transparent sustainability reporting that is index to establish frameworks that can demonstrate our progress. with that i'll turn it back to lynn and open it up for questions. thank you.

thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and the first question comes from david deckelbaum with cowen. please go ahead.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
good morning, lynn, and the team over there. thanks for taking the questions. 
lynn peterson -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
you bet, david. how are you doing?
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
i'm great. i did want to follow up. i know you're talking about deferring the decisions on returns of capital. i guess, can you put a timeline on that? i think our prior understanding was that maybe there was a trigger point when the rbl is fully retired, that we might have some more visibility there.
is this something that you might be able to update the market on by the end of the year?
lynn peterson -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yeah. i think we're moving in that direction. it's going to be toward the end of the year, first of the following year. i mean, i think we just -- we're trying to show some patience here, david.
think about our shareholders first. i think it always comes to our minds. we've got a lot of volatility in oil prices going on here. and we want to make sure that these decisions we make have sustainability to them that we can deliver in future periods kind of regardless of oil pricing.
so i guess we're just trying to be patient on top here as we go through this.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
i appreciate that. you know, i know it's probably early as well, but there is obviously a considerably -- considerable free cash yield that you can see on '22 with the strip. with that in mind, does that suggest that you would be buying back shares before kind of considering outright payment in terms of cash?
lynn peterson -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
i think this is certainly one thing we look at when you look at your share price and trying to balance it against the dividend. i mean, that discussion is front and center with us right now.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
and if i could just ask one on the operations side. you guys consummated a great bolt-on over in the sanish field. you talked about having one active rig there. and does any activity step up at all, i guess, in '22? or are you guys still kind of configuring units out there and seeing where you can sort of extend some of your lateral lengths, etc.?
lynn peterson -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yeah. let me ask chip rimer here to address that. and again, we haven't put out '22 plans yet, but we're moving in that direction. chip?
chip rimer -- chief operating officer
yes, dave, thanks. yeah, we drill the sanish in pods, and that's important to us. we also have to redo some permitting for a three-mile lateral. so we're planning it right now, but we'll be doing some of the wells we've picked up with [inaudible] in 2022.
lynn peterson -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
i think you can kind of, of course, run a two-rig program for '22, assuming that the oil prices stay where they're at.
chip rimer -- chief operating officer
yeah, we'll have one rig stay in sanish when the rig comes at the cassandra, and then it will go back into sanish. but for the most part, we'll have -- end of the year will be most of cassandra and then go back into sanish.
lynn peterson -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
all kind of the eastern half of our properties.
chip rimer -- chief operating officer
that is correct, yes.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
i appreciate that color. it was definitely encouraging to find some undeveloped locations left in sanish, so nice job. thank you, guys.
lynn peterson -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
we're pleased with the transaction. thank you, david.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question comes from chris dendrinos with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
chris dendrinos -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
hi, yeah. thank you. i guess just kind of following up here on the deferral, i guess, of the shareholder returns. can you kind of comment how much the consideration for additional m&a or acquisitions plays into kind of that decision or that thought process.
obviously, the recent williston acquisition was, in our view, very accretive and extended that inventory life. so i guess with that in mind, what's the appetite for additional m&a? and how does that play into the shareholder return thought process?
lynn peterson -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. i think we've treated our m&a process very much like we're looking at a return of capital. we're trying to be patient. we're trying to think through these things.
we want to build something here to have long-term sustainability here. so yes, i think there's some more things to do up there. at the same time, we're very aware of our shareholders and we do want to return capital, but we want to try to do it the right way. so again, i think we're just talking patience here a little bit.
i know everybody wants everything yesterday. and i think when we reflected back and when we think about emerging from bankruptcy in less than a year ago, we thought maybe we ought to just give this a little more time and see what commodity prices do and how this plays out. so we're thinking about all those things, and we're certainly trying to build something bigger than what we have here today.
chris dendrinos -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. thank you. then i guess just pivoting over to some operational stuff. i think previously, you mentioned the opportunity to drill a three-mile lateral.
can you just provide an update on when you expect to move forward with that and then the opportunity for, i guess, additional ultra-long lateral development?
lynn peterson -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
yes. i'll ask chip maybe if you don't mind.
chip rimer -- chief operating officer
yes. what we typically see, chris, on our -- we go over to three miles, especially in sanish, we'll see 40%, 45%, 50% increase in rate of returns. and so we've got to repermit some things because of the acreage we picked up, but we will definitely be doing something in 2022. we have it planned.
we'll be looking also up in our cassandra area to be doing some of that and increase that value also. so it's an ongoing process. we continue to look -- we can manage our business, improve our returns on our capital.
chris dendrinos -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
lynn peterson -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thank you, chris.

lynn peterson -- chairman, president, and chief executive officer
thanks, brandon. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. you can refer to our 10-q we filed yesterday and our news release for detailed information. to start with, i would like to commend our team for its continuing efforts to execute on the plan that we set out back in december.
as our first half of 2021 results demonstrate, we have proven our ability to optimize our asset base and take advantage of a dramatically different economic landscape. we are clearly in a great position with current commodity prices, solid assets, an enviable balance sheet, and a talented team. the impact of these strengths is evident in our financial results, as well as the updated guidance that i'll discuss shortly. when we combine our strong first-half results with our expectations for the second half, assuming crude oil price of $60 per barrel, we now expect whiting to generate approximately $700 million in ebitdax and over $425 million in free cash flow in 2021, which is over a 20% free cash flow yield at our current equity price.
looking at our financial results for the second quarter of 2021, we had a net loss on a gaap basis of $62 million or $1.57 per share during the quarter as compared to a loss of $1 million or $0.02 per share for the previous quarter. adjusting for certain items, but primarily the mark-to-market of hedging instruments, we had adjusted net income of $118 million or $3.01 per share, compared to $108 million or $2.79 per share for the previous quarter. notably, ebitdax was $176 million, compared to $170 million in the previous quarter due to slightly higher production and commodity prices. our production for the quarter averaged 92,600 barrels of oil equivalent, of which 58% was crude oil.
this compares to first-quarter production of 89,900 barrels of oil equivalent. our oil production has remained relatively flat quarter over quarter at approximately 53,000 barrels per day. the slightly higher boes are attributable to an increase in ethane recoveries from our third-party midstream providers with the continuation predicated on supporting ethane fundamentals. as such, we have adjusted both our oil and boe production forecast for the year to be above the previously guided ranges.
we now expect our oil to average 50,000 to 53,000 barrels per day and total production to be 88,000 to 92,000 boe per day. the increase also takes into consideration a slight decrease in fourth-quarter boes as a result of the transactions we recently announced. on the capex side, we spent $58 million during the second quarter to bring nine gross/5.4 net wells on production. and we drilled nine gross/5.6 operated wells.
we ended the quarter with 21 gross/15.3 drilled uncompleted wells, and we anticipate exiting the current year with around 30 drilled uncompleted wells. the company currently has a rig running in the sanish field and intends to bring a second rig into our cassandra prospect area later this year. our completion crew was dropped in may, as expected, and we brought them back in the end of july. we plan to keep the completion crew active for most of the remainder of the year, with a short break in the fourth quarter.
we expect to bring the crew back in december, which should help smooth out our 2022 production profile. as a result, we've tightened our guidance range of capex to $240 million to $252 million for the full year, putting it at the high end of our previous estimates. we, like all operators, are seeing some cost increases as oil remains at its current level, and we have tried to adjust our numbers to reflect our expected outcome. at the same time, our team continues to drive efficiency, which to date have more than offset the cost increases.
lease operating expenses were $64 million or $7.61 per boe for the second quarter of 2021. we're seeing faster turnaround on maintenance workover days due to better weather and more efficient processes. the benefit of this activity is shown in our production, so we'll continue to keep these workover rigs at work as these barrels are our most effective and cheapest barrels to bring online. again, we've tightened the range of guidance for loe to $235 million to $245 million or roughly $7.30 per boe, putting it at the high end of our previous estimate.
general and administrative expenses of $12 million was modestly higher quarter over quarter as work life continues to transition back to normal. overall, we continue to run less than our expectations, so we brought our guidance for g&a below the low end of the previous range. a big thanks goes to the team for holding these costs down. lastly, oil differentials in the second quarter were narrower than the lower end of our guidance range, driven largely by the district court's decision to deny the motion for injunction on dapl operations, along with a subsequent dismissal of this case.
with the risk of transportation interruptions inherently stabilized, coupled with the overall basin production levels that remain significantly behind takeaway capacity, oil spot differentials have benefited as a result. pipeline utilization has started trending downward from the beginning of the year, and we've seen an increase on rail movements likely reflecting alternative marketing arrangements put in place prior to the dapl ruling. recent pipeline capacity additions placed into service in july and august have also bolstered the continued improvement of oil differentials, and as such, we've revised our full-year projections to reflect this. overall, when we look back at the guidance provided back in december of 2020, we are pleased to see our progress and our ability to stay within the cost structure and still improve productivity.
if you think back to that time, we had $40 oil and a possible dapl shutdown, so there are many variables going into our planning models. now turning to recent business development activities. as previously announced, whiting entered into two separate agreements to divest its redtail assets in weld county, colorado, and purchase assets in mountrail county, north dakota, allowing for a more focused asset portfolio. net oil production to come from these two transactions is nearly identical, so the net effect was a little impact to our oil guidance.
the colorado assets had a higher daily boe, but the oil cut was significantly below the assets we picked up in north dakota. the redtail assets have not received capital for several years, and there were no plans to add activity, so it made sense to monetize that asset. the assets acquired in the williston basin overlap our sanish field and expand our top-tier inventory by over 60 locations. it also included five drilled uncompleted wells.
sanish was one of the early fields developed in the williston basin and was drilled with wellbore azimuth that is not common to today's development standards. this early development resulted in shorter laterals and stranded tracks of land when offset dsus were operated by different companies. the acquired assets will allow us to maximize lateral length across several dsus, allow us to develop stranded resources, and eliminate costs for frac protect as acreage is developed. we were fortunate that both of these transactions came together in a timely manner, allowing for an attractive trade with little incremental cash consideration.
thanks and congrats to our team and the counterparties on both deals for getting the agreements in place. we look forward to closing both transactions in mid-september. our debt levels continue to drop quickly, and in spite of the two transactions noted above where we anticipate drawing something close to $90 million on our revolver, we still anticipate being in a positive cash position at year-end with nothing drawn on our revolver. turning to esg.
we are committed to reducing our emissions and improving transparency on how we measure and report. we are working with trade groups like axpc and api on reporting comparability while honoring sustainability frameworks like sasb. we are also working with an established third-party to measure and document our emissions. we have stepped up efforts to coordinate discussions between our facility engineering teams and our midstream partners to identify, plan and resolve gas capture limitations for future development.
narrowing our focus to just the s or social part of esg, i want to compliment our staff for personally contributing money and then assembling school backpacks with supplies for the precious child and their fill a backpack drive for underprivileged students in the denver area. this type of efforts demonstrate the impact our company has on the communities in which we live. finally, let me address our plans for capital allocation. with the results that we expect and the generation of significant free cash flow, we are in an enviable position financially.
we have had ongoing discussions internally and with our large investors over potential uses of our liquidity. at this point in time, we continue to evaluate options that balance the desire to return capital to shareholders while at the same time expanding and improving our inventory. our opinion on this decision will continue to evolve as economic and opportunity landscape dictate. but having only completed the bankruptcy process less than a year ago, we have decided to temporarily defer any decisions on returning capital.
we want the return of capital decisions to be sustainable for future periods under a range of economic conditions. with that, i will open this up for questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question will come from william howell of stifel. please go ahead.
william howell -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good morning guys and congrats on the quarter. my question is around how you see the m&a market right now, if you could talk about that a little bit. are you willing to look outside the williston? and if so, any preference among basin?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
good morning, william. thank you for calling in. we continue to look at a lot of opportunities. we've been -- remain focused in the williston basin.
we think that's where our expertise is. i think during a period of rising volatility and commodity prices, some of these acquisitions are a challenge. so i think if we remain patient here, i think things will come to us. i mean, we're delighted to get our acquisition done here in the third quarter.
we're looking at some smaller things right now, looking at some large things as well. so opportunistic and we're actually, we're anxious to see what unfolds during the next few months. so stay tuned i guess is what i'd say.
william howell -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thanks. my other question is around oilfield servicing cost inflation. if you could talk a little bit about the extent to which you're seeing that? and maybe how much of that you might be able to offset with efficiency improvements?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'll start and i'll turn it over to chip here a little bit. obviously, steel prices have been the one that's really ratcheted up for us. we think labor issues are something that we're certainly concerned about. but chip, maybe you can give your thoughts on what we're seeing in the field.
chip rimer -- chief operating officer
yeah. thanks, lynn. yeah, i think we're in pretty good shape with supply chain. our guys have really worked really hard to locking contracts and services and find those supplies like casing, tube to billers.
we've had additional stuff like pumping units we bought this year that carried into last year. but i think the big thing is our partnership. lynn and i both believe in having partnerships as providers and using those partnerships to make sure we have access to all the commodities, all the things that we need going forward. so along with that, you then have less nonproductive time typically when you have partnerships and you can build in efficiency.
so we'll continue to look at efficiencies, continue to try to reduce the cycle time to create capital efficiency.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah. again, we don't know what we threw out that high single digit, low double digit. we've built some inflation into the end of '21. and so i think we're in a pretty reasonable session here.
william howell -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. thanks guys, and congrats, again, on the quarter.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
all right. appreciate. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from bertrand donnes of truist. please go ahead.
bertrand donnes -- truist securities -- analyst
all right. good morning, lynn and jimmy. great, great news on the shareholder initiatives. the obvious question is which bucket you guys are going to focus more on.
we've seen some other peers try to push shareholder -- share repurchases a little too hard and it's not working and now they're kind of breaking back toward a variable dividend. just where do you guys fall?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah. and i applaud our board for taking a very balanced approach to this. i mean, we've obviously taken a little bit of time trying to get to where we want to be. i think i'm going to still push off to the first quarter.
we are looking at some type of fixed dividend possibly, some -- the buybacks. i think a lot of us share your opinion there, but i think we're also looking at continued investment in our business here because i think in so many ways, that's the best return we can get to our shareholders. so everything is still being discussed. again, we feel like we're approaching that point where we need to do something.
and so we'll lay that out as we get into the first quarter of 2022.
bertrand donnes -- truist securities -- analyst
that makes sense. and then just for the follow-up, not to beat a dead horse, but on the m&a front, are you only looking at a transformational deal? or is there maybe the possibility that you line up two or three small deals in a row and that will still accomplish what you're looking for?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
again, we're kind of looking at everything. clearly, we've done some of the bolt-on things. the last one we did here in the third quarter, it was not transformational, but it was very good to have an inventory to us in our area that we think we understand very well. so we're looking at everything and whatever we think creates the best value for our shareholders, we will try to pursue.
bertrand donnes -- truist securities -- analyst
that's fine. and then this one is really just a housekeeping. you didn't explicitly update the guidance. i mean you just did it.
i wasn't sure if we should -- you're just waiting for the end of the year to update full year '22 or if we should read into something with no official update?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
i think we're in pretty good shape. jimmy, do you want to kind of walk through. i mean, we think we're going to be at the high end to some, low end of others and maybe just kind of walk through it.
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
no, that's right. you took the words out of my mouth. bertrand, but really give you guys credit that you can kind of trend -- see where the trend is going for the last quarter of the year and that we're trending toward kind of the high end on our production measures and lower end on days. and so kind of everything going in the right direction.
we just didn't feel like we needed to slightly adjust anything and let you guys do your work and get -- i think we'll get to the right point, but looks pretty good for the year. we're really happy about where we're at through three quarters and really kudos to the team throughout the company and being able to predict the outcome for the year and be in a position where we can slightly increase it as we've gone through the year and have very predictable results. that's where we want to be.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
i want to ankle that what jimmy said. i mean the team has done an excellent job. we came together about a year ago, a little over a year ago. uncertainties in the environment we were dealing with, the commodity environment and to put out numbers and be able to meet these for the last three quarters spot on.
i feel very good about the team and congratulate them on their efforts.
bertrand donnes -- truist securities -- analyst
well, i know it's been said before, but what a year can make. so i appreciate your concept.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
that's a fact. thank you. appreciate it.

lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
thank you, brandon and let's go ahead and get started this morning. good morning and thanks for everybody joining us. i believe you have all thoroughly read and enjoyed our 10-q we filed last evening as well as our news release and reconciliations to non-gaap measures and you can refer to them for detailed information. over the past year, the macroenvironment has changed dramatically.
however, we have remained disciplined in our approach and continue to execute on our plan. we find ourselves in an enviable financial position, whereby we expect to have no debt and be cash positive before the end of 2021. we're working through the 2022 capital plans now and i'll give some high-level thoughts after briefly discussing some of the quarterly financial numbers. starting with our financial results for the third quarter of 2021, we had net income, on a gaap basis, of $198 million or $5 per diluted share during the quarter as compared to a loss of $61 million or $1.57 per share for the previous quarter.
adjusting for certain items, primarily the mark-to-market of hedging instruments and the gain on sale properties in the previously announced divestiture, we had adjusted net income of $142 million or $3.57 per diluted share as compared to $118 million or $3.01 per share for the previous quarter. adjusted ebitdax was $201 million compared to $176 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to better commodity prices. our company's production on a barrels of oil equivalent remained relatively flat quarter over quarter, averaging 92,100 boe compared to second quarter production of 92,600 boe. oil production for the third quarter averaged 51,800 barrels of oil, which was down from the second quarter of 53.4 million barrels of oil -- 53,400 barrels of oil.
most of the wells turned in line during the quarter were in our sanish field, which typically come on with lower initial production rates, but experienced a shallow overall decline, particularly in the first year. additionally, some of our third-party midstream providers have continued to increase ethane recoveries as illustrated by our ngl yield for the quarter. oil differentials have continued to narrow given an overall basin production level that remains significantly behind total takeaway capacity of which increased during the quarter as expansion capacity was placed into service. on an activity basis, our oil differential was similar to what we realized in the second quarter.
however, revisions primarily from third-party providers recognized in the third quarter resulted in a wider differential reflected in our financials. we expect our full year oil differentials to land within the low end of our stated guidance. additionally, with the majority of our g&p agreements structured on a fixed fee, we've seen a more pronounced benefit to our net realized price from the increase in both residue gas and purity product benchmark prices. the company invested capex of $67 million during the third quarter to bring 17 gross 9.1 net wells on to production and we drilled 10 gross 5.6 net operated wells.
we ended the quarter with 25 gross 14.3 net drilled uncompleted wells. the company currently has a rig running in the sanish field and a second rig in our cassandra area, that commenced drilling operations at the end of september. we have just released a completion crew this week and we expect them to return in mid-december. lease operating expenses were $57 million or $6.68 per boe for the third quarter of 2021.
loe benefited from less operating expense workovers during the quarter. general and administrative expenses of $12 million or $1.41 per boe was similar quarter over quarter. in september, we completed the previously announced acquisition of assets in north dakota and divested our redtail assets located in colorado. the assets in the williston basin overlap our sanish field and expand our inventory by over 60 gross locations.
the acquisition also included five drilled uncompleted wells. the acquired assets will allow us to maximize lateral length across several dsus, allow us to develop stranded resources and eliminate costs for frac protect as acreage is developed. we plan to issue our 2020 sustainability report later this quarter. i'm pleased with the progress the company has made and how we continue to improve on the goals we've set for the safety of our employees, the environmental controls for our operations and the ongoing governance improvements.
gas capture remains to be an area of focus for the company and we continue to make improvements in that area. i would now like to spend a little time thinking about 2022. we expect the company's reinvestment rate in 2022 to be similar to what we saw here in 2021 where we will have invested roughly 35% of our ebitda. let me highlight a few items that we think will impact our 2022 outlook.
first, we are budgeting for some additional activity in '22, both from an operating standpoint, as shown from our second drilling rig that we brought in during september, but also non-operated properties and we've seen our peers increase activity during the year. 2021 has been somewhat of an anomaly for us and that the company shut down operations during its restructuring in '20 and therefore, '21 has been a rebuilding year. our corporate decline rate increased during '21 as we brought on new wells and therefore, we will need some additional activity level to replace that production. second, we do believe we will be dealing with some inflationary costs and we are estimating this to be in a range of high single-digit to low double-digit percentages.
to address price inflation, the team has been aggressively securing contracts and lining up equipment through the first half of '22. we are hoping to see some relief with supply chain issues and perhaps some rollover with steel prices in the back half of '22. and finally, we have some infrastructure to build out next year, particularly in the sanish field for new well connections and to alleviate flaring and/or curtailment of production. some of these costs were deferred in '21 due to the lower commodity price environment at the beginning of the year.
most importantly, the company is in a desirable financial position as we exit 2021 and move into 2022. many of the derivatives that were linked to much lower prices rolled off during 2021 and we now have a much more attractive hedge portfolio and commodity prices continue to benefit the bottom line, increasing our free cash flow. with the free cash flow we expect to generate from operations, we will continue to pursue acquisitions which enhance whiting's competitive position in the williston basin including bolt-on opportunities that create synergies with whiting's existing asset base. while we continue to believe that we will have attractive opportunities to create value through investments in our operations, management and the board also understands important to returning capital to shareholders.
now that we have the company in a solid financial position, we expect to initiate a return of capital to shareholders in some form commencing in the first quarter of 2022 at a level that is competitive with our peers. with that, i will turn it back to the operator and any q&a we might have.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from leo mariani with keybanc. please go ahead.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
you there, leo?
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yes. hello. sorry. so look, whiting obviously had strong production here in the fourth quarter came in, above guide.
i was hoping you could maybe provide a little color around what drove the good fourth quarter here on production.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
i think we continue to see good performance from our wells. i'll let chip jump in here as well. but the team is trying some different things on completion. i think we're seeing some benefits to this.
chip?
chip rimer -- chief operating officer
yes. appreciate it, lynn. yes, especially in our sanish field, our lacey, littlefield areas, we've seen -- going in there. we're doing some rifting right next to the wells that we are stimulating the new ones, and we're starting to see some impact.
and so, we're seeing wedge production higher than we -- our original curves and also our base production is staying up there.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and i guess just in terms of maybe some of those new simulations, are you all planning on kind of receiving a lot of that here. i assume in 2022, is this pretty broadly applicable across the entire basin? is it more just in sanish? what can you kind of tell us about that?
chip rimer -- chief operating officer
yes, leo, it's a little early to say. we're seeing that impact. i'd like to wait for a quarter or two, but we're pleased with what we've seen so far, and we'll see where it goes from here.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. maybe can you just talk about the m&a environment a little bit. obviously, you guys have done a few smaller deals over the past several months, which -- in your wheelhouse, are you seeing other type of bolt-on opportunities out there or perhaps maybe there's some bigger deals that you're eyeing here in the bakken?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yes, leo. clearly, we're watching everything looking at many things possible. i think you also -- we got a backdrop of pretty aggressive rise in commodity prices. and i think it's made it a bit challenging.
people are enjoying their cash flow, they're seeing off these properties. so we also want to make sure we don't buy on the high end here and watch oil drop over time. so we're being cautious, but we're looking at everything we can.
leo mariani -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks, guys.

our next question comes from neal dingmann with truist. please go ahead.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
good morning, all. first question on dips, kind of two for here. just wondering, could you talk about how you're thinking about -- maybe for, jimmy, first, just speak to the delta on the spot dips this year versus '21. are you still guiding to that through $3 or $4 off versus, i think, it was about $4 in '21.
i think you've mentioned more exposure to spot this year and i think spot is now in a pretty good place. so i'm just wondering on that. and to tuck into that, i know there was some dapl news. i don't doubt that has any impact near term, but i'm just also wondering how you're thinking about this dapl moves down the line on the debt.
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks, neal. i'll start, and i'll turn it over to jo ann to correct anything that i say wrong. but look at '21 over -- compared to '22, i mean if you remember, '21, we started off the year with concerns about dapl and we're kind of affected, this is going into the year and the guidance that we gave was trying to take that into consideration, and it certainly got better as we move through the year as things kind of normalize and production levels stayed relatively consistent and within the total transportation capacity.
and jo ann, maybe, i'll let you talk a little bit more about the -- what you see on the america side, as well as dapl.
jo ann stockton -- vice president, commercial
sure. yes. and just a little bit more detail on 2021. i mean, we had a mixture of various term length deals, utilizing firm transportation on alternative pipeline, along with supply commitments into rail markets and really, it was strategically aligned with our crude gathering service provider system connectivity to specifically protect our larger producing areas.
and if you think about how that case unfolded and the timing, we really did layer in from q4 of '20, all through up until right in front of the may decision. and so, from there, moving forward into 2022, most of the deals that acted as a physical hedge against an uncertain dapl outcome has rolled off and what remains is a combination of term into various markets with more of a concentration on spot volume relative to last year is what we've indicated. and so, with the recent decision of the u.s. supreme court denying dakota access petition to appeal the lower court decision, basically reaffirming that the eis will stand.
and so, we shift ahead and expect a draft version of that here in the next few weeks with the official timing still protects -- project, excuse me, for september. but we're actually wondering if that timing will slip because you take into account how contentious this issue is and the expectation that the numerous comments that will be filed, will need to be addressed and taken into consideration before the eis is finalized, we can easily see it slipping out past that date. at the end of the day, if you're thinking where we stand on the balance of this year, we look at it as the army core engineers have the opportunity to go down a different road than they chose not to. and as we factor in the macro-outlook, especially in light of the most recent news, along with an existing pipeline with continuous operations, we're cautiously optimistic on a favorable outcome.
and if anything, that guided range that we gave me, maybe we could see some slight improvement to that.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
we should have given our proper introduction. jo ann stockton is our vice president of commercial here for whiting.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks for the details. and then, just one follow-up. maybe jimmy, for you, you guys have had some outstanding return of capital that -- to me, then appears the market is fully appreciated. i'm just wondering could you speak to potential additional return of capital that you are seeing for yearly?
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
well, we announced the dividend earlier this quarter, and that's the first step. and i think it's pretty obvious when you look at our cash flow -- free cash flow generation, there's more to come. i think we spoke to that quite a bit in the prepared script. as we've talked about consistently over the last year.
it was -- it's always been our intent to do this very methodically and thoughtfully and goes one step at a time. so we've done that. we've paid down our debt to 0. we've been able to do an acquisition, which we'll pay off very quickly.
now, we've announced the dividend, and there's more to come on that front. we've been very consistent in laying out with our shareholders.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
very good. thank you, all. look forward to it.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
you bet, neal. just to reiterate, our board is completely aligned with us on this. we just really wanted to do it one step at a time, as jimmy said there. so it's all good.
neal dingmann -- truist securities -- analyst
yes. that makes the most sense. i'm glad you're sort of walking before running on this. it makes a lot of sense.
thanks. thanks, lynn.
operator
our next question comes from michael scialla with stifel. please go ahead.
michael scialla -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
good morning, everybody. maybe just staying on that last topic in terms of return of capital. when you said you're having a lot of conversations with the board, everybody is aligned. i don't want you to try and front run what the board might decide is the best avenue, but i guess, in looking at share buybacks, just how do you think about that from a high level versus where your stock is today and the opportunity to continue to do these bolt-on acquisitions.
how do you view the opportunity set there?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah. good morning, mike. good to hear you. i think stock buybacks is probably going to be our next step here.
we've talked long and hard about it. clearly, after we put our last announcement out, i wish i had it in place so, i mean, it would have worked out pretty well. so we just -- we see a lot of noise in the investment world today. and we talked to our shareholders, both long only and value and everybody.
we get a different message for everybody. some people want us to reinvest in properties. some want us to pay dividends, some want us to buy our stock back. so we're looking at all of these things.
and again, we just laid out the fixed dividend as our starting point here. i think the next step would clearly be a stock buyback announcement. and then, i think you're seeing more of the variable dividends. i still -- i think we've got more work to do on that one.
but i think all these make sense in conjunction with you're seeing the free cash flow that we're generating here. i mean, you've seen companies pay back 40%, 50%, 60% in some cases. if we can get into that range, i think we'll be very competitive with our peers out there. so i'm excited what we got to go ahead.
i mean, again, people want it today. they don't want to wait. i get it. but at the same time, i think i have a lot of respect for position our  take on this, and we're excited to lay out as we go through the year.
michael scialla -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's helpful. sounds good. and i know you've steered clear of quarterly guidance in the past, but i just wanted to see if you could give us any sense, maybe from a high level, the expected completion cadence through the year. should we just anticipate kind of flat production throughout the year? or is there going to be any variability given the cadence of completions.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
well, again, that was kind of the purpose of the comments here. i think you're going to see a kind of a slow first half of the year with really ratcheting up as we exit the year. and a lot of -- due to the comment i made earlier about the five well pad that we've been delayed on a little bit. so i think that was kind of the disappointment when we put out our news that people didn't see the production overall, and it was just moderated a little bit by this pause or slowness on our five well pad.
i think as we exit out the year, the numbers get pretty significant. do you have anything you want to add too?
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
yes. no, you're exactly right. so our telecom is a little bit light on the first half, and we're pretty strong in the back half of the year. you'll see that in the back half of the year on production.
michael scialla -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thank you, guys.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, mike.
operator
our next question comes from scott hanold with rbc. please go ahead.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning, all. lynn, i don't want to beat a dead horse, but i feel like i'm going to here. on dividends versus stock buybacks, you obviously made a lot of compelling cases that buybacks make a lot of sense and they do provide a lot of flexibility, i guess, to a certain extent.
and maybe at a high level, it would be helpful if you could just give us a sense. i know it sounds like buybacks are an option you're looking at, and it sounds like the next step, but why not that be the first step? like what was the decision to go with the dividend before the buyback?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
well, scott, i wish you could be at all these investor calls we have because, like i said, some guys don't want any dividends, others want every $0.01 of free cash flow. so these are hard decisions to make. and again, a lot of comments were, investors want the cash in their pocket, they can reinvest in the stock if they want to. if they want to reinvest in something else, they can, stock buybacks.
and maybe we should have combined it. i'm not saying we did exactly right here. we probably should announce the combination of the buyback and a fixed dividend, looking back now. but again, we're going to get there quickly.
so i'm not too concerned, we just thought we'd do the fixed dividend first and then follow it up with the stock repurchase.
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
yes. and probably just to add. just kind of the process of getting a dividend, we're going to announce it so we can kind of get that -- get the record date set and get started paying actual cash.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and then how do you contemplate usage -- when you think about usage of the free cash flow -- and look, i think it's -- you guys got a good runway of inventory for at least five years and maybe a little bit longer. but obviously, when you think about the durability and sustainability of the free cash flow generation, i think, generally, investors would like to see it somewhere in that decade plus if they can. and so, obviously, it feels like that potentially some of that free cash flow could be earmarked for various types of consolidation. but like can you give us a sense of like as you look at that free cash flow wall that you're seeing, how much of that dry powder do you think make sense to keep in your hands for opportunities if they pick up?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
it's a good question. and i think the size of the company matters in this regard. i mean, i share your comment on our inventory. i think we're fine, but we're not where we want to be.
i think that was really what drove us in '21 to pay down our revolver. i mean, -- and again, i got to -- you've got to remember, we started the year at $35, $40 wti, and we were in a totally different world where we ended up at $80 at the end of the year. so things have changed dramatically here. but -- we are constantly looking to see if we can find properties that compete against our current properties.
and we want to have some dry powder to execute on those. and i don't know what the right number is. again, you see companies' kind of 40%, 50%. i know there's a few out of 60% of free cash flow in total between fixed stock buybacks and variable dividends.
so i think, ultimately, that still allows us to pursue these acquisitions when we find them and keep our balance sheet strong. i mean, we're trying to do a lot of things here and we're fortunate to have a really strong balance sheet right now. we want to protect that, but we do want to grow the company at the same time.
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
yes. also, remember, scott, that we have an untapped revolver of $750 million of capacity on it. so it's not a matter of porting cash to save our pennies for a deal. we got a lot liquidity that we can tap to these things.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
would you be willing to use equity to do some of that that made sense? or is that a nonstarter discussion?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
no. i think we've used it in the past, and i don't have a problem with all with us now. if we think our stock inside at a reasonable number. i mean, again, you got to just evaluate the time you are in and where you think your stock is.
right now, we use cash versus our stock because we think our stock is -- it's below what we think we're worth. so we would tend to use more of the cash position.
scott hanold -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
understood. thank you.

your next question comes from david deckelbaum with cowen. please go ahead.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
good morning, lynn, jimmy. thanks for squeezing me in here.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
hey, david. how are you doing?
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
doing well. congrats on the operations update. you pointed out the delays, i think, is a five well pad, which i believe was in the cassandra area. for context, as we move forward here, particularly with the higher working interest in sanish, how long should we be thinking about those two rigs staying in that sanish area? or are there going to be more of these sorts of longer lateral developments that get sprinkled into the program?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
maybe i'll let chip take the first shot at that, if you don't mind.
chip rimer -- chief operating officer
yes, will do. david, thanks for the question. yes. our program has about 65% of our program is in sanish, and then we move to the west, the hidden bench forming later in the year.
we're probably close to 35%, maybe a little bit more than that or three miles as we go along. so that will drive capital efficiency as we go and help to minimize some of the inflation impacts. and so, -- that's kind of what the program has us doing right now. we'll run back up into that cassandra area later this year and knock out that additional pad that was delayed.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
one of the things that matters a lot to us is all this esg conversation. i think as we look -- bringing these wells on, we want to make sure we have the takeaway that's required. we're not allowing trying to flare anything and done a great job working with our midstream partners. and so, some of this movement is dictated because of the commodity takeaway as well.
chip rimer -- chief operating officer
it was a mechanical issue up in the cassandra, not a systemic issue. so we'll get it back over there later in the year.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yep.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah. thanks, chip. and then, lynn, i know a lot has been asked around this, but like one, i think it just -- it seems like you've been pretty explicit that you think whiting is perfectly capable of paying a 50% rate of its free cash while still maintaining enough cash hoarding and flexibility to pursue m&a. so it seems like that's a reasonable target as investors compare you to some of your peers.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yes. i'm not going to let you put a percentage on me, david, but i think you see the numbers and you see -- i think we have a lot of flexibility here, and we can do the right thing, and we will do the right thing. we're excited about that. i mean, this is not a situation where we're trying to put cash on the balance sheet.
we want to return it to shareholders, and we want to do the right thing. but at the same time, we are looking for opportunities. yes, i think your numbers are very reasonable.
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
and then, i guess, in terms of how we should think about how that presents itself over the course of the year. did the conversation when the fixed dividend, i know we talked about the intention to start kind of small and build into this program. but how frequently is the return of capital program being reevaluated. and at some point, it sounds like we should get another update at least this year.
but is this something that occurs on like a three-month basis or it's just ad hoc?
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
yes, we probably talk monthly, weekly. i have a lot of -- we have a great board. we work together and i stay in communication, we all got thrown together here about 16 months ago, 18 months ago, and it's been a great, great opportunities to get to know each other and share ideas. so we talk a lot, and we've talked about all of this for the last several months.
so yes, you're going to see this evolve and you'll probably get evolve fairly quickly. i think it's really important to our shareholders. and we want to do the right thing. we've always had the intention doing the right thing.
and sometimes we have a different timeframe than other people, but that's fine. we're excited where we're headed. so...
david deckelbaum -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks for the messaging and the clarification, guys. good luck ahead.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
appreciate it, david. have a great day.
operator
ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. i'll turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
all right. thanks, again, sara. in closing, i want to thank our shareholders for your continued support. i can assure you that we're excited with our free cash flow projections for '22 and beyond.
we have listened to our shareholders and their comments on the emphasis on return on capital, as well as continue to participate in opportunistic acquisitions that build on our future. our board and our management are very much aligned in expanding our return on capital structure to our shareholders, and we will roll out this additional information soon. at the same time, i want to thank our staff for the continued dedication they have given to our company and shareholders. a special shout-out to our field staff that endures some very challenging weather conditions during the winter months each year.
their ability to maintain production and operations is not lost on me, and they deserve kudos above and beyond their daily routines. with that, i thank everybody for joining us this morning. feel free to give us a call if there's any other questions. thank you very much for your time.

operator
good morning. my name is sara, and i will be your conference facilitator today. welcome to whiting petroleum's fourth quarter 2021 conference call. the call will be limited to 45 minutes, including q&a.
[operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to brandon day, whiting's investor relations director.
brandon day -- investor relations manager
thank you, sara. good morning, everyone. this is brandon day, whiting's investor relations director. thank you for joining us to discuss whiting's fourth quarter results for the period ended december 31, 2021.
with me today is whiting's ceo, lynn peterson, and our cfo, jimmy henderson. also, available to answer questions during the q&a session will be our coo, chip rimer. please be advised that our remarks today, including answers to your questions, include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act. these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to be materially different from those currently anticipated.

following the prepared remarks, we'll open the call to your questions. i would like to remind everyone that a replay of this audio webcast will be available via the company's investor relations page on our website. i'd now like to turn the call over to the ceo of whiting petroleum, mr. lynn peterson. 
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
thank you, brandon. good morning, everyone. i appreciate you joining us for the call this morning. i want to keep all this in perspective in light of what's happening in the world stage.
above all else, we hope peace is restored as quickly as possible. you can refer to our 10-k we filed yesterday and our news release for detailed information, as well as reconciliations to non-gaap measures. 2021 was a strong year. we exited the year with some momentum and expect to see another good year in 2022.
we exceeded our guidance numbers. we paid off the balance of our revolver. we added inventory in our core areas, and we, most recently, took the first step toward a capital return plan by initiating our first-ever regular dividend. we're going to take a little different approach this morning from our previous calls, and i'm going to ask jimmy henderson, our cfo, to spend some time discussing our fourth quarter and full year results.
while we were assisted by a rising commodity price environment, our team did a great job executing our 2021 program, as well as the initiatives we set out at the beginning of the year. once jimmy concludes, i want to talk about our 2022 program, our return of capital approach for 2022 and to answer some questions that arose from our last news release. jimmy, i'm going to turn it over to you for the financial results.
jimmy henderson -- chief financial officer
all right. thanks, lynn. and i echo your thoughts on -- as our thoughts and prayers go out to ukrainian people on news that we're all watching here and hope that peace is resolved quickly. well, i hate to spot off a bunch of numbers.
i know you all read in our filings already. i do want to highlight a few things, a few results that are really striking. in the fourth quarter of 2021, we had net income on a gaap basis of $292 million or $7.34 per diluted share as compared to $198 million or $5 per share in the previous quarter. adjusting for certain items, but primarily the mark-to-market of our hedging transactions, we had adjusted net income of $168 million or $4.23 per diluted share in the fourth quarter as compared to $142 million or $3.57 per share for the previous quarter.
adjusted ebitdax was $226 million compared to $201 million in the previous quarter. the increase is primarily due to the better commodity prices and a slight uptick in our oil production quarter-over-quarter. our production on a barrels of oil equivalent basis remain relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, averaging 92,800 boe per day compared to a third quarter production of 92,100 boe per day. oil production for the fourth quarter averaged 52,900 barrels of oil per day, which is up slightly from 51,800 barrels of oil in the third quarter.
oil differentials were considerably higher in the fourth quarter as overall basin production levels remain well within total takeaway capacity. as we move into 2022, our term commitment levels have decreased, resulting in more exposure to spot value premiums that we're seeing now. our natural gas prices benefited in 2021 from a premium at our primary pricing point, the ventura point as compared to henry hub. and ngl prices continued to be strong in the fourth quarter at an average percentage of wti oil of around 37%.
just for context, this compares to less than 20% that we were experiencing in the same quarter last year. as noted last quarter, the majority of our gathering and processing agreements are structured as fixed fee contracts, and therefore, receive a more pronounced benefit to our net realized price at current residue gas and ngl benchmark pricing. the company invested capex of about $66 million during the fourth quarter to bring 16 gross, 12 net wells on to production and we drilled 17 gross, 10.4 net operated wells. we ended the quarter with 34 gross, 20.2 net drilled and uncompleted wells.
we currently have two rigs running and one completion crew. both of those drilling rigs are in the sanish field and our completion crews working in the cassandra area. lease operating expense was $62 million for -- or $7.31 per boe for the fourth quarter of '21. note that loe continues to be impacted by expensed workovers that we've talked about previously.
our cash g&a expenses were $12 million for the fourth quarter and for the year totaled about $39 million, averaging right around $1.16 per boe for 2021. we also disclosed our year-end proved reserves in our 10-k and our press release last night. we did see a dramatic increase year-over-year with the estimated total proved reserves totaling 326 million boes with a pre-tax pv10 value of $4.4 billion at year-end compared to 260 million boe and $1.2 billion at the year-end 2020. pricing under sec rules increased by approximately $27 per barrel to $66.56 per barrel at december 31, 2021, compared to december 31, 2020.
gas increased to $3.60 per mmbtu compared to $1.99 for the same two periods. obviously, these price changes were the biggest factor in the year-over-year changes, but we also added 20.3 million boe through the drill bit and 16 million boe with acquisitions, which more than offset the decrease from selling our colorado assets. lastly, i'll point out that our proved developed properties accounted for roughly 80% of our total proved reserves with approximately $3.6 billion in value. it's worth noting that this value is at sec pricing of around $67 per barrel of oil as compared to spot prices today.
with that, i'll turn this back over to lynn and talk a little bit about where we're headed in 2022.
lynn peterson -- chief executive officer
thanks, jimmy. there were a lot of numbers here. so i appreciate that. again, thanks to our entire team for their great efforts during the year.
divesting of our colorado properties, combined with adding meaningful inventory through our acquisition work, we'll pay great dividends in future years, and we should really start to see the benefits accruing at the end of 2022 and moving into 2023 with our development plan. the board and management understand the importance of returning capital to shareholders. we have had much engagement throughout the last year by our board, and we are excited to lay out our plans as we go through the year. as such, the board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share that will be paid beginning in march, which was only the first step of our capital return program.
our board wants to be very thoughtful and measured in developing a plan. to that end, we have had multiple discussions of stock buybacks and fixed and variable dividends. and i am completely comfortable in saying our board of directors is going in this direction, and we would expect to lay out additional information that would place the company in the fairway of what we are seeing from returning capital from our peers. when we look out over the next four years and consider a $70 price environment for wti crude, we see our company generating free cash flow in an amount approximately the same as our current market cap.
i know we live in a world of instant gratification. but again, i will state that our board of directors is aligned with our shareholders, and we will methodically develop and return a capital plan that should please our shareholders. and i want to shift and outline how we thought about our 2022 capital plan and production profile. looking ahead, we will have a slightly higher activity level, we will have larger working interest in the wells drilled and completed in our sanish field due to the acquisitions.
we anticipate an increased level of non-operated activity, and we have built in inflationary factors that we are currently experiencing and anticipate throughout the year. our supply chain team has done a great job of locking many of the big-ticket items for the first half of 2022. however, we are less protected in the back half of the year. we estimate the inflationary pressure to the program to be in the low double-digit percentages, but the high end of our guidance has contingency for higher inflation should that become an issue.
turning to our production profile. we have shifted some production from the first half of the year and into the second half due to the drilling and completion activities on a five well pad mentioned in our previous release. we had the rig down on the pad in january, and we'll be moving back in, in march. this delay, combined with our current activity in the sanish field, create somewhat of a hockey stick, moderating our overall '22 production but creating impressive growth as we exit the year and move into '23, which should benefit with a sharp increase in production.
in february, we announced the acquisition of non-operated assets in our sanish field. we negotiate these transactions in the fall of '21 in a lower price environment, and we believe they add significant shareholder value. we have been able to hedge production from these acquisitions at a much higher wti pricing. the acquired interest included wells currently on production, wells that have already been drilled and are awaiting completion in '22, as well as significant interest in wells scheduled on our '22 and '23 drilling programs.
this is a field that we understand very well, and i have a high confidence in the well economics, supporting our belief that these are highly accretive transactions with excellent risk-adjusted returns. we're starting '22 in an incredibly strong financial position, and i expect to have attractive cash flow from operations during the year. with our current hedges in place and using the $70 price for wti and $4 for gas, we model over $900 million in ebitda, resulting in over $500 million of adjusted free cash flow, which demonstrates that we can continue to grow our return to capital program while also continuing to pursue acquisition opportunities that will compete with our current profile. by investing in whiting, we think shareholders can really have it all.
and with that, i'll turn it back to sara.
