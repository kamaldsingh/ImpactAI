thank you, sir. we will now begin the question-and-answer session [operator instructions]. and the first question we have will come from austin wurschmidt of keybanc capital markets. please go ahead.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning everybody. so, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that supply or that pre-leasing is tracking below or at the mid-point of your expectations at this point. do you think supply is having a greater impact than you originally projected, and what markets are you seeing the most softness relative to your initial expectations?
william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
sure. and if you take jennifer's prepared remarks, we talked about at this moment current trending has us near or just slightly below the mid-point. with 5 to 10 weeks left in the leasing season, our projection models we are best-case scenarios that have us still performing above the mid-point. and we have worst-case scenarios that have us performing slightly below the mid-point. so, when we take the -- at this moment in time, the most recent trending we're just slightly below the mid-point in those projections. and so i would say, largely relatively on-track with expectation on leasing.
when you look at the markets, austin is a market we continue to focus on in terms of the impact of new supply. taking austin out of the equation, the other high-supply markets we talked about earlier in the year, we've continued to do well in, in san marcos and some of the others, and for the most regard leasing is on-track. we always talk about this time of year, it's the power of the ones and the twos. with 5 to 10 weeks left in the leasing season, the things that we're looking at as we close out that have the impact or that can be significant swing positive and negative or the late market demand in the next 5 to 10 weeks as compared to the historical trend. our execution on back-filling, late cancellations which you saw in our main numbers, our back-filling efforts there were significantly better than in years past and you saw about a 20% improvement from the historical diminishment in back-filling largely due to lams and next gen initiatives. also the no-show management and late-season leasing opportunities. and so as jennifer said, the guidance range is still in play, we have opportunities to still exceed the mid-point and to be slightly below the mid-point based upon those variables that i just went through.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
so, again just like markets you mentioned ut austin, i mean kennesaw state one i think you've mentioned in the past, texas state has come up in the past as well as tallahassee. any of those markets that have continued to see softness or that are under-performing a little at this point?
daniel b. perry -- chief financial officer
yes, kennesaw, we saw softness about 8 weeks ago and the team is actually done incredible there. we've had a very strong lease up finishing out through the last weeks, i've given up a little bit on rate but done very well there. also san marcos is tracking to not be a diminution on this year's lease-up in terms of its revenue growth. so overall, we've done very well --and tallahassee, as i mentioned, the team is just absolutely not cover off the ball in terms of our improvement in that market, and so in the new supply markets austin is the only one that we continue to track cautiously.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
appreciate that. and then just one more from me. i appreciate the early detail on the supply figures. just curious looking back what probability would you place on those numbers being kind of good final supply figures for 2020, and then can you point to some markets next year where you see the heaviest level of deliveries?
william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
yes, i got to tell you this is the positive headline of this call and that is the new supply dynamics moving into 2020. as william talked about in our range where we see a decrease of 24% to 28%, that 24% is based upon projects where there has actually been a shovel in the ground and they are under way for construction, and the 28% is the 1100 other potential beds that are planned, but not yet a shovel in the ground and we have to see whether or not they truly get under way to be delivered next year. and so, those numbers are fairly solid. and just about any way you slice and dice the data, it is a positive story in terms of the new supply in our portfolio. total new supply as a percent of enrollment of the portfolio is only a 1%, which is the lowest number and about six years. when you look at the impact of noi at our largest top 10 markets, it's down to 14% versus 18% this year. with only 5 of the top 10 markets having new supply. and so overall -- and again i would make the statement that and axiometrics number nationally, realpage-axiometrics is down 13% that decrease is in no way due to a lack of interest or desire to do development in the space. but rather it is the natural barriers to entry that exist in the markets that makes new development difficult and new supply difficult. and so, those numbers are very encouraging and also consistent with the trend that we have seen over the last 2 to 3 years. when you look at the markets where we see repeating supply in 2020 where it also occurred in 2019 those markets are champaign, austin, auburn and san marcos and we've done well in those markets. again, austin is one that we're watching this year and probably will continue to watch for the next couple of years, given the potential supply horizon there. champaign, which had been a challenging market a couple of years ago, this year has gone extremely well for us. we're already full and had significant revenue growth, one of our better ones about 6%. and so, we feel we're well positioned there and also with our current price point in the market compared to new supply. and so on the new supply front, overall, it is a very positive picture in the fundamentals moving into 2020 both nationally for the industry and specifically to our portfolio.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. i appreciate the thoughts. thanks, bill.
operator
next we have nick joseph of citi.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks. maybe just staying on same-store revenue. the maintain mid-point guidance assumes a deceleration in the back half of the year to 1.9%. is that 1.9% a good run rate in the first half of 2020 as well, given the expected 2.3% growth for academic year '19 '20 lease-up and the 40 basis point drag from the outsourcing of the online resident payment processing that you mentioned?
daniel b. perry -- chief financial officer
yes, nick, this is daniel. that's right. with the -- just from a optical standpoint, you'll see that impact of the portal fee elimination on revenue with an offsetting reduction in expenses about 40 bps on the revenue growth statistics and about 80 bps on the expense side, obviously as we talked about going into this year, the variable to the total revenues, is total same-store revenue growth can be other income. and what we're able to project there in terms of any growth that we might see in other income and whether that's a positive or negative contributor to overall revenue growth. we will give the guidance on that on our fourth quarter call, but in terms of rental revenue growth, we're taking 40 bps off of that too in the quarter would be mid-point if that's where we end up would be the right assumption.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then just on development. the auburn development now looks like delivering in the august versus july previously, will it open in time for school year and then is there any impact for opening a little bit later than expected on final numbers versus what you assumed in guidance initially?
william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
no, not at all and that's just candidly an administerial clean up in terms of when we actually expect revenue generation to occur. we have a handful of july move-ins, but you all should be modeling that property and it's 100% pre-leased, everything is gone great there, development is on-time, on-budget and fully leased, will stabilize in year-one as anticipated. but just from a modeling perspective revenue should begin consistent with the commencement of the academic year in august, so we just have a handful of july early move-ins.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
next we have alexander goldfarb of sandler o'neill.
alexander goldfarb -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
hey, good morning down there. just a few questions. first, on the pre-leasing bill, and you guys have talked about this in prior calls, based on various industry conferences, but overall the trends for this year in general were pretty favorable and i understand that the private companies have the benefit of being private. so they don't have fd because they don't have d. for you guys, you're still sort of within the range, you're touch below, but obviously it sounds a little bit different from the narrative that we've been hearing over the past few months. so maybe you can just provide a little bit more color, and maybe it's just perspective on sort of you guys running your portfolio at 96%-97% versus the private guys running 95% plus and maybe that's where the delta, but it does come as a little bit of a surprise that you guys are at a touch below the mid-point given the commentary to-date?
william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
yes. alex, i would say it's actually consistent from our commentary and that again we still have projections above the ranges and below the range and would say that right now based on this moment projection with 5 to 10 weeks left, we're just slightly below the mid-point. and you hit on exactly the case-in-point, as to what the differentiation is between us in the private company competitors and that we typically operate at an occupancy improvement over our competitive base between -- they are typically at 95% or slightly below and we're typically at 97% and slightly above. and so when you look at the positive tailwinds and the fundamentals that the sector does have at this moment in time, other folks have opportunity to start to close the gap between their own portfolios and our best-in-class portfolio from an occupancy perspective, where this year our growth driver is a little more limited and that the occupancy provides less upside for us and it's largely driven by the rate. and so, i don't think there is any change whatsoever in terms of the industry fundamentals and the positive messaging that you have heard at the past conferences and we have a good solid comp of the occupancy last fall, coming in at the 97% that we're working off of. it doesn't give us quite as much upside as some of the other private that are out there.
alexander goldfarb -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
okay. and then a question for dp, if you look at guidance and you look at where you guys have been trending you've been having a good year so far, it seems like internally you guys have been buttoning up all the issues, you were better at the drop-outs in the back-fills and yet it would seem like you're number should be toward the high-end. so, maybe you can just go through the variables, because obviously in your guidance originally you knew that the back half would be a little tougher, you knew that you have to wait for that berkeley deal to come, the timing of the jv or outright sales like those items haven't really changed. so, maybe you could just talk about what would prevent you from being toward the high-end based on where you are in that you already know how your pre-leasing is coming in and certainly your pre-leasing is not at the low-end, which again, suggests that it's pretty much on-track. so, what are the things that would prevent you from getting toward the high-end of earnings guidance?
daniel b. perry -- chief financial officer
sure, alex. let me go through that in two components. first, in terms of noi and then in terms of ffo overall. when you look at the first two quarters of the year we produced 4.3% same-store noi growth and our mid-point is 2.5%. so certainly i understand just trying to -- everybody trying to continue to get a better feel for how the second half of the year is expected to play out. our mid-point of rental revenue growth for the fall is 2.25%.
if you just think about normal inflationary expense growth of 3% that would get you down into a range of noi growth in the mid-to-low 1s that would combine with that to put you closer to your same-store noi growth mid-point. we talked a little bit about tough comps on the expense side. and i mean even though we're talking about 3% that's not necessarily significantly high operating expense growth, you still have to consider that we've been able to drive below that.
when you look at 2018 second half of the year, excluding repairs and maintenance, where you have incident response cost for hurricanes and things like that and property taxes, the expense growth was 1.7% . so, we had very low growth last year, we saw in the second half of last year a lot of the benefits of the energy efficiency initiatives that are helping us drive those savings in utilities. and so, you start to lap those deployments in the second half of this year and you start seeing less benefit from those.
so we only have about 30% of our property taxes in and settled at this point. it's hard for us to anticipate fully where that will all finish out. we're still holding our 4% or a little over 4% projection in property tax growth, but it is a variable that requires us to maintain a range there.
and then, we're just entering hurricane season and that is something we can't control. we don't know what we will have in terms of incident response cost there this year. last year was a very light year, and so if you know if we have anything on the heavy side of the equation that would lead to greater growth in repairs and maintenance. so that's where we get to maintaining that mid-twos. same-store noi growth target for the rest of the year.
and then in terms of overall ffo, we do still have a third-party fee deal to close, that's $1.8 million in fees for 2019 at uc berkeley. as you've heard us talk about there is a lawsuit between the city and the university with regards to the fees that they will have to pay as part of their environmental approval process. we want to see where that settles out. it could impact the timing of commencement of that project.
we think that they'll ultimately come to agreement, but we just don't know when that will occur. we didn't expect that project to start until q4. so there's still time for them to come to agreement. but again another variable in the ffo equation that makes us want to just continue to see things develop as we move through the third quarter
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
okay, thank you.
daniel b. perry -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
next we have samir khanal of evercore isi .
samir khanal -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning, guys. i guess in the past you've talked about the ongoing efforts to control operating expenses to asset management initiatives i guess, how much is left to do on that front as it relates to controllable expenses at this point?
daniel b. perry -- chief financial officer
i mean you know as we, as i just discussed. we deployed a lot of our led initiatives and also peak billing our usage reductions throughout the portfolio, last year. we are still continuing to deploy some of those this year, but a lot of that started in the second half of last year and so you're seeing it occur in the first half of this year, we'll get a little bit of help from it, but it starts to roll off as you get into the second half of this year.
we continue to explore opportunities on the multi-asset efficiencies that we've talked about, where we have multiple properties in a market and we look at strategies from a marketing standpoint, from a staffing standpoint, from a maintenance standpoint that will allow us to control expenses there. and then of course, we've talked about on the marketing side that we are really doubling up right now in terms of our traditional marketing efforts that would have driven our marketing expenses historically and a much bigger move into social and digital marketing.
and as we really start to get our process and our strategy oriented around that digital and social media marketing and we can eliminate more of the traditional marketing efforts that will allow some improvements over the growth levels that we're seeing right now in marketing,
and then of course, we are always scrubbing the portfolio for opportunities on national purchasing agreements, contracts with vendors that we can use our footprint to take advantage of, and other types of asset management initiatives . so we will continue to try to control expenses as much as we can and we always have the uncontrolled those of property taxes, but on some of the things that others have seen whether it'd be on payroll increases across the country, we -- our approach there has been able to -- a lot has allowed us to keep those expenses in check and we expect that to continue as well.
samir khanal -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, that's it from me guys. thank you.
daniel b. perry -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
next we have drew babin of baird.
drew babin -- baird. -- analyst
hey, good morning. quick question on -- question on a ut austin last year i think in the west campus market you saw some of the higher-end, more amenitized, better located product kind of generally lease up faster and your product out of the block those type of assets may be took a little longer to kind of fill in. is that what you are seeing once again this year? and is there anything you're doing? i think last year, some of the i think the castilian demand. i think it was kind of diverted out to the block or there was something to do with maybe strategically being done there. could you just talk a little more in depth about how that's coming together in austin?
william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
yes, and austin continues to be over the last 5 years and this year and looking into the next 2 to 3, one of the most prolific new supply markets in the country and that it is unique and austin at the city of austin, because there is such an overall housing affordability crisis, did the university overlay district, which is one of the few pedestrian sub-markets near a major university in america that is actually encouraging and eliminated the barriers to entry related to high-density development.
and so all of the development that you see taking place given the land cost and also construction pricing each year the new products tend to be the highest priced product price points in the market and you don't see this in all markets nationally. this is somewhat unique to austin.
you continue to see the new highest priced products lease first, and so we continued this year to see the new deliveries that are at the highest price point that are at a significant premium to our block texan, jefferson 26 properties or 26 west properties continue to lease first, and so that did continue this year as we look at new supply coming in, in the future there is absolutely going to come a point to where you have an over-built situation at the absolute highest price point in the market, which is some point you put some pricing diminution ability on some of the second, third generation, 2- to 3-year-old new supply, but that's probably going to occur in 2021, 2022.
we continue to have a good price point, the block property, for example, you can still lease there as low as $399 per accommodation. and so really our product positioning in that case-in-point, is to compete with the dried sub-market on riverside in offering accommodation in price points where students can still walk to class versus having to drive interstate 35.
but we do see the upper socio-economic properties continue to lease very quickly, but that is candidly where the invest -- the long-term investment risk is in the market is at that higher price point. and so, austin is a market that even with the new supply we always continue to do well from a year-over-year revenue growth perspective. this year continues to be a little tougher than usual. but overall, we like our product positioning and that with our strategy of build for the masses, not the classes, the longer-term installation that we have for new supply is the more affordable price point and the spread that does still exist with our products, especially in the apartment sector to the new apartment supply coming in. castilian and callaway house tend not to be as impacted by the new supply which off-campus has continued to be all new apartment supply, and so they operate somewhat independently of that and don't directly correlate to the apartment development
drew babin -- baird. -- analyst
okay, that's helpful and then just one more from me. the overhead related to the third party businesses. if you look at kind of what is cost year-to-date versus the full-year guidance, it looks like there is some uptick in the rest of the year. i know there is some expense or some payroll reimbursement dynamics in that number, is that back-end loaded where you're going to see those higher revenues and higher expenses in those segments? or are the third-party overhead costs increasing in the second half of the year?
daniel b. perry -- chief financial officer
yes drew, we did see a little bit of benefit in the second quarter relative to our expectations in terms of how that third-party expense trending has played out. we're reserving our expectations there as we continue to pursue third-party projects and a lot of those expenses are in that line-item. and so, just depending on the activity throughout the rest of the year and the cost associated with that whether not the savings that we've seen there will ultimately materialize or turn out to be a timing thing. we just are withholding expectations on that for the time being.
drew babin -- baird. -- analyst
okay, that's all from me. thank you.
operator
and next we have john pawlowski of green street advisors
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
thanks. bill or jennifer circling back to fall lease up being slightly below the mid-point, i guess everybody has got a different definition of slightly. so, are we talking 10 basis points? are we talking 50 basis points?
william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
yes. and again, i would say first of all we'll jennifer said we're trending near the mid-point, i would take near as above or below the mid-point. and when we talk slightly typically when we talk slightly we're talking 0 to 30 bps
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
okay. just so we get a sense for the breadth of strength or weakness, what -- how much of the portfolio is trending below the 1.5% low-end?
william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
you know, and this is where, what we always talk about. at the end of every lease up rather than focusing on particular properties, it really comes down to the execution of what we refer to as the onesies and twosies and we'll have our employee call every -- after every earnings call each quarter we do an employeewide call and the focus of tomorrow's call is the execution on the four variables that i talk about in terms of the execution back-filling of late cancellations and no-show management and that when you look at our leasing projections, you typically have more than half the portfolio, 80 properties where you have vacancies that exist with candidly in our projects is about 40 properties that have between 1 and 10 beds being vacant.
and when you're within 1 to 10 beds being vacant it really comes down to execution on your back-filling and no-show process, that can have a meaningful 30 to 40 basis point difference in terms of execution of filling in the places that you can. and so, really for us the key to performance in terms of finishing at the mid-point or above or below the mid-point is it looking at the 1 or 2 or 5 to 10 properties where you have double-digit vacancies that you hope to excel, but it's really in the execution at each and every asset of those ones and twos.
and so, that's the focus of the company and candidly, you know what -- and alex asked this question previously, where we have always out-performed our competition, the reason that we operate at that 150 to 200 basis points better than competitors and what ultimately makes the difference in our final numbers as it relates to whether we're slightly above or slightly below the mid-point is in the execution of those 80 to 90 properties where we can make those incremental differences where you have the best opportunity to do just one or two better versus just focusing on the properties where you have more significant diminishment to your original projections
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
no, i understand it's an execution game. again i'm talking the extreme, so at this point 10 weeks out how much of the portfolio is trending below the low-end, not, slightly below the mid-point, but below the 1.5% low-end?
william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
yes, we're not going to give that statistic in terms of property-by-property in terms of, again, it's a combination of the roll-up each and every year. you have a handful of properties, 5 to 10 to where you have somewhat what i would say is material diminishment to your mid-point projections that you have at the beginning of the year. and you also have 5 to 10 that significantly out-perform your mid-point projections. so it tends to be a fairly balanced pro and con to each of those categories.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
okay. one longer-term question for me. i guess what inning are we in, on the portfolio transformation and is the current school list pretty steady state or additional school exits on the horizon?
william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
i would say we're probably in the seventh inning stretch on the portfolio we refined. my favorite statistic and this really gets into -- what went daniel was talking about the operational efficiencies. i believe the portfolio today, while our growth over the company's history has been largely 65% acquisition and m&a because of our dispositions typically being properties that we bought in larger m&a portfolios that did not meet our investment criteria, 56% of the portfolio today consists of american campus program designed and developed communities. and so, it's a much higher quality base and we believe we can put all of our expertise into the design and the operations of properties, which then does translate into better operating costs, better capital cost and the like. when you look at the remaining portfolio, and as daniel talked about our capital needs in his script, our recycling of about $100 million to $150 million a year over the horizon of the next -- through 2023 and we look to funding out of disney. and then we have always said historically that we're looking at 2.5% to 3% of our portfolio on a long-term ongoing basis to continue to refine and you'll see that refinement continue.
certainly as you look at the evolution of market selection, we have more thoroughly defined over the last 3 to 5 years that our investment, we prefer to be in power-5 conference and carnegie r1 institutions. we still do have a handful of markets left, probably 5 to 7 where we had done m&a transactions where we ended up at schools that don't meet that criteria that over the long term. we would expect through our disposition to exit out of, and we would expect the large majority of our investment activity to take place in those more targeted power-5 conference and r1 institutions. and so again, i would say at this point in time, looking at the current portfolio middle of the seventh, maybe even top of the eighth in that regard, but that will be over time.
and as we get -- i think the greatest opportunity for the company going forward over the long term horizon of 3 to 10 years is when all of this global capital that has come into the space and is now in the new development stage in 3 years or so there's going to be a lot of good m&a acquisition opportunities for us that we intend to be positioned to continue to be the industry consolidator. and as we get back to expanding our portfolio beyond just our own development, then that's going to foster different recycling opportunities on the long- term based on those initiatives, so it's an ongoing process.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
again as a reminder, if you'd like to participant in today's q&a, [operator instructions] and the next question we have will come from shirley wu from bank of america . please go ahead.
shirley wu -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question. so for the 2q revenues came in higher than expected, with intensive acceleration of same-store revenues, which is slightly different than your usual deceleration from 1q to 2q, so how should we think about that contribution from the short-term lease back-filling and how should we expect that to flow into 3q as well?
william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
one of the initiatives that we've talked about as part of our next gen initiatives is having better corporate controls and oversight over what we refer to as current period leasing and then if you follow the company historically and the people that have always come in for investor tours and seen lams demonstration. lams was originally designed as a future period leasing season for the next academic year where we had all of our business intelligence and sophistication, and what next gen has done is has evolved lams into having a major impact and full purview into the current period leasing season, which is your december back-filling leases,your summer back-filling leases also something we refer to as a may-to-may initiative where you undertake 12-month leases commencing in may versus doing a stub summer period and then in august.
and so,as the company has advanced its next gen initiatives, this year you start to see improvement in both that december diminishment between q4 and q1, and you're seeing it again from q1 to q2, and so we would say that that is something that we have seen continued improvement as we continue to add sophistication, to our next gen systems and something we hope, over the next 2 to 3 years will continue derive benefit and you see some of those historical trends in seasonality that may be better.
now the one thing that we do always point out though and we started at this point out about 3, 4 years ago, a lot of the, the new development does tend to be in the on-campus ace transactions and residence hall style products. and so from a seasonality perspective as those on-campus assets tend to be more academic year, you may see a little bit of difference in the seasonality trend, but we're hoping to do better in terms of the year-over-year, quarter-to-quarter diminishment from each quarter to the sequential.
shirley wu -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great, that's good color. so, moving onto your marketing expense you mentioned that you're moving on to more social and digital method, could you give a little bit more color on what you're actually doing and maybe a little bit on the sports initiatives that you mentioned briefly in your prepared comments?
william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
yes. and this is something that for the when -- we survey very sophisticated demographic in terms of the 18- to 22-year-old student that is the power user of social media, digital media and technology. and so, there has certainly been an evolution in our marketing program over the years in terms of, you go back even 5 years ago, the largest expenses in our marketing programs were direct mailings and more traditional promotions on-campus. where today those efforts are very much facebook, instagram i'm not equipped to say all the ones that the -- our marketing team that is very much in touch and much younger than i am and understand these things, into our day-to-day interaction. where you see the duplication between traditional marketing efforts and social and digital media really goes as the year progresses.
and that when you look at our most likely target markets early in the leasing season, it's the students who are living on campus, it's the students who are in the market and when you develop your social media strategy, it's much easier to implement that and know where those students are and what their behaviors are through sophisticated social and digital -- social media and digital marketing tools that we have. as you get later in the leasing season and some of your target markets become students who are transfer students and first year incoming students that are not currently in the market. the social and digital media becomes a little bit more complex and that's where we tend to still fall back on some of the more traditional direct mailings, mailings to parents and also on-campus direct interaction promotional activities through the orientation programs and the like. and so that's where when danny refers to, we're still doing some of the double implementation, you tend to see that later in the leasing season having a little more of the cost impact versus the average.
the other area where we continue to see, and this goes hand-in-hand with our strategy of multi-asset markets is that once we build scale in a market, we have found that our most effective marketing activity are through the university athletic sports marketing programs and we also continue to refine those. and so those are the three components of the evolution of our marketing strategies, and the marketing spend and why you see a little bit of the uptick over last year's cost as we balance those initiatives out.
shirley wu -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right, thanks for the color guys .
operator
and it looks like we do have a question that will come from derek johnson of deutsche bank.
derek johnson -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, everyone. good morning. i'm sorry if i missed this, but can you just give an update on the targeted stabilized development yield. i see today, you're at 6.25% to 6.8% last year, in 2q. you guys were 6.25% at the low-end and 7%, so is the low-end safe here and any just update given all the info we've heard about rising costs and labor shortage and stuff like that? and i apologize if i missed this. thank you.
william w. talbot -- chief investment officer
hey, this is william talbot. as we stated in the prepared remarks, we do anticipate for the '19 deliveries to deliver within that stated range of 6.25% to 6.8%. they are already fully pre-leased at 96%, so yeah our targets are still very much in-line as we had previously stated.
william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
and i would comment this continues to be along with the new supply outlook that we talked about, which is very positive on this call. the real investment thesis for american campus in the sector today is the spread between current market cap rates being at the 4% to 4.25% for class-a pedestrian to the development yields of the 6.25% north that we're producing and you know it's amazing from our perspective there 15 years after going public, we have the widest spread we have ever had between our development investment opportunities and current market cap rates.

william c. bayless -- chief executive officer
thank you, ryan. good morning, and thank all of you for joining us to discuss our second quarter 2019 financial and operating results. as you saw in last night's release, it was another strong quarter for the company with 8% earnings-per-share growth over the same quarter prior year.
let me provide a high-level overview of what the team will cover today. our operational and financial results, slightly exceeded our internal expectations. with our same-store noi growth of 3.5% over the same quarter of the prior year. we're pleased with our core operating performance year-to-date and we remain focused on several important operational initiatives in front of us. including, executing through the important final stages of our fall lease up, administering our annual turn and make-ready process and ultimately in welcoming over 133,000 students, who will move into an owned or managed american campus community during the months of august and september. pre-leasing for fall continues to be on track within our stated guidance range. and we're especially pleased with the year-one stabilization of our 2019 development pipeline. also we will provide an initial outlook for the fall 2020 new supply, which is projected to decrease, both on a national level and within our own markets.
in addition, we continue to see a vibrant p3 environment fostering both ace and third-party development opportunities. we also see a significant continued global institutional investment interest, giving us a high degree of confidence in our ability to execute on the modest $100 million to $150 million we needed annually to fund our growth and execute on our highly creative development pipeline. while minimizing dilution to earnings.
with that, i'll turn it over to jennifer to get us started.
jennifer beese -- chief operating officer
thanks, bill. as bill mentioned, our second quarter 2019 same-store operational results slightly exceeded our budgeted noi for the quarter. as seen on page s5 of the supplemental, quarterly same-store property noi increased by 3.5% with strong revenue growth of 3.2%. we were pleased with the revenue results for the quarter, as we saw good summer leasing success at our apartment communities, as well as solid levels of summer camps and conferences at our res hall properties. same-store expenses for the quarter came in at 2.9% with double-digit growth in repairs and maintenance category, which was in-line with our expectations as we communicated on our q1 call. we had a tough expense comp in this category from one-time items that benefited the prior year's quarter. excluding those one-time items this category would have reflected expense savings of approximately 2% for the quarter.
utilities expense came in slightly below plan, as the category continues to benefit from renegotiated cable and internet agreements, as well as favorable electricity cost due to recently executed energy contracts and lower usage from our led installs. marketing expenses, one of our smallest categories from a nominal dollar standpoint had an elevated expense growth this quarter. we expect to finish the year at close to 10% growth in this category as we ramp-up our digital and social marketing efforts as well as our university sports marketing activities, while we continue to explore eliminating some of the more traditional marketing efforts.
turning to our portfolio's leasing activity. our projection for opening same-store rental revenue growth is trending within our guidance range. as always, the last 5 to 10 weeks of the leasing season is the most critical. and as of today, we would estimate the final leasing result that is near or slightly below the mid-point of our guidance. we also continue to be pleased with the lease up progress for our fall 2019 developments. with this group of properties currently pre-leased at 96%, achieving first year stabilization at our anticipated yields. as always, we want to thank both our field and corporate teams who remain focused on completing our lease up, managing our annual turn cycle, no-show process and preparing our properties for moving and welcoming each resident to their new home.
i'll now turn the call over to william to discuss our investment activity.
william w. talbot -- chief investment officer
thanks, jennifer. turning first to development. we are completing construction on our 2019 pipeline of developments and pre-sales which totaled 5 projects approximately 3,150 beds and $404 million in development cost, and look forward to opening the projects in the fall. developments are currently on-time and on-budget and we're fully stabilize and opening yields is in our anticipated range. we expect to close on the 2 pre-sale developments during the third quarter,
with regards to our on-campus partnerships, we are very excited to announced that we closed and commenced construction in july on our third-party on-campus development project with the university of california, riverside marking our seventh successful closing within the university of california system. the 1500-bed apartment project is our second project as part of the multi-phase award anticipated to ultimately deliver up to 6,000 beds on campus.
the project is targeting a fall 2021 opening and acc will manage the community. upon completion. with the first two projects acc is anticipated earn a $11.7 million in development fees and $1 million in annual ongoing management fees. overall, we continue to track a vibrant and expanding pipeline of on-campus p3 opportunities with colleges and universities, continuing to turn to the private sector to address their housing needs.
finally, turning to new supply for the 2020-2021 academic year realpage axiometrics is tracking 30,000 beds, currently under construction nationally, with a potential additional 12,000 beds planned, but not yet under construction. based on how many projects ultimately start construction for 2020 delivery new supply could range from 30,000 to 42,000 beds, down from a total of 48,000 beds delivering nationally this fall, representing a decline of 13% to 38% in new supply nationally that has tracked by realpage.
within acc 68 own markets we are tracking 21,000 beds, currently under construction for 2020 with a potential additional 11,00 beds planned, but not yet under construction. based on how many projects ultimately start construction for 2020 delivery new supply could range from 21,000 to 22,000 beds, down from a total of 29,200 beds delivering this fall in those markets, representing a decline of 24% to 28% of new supply. we will update the market with respect to these potential deliveries on our third quarter call.
i will now turn it over to daniel to discuss our financial results for the quarter.
daniel b. perry -- chief financial officer
thanks, william. last night we reported the company's financial results for the second quarter of 2019, which with $0.56 of ffom per fully diluted share grew 7.7% over the second quarter of 2018. as jennifer discussed, overall this was slightly better than our expectations primarily due to property operations as we saw higher than expected same-store revenue resulting from out-performance in back-filling short-term leases this year and higher summer camp and conference business at our residence hall properties.
we also continue to see some out-performance in utilities from our asset management initiatives. as you heard from bill, we are pleased with the out-performance, we have achieved in the quarter so far this year, but we are not making any updates to our 2019 earnings guidance at this time as many of the traditional risk to earnings still exist in the completion of the fall 2019 lease up, continued operating expense management throughout the year and the successful closing still to occur on one of the third-party development projects included in the mid-point of guidance.
further as implied by the 1.5% to 3.4% same-store noi growth guidance we are maintaining for the year, we anticipate the remaining quarters of the year to experience less same-store noi growth than the 4.3% percent achieved year-to-date. this is due to the slower seasonal revenue growth in the summer months and the 1.5% to 3% targeted rental revenue growth from the fall 2019 lease-up, as well as tougher operating expense comps in the remaining quarters.
also, as we talked about on the last call, we will be transitioning to an outsourced solution for online resident payments starting this fall. as a reminder, historically these payments were initiated through our portal, which required us to record a portion of the online payment as other income with an offsetting expense for the payment to the processor. with a fully outsourced online payment solution both the required revenue and expense entries will be eliminated. while this will be neutral to noi during the initial 12 months of implementation comparable quarters and quarterly same-store revenue and expense increases will be reduced by $700,000 to $800,000 and revenue growth rates will be reduced by approximately 40 basis points and expense growth rates by 80 basis points.
again, this change does not impact our noi and is already reflected in our guidance figures for 2019. but we will continue to remind you of the temporary effect it will have on same-store revenue and expense growth figures later this year and into the first 3 quarters of 2020.
with that being said, you can refer to pages s16 and s17 of the earnings supplemental to get complete details on each of the components of our 2019 guidance. as usual, we will update our 2019 guidance on the third quarter call for the final results of our lease up in our expectations for the remainder of the year.
moving to capital structure. as of june 30, the company's debt-to-enterprise value was 33.7%, debt-to-total asset value was 38% and the net debt-to-run rate ebitda was 6.7 times. during the quarter, we took advantage of the attractive conditions in the bond markets and completed a $400 million bond offering to term out a portion of the balance on our revolving credit facility.
as you will see in our capital allocation and long-term funding plan on page s15, we have not made any significant changes to the growth and funding plan.
we continue to expect to meet our capital needs for the remainder of 2019. and then for 2020 and beyond through a funding mix of cash available for reinvestment, additional debt and approximately $100 million to $150 million per year in disposition, joint venture and/or equity capital.
this will allow the company to maintain a debt-to total asset ratio in the mid-30s and a net debt-to-ebitda ratio in the high-fives to low-sixes, consistent with our stated strategy of trying to better match time to capital raising with the delivery of our development pipeline each year to create less disruption in earnings growth.
our current 2019 guidance, includes approximately $100 million to $190 million in proceeds from dispositions and/or the sale of a minority joint venture interest in existing properties during the second half of this year.
with that, i'll turn it back to the operator to start the question-and-answer portion of the call.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from derek johnston with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank securities -- analyst
hi, everybody. good morning and thank you.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
good morning.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank securities -- analyst
can you share some deeper thoughts on summer camp ancillary income from camps, conferences or other historical tenants, meaning if 2021 summer likely to see some rebound in revenue in demand or is this another total washed year similar to 2020, we're certainly looking for a quarterly comp basis.
daniel perry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, hey, derek, this is daniel. as you may recall, last year we talked about, typically we're able to generate about $4.5 million in revenue during the summer off of -- the summer camps and conferences that we hold at the residents halls that of course were empty during the summer months. it pretty equally split between q2 and q3 and of course, last year we did not have any summer camp and conference business as that was all suspended amid the height of the pandemic. typically those contracts are signed up throughout this spring semester as we go into the summer and so we don't have a lot of insight into it yet, but at the midpoint of our expectations as we thought about the year, it's hard for us to think that would be something that would be back to normal level, certainly this year and likely that we wouldn't have much of it. many of the schools are thinking that there is the risk that it could impact their ability to get back to normalcy for the fall, which is their primary focus at this point. the summer camps are middle-schoolers and high-schoolers, and so they bring hundreds of kids onto their campus when their primary focus is to return to normalcy as much as possible this fall, they don't want to interrupt that. so it's hard for us to expect much, we don't have a lot of insight into it until later this semester and so that's our expectations right now.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank securities -- analyst
okay, got it, thanks. and then the disney lease-up, can you share some more details on the leasing velocity and future demand expectations and this is really given your talks with disney management, did they give any details about possible reopening dates or their current thinking or did they hire a 2021 intern class that you know of?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
hey, this is william. as it relates to the turn of the dcp, we're obviously in constant communication with disney as it relates to that. it is not our current expectation that that program will return in 2021, but it really, as bill said in his opening remarks. it really is tied to the expanded capacity of the parks, which obviously disney is monitoring very closely, and once those parts expand capacity, there is the ability for the dcp program to come on board and come on board at much larger volumes in the traditional cast member housing leasing velocity. so, that's still influx, as bill mentioned in the opening remarks, but something we're constantly in contact with them and optimistic to hopefully see that program return in '22 and then build up quickly thereafter.
the second part of your question on the disney leasing velocity, we are 88 leases to date, we've got an additional 11 applications in the process. we've kind of seen a trend of about right in line of that 50 leases on our trailing 30-day, and so when we talk about that range of 25 to 100 leases volume, we certainly -- we saw that here earlier in the year and expect that accelerate and that also is directly tied to, as you see the additional capacity at the park's brings on more cast members working at the park.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank securities -- analyst
okay, understood. thanks.
operator
the next question is from austin wurschmidt with keybanc. please go ahead.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
all right, thanks, everybody. just curious, what you've seen at your properties in terms of how traffic has trended whether it'd be in-person virtually or however you track that data and then also could you share how many may-ending leases you've kind of backfilled historically within the existing portfolio?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, good morning aus. this is bill. i'll handle the first part and kick it over to daniel for the may-ending leasing. as we mentioned in our comments and while all lines velocities have been good from thanksgiving through the end of january with the extended spring break, we did see a lesser velocity than usual in terms of walk in traffic, which is something that we did fully expect. and also, as we mentioned, once the students came back from that extended spring break, we did indeed, see a pick up in velocity, more consistent with what you would see in terms of historical interest. now obviously in texas the last week, there was a major slowdown in velocity just in this particular state, given the weather conditions. but as we did mention where we really were -- on the last call, i put forth, we're really not going to really have the type of indication that we can give in terms of trajectory in making really sound projections until we get through april, may and june where you had the inversion of the slowdown last year that we expect the acceleration to occur in velocity. and so it will really be more toward the end of the second quarter before we have comparable data on -- that there has been enough time passed in stabilizing what was normalized period last year that is currently slower versus in the april, may and june when we will have an increased velocity over that period of time. so that's where we talked about transition area. it's going to be a little bit of time, but we have to color into that.
daniel perry -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and then i'll jump in austin on the may-ending leases. so, and of course, just to make sure everybody's clear that we're talking about may-ending leases with regards to our 12-month properties. of course, we have our residents halls that have may-ending leases as well. what we're not doing a lot of backfilling in that -- in many cases what we're doing that summer camp and conference business in a normal environment. but with regard to the 12-month properties where we do sign some may-ending leases, it's typically about 1,000 leases per year that are may-ending and we're able to backfill about 50% in that in a normal year, which is about $1 million in revenue. about two-third of that hits q2 being the may and june months and then the other third hitting july. so that's really the area where again a lot of those leases like the summer camp and conference business aren't signed until later in the spring semester and it's hard for us to have a lot of insight into it, but just being still in the middle of covid, it's hard for us not have some expectation that there could be some softness there.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. you mentioned rates have been flattish to slightly up at this point of the year, but it seems when, not if velocity will accelerate. so how are you thinking about freight growth trending once you see the pace up -- pace pick up given what you're seeing just in terms of applications and admissions data?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. it is going to be a delicate balance. it's something obviously that we're going to be utilizing our internal systems to manage, there is significant upside as everyone's aware in occupancy this year at the $90.3 million that we ended up last fall. in terms of however much progress we can make from that point more toward normalized operations and so we're certainly going to make sure that under all circumstances, we do not jeopardize velocity to maximize occupancy in terms of being overly aggressive with rate. also when it comes to the pricing, the one thing that we've been very pleased with throughout last year's lease up with covid and this year's lease up is the owner's market has been very patient in terms of realizing that the velocity is related to covid and not supply demand and people have been very balanced in terms of their pricing policies. obviously, that's something that helps create stability that we're referencing in those rental rates, and so as we move into the period again of april, may and june, when we do expect those increase velocities, we will utilize our systems as we always have to maximize the combination of occupancy and rent being very thoughtful that our greatest opportunities are indeed in occupancy.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and just one quick follow-up to that, bill, if i can. in years where you kind of held back on rate, where have you seen final occupancy range across the portfolio?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
you know, it wouldn't be a generalization that you could transfer and what's taking place right now and also in the context of answering that question in a broader portfolio perspective, when you look at what is taking place and the disruption that covid has caused, it is a market by market conditions on the ground that there may be great variation in terms of how we're implementing those policy. so i don't think there's anything that we can talk about on the broader historical trends of pricing velocity in results that we could translate into this environment this year and draw conclusions.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
the next question is from neil malkin with capital one securities. please go ahead.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks. i guess maybe william for you. you had obviously the berkeley, your chosen as you did the eighth development or it's under -- you expect to start next year. i just wanted to be clear. were you likely to be the developer for the entire 6,000 bed master plan and then are you -- could you maybe give any detailed answer on the updated p3 activity, sort of where you are there, any breakdown of ace versus third-party developed and sort of kind of how you see that playing out maybe over the next couple of years?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yeah, for sure, in particular with cal, berkeley that phase or that pre-development that we announced this quarter, that was related to our selection as the master developer of up to 6,000 beds on their campus. berkeley does have other housing they're pursuing on their own, namely the people's park project, but the 6,000 bed master developer, this is really the first project to be moved to pre-development under an ace structure and we're actually working with them on a number of other potential housing projects as well. so we are excited to see certainly in this covid environment the projects moving forward and seeing that progress and universities really starting to focus and advance their housing now that they're starting to focus on campus returning to normal.
as it relates to the overall p3 activity business as bill mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're tracking over 60 current potential opportunities out there. we've really started to see momentum both in those projects that we had been awarded in pre-development and pre-covid, are starting to move forward and see progress where there was a slight pause and with the procurements and the universities actively picking up activity to address these housing needs that really the weakness in the consumer demand was exasperated in covid and we believe the majority of those will be looking to p3 solutions, but it's really too early to tell if that would be an equity ace solution or third-party finance type solution and again one of the big benefits we bring to our university partners is, we can offer all of those solutions and evaluate all of those with them as we go through the process.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
the only thing i would add that from a capital allocation perspective is while there certainly a -- we believe a greater opportunity in the p3 in the years ahead. obviously, as it relates to ace, it is going to enable us to even be more selective in terms of where we want to invest our equity on campus with a broader range of opportunities and we will continue to assess ace investment, the same way we do all investment decisions in terms of making sure that they meet our criteria.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
okay and then just a follow-up on that. would you expect then at schools, you're in -- your assets are off-campus, would you expect maybe like over the next, let's say, one to three years given the sort of hesitance about the dorms in the shared bathrooms. would you expect to see an uptick in occupancy for your off-campus product as maybe kids and parents are a shift away or kind of make choices that are with covid in mind.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
that depends on whether or not they have the opportunity to do so. let me explain what i mean by that. many universities have housing requirements and so obviously through covid, they realize that those properties as you mentioned are not conducive from a consumer perspective to what students and parents want in that type of environment and it made them realize that if indeed they need to prepare to have more modern products for all situations. now, many schools will go back to their on-campus housing requirement where the students won't have a choice. they will have to continue to live in that product for as long as it remains on the campus and so it -- and again that's why we love our ace transactions and when we build on-campus housing is that we are covered by those housing guarantees and housing expectations, we mentioned in our comments, arizona state university, where we have modernized the housing has a first year housing expectation of the students. unless you are commuting from a local community, they expect you to live on campus and the only reason they historically will not have enough beds for the entire first year class and so that is something on-campus that universities will still be able to benefit from. but as well you mentioned they realize that those antiquated facilities do need to be updated in many cases and will move forward with those activities. where there are open market choices universities where we could see a small outflow in terms of students living off-campus, but as we always talk about with regard to the on-campus investments that we make, universities really have great advantage in terms of locking up the first year students as they come in, in terms of administering their own processes.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
okay, great. and then the other one for me is related to the growth 2030, the strategic investment in development acquisitions and then jv, partnership side, anything under contract or in the works, maybe are you waiting for the new board members and maybe that new allocation committee to sort of get the low down on prospects and everything going on before. i guess, when you kind of see that starting to take off?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. and certainly, we continue to make progress in terms of our selection of partners in that regard, as william said on the call, it is a slow transit --transitionary environment at the moment, and we believe the bulk of activity will come, as it relates to q4 in terms of when you'll see an increase in acquisition type opportunities, and so certainly we are advancing those initiatives, and of course we will always involve the board in those process as the new capital allocation committee will help us in terms of prioritizing the numerous opportunities that we will have before us in the future.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
thank you, guys.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
the next question is from nick joseph with citi. please go ahead.
michael bilerman -- citigroup equity research -- analyst
hey, it's michael bilerman here with nick. so i just want to come back, bill, on the board. how do you sort of see the interaction, relationship with this new capital allocation committee and help us understand how, i guess the formalization of this committee compared to what the previous board oversight was and involvement in all of your capital allocation decisions, i guess what has changed between now this formal committee and what you had before. i don't know if there was a certain threshold, i don't know if the whole board wasn't involved in your decisions and just go through what in fact this capital allocation committee is going to have oversight of all acquisitions....
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
sure.
michael bilerman -- citigroup equity research -- analyst
development, dispositions, equity raises, strategic alternatives, where does their mandate start and end?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. and certainly as you went through the litany of purview that they can have insight into. first of all. historically, the board has always been intimately involved in our capital allocation decisions, equity raises, all of those items, and certainly have had complete influence and control over that. as we move into this capital allocation committee, and extremely excited about the caliber of the three individuals that are joining the board and the specific capital allocation expertise that they're bringing, and also that it's very recent and fresh capital allocation expertise.
mainly -- certainly craig is a known entity to the real estate industry and highly regarded in terms of all the work that he has done throughout his career, and alison hill has exceptional purview into the role that she has played at prologis in their strategic capital platform and so, and herman bulls is a vice-chair of jll, certainly intimately involved in terms of the real estate market and capital allocation specifically in tune to higher education. and so i think we're bringing in some of refreshed firepower that really has their fingers on the pulse of the market in terms of what the opportunities are and how best to approach them.
and so the interaction will continue to be the -- at the board level as it always has been. however, we're going to take advantage of that expertise. and so that capital allocation committee, matter of fact we're meeting today at 3 o'clock, as a part of our normal board meetings going in and at groups meeting in advance for a longer extended period of time and with the -- again we're going to have a plethora of opportunities available to us as we go forward, giving the emerging market opportunities down the road, and we do have limited capital.
and so as we do look at prioritizing and maximizing value for our shareholders on all fronts, drawing off of their expertise and having their purview into the transactions on all fronts that we're doing. we really have involved the board and we will continue with this committee on all transactions that we do. the management team typically every quarter is taken every transaction of the board regardless of size and whether it's over or under any threshold. and so we got a lot of a good expertise and firepower coming in and certainly with craig and alison, you combine that with the cydney donnell and john rippel from the private equity side, it is very, very active still in his professional career of capital allocation. there's a lot of benefit there that they're going to bring in terms of the purview of the shareholders into the intimacy of what we're doing. and so we as management embrace it, we're excited about it and we look forward to working with them intimately on it.
michael bilerman -- citigroup equity research -- analyst
that's helpful color bill. i guess what was done before, and i think you've just mentioned that everything was taken to the board. was there a subcommittee previously on your capital allocation decisions, obviously i'm not discounting the fact of trying to bring in this firepower to your board to improve capital allocation, but it's also the mission that something was wrong before, and i'm just trying to get a little bit more color about how we got to that point, what you did not have...
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
no.
michael bilerman -- citigroup equity research -- analyst
the appropriate people on the board or...
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah.
michael bilerman -- citigroup equity research -- analyst
or you did not have the right processes, where the management have more influence, i mean this is a pretty major thing to go through an activist campaign and and put new members on the board and form a capital allocation committee. i'm just trying to get a perspective of what had happened before that led to it?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. and certainly, we were forced to do nothing, and let me say this is something that i and this management team embraces and very much help to drive. the -- what had been done previously, it's not that anything was wrong, we always look to improve and you can always look to improve the process that you put in place in both this board refreshment and this capital allocation committee are an improvement in terms of advancing our initiatives in that area.
michael bilerman -- citigroup equity research -- analyst
thanks for your time, bill.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
you got it.
operator
the next question is from alexander goldfarb with piper sandler. please go ahead.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning. good morning down there [phonetic].
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
good morning, alex.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
rather you guys are getting your power back and just for what it's worth the change for the intro bill just having you speak and they get into q&a, definitely streamline things so if that's the go forward. i don't know that you need to form a special board committee on earnings calls, but that was definitely a very good. just going on to the michael's question, it's a little puzzling actually the capital allocation review, one, just the name, which gets over used in reit land, but two, you guys made a concerted effort a few years ago to change your funding strategy where you're selling sort of low 4 caps to deliver -- to recycle that capital into assets that basically are opening up, september 1st at 95 plus yielding 6 plus. so, you guys had actually....
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
transformed the capital allocation overall, especially as you had sold out your legacy higher cap drive assets. so on one hand, you guys already seem to have addressed this and i think two, you guys have also been pretty good at communicating that the growth of student housing, it doesn't have the highs of multifamily, but doesn't have the lows either it's sort of a steady eddie plus 2% to 3% business year-in and year-out. so i guess, from that perspective is -- what i guess sort of from that approach, what was sort of driving this to have because as i say, i think that you guys had already remedied on the capital markets, that was really just in finding the assets now that you know the higher cap and you found the sustainable development pipeline of that $300 million range and then two, on the earnings front, i think that you guys have finally gotten that message through on the pace of earnings growth to be expected. so i guess, from that perspective, what really caused you guys form this and what changes would we really see versus just having people like craig, etc. on the board, just to be a part of the discussion?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
alex, thank you for pointing all that out, and that you really hit on some key points and that we did -- with the -- we in the board together made the decision really in '15, '16 and '17 to undertake the massive refinement of the portfolio and to transform it from the more eclectic portfolio that existed from a value add core portfolio into the premier core portfolio that you see today that we were then able to shift our capital allocation strategy coming out of 2018, in terms of better match funding with the sale of low cap rate 4 to 4.1 we transacted at and reinvesting that with a better match funding into the 6.25 development opportunities that we had. and so that -- and this speaks exactly to how i was answering michael's question, as there was nothing that was wrong before, it is only in terms of continuing to strive to do better and to better enhance the processes related to that. with that said, again we as a company and especially in the position that we are in is the only public company in our space and the opportunities that we have before us in the years ahead. it's only prudent. the most important thing that we do as a company is capital allocation and so to meet the expectation of the market in terms of utilizing the expertise that we have available to us in a board of directors that all -- that has been and continues to be as we continue to refresh exceptional real estate and capital allocation expertise, we of course want to do everything we can to advance that moving forward. and so, performing that committee from our perspective, we as a management team are going to continue to be very selective and very disciplined as we procure opportunities and always strive to undertake transactions that for the long term will create the most value for our shareholders and we'll always rely on the expertise of the board that we have whether it's in the confines of a committee or the full board to help advance those initiatives.
i do thank you though for pointing out the -- the 5% earnings growth, you start to see come in 2019 that we talked about in our comments in the tailwinds in 2020 that we were very pleased with the shift that had taken place and we now just want to continue to advance that.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay and then just two other questions, so apologies. one dp [phonetic] on the opex, you mentioned that the percentage impact from growth in opex in the second and third quarters. but from a modeling perspective, in aggregate, on a gross portfolio, not just same-store, how much more million of opex are we looking at in the second and third quarters?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
well, if you look alex at 2020, we reported on this -- as we went through the year, in the second quarter, we came in about $8 million below our original expectations for the quarter, about $7.6 million for the third quarter. and so as we're looking at 2021, and at the property level, we're 90% plus occupied. we're pretty much back to full delivery of services and operations at the property's and so we expect those expenses to materially return on top of the fact that we also will have some additional covid cleaning costs as part of the operating response to covid that we put into place. and so when we look at 2021, we would expect to see the return of where we came in under with a lot of the expense activities that were halted and really that kind of primary period, initial period of covid in q2 and q3 of last year to return to basically what we're looking at still some efficiency relative to what our original expenses would have been in 2020. but when you add the additional covid costs pretty much in line overall with those original expectations, if you go back and look at what we had provided from a guidance standpoint on expenses last year.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. so just to be clear, so basically we're looking at $16 million in aggregate higher operating expenses and then perhaps a little bit more for extra covid cleaning, is that's what we should expect spread out over the second and third quarters?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
that's right. and if you go back we talked at the end of last year third quarter call in october that our expectations are that covid clean costs will run upwards of $3 million. obviously, we're trying to control that as much as possible, but somewhere in that up to $3 million range is what we're expecting that to contribute.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay and then just finally and apologies for the third question. but, bill, in your opening comments, you made a comment about student housing valuations, having been diminished. and just in our channel checks from the folks that we spoke to, we have been hearing is that any asset that was impacted by noi, this wasn't trading in that otherwise valuations and cap rates etc., have been unimpacted pre-covid to post-covid. so i just, maybe i misheard you or maybe you are just...
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
no. no. and obviously, alex. if you have an asset that was unaffected and is 95% to 97% at its historical occupancy and you traded, its valuation was not impacted, but largely, when you look at valuations of portfolios and decisions of sellers to sell or not sell, the decision to not sell the asset is based upon that impacted noi in applying that cap rate to it and so the -- you see selective trading taking place in terms of what assets are not impacted in going out versus those that are being held for sale for later period when they improve.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
[operator instructions]. the next question is from john pawlowski with green street. please go ahead.
john pawlowski -- green street -- analyst
thanks a lot. for this upcoming fall, do you have a sense yet with your conversations with the universities on how many of your beds could be potentially just offline due to do densification efforts on the on-campus assets?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. at this point in time, john, it is still optimistic that there as it relates to our ace portfolio that there will not be de-densification. of course as we see universities in many cases not -- they do have to react to public health officials if there is any concerns brought through on that. we're in very good standing in that the large majority and we only have two products that we've developed that have community bedrooms in terms of a vcu and cal berkeley. cal berkeley has come out very positively in terms of their expectations currently to return to normal in the fall. and so we are hopeful that de-densification will not be a major impact to us in the fall.
john pawlowski -- green street -- analyst
okay. and then i apologize if i missed it. could you share with the occupancy assumption that underpins the first quarter revenue guidance?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, so if you'll recall, we came in and i think 90 point obviously for the fall, 90.3% on our roll forward page where we show the roll forward to the 2021 same-store group. on page s10 of our supplemental, you can see fourth quarter was 90.5%. we typically see that drop in the range of 20 to 40 bps as you move into q1 because you have some whether it's short-term leases you have for seniors that are graduating or students who leave primarily on at ace properties for spring co-offs or internships. as we mentioned, we did sign more spring starting leases this year than we historically have. so we think there will be some contribution of that. they do start at different times throughout the spring semester depending on the individual lease. but we do think there will be some offset to that 20 bps to 40 bps, but still a little bit of a downtick relative to the fourth quarter, 90.5% average.
john pawlowski -- green street -- analyst
thank you.

with that, i'll turn the call over to bill for his remarks. bill?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
thank you, ryan. good morning, and thank all of you for joining us as we discuss our q4 and full year 2020 financial and operating results. as you know, this call is occurring six days later than originally scheduled due to the unprecedented widespread disruption in texas last week caused by severe winter ice storms and related power and water outages. our hearts go out to those affected by these storms and we hope that everybody is recovering at this time.
now, turning to our business. in reviewing 2020, prior to the pandemic, acc was off to an excellent start. after delivering nearly 5% earnings growth in 2019, the q1 delivered noi that exceeded our expectations for each of the three months. additionally, our velocity for fall 2020 lease-up was over 3% ahead of the prior year with rental rate growth trending well relative to targets. new supply for fall 2021 was also near decade lows. the fundamentals in our sector were strong and all facets of our business were exceeding our internal expectations.
with covid- 19 being declared a pandemic, the student housing sector like most businesses faced unprecedented and unanticipated disruptions. the u.s. higher education system was dramatically impacted by the governmental shelter in-place orders put in place across the country. over the last 3 quarters of 2020, we responded by attempting to do the right things on behalf of all of our stakeholders, while continuing to provide a central housing services to students all across america, all the while attempting to mitigate long term negative impacts to our business and providing thought leadership in action to help universities return to a sense of normalcy.
despite the negative financial impacts to our business in 2020, we were encouraged by students' strong desire to be physically present in their college environment, demonstrating that the desired educational experience is much more than simply attending a classroom lecture. ultimately fall 2020 enrollment levels at tier 1 universities we serve remained relatively consistent with 2019, and most students returned to their college towns for the fall term, regardless of whether their university was holding in-person classes or providing them online. this was evidenced by the fact that our portfolio achieved approximately 90% occupancy for fall of 2020 with the sector as a whole being over 88% occupied.
as we look forward, 2021 will be a year of transition on the path back to normalcy. while the virus continues to have a lingering impact on the student housing sector, we are seeing signs of improvement. during the fourth quarter, we saw an increase in collection rates, a diminished necessity for on-campus rent refunds and a reduction in request for rent relief under our resident hardship program. we also had strong demand for spring leases signing over 3600 new leases commencing in the spring term, 50% more in the prior year. while the current transitionary environment causes us to believe there could be softness in our ability to backfill may-ending leases at historical levels and that we may not return our summer camp and conference business to normal levels.
we are cautiously optimistic regarding the 2021-2022 academic year commencing this fall. in discussions with our university partners, the vast majority are indicating that admission applications are up over the last year and many are projecting strong enrollment growth for fall 2021. there is also incrementally positive news in terms of universities planning to return to in-person classes for fall of 2021 as exemplified by the recent announcements by both the university of california and cal state systems as well as several other major universities who have been fully online in the current academic year. with regard to their statements, they will be returning to in-person classes.
also, arizona state university, our largest university partner recently announced plans for full availability of in-person classes in fall of 2021 and encouraged students to register early and at this time, they expect to reinstate their on-campus housing expectation for first year students. although, we cannot yet give you a reasonably accurate estimate of fall 2021 occupancy levels, these are certainly encouraging signs. as we fully expected and consistent with what has been reported by our private peers and in third party market research, across the industry pre-leasing for the 2021-2022 academic year is tracking behind the traditional historical pace. beyond the general disruption of covid, the extended winter breaks at many universities that in many cases lasted from thanksgiving through late january, appeared to have specifically contributed to a delay in students securing housing early for next fall as compared to the normal leasing activity that we would see during that period of time. we did see accelerating leasing velocity in the weeks after students return from winter break and there will be significant acceleration in april, may and june, which we expect to compare favorably relative to those months last year when leasing activity dramatically dropped off during the height of the pandemic.
finally, the new supply picture continues to provide tailwind for the sector as a whole as fall 2021 deliveries are flat compared to 2020, which as i mentioned earlier was at the lowest amount of new supply in the past decade.
turning to our ongoing development at walt disney world. as we discussed last quarter, with the current suspension of the disney college program, we did commence in earnest [phonetic] marketing and leasing of the project at disney cast members and employees of operating partners in late q4. with the holiday season in the start of the new year, being a slow leasing period for conventional multifamily, we have signed 88 leases to date and anticipate the velocity will accelerate through the remainder of the year as cast members' current leases expire.
the original pre-covid proforma projected disney college program to deliver approximately $14 million in operating income after ground rent in 2021. however, based on a standard multifamily leasing stabilization trend of 25 to 100 leases per month, we now expect 2021 to have a net operating loss after ground rent between $2.7 million and $5.4 million. as disney brings the dcp intern program back online, occupancy will increase more rapidly than the current conventional market leasing velocity. disney continues to be fully committed to the full reopening of walt disney world as soon as possible, evidenced by their continued investment in the parks and resorts, including the continued construction of flamingo village crossing town center, a 200,000 square feet mixed used entertainment center set to open in fall of 2021 across the street from our community.
and as disney discussed on their recent earnings call, they have significant demand for attendance at the parks and are very pleased with future bookings, and as they stated at this point, it's only a matter of the rate of public vaccination that will allow them to start to see a return to normal levels of operations at the parks with corresponding increases in cast members and ultimately dcp participants. although the timing and velocity of the reinstatement of the disney college program continues to be influx at this time, we currently expect the completed project to be fully stabilized and pro forma occupancy and rents within 12 to 24 months of the originally anticipated date of may 2023 at its originally targeted stabilized yield of 6.8%.
now looking to transactional activity in the student housing sector. as with many sectors, 2020 volumes were down significantly, with cbre reporting student housing transactions decreasing approximately 20% versus 2019. while deep interest from capital sources looking to invest in the sector held cap rates in line with pre-covid levels, pricing has been lower as valuations have been impacted by covid's disruption to historical revenues and nois. based on our discussions with the investment community, we expect transaction volume to remain low in the first three quarters of 2021, with potential improvement later in the year, as lease-ups are finalized for the upcoming 2021-2022 academic year. as it relates to our capital recycling plants for '21, we will continue to monitor the market to assess the optimum timing to maximize our own asset valuations and we'll update the market at the appropriate time.
turning to on-campus public-private partnership, p3 opportunities, as universities are expecting a return to normalcy in the fall, they are now beginning to refocus their efforts to modernize on-campus housing. we started to see progress with regard to our projects awarded pre-covid that are in pre-development as well as a pickup in new pursuits. we continue to believe that p3 opportunities on-campus may well be greater in a post-covid environment, given the significant financial impacts universities experienced related to the de-densification and consumer rejection of older community bath residence halls coupled with the funding and budget cuts university space in the post-covid environment. as the recognized industry leader, acc is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this expanding opportunity.
currently, we are tracking over 60 universities that are evaluating potential on-campus projects. with respect to guidance, while we believe the student housing sector has exhibited impressive resiliency, despite the significant disruption the pandemic has had on the universities of students we serve, and while we see many encouraging signs of a steady return to normalcy, the range of potential financial results for 2021 is still too wide for us to provide full year earnings guidance, with a reasonable and useful range. instead, we'll be providing guidance for each forward quarter until we can provide an estimate further into the future, that we can stand behind.
as such, we're providing q1 ffom guidance in the range of $0.54 to $0.56 per share. as we look beyond q1, we would encourage everyone to review the normal quarterly seasonality of our business and further take into consideration some of my earlier comments, regarding the fact that the transitionary environment causes us to believe that there may be softness in our ability to backfill may-ending leases at historical levels, and that we will likely not see a return to normal summer camp and conference business in 2021. we also expect to see significantly higher same-store operating expense growth levels than normal, as 2020 presents a tough comparison year given that operating expenses were approximately 6% below our original 2020 guidance for expenses. this will be especially notable in q2 and q3, as we anticipate more normal expense levels that will be compared to the same periods in 2020, when many expense activities were halted. this could lead to expense growth in the high-single digits in q2 and q3 of this year.
in closing, i'd like to convey our excitement related to the recent appointments of three new outstanding independent directors to the acc board. as a part of our commitment to continued board refreshment, we're thrilled to welcome, herman bulls, alison hill and craig leupold. these three new directors have extensive real estate and capital allocation experience and bring valuable diverse perspectives that will serve the interest of our shareholders well. i'd also like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude on behalf of the entire board to our two departing directors, carla pineyro sublett, who left the board in concert with accepting an exciting new role as the chief marketing officer of ibm made meaningful contributions during her short time as a director, and we wish her all the best. we'd also like to thank ed lowenthal, who announced that he'll be retiring from the board in may, after 16 years of service, including 5 as our board chair. ed has helped oversee our company's transformation from an owner of only 16 student housing properties at ipo to becoming the industry leader, and we'd also like to congratulate ms. cydney donnell, who will be assuming the role of board chair up on ed's departure.
with that, i'll turn it back to the operator to start the question-and-answer portion of our call.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from derek johnston with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank research -- analyst
hi, everybody. how are you doing. thank you. are any of your colleges or universities requiring the vaccine? and do you see this as an enrollment hinderance? do you worry about a broadening of vaccine mandate for students? and then as part of this question, lastly, are these vaccination requirements being driven by student wishes or instructors, professors and staff.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yes, thank you, derek. currently, only two of our 64 universities are requiring a vaccine. it's important to note, we do think you'll see more schools follow that trend. the way that it is being done is in the context of students needing a vaccine to attend classes in-person on campus. and so when we look at what occurred last year, where in many of our universities no students were able to attend classes at all, but yet still 90% came back. and so, even with schools mandating a vaccine to a 10 classes, we don't think that as a whole it will be a negative impact with regards to, it's still going to be a much better situation than we had going in the last fall, and so again we would expect it to be not anything to the detriment of where we are launching from this year. we do think that most institutions that are having those conversations, it is being driven by making their faculty comfortable in terms of being able to fuel comfortable coming into the classroom. we see more of that than we do from a student mandate with regard to it.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank research -- analyst
thank you. that's very, very helpful. given the growth in application rates nationwide, is there a potential upside to growth in admissions? and do you think it's taking students a little longer in the side where to attend given that most students are applying to numerous or more universities than historically, and are the elevated applications and covid possibly delaying university offers?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. and certainly, when we look at common app, which is the company that helps universe students apply to universities, there is indeed an uptick in applications this year. when you look at unique applications in terms of the actual physical number of applicants, thereof nationally about 2.3%, which is a good growth number. good for us. and when you look at where the the larger increases are in the increase in applications, certainly public large institutions with enrollments above 20,000 are doing very well. the applications there are up 13% to 15%. and so, in the universe where we operate, we do see double-digit submission of application.
certainly, the increase in applications is from an administrative perspective, there's more processing that the universities need to do. and so, while we do see them operating on their normal timeline and typically by the end of may, is when you see all the application and acceptances play out. we don't see a slowdown in that process, but there is a little more processing for schools to do. how it all plays out at our particular universities, ultimately we have to wait to the fall when those final enrollment numbers come in. but the trending is positive, both in a small uptick in the 2% and a double-digit submission of applications at our universities. and when you look at we're students are applying on in a pre-covid environment, they were typically applying at 5.3 universities per student and now it's 5.8. so it is a small uptick in terms of the number of institutions they're applying to to, an average of about one more, if you round up.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank research -- analyst
okay, got it. and just one last one if i may. what are investors missing? i mean, why do you think acc shares significantly lags the broader multifamily reits year-to-date. i mean, especially is your company booked the bulk of the pandemic pain upfront and in real time versus apartment reits where it likely takes years to get back to pre-covid earnings power.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
first, i think that you know, just when we look at the initial impacts on covid that occurred last year, i think there was more concern and fear around student housing than multifamily at the beginning. when we saw university, starting with harvard, taking very significant draconian actions, closing the campuses, when we didn't know what covid yet was. and so, certainly i think that the initial impacts in terms that concerned our sector were greater than multifamily. certainly, i think that we have over time now demonstrating the long-term thesis of student housing has always been the stability of cash flows, and the fact that we are more resilient in times of macroeconomic uncertainty. and i think we started to build that story back in showing the reality of it in the context of the progress that was made this fall in terms of the 90.3% occupancy, and more importantly, a return in the payment structure and the collection rates going back up to that 97%-98%, showing that students and parents can recapitalize the funding of their education in economic hard times with guaranteed student loans and grants and the like.
and so, we think the market is seeing firsthand a demonstration of the resiliency of the sector there -- we've got to prove out this year's lease up, and that's we're focused right now. we're chopping wood and getting back on that road to normalcy and returning to the sector. and i do think there's going to be some geographic variations as we see the reopenings in university systems across the country and on the coast as we build that back. and so i don't know that the market is per se missing anything, just in terms of watching the demonstration of the long-term thesis of our sector being proven out in one of the most unique circumstances we faced as a company and in the industry.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank research -- analyst
thank you, bill.
operator
our next question comes from neil malkin with capital one. please go ahead.
neil malkin -- capital one -- analyst
hey, everyone. good morning. nice quarter. nice start to the year. first, a kind of a housekeeping. in terms of, like arizona, texas, florida, like the states with your largest exposures, most of those schools, have announced or do you expect them to announce a plan, or i guess a formula for a full-time in-person curriculum in the fall, in terms of just -- again as a learning implementation and as well as a covid protocol?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. those three states in particular have done very well even through this first year in terms of their models of education delivery and their policies on campus and continue. now the good news is, when you look at all of the data, of all the markets that we're operating in, is that all state systems are making positive statements toward a return toward in-person activities. certainly, those three where we have the highest concentration are already states and systems where we have seen more open policies as it relates to in-person activities.
neil malkin -- capital one -- analyst
yeah. okay, makes sense. and then in terms of your, i believe it's growth 20:30, if i remember correctly that you're initiatives with joint ventures and growth outside of the normal business lines, i suppose you could say. any update there? i mean, i know things have gotten a little bit better since sort of that was announced. but do you think that you're going to have more to announce there? are you in talks? have you potentially established partners you're going to announce something with, any updates there would be great?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. no. and we certainly continue that process as we talked about. we had engaged a consultant later in their brokerage firm later in last year. we moved that process along. we're into the final stages of selection. we're very pleased with the interest and the amount of capital that is out there that is entering such program. as i mentioned previously, the entire industry is in the focus right now of returning our values as we move through this fall's lease up. and so, as we get closer to the transaction environment, which we think in q4 of this year and q1 of next year, we'll be in a position to talk more about that and bring finality to it.
neil malkin -- capital one -- analyst
okay. thank you, guys, very much, and good quarter.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from nick joseph with citi. please go ahead.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks. bill, i appreciate the commentary on pre-leasing and understand the uncertainty is still there. but just in general, why couldn't occupancy come back to fall 2019 levels this year, just given the application trends you've talked about, as in-person enrollment or need for kind of continued social distancing or something else that could hold back on it and versus that long-term average?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
nick, we think we talked a lot about this at the investor conference that you all put on. in that, it's really on the margins. just for everyone on the call, think about your circle of friends in the quintessence [phonetic] -- the 20 to 30 families that you interact with. and then you know, how many of those families are 100% returning to normalcy in all their decision makings. there is always that you know on the margins, two to three that are going to continue to have a consumer behavior that's different.
last year we had 9.3 out of 10 students that came back. this year its going to be 9.5, 9.6. i mean, it's really that on the margins. the other thing that we -- when you look at our performance historically over the years, and one of the things that we always talk about is the spread of occupancy, where we outperform the rest of the industry in the axial metrics 175. and a lot of that benefit that we bring, the full maximization of revenue in our portfolio, we always talk about how we manage the wait list and no-show process. and you know, some degree, filling student housing beds in the fall was like running an airline, in filling those, maximizing the seats in that process. and when you're in that overfill and over book situation, is where we really utilize our proprietary systems to fill every last bed, do every last roommate matching to efficiently work that process.
and so, the maximum benefit that we bring is when you're in an oversold situation in the majority of your markets. and so, when you look at a normal year -- fall of '19, we had 93 assets that were over 98%, 76 that were virtually 100% full, where we were able to nurture that process to maximize. you look in the covid environment, we only had 46 assets that were 98% and above, and so you have a little less opportunity across the portfolio geographically across the entire nation to have that type of outperformance. and so, when you look at consumer behavior on the margin and the ability to fully take advantage of our systems in a normal situation of overflow, we think that's the reason we probably won't see a full return to normalcy.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks, that's very helpful.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
this fall. yeah, right.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
and then, given more clarity on the disney college program, as the disney phases deliver this year, how are you thinking about leasing those in the open market versus waiting for the program to resume.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, we're in discussions with disney on that right now as they advance their plant and thinking about the reinstatement of the college program. as we mentioned in my comments, and certainly, mr. chapek, at their annual meeting, talking about what the disney college program means to them and that they hope it will be reinstated this year. in the internal conversation that we have with them, we do believe that, and i mentioned this also, as the reinstatement takes place, which you know is mr. chapek, that they hope will be by the end of this year. that the potential for the ramp up of occupancy may more emulate closer to our original pro forma as we're bringing phases back on, to where we now believe that we may indeed be able to hit the stabilized yield of 6.8, ultimately by may of 2023. between now and that point in time, while the reinstatement is still in question is exactly when it will occur. once it does, it may ramp up more in line with what our original expectations were. and so certainly because of that, while we've leased, i think we said 148 beds to-date at the time of the release, we are, because those leases are typically 12 months and would extend to the period in which mr. chapek has said the college program will come back. we are monitoring that to make sure we make the right decision, that we're ready for the higher revenue generating beds to be available to the college program.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks.

our next question comes from alexander goldfarb with piper sandler. please go ahead.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
hey, good morning. you guys seem to be in pretty high spirits today, so that's a good thing. so, two questions here. one, freshman, where the -- were they laggards last year? i think that we're 80% pre-lease. do you have any sense bill of how the freshman are doing this year because that seems to be sort of the mixed question? that seems to be the real variable in getting back to normalcy.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. and alex, when you say first year students, are you referencing the ones coming in from high school this year or the ones that came in last year continuing on with leasing.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
no, no, the new to school. it was -- because last year had been up, these were the kids that were first going to school who were the ones that will then come back and actually live on campus, so trying to gauge that same group, the people who are going to school for the first time.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. no. and this is where we're -- again all of our preliminary indications are positive. but we continue cautious optimism as it relates to the ultimate outcomes. we continue to see good velocity among that group and all others and as it is, we mentioned, we're now at about 2.5 times weekly activity of what we had in the prior year. and so certainly, we did see a slower pace of decision making toward housing initially in the fall and over the holiday break period, but we have seen that acceleration continue. so they are indeed making decisions a little later.
when you look at prior years, people that entered the market, the sense of urgency that existed to retain your housing. for that particular group coming in, they never experienced that. and so their decision making is just more on a comfortable pace of own, alex time for me to do this. we always attempt to create that sense of urgency in some markets. we continue to have that sense of urgency. but it has been a slower decision making process. we have seen with that two at a times velocity, and this is where i mentioned. hopefully, by the time we get on the call next quarter, we'll be able to give you a real comparison of this year to prior year, that will enable us to start to have a feeling or a projection of where we're going to end up. but with that particular group of freshman and as well as sophomores and juniors, we now see a velocity that 2.5 times trending by the end of june, july, we should be at a point we should be able to have some indications as to how far we're exceeding last fall, and that goes across the board.
as it relates to new incoming first year students, there is two positive things. one, the common app data that we mentioned, in terms of an increase in applications of the first-time students. and secondly, and probably more importantly in our partnerships, is colleges and universities returning to their housing expectations and requirements that they had waved during covid, which should be the bolster in that particular category.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
okay, perfect bill. so that leads into my second question. from across your portfolio, especially the comment about the geographic differences and return to normalcy, what are you seeing from the schools as far as full restoration of sports, extra curricular, yeah allowing fraternities, and so
[indecipherable] basically, how much are you seeing schools go back to full operations? or is your view that maybe some of your portfolio would be full operations, some will be sort of limited number, i'm just trying to create -- get a sense for how much the schools are doing on their part to try and really restore the fun college experience that's [speech overlap].
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
the most important policy we're seeing first is housing, and the schools are going to a restoration of normal housing activity and policy. secondly, when you look at major athletic events, and i do think you know was a pretty successful year overall for collegiate athletics from where we started at the beginning of the pandemic to what we saw in the completion of your major athletics, especially with march madness just having finished up and having a successful college football season, where they actually crowned the champion.
some schools have announced full occupancy at sporting events. and so, we have seen some begin to go all the way back to normalcy. others, we're seeing that are now staging that coming in line, but everything is positive movement more toward normalcy. this is where you may see some of the vaccine requirement help universities put these back into action. and so, it's still somewhat influx geographically. the good news is every announcement that has been made has been positive, whether it's in texas, florida, california and massachusetts, all announcements have been incrementally positive in moving back more toward in-person activities of all kinds versus where they were.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
okay, thanks, guys.
operator
our next question comes from austin wurschmidt with keybanc. please go ahead.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. bill, to that the one of those last points, can you just put a finer point on what percent of your schools have reinstated through the on-campus housing mandate for first year students.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. every -- all the -- we are in formal partnership with are going back to their normal expectations and requirements. and so within our portfolio, at this moment in time, barring any changes, we have seen a 100% that they're going back.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. thank you. and then as far as dpc, you discuss the potential to reach the underwritten yield by may 2023, which i think is when the final kind of 10 phases delivered, but at what point do you think you could achieve the targeted yield on those phases one through five that deliver by the end of this year to the extent that the program is reinstituted later this year?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, we don't have clarity at this point in time on that. and again, certainly, looking at mr. chapek comments, we think that by the end of this year we can begin to see the reinstatement. what that ramp up is through '22 and how it may hit pro forma is just too soon for us to have clarity into being able to convey to you what that might be.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. and then just last one for me on the balance sheet and sort of leverage. we've seen it tick higher. but as we start to lap some of the comps and refunds of last year, how do you see that ratcheting down and how do you plan to manage that as new development opportunity start to emerge for maybe 2023 and beyond?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah. austin, this is daniel. first, just on the normal recovery in those leverage ratios. we continue to lay out what we believe our pro forma leverage ratios will be as we fund out the development pipeline. the current development pipeline, which currently all that is remaining is the disney project. throughout '22 and into the fall of '22 is when we actually expect to see that full recovery in ebitda to bring it back down to the pre-covid levels, which at this time if you were to eliminate the negative impacts of covid, we'd be around seven times, low sevens, debt to ebitda. but with the capital recycling and/or other types of equity type capital raises that we lay out in that $177 million and $377 million range between now in 2023, that would bring us on down to the low-sixes, high-fives that we plan.
so we don't have -- we're willing to be patient and allow that recovery in ebitda to occur and to execute on attractive cost of capital transactions that will move that debt to ebitda and debt to assets ratio back into our targeted ranges, and not do something that overly dilutes the nav of the company just to get there more quickly.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
i appreciate the time. thank you.
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from anthony paolone with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
anthony paolone -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning. bill, just wondering if you can walk us through your view on when the core noi of the company gets back to 2019 levels? i'm just trying to size up, like you've actually had some rent growth even if you have some occupancy slippage. so i'm just trying to get a sense maybe as we look past 2021 as a transitional year?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, we certainly -- we certainly believe as we get to fall of '22 that we believe will be very close to a complete return to normalcy in that -- and by that time with some -- hopefully rent growth and revenue growth in that area will certainly be back to the pre-covid numbers. again, it's just too soon for us in terms of being able to build in a reliable expectation for this fall through the first three quarters of '22 that are relying upon this lease up to be able to have full clarity. but certainly, as we think about the lease up in fall of '22, and where the university policies have been and what we've seen in consumer behavior, we do think by that time it is reasonable to expect that we should be in that position.
anthony paolone -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
right. do you need for occupancy to come back, you've had some rent growth over the last few years?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. and obviously, it's the combination of rent and occupancy to get to that number. we will always utilize the lams program to do that. we have mentioned that the on-campus beds, where we had the vacancy this fall were at a higher rate, so we should get an average revenue per bed uptick from that as you see the recovery. and so, certainly, the combination of the two, but to granularly say how much is going to come from each one, we can't do with this time, but certainly i think by fall of '22 we should be there.
anthony paolone -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
okay, and then just on the supply side, can you comment on what the supply picture looks like for '21, '22 in your markets? and also whether there is -- whether the developers are starting new projects? or there is capital available for that right now?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, let me let william talbot answer that question. william, go ahead.
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yeah. so as we've talked about in the past couple of calls for fall '21, we are seeing a slight decrease in supply, about 1.3% is where that ended up at the end of the day, and that's coming off a year where we saw 20% decline of supply, so continue to see that decrease in supply. and it's really driven by -- most developers are focusing on those pedestrian sites in the tier 1 major markets. and as you all know, if you've been to college -- those are typically very difficult sites, require assemblage, difficult entitlement -- environments typically are going up, so higher construction costs certainly in a more difficult, construction environment. so those really -- those barriers to entry that are naturally in close to universities is what's really constricting that development we're seeing in our market.
anthony paolone -- j.p. morgan securities, inc. -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
our next question comes from eric noll with evercore isi. please go ahead.
eric noll -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning, everyone. i guess, bill or daniel, can you provide an update on what you're seeing as it relates to the summer camps on the conference businesses. i think, daniel you've talked about the sort of $4.5 million in revenue kind of split between the second and third quarter, kind of based on kind of what you're seeing on the ground. how should we think about that segment over the next two quarters?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer
yeah, assuming you're right, in a normal year we had commented that we typically produce about $4.5 million of summer camp and conference business. and as we discussed, obviously that went away last year when we were in the middle of the early part of covid. schools have started to think about that, but honestly with the real goal in mind being keep an eye on the ball for return this fall and making sure that they don't do anything to derail that, we don't expect really much of any this summer. we do think that that will return in the summer of 2022. if there is any of year, we expect it to be very minimal and not a big dial mover in terms of earnings.
eric noll -- evercore isi -- analyst
got it. thanks for that. and then i guess my second one is, just from a modeling perspective. i know you've talked about expense growth being in the high single digits, especially next quarter and maybe into the third quarter. how should we think about maybe the sort of the items within expenses, whether it's g&a, utilities, payroll, kind of in the broader context of that high single-digit growth?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, if you think back to, or if you were to go back and look at expenses during the midst of covid, all of those controllable items, so excluding insurance and property taxes, we had significant savings across the board, honestly in the second and third quarter due to just a lot of activities ceasing, and so we would expect in the controllable areas to see significant growth pretty much across the board as we return activities to normal levels. we are continuing to deploy a lot of asset management initiatives across the portfolio that will help keep in our utilities expenses, but you're going to see the return or that higher growth level just because of the absolute savings we had due ceased activity in the second and third quarter, and then start to maybe normalize a little bit into q4.
i'll remind you that when we talked on last quarter's call, our expenses, when we looked at our internal budgeting for this year, overall, we're pretty much in line with what we had budgeted for 2020 pre-covid, and that's with $2 million to $3 million of anticipated spend on additional covid cleaning costs, and then of course, normal increases that are uncontrollable in property taxes, really significant increases in insurance, as you're hearing from a lot of operators just due to the insurance market we're all dealing with. so even despite those increased costs to be able to come in, in line with where we were expecting going into 2020, we've really taken a lot of benefit from the efficiencies we learned during covid and are bringing those forward into the more normal operating environment we're in right now.
eric noll -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, thanks, that's it for me.
operator
our next question comes from john pawlowski with green street. please go ahead.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
hey, thanks for the time. william one follow-up on the supply question. in terms of the shadow supply market post covid, do you expect any meaningful shift, either higher or lower from kind of shadow supply, perhaps apartments repurposed into the traditional apartment market.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
no, really don't -- i mean, i think the majority of our university markets are in these smaller college towns that don't have that shadow multifamily supply in the traditional sense that's catering to the conventional multifamily renters. so in the majority of our university markets, you don't have that flex. and then when you look -- take for example in market where we do have that, austin, texas, i mean the multifamily market continues to be on fire, and we have the benefit of being that location to campus. so we'll always have that premium even if the austin multifamily market were to soften, you've got that great benefit of being walk to class, whereas the further from campus properties could maybe see some softness from that.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
okay. and then second question for me on the berkeley master plan development. could you give us a sense as the plans are evolving kind of a minimum capital needs required from acc's balance sheet and maximum needs these next few years, as you guys go about the project?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
and again, this is billy. at this point in time, on the berkeley master plan, what transactions are third-party, what transactions are ace, how those play out. and again, this is a long-term planning process. this work is -- we look at the total scope could be over the next decade. and so, how much of that actually turns into ace and equity requirement is yet to be determined. we have a long runway. is it relates to as those decisions are made with the institution to announce that and to think about it in those context. but at this point, it's still too early.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, and john, i guess that reminds me. i think somebody asked a somewhat related question earlier that i didn't fully answer in terms of how we think about our funding and our leverage as additional developments become -- come to fruition beyond the current pipeline. and of course, we will look to match fund those, match time those, as we've talked about historically doing a better job of -- to maintain a more stable earnings growth trajectory. and so, we will look at all the forms of capital available to us.
we continue to have a great partnership with allianz in that 45, 55 jv structure we have with them. and we think that's a great alternative as part of our set of capital raising options to be able to contribute assets into and really match time, any kind of development activity we might have.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
all right, great. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from rick skidmore with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
richard skidmore -- goldman sachs & co. -- analyst
good morning, bill. just a question on the comment that you made in the press release around rent rates and in line to slightly ahead of a year ago. can you just talk about how you think about rent rate growth as you go into the fall academic year?. and going back to your analogy on the airplane, do rent rates go up as you get closer to that or do they go down?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. and certainly, the first comment that i would make is asset by asset, unit type by unit type, market by market, we look at what that velocity is and adjust rates accordingly. and so for example, i mentioned, we had several three to four dozen properties that were full this year, virtually at 98 plus percent. that's a different pricing matrix where we can still be aggressive as you would in a pre-covid environment. however, if you look at the broader portfolio as a whole, with approximately 100 basis points of occupancy diminishment from a normal year, first and foremost, we look at making sure that we make the occupancy gains and don't damage velocity by being too aggressive in rate.
and we also mentioned that the market as a whole, and in jennifer's comments in the release, are being patient in terms of understanding the difference in velocity. and so when you look at the portfolio as a whole, we do look at that more of a flattening of rents in this year as people are focused on making up those occupancy gains. so i would say it's very cautious, where you have occupancy upside and only being implemented in a normal fashion in the several dozen assets where we have normal fee based on fortress locations in demand for our lease up. we do, as i mentioned, to have a little bit more potential in that the return of occupancy in our on-campus assets that are higher price typically lead to an average rent per bed, it's a little bit of an increase over just the straight rental rate growth.
richard skidmore -- goldman sachs & co. -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
our next question is a follow-up from nick joseph with citi. please go ahead.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
hey, it's michael bilerman here with nick. so i was wondering if you can talk a little bit about, there is a number of student housing portfolios, some small, some larger on the market, deal activity is picking up. how in the reconstituted capital allocation committee on the board and management, how are you now evaluating those portfolios on the market today?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yes, first and foremost, michael. at this point in time, we are chopping wood and we're focused on putting the value of our own portfolio back in place in this lease-up [speech overlap] well, sometimes you should. but certainly, as we look, and the current focus is on returning that value in our own portfolio. we do believe that the bulk of transaction activity that you're going to see is going to be coming in q4 of this year, in q1 of next year as you see those values return.
and so, we will underwrite transactions as we always do looking at what is the growth rate of opportunities that there are before us based upon how much upside continues to be on an asset by asset, portfolio by portfolio in a post covid world and implement proper in investment when we can create outsized returns for our investors.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
i guess, are you looking at maybe activating more disposition activity today to put yourself in a position to -- if you wanted to be active in those acquisitions to have the balance sheet and all the capital necessary. so i don't know if that's part of the plan today in terms of selling more assets, looking at institutional joint ventures to really gain that capital and maybe also gain insights about where the market pricing assets today?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'll jump in on that real quick, michael. i think the first thing is we do have a capital recycling plan that we've laid out, obviously we would increase that if our cost of equity does make sense for investment. if we think there is an appropriate match funding, we can do with additional dispositions for external growth opportunities that have upside as bill talked about. right now, the important part is to let the student housing market restabilize.
we have seen cap rates hold in throughout the pandemic, but we have seen values that on stuff that has transacted, impacted by the current in place noi, and so both ourselves and the broader market want to wait and let that releasing occur for this fall and improve out more stabilized values that we aren't giving away value just based on short-term disruptions to noi. and so, i think you'll see us be able to be more specific about amounts and timing of dispositions as we get into this fall. and of course, any external growth opportunities that we would think makes sense from an upside standpoint, we would -- we would match fund with what we think -- whatever we think is the most appropriate cost of capital to create value.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
in terms of just being an operator as well as an owner, are you finding basically this institutional capital calling on you for some of these portfolio that in the marketplace where they're willing to be the 70%, 80% equity, but they need industry expertise and operational expertise, so i'm just wondering if there is -- are you being asked to partner in some of these deals to go forward?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, michael, there is always strong institutional capital interest in this space and certainly people that want to partner with american campus. as you know, we are running our own process and that we are very selective in terms of the partners that we will pick in terms of joining -- doing institutional joint ventures, and that we want to make sure that we're aligned in terms of asset characteristics and term and whole periods, the line with us. and so, we get quoted all the time by the capital that's coming in, but we are very selective in terms of who we are looking to partner with.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
okay, thanks for the time.

operator
good day, and welcome to the american campus communities q1 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to ryan dennison, senior vice president of capital markets and investor relations for american campus communities. please go ahead.
ryan dennison -- senior vice president of capital markets and investor relations
thank you. good morning, and thank you for joining the american campus communities 2021 first quarter conference call. the press release was furnished on form 8-k to provide access to the widest possible audience. in the release, the company has reconciled the non-gaap financial measures to those directly comparable gaap measures in accordance with reg g requirements. also posted on the company website in the investor relations section, you will find an earnings materials package, which includes both the press release and a supplemental financial package. we are hosting a live webcast for today's call, which you can access on the website with the replay available for one month. our supplemental analyst package and our webcast presentation are one and the same. webcast slides may be advanced by you to facilitate following along.

with that, i'll turn the call over to bill for his remarks. bill?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
thank you. ryan. good morning, and thank all of you for joining us as we discuss our 2021 q1 results, an evolving operating environment. as we commented last quarter, 2021 will be a year of transition on the path back to normalcy. and as overviewed in our release last night, we are off to a good start.
the results for the quarter exceeded our expectations at the property level and for the company overall. with noi and earnings per share beating our projections in q1. and operationally, we continue to see stability this quarter. collection rates for the first quarter were 97.3% consistent with the fourth quarter of 2020. request for assistance under our resident hardship program continue to decrease, totaling only 750,000 for the quarter. student request for refunds at on-campus communities also continued to decrease, with refunds only being provided at one university, totaling a net refund of just $1.3 million this quarter. we expect the need for refunds to continue to decline through the remainder of the current academic year and do not expect refunds to continue into the new year academic year this fall.
increased spring leasing and less seasonal attrition led to the lowest reduction in fall to spring occupancy that we have seen in recent years. another positive sign of improving consumer sentiment. we're also pleased with our ability to continue to control operating expense growth despite the impacts this quarter of the extreme ice storms in february, which resulted in over $800,000 net of insurance proceeds in repairs and maintenance cost, and increased utility expenses in texas, oklahoma and other affected states.
turning to pre-leasing for the 2021-22 academic year. as we mentioned last quarter, and consistent with what has been reported by our private peers in a third-party market research, pre-leasing across the industry continues to lag behind the traditional pre-covid pace. however, as we anticipated, we have begun to see significant acceleration in weekly pre-leasing velocity compared with the prior year. now that we are into the leasing period when activity slowed dramatically early in the pandemic last year.
since march 12th, our weekly velocity of applications, renewals and new leases are running approximately 2.5 times the same period prior year, with a significant amount of leasing left to do before the next academic year begins. we'll continue to utilize our proprietary lams platform and in attempt to maximize rental revenue.
on our next earnings call in july, we should be in a position to disclose a more meaningful leasing comparison to the prior year. and at that time, given early indication as to where our final occupancy may be. while we remain cautiously optimistic that we will experience increased occupancy levels for fall of 2021 over the prior year, we continue to believe that we will not fully return to historic occupancy levels this fall. and at this time, the range of final fall occupancy and overall financial outcomes is still too wide for us to provide full year earnings guidance with a reasonable and useful range. as such, at this time, we're providing guidance for the next quarter.
we do want to thank the analyst community for their efforts, since our request on last quarter's call to better incorporate the seasonality of our business into their quarterly estimates, despite what is obviously a very difficult environment in which to project earnings. with regard to our disney college program development, as some of you may be aware, on their last earnings call, disney ceo, bob chapek, commented that they have been very pleased with future park bookings. and at the recent annual shareholder meeting, he conveyed that the disney college program is a tremendous asset and that they are hopeful that the program will be back in business by the end of the year. based on these public comments and our ongoing conversation with walt disney world management, we now believe that once the college program is reinstated, that the ramp up in occupancy may well occur at a pace that ultimately allows us to meet our targeted stabilized yield of 6.8% by may of 2023 as originally anticipated prior to the would pandemic. we will, of course, provide additional updates as disney plans for resumption of the program continue to develop.
turning to on-campus p3 opportunities, we are seeing early signs of university administrations beginning to focus their efforts on the future monetization of on-campus housing post covid. during the first quarter, we were awarded a new project to renovate kelly hall 1960s-era community bath residence hall located at drexel university. and we commenced construction on another third-party projects at concordia university.
we continue to believe that both ace and third party on-campus development opportunities may well be greater in a post covid environment, as universities prioritize their limited capital on academic and research infrastructure, and as older community bath residence halls are taken out of service, given the negative consumer sentiment and economic impacts of dedensification during the covid pandemic.
i'd like to congratulate the acc team for two national development awards this quarter. first, our leadership in sustainable development was recognized by the national association of homebuilders with the pillar of the industry award for the best green market rate multifamily community for our development of plaza verde at uc irvine. this was not a student housing specific award, but rather, was selected from among all multifamily developments nationally. also in the student housing category, the academic and residential complex that we developed on the campus of the university of illinois, chicago received the pillar of the industry award for the best on-campus student housing community.
lastly, i'm proud to announce that we recently published our 2020 esg report, which can be found at esg.americancampus.com. we have always attempted to positively impact the lives of our residents, from fostering academic achievement to nurturing health and wellness. in 2020, we took great care in making our communities a haven of well-being during these challenging times. as outlined in the report, acc earned a leed platinum certification for lightview at northeastern university in boston. this is the company's 38th project that has earned or is tracking leed certification. in addition, the company completed its first greenhouse gas emissions inventory to inform future target setting, and we entered into renewable energy contracts at six communities for a projected 11.4 million kilowatts annual. additionally, the company published employee demographic data, demonstrating our commitment to diversity and inclusion, with over half of our team members being female and over half of our team members being minorities. we're very proud of our efforts to bring value to all stakeholders, and look forward to what the future holds for our company.
with that, i'd like to turn it back over to the operator to start the question-and-answer portion of the call.

thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question today will come from neil malkin with capital one securities. please go ahead.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
hello, everyone. good morning.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
good morning.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
nice to see your stock in the green after you report earnings.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
always.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
yes. the first one, you talked about 92% to 94% for the fall, academic year 2021, 2022, you're at 91.7% now. the data we're looking at with adeo, which i'm sure you see, is that the pacing from sequentially month-over-month continues to be very strong. it seems like that's a pretty conservative estimate. i think it wouldn't be too hard for you guys to get to the high end. can you just maybe talk about what goes into your 92% to 94% range? and if you could actually get to the high end or maybe higher what you're baking in, etc.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
hey, neil, thank you. and the 92% to 94% range is where we believe, based on the current trending and the data we have for us at this moment that is probable that we will end up. we're very pleased, as we've talked about on the last couple of calls, the critical thing was that inflection point where we were able to cross over last year's pace and start to trend ahead. we had talked previously at nareit in prior calls about that 2.5 times rate that we were prior year velocity. that has slowed a little bit, as you expect at the end of the leasing season, it was about 2.0 last week.
over the next four weeks going forward, last year, we brought in about 1,000 applications. and so the training is we should do a little better than that. and so -- the last part of that, obviously, is then managing no-shows, which in a typical year is 40 bps to 50 bps, last year bumped up over 1%, we expect that to return to normal. when you take all those things into consideration and do the math as we're doing on the current statistics we have, that 92% to 94% is where we fall in and would expect to be.
the other thing that we are very pleased with or watching cautiously is the ace properties that we have on campus to colleges and universities where the universities administer the assignment, the move-in and the process. in that particular case, we're very pleased, in that we're at least near 98% on those.
and this is the first move in, the universities will be orchestrating to full capacity since covid commenced. and so we're watching that move in closely across the country in terms of the university's effectiveness of getting everybody in properly managing attrition. there's probably a little more risk in that category than there would be in a normalized year, given some of the lingering concerns. and so all those things combined is why we think that range of occupancy of 92% to 94% is a high probability of where we expect to be.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
okay. thank you. the other one for me is related to acquisitions or external growth. so i guess the first part is some other real estate asset classes are, you've talked about, very strong or accelerating transaction activity just due to sort of more certainty people bringing things to market due to potential tax changes. so i'm wondering if you guys are seeing that, if you expect to see that kind of pick up toward the end of the year and how you're -- the jv growth 2030 plays into that?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
yes. and certainly, the other sectors, we've been following the multifamily and the incredible progress that you're seeing there. so student housing is lagging that sector real estate for sure. and it's what we've talked about for the last three calls. everybody is waiting to complete this lease-up, have nois improved to the point, the valuations are stronger, and then we would expect to see more transactions coming into the marketplace.
and so you've all been very patient our shareholders and as in following us, and we're close to getting beyond this fall to where i think we'll put to bed many of the concerns over what were short-term impacts on covid and we'll start to see valuations begin to firm back up as nois improve this fall.
and certainly -- i'm sorry, the second part of your point as it relates to our plans. we certainly continue to move forward with our strategic capital platform initiatives, and we'll be in a position when it makes sense to execute on when there may be advantageous opportunities in the marketplace to create value for you all.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and the next question will come from jeff spector with bank of america. please go ahead.
jeff spector -- bank of america -- analyst
hi. good morning and congratulations on the quarter. just wanted to ask, i guess, thinking about the 2022, 2023 school year, i don't know if it's too early to ask, any key initiatives, anything different, any way to approach the school here versus, let's say, last year or the prior year maybe to capture some of this pop in demand this past quarter?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
yes, jeff, great question. the one thing in analyzing all of the data related to this year's lease-up versus historical lease up, and i mentioned this in my comments in the script, with students now being back on campus and university on-campus housing being back at full capacity versus last year, the mid-60s or where it was, having students back on campus, having the ability to resume in-person marketing, having the opportunity to implement our exclusive sports marketing program, where you see us in the stadiums around the country in our larger markets, we did see a diminishment in early leasing velocity as compared to our peers.
typically, we outperform in that area in november through february, about 12% to 16% in a given year. this year, our spread and velocity over our peers was lower, it was more 5% to 6%, and we directly attribute that to not being able to implement all the programs we have in on-campus in-person and sports marketing. and so having the students back on campus, especially those first year students, gives us the chance to more aggressively implement one of the marketing areas where we have unique proprietary advantages.
and so one of the things coming out, and we talked to you all on past calls in terms of we're saving marketing dollars because we're doing completely social online, we're seeing that the in-person sports marketing program really did pay dividends to us as we look at the velocity in the periods of those first year students being on campus. and so we're really happy to kick that back off again and why we mentioned in our comments.
jeff spector -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. very good -- great to know. and then i'm sorry if i missed this. i know at nareit in june, you discussed 60-plus opportunities to work with universities looking to modernize housing. i'm sorry, did you mention already? or if not, can you discuss the pipeline as of today?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
yes, and we haven't issued any additional numbers, but what that -- the $60 number that you saw in the presentation there at nareit and also that i covered an interface a couple of weeks ago. and as we've said, definitely, we have now seen the universities as their management of the covid period is much more an ordinary day-to-day operation for them, and they're now focusing on the future.
and we have seen the awards that we were working on pre-covid kick back into full swing, and we see the vibrant pipeline that was representing those 60, which is significantly above what we had seen in the pre-covid taking place. and so that particular sector of our business, we do see post-covid as emerging with equal or better opportunities than we had prior to that.
jeff spector -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
next question will come from nick joseph with citi. please go ahead.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks. how are you thinking about atm equity issuance versus asset sales going forward? and then is the capital allocation committee involved in equity issuance decisions?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer and secretary
yes. nick, i'll jump in on that. this is daniel. certainly, when you look at what we did during this quarter, we've talked about having a capital plan as part of our recent development deliveries and ongoing under construction development of raising $60 million to $120 million a year in equity-type capital, whether that be through dispositions or common equity.
certainly, when we were active on the atm this quarter, we were looking at where we were in the lease-up, but prior to kind of at the end of the quarter, we were still trailing the prior year. we certainly had some uncertainty around it for what the ultimate outcome for this fall would be and what the disposition environment would be like if things didn't go or didn't return as much as we had hoped for the fall. and so we thought it was prudent at that point to go ahead and get at least the bottom end of our capital plans for this year addressed with the $60 million at a valuation that we think represented a good value relative to navs at that time.
of course, now that it is looking like things are going to continue their march toward normalcy this fall. i think everyone, including our own opinion of nav is changing, which certainly changes that calculus a little bit. we do believe that capital recycling through dispositions is going to be an important part of our longer-term capital allocation strategy. and we think that there's going to be a strong bid for student housing assets which will provide an attractive opportunity as we go forward to use that. so of course as always, we'll continue to evaluate stock versus dispositions and the cost of two different options represent to the company in which source of capital provides the best balance of achieving good value creation while also allowing us to manage toward our longer-term leverage targets. but we do think that it is important to include capital allocation -- or capital recycling as part of our longer-term capital allocation strategy going forward, especially when you look at what we can monetize assets relative to the development pipeline that they would be used for. and to answer your question, yes, all of that is a significant conversation that we have with the capital allocation committee on the board.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks. that was very helpful. and then i know rent collections have moved up a lot. but can you just remind us on the bad debt policy, what amount of non-collected rent is included in revenue in a given quarter?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer and secretary
so we typically run in the kind of 90 -- mid-97%, 98% in terms of uncollected rent during that quarter. of course, as you move on from the quarter, you continue to collect and those ultimate collections do climb. in a normalized environment, we ultimately end up annually about 80 to 90 bps in terms of bad debt. right now, for 2021, we think ultimately we'll probably be in the range of 120 to 130 bps in bad debt, but quickly see that returning to our more normal historical levels. one of the things that allowed us to outperform during this quarter was we were expecting to have about $1.5 million in potential abatements under our resident hardship program, especially as we move into the summer months. and we only had about $300,000 in requests for abatement under the resident hardship program. so we've really seen a diminishment in the need for that and are very hopeful that, that will diminish to really negligible levels as we move into the new academic year.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks. and then if you're looking at what's the outstanding delinquency that hasn't been collected but has been assumed in earnings? do you have that number?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer and secretary
yes. well, i mean, as we reported, we had collections of 96.8% this quarter. it was a little higher in the first quarter, a little over 7%. that is not abnormal to see collections a little lower in the second quarter because you're moving into those summer months, and you have kids that leave for the summer. and as you can imagine, that sometimes results in their rent being late. and so not anything out of the ordinary, but ultimately, we still believe that those collections will -- that 96.8% in collections will drive ultimately about 130 bps of ultimate bad debt for the year.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks.
operator
and the next question will come from derek johnston with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, good morning, everybody. given what you're seeing in the market with your university partners as well as the lease-up at disney, do you feel confident that acc's pre-covid so january 2020, that your pre-covid 2022 earnings power is fully intact at this juncture?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
sorry, derek, i missed you a little bit there. you were saying by when it would be back in line with january 2020?
derek johnston -- deutsche bank -- analyst
no. so back in january 2020 before covid hit, clearly, you had expectations of what your earnings power would look like in 2022. so the question is what you're seeing in the business now between university partners and disney, are you confident that acc's pre-covid 2022 earnings power is fully intact?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
yes. i mean, i think by the time it's hard to compare, and i know this isn't how you're completely asking it, but if you look at where we were in january 2020 in terms of what kind of ffo we would be producing on a run rate basis, that was, of course, before we had delivered the fall 2020 developments and started delivering disney. so as we come out of covid, we're really going to leapfrog where we were at that point in time, because of those new development delivery. when you get to december or fourth quarter, i guess i would say, of january 2022, because of our prominence around expecting to be returning to more of a normal level of earning -- or of occupancy in the portfolio, we think that we will be on a same, same basis back in line with what we had originally targeted for the portfolio by that quarter. we continue to have decent rental revenue growth throughout covid. so, it's really about getting that occupancy rate back to historical levels. and then obviously, on top of that, the accretion that we've added from the new developments we've delivered throughout the covid time period, including disney, as you referenced.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. no, that's very, very helpful. and then, just sticking on disney. how is the tenant reception at flamingo village been trending? any anecdotal surveys or feedback that kind of gives you confidence that the roughly 5,000 units can stabilize around year-end, this year-end?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
yes. i mean from a tenant satisfaction perspective, i mean, the residents are elated. and as you all will see with what we've announced in terms of an investor day in september. this is a new phase of quality and living environment for the disney college participants versus the historical housing that the disney had been master leasing. and so, we were, actually the executive team, was just there several weeks ago. and the -- basically, what we have done, and you all will see this for yourself. we have now provided the type of customer service and living environment that the disney interns are delivering that mission for disney, we're giving them each and every day when they come home. and so, it's really taking a little bit of the disney magic and bringing it into the community in which they live. and honestly, my words won't do it justice, you all need to show up in september and see for yourself and talk to some of those residents.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks, bill.
operator
and the next question will come from john pawlowski with green street. please go ahead.
john pawlowski -- green street -- analyst
thanks. one follow-up to nick's question, maybe for william, can you give me a sense for how anticipated pricing of dispositions was shaking out as you weighed selling assets versus issuing common stock?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer and secretary
and we've talked about in the market. cap rates in student housing have held pretty consistently through covid at that low to mid-4s. and in most cases, that was off a slightly impacted to noi. now as we look forward and we start to talk about this increase in transaction volume that bill referenced, there is a deep investor base. and then, we look at it relative to what's happening with the multifamily cap rates, do we think forward, you could see that compression in cap rates coming? yes, that's something we're going to be watching very carefully and as we can make future decisions from a capital recycling and disposition versus equity or other costs, those are the things we're going to be weighing. but they've really held and kind of been pretty consistent in that -- the core pedestrian type in that low quarters. but we do think going forward, there could be an opportunity to see that compression. and that's obviously something that we'll be weighing when we weigh how we look at capital recycling in the future.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
and for us, john, it's about increasing the noi going forward into the fall, so that we can maximize valuation on dispositions from the recovery that we're in the midst of conducting.
john pawlowski -- green street -- analyst
sure. but the product you brought or potentially would have brought to market on a value, just total value perspective, what kind of pricing did you see versus pre-covid values?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
yes. i mean, consistent. certainly, cap rates were consistent. like we said, your noi could be slightly impacted by covid, as you saw the overall portfolio, but those valuations and cap rates have came fairly consistent.
john pawlowski -- green street -- analyst
okay. last one for me. if supply growth moderates as you expect, i believe you referenced 20% decline next year and the positive tailwind on demand continue, is there a reasonable scenario where you can push rental rate growth above the historical track record of plus or minus 3%. is there anything different this time around for the typically coupon flipping nature of the portfolio?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer and secretary
yes. let me answer that short-term and long-term. from a longer-term perspective, over the next three to five years -- one to five years rather, you do have tailwinds given the supply situation and also if these record admissions continue beyond one year. where from a pure supply demand perspective, we're going to probably have more pricing power than we have in the prior five years.
next year for us, we got to wait and see where the vacancies end up in the portfolio this year, in terms of how our average rent per bed growth going into 2022 pans out. and part of that benefit you see in the 3% to 3.5% this year that we've been talking about is that average rent per occupied bed drove that number up as our more expensive beds and the on-campus p3 beds returned in their occupancy.
and so when we're looking at the projection of occupancy that we have in 92% to 94% at the end of the lease up, we got to look at where those vacancies exist and as we recover occupancy where the average rent or better those vacant beds are as we move into '22, there could be a little bit of a drag on overall rent growth next year as we push forward. and so that's a question we'll be much more apt to answer once the lease-up is complete.
we see what beds are filled, what beds remain vacant to get a better picture going into '22, but long term, certainly, the diminishing supply, coupled with the admissions and enrollment that we're seeing should lead to a better pricing environment for the industry.
john pawlowski -- green street -- analyst
all right, thank you.
operator
and the next question will come from alexander goldfarb with piper sandler. please, go ahead.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
hey, good morning, and i totally agree, i mean, the drop in supply, the growing enrollments and all that stuff that we heard at interface is pretty incredible for the industry. so bill, along those lines, first question is greystar had announced that they sold a 49% interest -- 49% interest in the former edr u.k. stuff. as you guys look at dispositions or capital recycling and especially with the amount of capital that we hear all wants to come into the sector, etc, do you guys see an opportunity now to maybe include some of your ace deals as part of that, whether -- not outright sale probably but joint venturing, is that something that you would now consider based on the greystar execution?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
yes. that is certainly something that is in our realm of consideration. and doing it in the manner, it's very important because, again, as we've talked about over the years, when these universities are entering into these partnerships, it is very much qualitative who they're choosing to a partner that they're hoping to be a long-term partner through the life of that relationship. and so being able to capitalize the value in those transactions, in selling a minority joint venture interest where you maintain control. and in the eyes of the university who their partner is not changing, is absolutely the preferred way to do that. and so yes, to answer your question simply.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
okay. so we may see you guys actually joint venture some of your ace?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
yes. that's very much a possibility as we look at how to best raise capital most efficiently going forward. but what, again, would always be the situation where we're maintaining control position for our university partners to be able to rely on us.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
okay. and then second is -- and bill, i understand that you're not making any comments on next year until you see how this year goes, but your outlook that you guys provided certainly exceeded the consensus same for third quarter. so as you guys look at your outperformance in the second quarter and what you see that goes into those numbers for third quarter and for the full year, is it more that things are better from a top line growth perspective, meaning better disney, better rents, better ancillary income, or is it that a lot of the negatives that you guys endured over the past year, a lot of those negatives quickly unwound and therefore, you just had a bigger increase in margin because the negatives were removed. i'm trying to understand, is this more a top line that's really driving everything or the elimination of a lot of the negatives that were dragged over the past year?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
it's a combination of both. and as you heard in our script comments, i mean, the outperformance in this quarter, first and foremost, just driven by the sheer volume of students leasing for the spring and the summer. we also -- we were very pleased. we've been talking about next gen over the years also.
and one of the things that we were very pleased with this quarter is we backfilled about 85% of our short-term banding leases, where typically that's historically been about 50%. and so part of that, we believe, is good demand coming back. the other part of it is we are getting more sophisticated in that current period leasing administration, that you've always seen in our fall releasing competencies.
and so certainly, top line -- but then also, as daniel was talking about the resident hardship program and some of the lingering cost impacts, we have seen those start to evaporate. and this is something going back -- and alex, i know you were at the national student housing business conference last week or two weeks ago, the investment thesis for this space, which has always been on the stability of cash flows and the resiliency. as you go through our comments, the first time we pointed this out was in fall of 2020, when you saw our collections from july of 2020 by september of 2020, rebound 500 basis points back to 98% collections, right in the midst of the pandemic, and now you see this quick diminishment what that speaks to is the ability of students and parents to recapital the funding of their education through loans, grants and the like. and so we think the long-term investment thesis you're seeing prove out through the challenges that covid has put out there.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler & co. -- analyst
okay. thank you, bill.
operator
the next question will come from steve sakwa with evercore isi. please go ahead.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
yeah. thanks. a lot of my questions have been asked and answered. but i'm just curious, bill, a lot of your apartment peers have been using a lot of smart home technology to drive incremental revenue and also cut down on operating costs. and i'm just curious what you guys are looking at or testing within the current portfolio? and how do you see that unfolding over the next couple of years?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
yeah. and certainly, when you're building a new portfolio or a new facility, for example, when you get into disney, you're getting some of our modern buildings, the amount of technology and operations management that we're able to build them from the design phase is substantial, which really also helps drive the esg. obviously, in the older portions of your portfolio, that is a little bit more difficult to do so. i previously mentioned, steve, as we look at technology in the areas of operations, the customer experience, obviously, covid did help advance a lot of those interactions in terms of how we speak to our existing residents on a daily basis and communicate how they're able to transact and do work orders with us. and so those things do continue to advance.
as i did mention, the one thing that we have kind of had an affirmation of is given the unique aspect of our student that is in the college market for four years and how we reach them and how the cycle comes, the face-to-face in-person interaction with them in the marketing and leasing process is something that in statistics we're seeing the value in the dividends that, that has paid. and so we'll continue, like all the companies in real estate to look at from an operations and a customer experience perspective where we can continue to employ those systems and how we can use to start benefiting one of the ones just top of the mine. one of the things in our business where technology has always come into place ahead of multifamily is key management and electronic locks and it is how you deal with that and the customer experience for lockouts, things of that nature. and so we'll continue to exploit those anywhere that it makes sense and is good for customers and good for us.
steve sakwa -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thank you.

[operator instructions] the next question will come from austin wurschmidt with keybanc. please go ahead.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. with the equity capital being more attractive today and you guys have now reached sort of the low-end of your range in terms of the equity capital raise that $60 million to $120 million you referenced, daniel. do you and the capital allocation committee still think it makes sense to move forward with the joint venture platform this year? or could we see that announcement push in 2022?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer and secretary
no. and that is something that we are committed to and continue to move forward. i think it is a very prudent move given the types of opportunities that are going to be before us. and so that's something that continues on pace.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
so, i know you just mentioned kind of ace assets are a consideration to sell into the joint venture, but how are you prioritizing what assets may go into that new platform. and then i'm also curious, have you guys had any inbound inquiries to acquire any of your ace assets and just trying to really gauge what the demand is from the open market for those types of assets?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer and secretary
sure. well, one, the -- anything we talk about a joint venture regarding ace assets would be more in line with, for example, with the joint venture we have with allianz, the 55-45 we're in control. when we talk about the strategic capital platform, that's the addition of a 90-10, 95-5 joint venture where we are a minority noncontrolling partner in that regard. we've always had people inquiring and showing interest in those ace assets.
as you all know, they are highly attractive to institutional investors. its coupon clipping, consistent, resilient income and income growth, and so, that's something that if and when we decide to transact on a joint venture fashion, there will be no shortage of desiring students.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. and then, just last one for me, on sort of the leasing and attrition. i'm just curious, bill, i appreciate the range that you've given us both last year's attrition and historically what that's been.
but can you put a finer point on what you've assumed for the 92% to 94%. and have you started to see any signs of early cancellations at this point? and then, i was also wondering if there's any differentiation across the 68 universities you guys are at, from a leasing perspective?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
yeah. and as we have talked about on numerous occasions and calls prior to this one. data and business intelligence in this lease-up is more difficult, than it's ever been, because last year was such an anomaly and you can't utilize the pre-covid historical data, to draw any type of future trending.
and so as i mentioned in my earlier comments, when we talk about that 92% to 94%, all over the real-time assessments that we do in terms of what is our current outpacing a prior year velocity, what did that prior year velocity last year look like and apply, assume that, that multiplier holds true, which we have no way to know it's going to hold true.
that's why we're so nervous, up until it crossed over in july. and then we look at putting on that trend, backing into what we believe will be a more normalized no-show management. i mean when we look at our expectations for no-shows this year. we do think that particular segment of our business should return to normal. and we should be in that area about 50 basis points.
and so, when we look at the current statistics, where we are now and what the trend is at the time we did this release, the math turns into that 92% to 94%. and so we are giving you the most analytical, sophisticated approach to that projection that we can, in this unique environment based on the data and the training we have at the moment we're putting it out.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. and then, any differentiations across schools, worth noting?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
the one thing and i think this is where we're probably the most optimistic in terms of a return to normalcy being in full swing.
and that's the statistic we gave where our mlas -- sorry, our on-campus ace properties that are administered under mlas marketing and licensees by the university, being at 98%, that encompasses schools from cal, berkeley, across the country.
and so seeing that type of geographic resurgence regardless of what the classification or what their methods of managing covid were throughout the year, that's the one indicator to me that is the most profound in terms of, ok, with all those students coming back across the country and being in person, in their housing on-campus, that begins the normalization of the feeder cycle into leasing as it usually exists.
as i mentioned, about being able to get in person, those marketing activities back in place, and should begin the normal cycle. and so that's why we're -- we continue to be bullish on 2022.
the only other thing i'll point out that we are monitoring is, we do -- geographically, we'll see how things go forward. we are a little slower in portland, in minneapolis, and some of the places where there was civil disruption. and so we're certainly monitoring that, to make sure there's no long-term impact from that to linger beyond this year.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. thank you.

with that, i'll turn the call over to bill for his opening remarks. bill?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, ryan. good morning, and thank all of you for joining us as we discuss our 2021 second quarter results and the improving operating environment. as we've noted on previous calls, 2021 is a year of transition toward a return to normalcy. the fundamentals of our sector continue to strengthen, and we're quite pleased with our progress this quarter. in q2, our operational and financial results significantly exceeded our expectations with noi and earnings per share beating our projections. specifically, quarterly rental revenue and ancillary income, including parking fees, utility, retail income, among others, were stronger than anticipated. this was primarily driven by a higher volume of students signing leases for the spring and summer 2021 terms. secondly, the ramp-up of initial occupancy at our community serving the disney college program has been very strong. since the dcp program recommenced only two months ago, we have already moved in over 3,200 students. and we continue to project 85% occupancy by the fall for the 4,996 beds delivered through phase 5. and finally, rent collections have largely returned to normal historical levels. on-campus rent refunds and request for rent relief under our resident hardship program continue to decline and are anticipated to be insignificant in the 2021-'22 academic year.
turning to pre-leasing. velocity for the 2022 same-store group surpassed the prior year's pace in early july and is now 310 basis points ahead of the prior year. the guidance we have provided for the academic year '21 lease-up assumes strong opening rental revenue growth of 5.1% to 7.6% based on an occupancy range of 92% to 94% and an average rent per occupied bed growing at 3% to 3.5% for the '22 same-store group. as we presented at the national interface student housing conference two weeks ago, the long-term fundamentals of the student housing sector are strong. while we're extremely pleased with the progress, we have made as we discussed in last night's press release, lingering short-term impacts of the covid pandemic are hindering a full return to normalcy this fall. as evidence of the strengthening fundamentals in our space, we're once again seeing significant demand for on-campus housing.
for our on-campus ace properties, where the university administers the lease-up, we are nearly 98% pre-leased. we'll be closely monitoring move-in and attrition rates at these communities as these universities are administering their first full capacity move in since the commencement of the covid pandemic. looking forward, we remain optimistic and continue to anticipate a return to our historic range of occupancy for the 2022, 2023 academic year as the long-term fundamentals of our sector are strong and appear to be gaining tailwinds. specifically, these tailwinds include record admission applications at the four year public and private universities we serve and target, universities nationwide resuming in-person academic and social activities and reinstating their on-campus housing policies for first year students in the fall of '21. this will once again allow us the opportunity to implement our in-person and exclusive sports marketing program activities as we kick off the 2022 leasing season.
the tailwinds also include a significant downward trend in national new supply continuing at least through the 2022, 2023 academic year, including a currently projected decrease of over 20% in acc markets. and finally, university public-private partnership opportunities to modernize on-campus have returned and are exceeding pre-pandemic levels. this environment provides the company a unique opportunity for earnings growth and net asset value creation based on the prospect of robust internal growth and high-quality external growth in the years ahead. turning to capital activities. during the quarter, we renewed our corporate revolver, extending the maturity to 2025 and improved our borrowing costs by 15 basis points to libor plus 85 bps. further, the updated facility demonstrates our long-standing commitment to esg by introducing a sustainability-linked pricing, whereby the borrowing rate improves, if the company meets certain esg performance targets, each year. in fact, we believe that we're the first u.s. listed reit to have included a performance component tied to each of the three pillars of environmental, social and governance.
also, we raised $60 million of equity proceeds during the second quarter at a weighted average price of $49.05 per share, which was in line with analyst nav estimates at the time and was allocated to the funding of the ongoing construction of our 6.8% high-yielding disney development. we thought it prudent to derisk our balance sheet, given that our pre-leasing status was lagging the prior year at that time. there was and continues to be uncertainty that existed around derivative covid strains and the lingering impact of covid as previously noted. in closing, we'd like to announce our plans to host an investor day at our disney college program housing development in orlando on september 23 of this year. we're very excited to showcase the project and other important initiatives underway within the company.
with that, i'd like to turn it back to the operator to start the question-and-answer portion of the call.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from samir khanal with evercore. please go ahead.
samir khanal -- evercore -- analyst
thank you everybody. good morning. so bill or daniel, can you provide further color around the 12% to 15% growth for next year? i mean, maybe walk us through kind of what are the assumptions behind that range? and also, just curious, if you do end up doing better than that range of 12% to 15%, where do you think the upside would come from?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer
yeah, samir, this is daniel. i'll take that. and obviously, we're not ready at this point to give too much additional detail in terms of guidance for 2022. we did want to put that 12% to 15% out there for folks as we do have some foresight, obviously, through the remainder of the current academic year that we just completed the lease-up, which takes us into the third quarter of next year and the really attractive revenue growth that we'll be able to deliver from that.
when you look at kind of inflationary expense growth that we assume probably in the 3%, maybe 3% to 4% range, we should be able to deliver same-store noi that compares very well to other sectors. and so obviously, you also have the accretive contribution from disney as additional phases come online and we get a full year's contribution from that ramp up that we're seeing at disney. so we wanted to help people understand whether or not the recovery was reflected appropriately in the numbers they had put out, and we felt like that, that helped to clarify that a bit.
samir khanal -- evercore -- analyst
okay. and then i guess my second question is around -- i mean, you provided some color around dispositions of the $200 million to $400 million, that's part of your plan. i'm just curious how are you kind of selecting those assets that you're looking to sell? i guess, why does it not make your criteria? and what is the cap rate we should be applying to that bucket?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yeah. part of what we're considering in conjunction with those dispositions. in some cases, we're looking at the analysis of an outright sale, but also selling into a 55-45 joint venture in terms of assets where it's appropriate to harvest some of the value that we have created out there. but the growth rates are substantial to where we still want to have that coupon clipping income going forward. so certainly, anything we would -- we look to be selling would be in the low fours, consistent with where we're seeing market cap rates trade and accretively put that into the current and ongoing developments that we have.
samir khanal -- evercore -- analyst
that's it for me. thanks, guys.
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
thanks, samir.
operator
our next question comes from neil malkin with capital one securities. please go ahead.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
good morning, everyone. great job. very pleased with the preleasing results, obviously a testament to everyone on the team and jennifer as well from her operating ability, so congrats on that. first question and i think i've been asking this to you guys for a couple of quarters. but can you give some updates or any clarity on the growth 2030? if you're close, what does that look like, size? has anything changed given the, i guess, if you want to call it, pull forward of recovery or elevated investment capital looking in student housing or potentially lower supply environment making you more active? so if you can just maybe talk about your thoughts and plans there?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yeah. certainly. and the first component of that is the 55-45 joint venture structure that we talked about in contemplation of this immediate $200 million to $400 million of our own capital recycling and having that platform in place to be able to execute on it. the additional effort continues to go well. obviously, the team has been very focused on the lease-up and the delivery of this. william and his team are running that process, and we are well down the road and do expect to have it contemplated by the end of the year and look forward to moving forward with it. we think there's great opportunities for us as we go forward from a growth perspective in terms of bringing more assets into the portfolio that we can create outsized returns for our investors in that joint venture structure.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks. i just want to be clear on, you said the 55-45 that is -- what is that relating to? because i thought the growth 2030, that the jv was going to be like a 90-10 kind of --
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yeah. there's new -- the broader component of pursue growth 2030 initiative is broader than just one jv of 90-10. and also, we look at the existing jv structure we have with the allianz, where we had already transacted earlier in some of the austin assets. and we look at that as part of the strategic vehicle in terms of assets that i previously described, where there's still good growth to continue to harvest, but there's also an opportunity in the current environment to sell into and take some of the chips off the table with the value that we've created.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
okay. got you. i appreciate that. other one for me is related to development. so i think historically, you guys have delivered around $300 million of developments annually. and i think it's -- you're obviously lower than that in the $100 million range, i guess, over the next couple of years, i think you might get to $200 million in 2024. can you just talk about how you see that pace and when you expect to get to and probably pass that $300 million per year, just given, again, the strong fundamentals and the accelerating interest from the universities for housing revitalization?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yeah. and this will be a post-covid ramp-up of a -- a little bit of a slower nature than you've seen in a non-covid-impacted environment. one, as you saw prior to covid, most of the transactions that we were developing on balance sheet were indeed on-campus p3 transactions. and that is where we see the best accretive yields. it's also in an environment like this, which is related to land cost, construction pricing, where you have better opportunities to structure transactions where we can achieve our yield. certainly, the colleges and universities we mentioned over the last 18 months had a pause in moving forward with many of their processes as they dealt with covid and the reopening of the campuses.
as we've mentioned and as you now see proof of on this call, the universities are now focusing beyond covid and you're seeing that activity ramp up. but those development deals do take time to come to fruition. and so, the dip that you see at this moment in time is directly related to that little bit of pause. we see more demand than ever we mentioned in the script in terms of the number of transactions that we see coming on that front. and so there will be lots of opportunity. but when we look at the natural development cycle and putting assets into place, it's really two to three years out before you see those historical volumes start to come back into play.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
yeah, appreciate that. thank you, guys and great quarter.
operator
our next question comes from nick joseph, citi. please go ahead.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks. as you look at your rent roll for this fall, how many december leases are there versus a normal year? and how do you think about backfilling, i guess, for the second semester beginning in january?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yes. nick, we've got about 40 bps of additional december ending leases than we typically do. actually, it's about 30 bps, looking at the numbers directly. in most cases, those leases are at markets that have not fully recovered from covid. and so there's still upside in occupancy and the ability to backfill. i will note that on the interim leasing update that we did, we did put a footnote in the leasing table taking into consideration two things. it's slightly elevated level this year, but the bigger issue was how much leasing we continue to do last year as it related to q1 and q2 that we could see some tempering of given the success of the fall lease-up, and so we talked about -- when we talked about the 8% in rental growth in q4. we tempered that and said probably 6.75% to 7.75% in q1 and 5% to 6% in q2, taking that aggressive leasing that took place last fall that was a little abnormal and coupling it with that.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thanks. that's helpful. and then just on the asset sales, with the fall lease-up complete, where are you in terms of identifying and marketing the properties? and when would you expect them to actually close, either the sale or jv?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yes. and we are very excited that we have hit the point. there are two things have occurred. one, the restabilization of our portfolio and the industry has taken place. the other thing, and if you've been at the nmhc student housing conference a couple of weeks ago, student housing had not yet seen the compression that you've seen in multifamily. really cap rates stayed consistent throughout covid, but we haven't seen that benefit. and so hopefully, we'll also see now with the institutional capital in the space, with all the questions about the industry put to rest and the investment thesis in full stack then you're beginning to see some of those transactions take place. and so we're very bullish on the ability to execute. we do have properties identified within our portfolio as it relates to outright dispositions and/or harvesting value in joint ventures. and that's something we think we can move along in the first two quarters of 2022.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from alexander goldfarb with piper sandler. please go ahead.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey good morning. good morning. i feel like the kid sitting in the back of the class a little bit confused on what's going on. so, i have to raise my hand and ask the professor. you guys talked about accelerating $200 million to $400 million of dispositions. you also have jvs outstanding that you want to execute, but i would imagine the jv would be for more than just $400 million of assets because that would only be maybe four or five assets at most.
so can you just walk through big picture, what we're looking at? there's the joint ventures, there's the accelerated $200 million to $400 million, so i don't know if that's going to be executed later this year or that's something for '22, but just as we can conceptualize these different components that are going on that you guys are thinking on the external side?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer
sure. alex, let me jump in on that. i think what bill was trying to explain is how we think about both the capital recycling side of the equation and then the opportunity to deploy that capital into pursue growth platform opportunities. and so what we're talking about in terms of the $200 million to $400 million, you should expect to see us do that in a similar fashion to what we did with the austin portfolio, where we sold a 45% interest in the assets and that would represent the $200 million to $400 million in proceeds to us. the pursue growth 2030 strategic capital platform that we've talked about where we would make a minority 10% investment into a larger joint venture platform to go out and buy assets, we've said we expect that to be about $1 billion platform, where our investment would be about $100 million. and we expected that to commence next year, potentially be in place by the end of this year with activity starting next year. and we do think it will take a couple of two to three years to fully deploy the capital available in that platform. and so that's how you should expect those two different initiatives to take place.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. so it's a dp, just thinking about that. so the $200 million to $400 million, if we think about it basically a 50-50 jv, it's basically on a gross basis is double that amount. and then separate, you have this new jv, ok, now we're all set. and as far as modeling and thinking about timing, as we think about our 2022 estimates, that $200 million to $400 million, dp, you would -- should we think about that something later this year, early next? or is that...
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer
yes. yes, that was something bill commented on earlier that we would expect that to be in the first two quarters of 2022. we are already talking with different potential investors in that portfolio under a joint venture structure. and so just wanting to work through and get the best terms for that partnership that we can get.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then the second question is, in the opening comments, i think bill referenced supply is down a 25% reduction in your markets at interface. the main takeaway there was supply is going to be less than half of what it was back in 2013. so one, the 25%, is that the same base year as 2013? just trying to figure out if it's different base years or if this is what the whole industry is doing, which is everyone is gravitating toward the flagship school. so it's really the tertiaries that are seeing the dramatic drop in supply and then as everyone shifts to the flagship schools, supply is still dropping. so i'm just trying to figure out which is which. if it's a base year thing or if it's a geographic thing on the changes in supply?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
no, and certainly, when we talk about the 25%, it's directly related to our portfolio versus the national numbers that axiometrics get. i would say there is a flight to the blue chip institutions, and certainly the power five conference schools. i got to tell you, the industry fundamentals that we talked about on the call are what we are really sitting here excited about.
when you take these things together, one, the increase in first year student enrollment being at 7.5% over last year and 6.4% over '19 pre-covid, that is the pent-up market. most of those students have not yet benefited the private student housing market. that is the group of students that are moving on campus this year for the first time that will then migrate off campus over the next three years.
and so when you look at the supply demand equation coming down to the level that it is, typically, if you look at our historical chart, those of you that have sat in our meetings over the year, we have the pie chart that has shown enrollment typically growing at 1.2% -- or i'm sorry, supply growing at 1.2%, enrollment in the area of that same 1.1% to 1.3% and really more of an equilibrium in the industry.
when you now look at those charts for the first time, in our own portfolio, you see enrollment up 1.5%, supply 0.8%, the biggest differential we've ever seen. and then when you look at what was really driving most of that 1.5% is a first year enrollment number of 700 bps, that indicates what the future trend is. and so this is something we're most excited about is the trending of that differential in the decrease in supply with that first year enrollment as that evolves through over the next three to four years.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
and bill, just to confirm, the 25% reduction in the acc markets, that's based also off that 2013 peak year?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
no. that's -- this is last year to this year, fall '21 to fall '22.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. excellent. okay.
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
you bet.
operator
our next question comes from austin wurschmidt with keybanc. please go ahead.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody and thanks for the time. i was curious with the increased competition in the sector. what's kind of your view in terms of how that changes the landscape or opportunity set to do off-balance sheet deals in sort of that 40, 40 -- 45, 45, 10 joint venture? and then i was also curious if you could share what percent of the p3 backlog could fit within that joint venture, as i know you've talked about expanding the opportunities in an off-balance sheet structure in terms of the schools you'd be willing to do development deals then?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yes. let me start backwards. as it relates to on-campus ace transactions, those particular transactions we would not undertake in a 90-10 joint venture where we are the minority partner and that kicking off those relationships and those transactions, it's critical for us to be in a majority partner role in dealing with our universities. but rather, when we look at the ace portfolio that we have, we look at the recapitalization of those being better suited in the context of a 55-45 joint venture, where we sell a minority interest, we maintain the majority partner position with the university.
and candidly, we think that can be a plus in university saying that that's how we monetize those investments and that they're always hoping that acc is going to be their long-term partner versus selling out of those transactions. sorry, the first part of the question?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer
yes, the other thing i want to make sure that there's not any confusion on austin is, anything we would do in a minority interest joint venture, the 90-10 growth opportunity joint venture that we talked about, you referenced maybe going to schools where we wouldn't do it on balance sheet, that is not at all the investment strategy of that joint venture. we would continue to target universities that meet our core investment criteria. it's just that we want to reserve any capital that we raise from capital recycling for on balance sheet for.
we think the most attractive capital allocation opportunity we have right now, being that ace on-campus development. and we would then use that 90-10 off-balance sheet joint venture to do more off-campus development or acquisition-type opportunities that still meet our core investment strategy, but just from a capital restriction standpoint, doesn't make sense for us to do on our balance sheet right now.
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
and as it relates to the competition for those transactions as you brought up, there is indeed a lot of capital in the space and it is competitive. the other thing that has taken place, though, and we've talked about this in the past, and i think you're going to see it coming to fruition in the years ahead with the influx of capital into the space. you've seen most of the transactions that have been done have been recapitalization of existing portfolios, not direct sales.
and many of the folks that previously were merchant developers in the space are holding assets for the first time, building their operating platforms for the first time and operating larger portfolios for the first time. and so merchant developers now have all switched to wear their holders of three to five, seven years and then they'll look to harvest value. this reminds us of the early days when we were public, and you saw significant noi growth from us in terms of the m&a deals that we were doing is that we still believe our greatest asset in creating value is the incremental value that we create in our operational platform and occupancy, pricing sophistication. and so as we pursue transaction in that arena, that's what we're looking for.
we're looking for what are the assets that we can underwrite differently than anyone else because of the value that we can derive from our portfolio. and more of the product that is being developed and held out there is in the context of being able to pursue those type of opportunities.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
got it. and i thought that, just to be clear, that you were looking at a broader set of more third-party development opportunities that you would undertake within a minority -- with a minority interest to generate some additional fee income?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
no.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. and--
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yes, the nature of that, i mean, what you're speaking to is really what we do on campus in the p3 utilizing the bond financing structure or universities funding themselves where we are the fee developer. and there are more opportunities on campus for that business just as more schools are undertaking modernization.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
so, next part, so with sort of the recovery in fundamentals quicker than you had originally anticipated and now sort of the plan to accelerate the dispositions to improve the balance sheet strength, sort of what's the appetite or need or thoughts around equity today?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer
look, let me say this, austin. right now, both if you look at the market over the last few months and honestly, our own opinion, our nav has increased substantially. we were in a very different place earlier this summer before our leasing had surpassed the prior year's leasing levels in terms of being confident about the recovery in the operating environment in the business.
now that we have seen that take place, as bill said in his opening remarks, we've seen analyst estimates of nav move up in the 50 to 60 range, with the upper half of that really being driven by people making -- using assumptions that are based on a more normalized level of noi, which we think is appropriate at this point in time. we are basically there in terms of the amount of noi we're producing relative to 2019.
and when you look at on a same property versus same property in 2019 basis, our rental revenue for 4q of 2019 is growing, so -- or 4q of 2021 is growing. and so we would tell you that our belief is nav is up in the higher end of those ranges that are out there. and so our board and management team are focused on returning the stock to nav and in no way, shape or form are we interested in issuing equity at these levels. and that's why we gave the additional disclosure around our plan for increased dispositions in 2022.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc -- analyst
that's great, color. thanks, daniel.

good morning and thank you for taking my question. i appreciate all the color around nav and strategic capital platform. thank you for that. my question is around these two new project awards that you talked about, emory and university of texas. could you perhaps give some color on us understanding scale as we think about modeling them? i mean are we looking at, say, a princeton as a benchmark, $6 million? or are we looking at concordia as $1.3 million? i mean, how should we think about what the size of beds ultimately could be broad strokes?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer
yes, chandni, obviously, that is the difficult part when we announced these new third-party transactions, they have, at this point, been awarded to us, and we're in a position in the process with the university to announce those, but we are still working on the ultimate project that we will develop for the university. and so that's why you see those tbds where we're not able yet to disclose what the fee will be because it all depends on the ultimate size of the deal.
when you look at really though the average transaction for us, they're typically about $3 million in fees. the recent one we announced, you see on our page s10 in the supplemental at drexel university, that's a renovation. that's a smaller project, just under $2 million in fees.
if you look at one of the larger ones, i think in usc -- uci, that's up in the $5 million range, those are kind of the ends of the spectrum. and so your average transaction tends to be more in that $3 million range. and so -- and when we're still working through the ultimate project size, with university and not ready to disclose to you yet, that's what you should just assume and on average, should work out.
chandni luthra -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and just an extension of that, for instance, $3 million would be in fourth quarter and the rest through the construction process, is that correct?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer
when you say the rest being through the -- oh, yes, the rest of the fee being recognized through -- typically, it's about 50% upfront recognized and then the remainder is recognized throughout the construction process.
chandni luthra -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and then my follow-up question is generally around inflation and supply chain headwinds that are sort of omnipresent across the economy right now. i mean you gave some color on inflation. but as you think about all these projects that you're undertaking for growth, i mean how do you think about, a, perhaps just the ability to get product and how that impedes your own economic calculations as you think about just returns on these projects going ahead? thank you.
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yes. no, the supply chain challenges are certainly something that is factored into each and every transaction. and one of the things that you have to do is maintain flexibility on the front end and we sit on both sides of the table at times as an owner in contracting and also as a service provider to universities in delivering those things.
and so the process you have to have in place and as an owner developer is have flexibility as it relates to your requirements and specifications and knowing what you can get versus what you can get at it's emerging. you got to be well into the process in terms of maintaining that.
from a fee provider perspective, we protect ourselves in terms of force majeure in making sure that we have the ability to implement those changes in specifications. and as an owner, as we design and think about it, we take those into consideration how we approach the design of them.
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer
yes, the other thing, chandni, that i'll point out for you that we talk about quite often is why we like on-campus development transactions is, it does give us the opportunity to work with university to help manage through increased construction costs in environments like this. the universities at the end of the day have a desire to deliver modern housing for their students on their campus that make them competitive.
and one of the triggers that they can pull to help facilitate those projects is in terms of what they basically charge for their land through the ground rent payment that is applied to the transaction. and so when we see an increase in construction costs, we can work with the university to reduce that ground rent and make a transaction feasible to basically achieve what they're trying to accomplish, which is deliver modern product at a price that is affordable and acceptable to their students.
chandni luthra -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you for the color and congrats on a great quarter.
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
thank you.

our next question will come from derek johnston of deutsche bank. please go ahead.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi everyone. good morning. given the widely reported university endowment performance and growth in 2021, are you seeing increased interest in third-party development with maybe legs? and are universities considering deploying some excess returns into updating their on-campus housing? and how well positioned do you feel acc is to capitalize on this trend or any trend beyond the two recent wins?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yes. and while that's certainly a plus for many universities in terms of the performance of their endowment, we are not seeing universities typically earmark their capital for ancillary development, which housing is now falling into. and they're preserving their capital for academic and research. there are exceptions. for example, princeton is funding the transaction there and so you will have some schools that do have the wherewithal just to write the checks themselves, but that's not the norm.
and so most of the transactions that we are pursuing and those that are hitting the street are not university-funded, but rather off balance sheet for the university in the form of either project-based revenue, tax-exempt bonds that we have done for decades or the equity model. and as we talked about in our comments, we do see those numbers to continuing to increase post covid. we're now tracking more than 60. and we feel the company is better positioned than we have ever been in that space, especially being the only public company left pursuing that business that gives us a real alignment and transparency with the universities.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. great. second question. it looks like on the supplement page 8, you call for a return to pre-pandemic leasing next summer. so we expect you're referring to summer camps, conferences and revenue drivers along those lines. so what's giving you confidence that summer 2022 can bring the camps back on campus and pretty much return to pre-pandemic activity at this time?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yes. and many of those camps are tied to university athletic programs. in many cases, they ran by the coaches, and so they tend to go hand-in-hand with the campus activities that take place around sports, band, cheerleading, all those type of things. and so with the return this fall of all those campus activities, we're seeing a ramp-up in plans for those camps and conferences to come back.
derek johnston -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from john pawlowski with green street. please go ahead.
john pawlowski -- green street -- analyst
thank you. william, for the three development projects that are confirmed to be ace on the supplemental mit, berkeley, and north eastern, can you just share the latest thinking on stabilized yield assumptions?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yes. the -- as we continue to work with those universities, and again, mit could potentially be third-party or ace. but we continue to target that 6% development yield range and we're -- as bill said, on a number of comments, we're able to still achieve those ranges, because we're working with the vested partner of the university through ground rent and other levers to hit those even when you've got an escalating development cost environment. so those yield targets have not changed at this point.
john pawlowski -- green street -- analyst
okay, great. second question for jennifer or william, just curious about your strategy for setting rents at disney in an environment where traditional multifamily rents continue to spike in orlando, will you be increasing rents in the market aggressively or should we expect kind of 2% to 3% rental rate bumps similar to traditional student?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yeah. this is bill. and as we've talked about, disney was completely modeled the same as an on-campus ace transaction, it fits that structure. and also -- and so, in that regard, it is a coupon clipping 2% to 3% inflationary rental revenue increase on an ongoing basis.
john pawlowski -- green street -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from joshua dennerlein with bank of america. please go ahead.
joshua dennerlein -- bank of america -- analyst
yeah. good morning everyone. just one maybe a follow-up on the disney project, it looks like you hit about 85%, which i think was your forecast for this fall. i'm curious, is that something that you can continue pushing as we get to year-end?
or is there something seasonal about the disney internship program and when interns might enter the facility?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yeah. no, we will continue to work with disney on increasing occupancy through year-end and then going into 2022, that's something we're forecasted, too. if you go back to and we originally talked about the program, we expect that project to average 93% occupancy throughout the year.
it will ebb and flow as they have moved in and moved out, but that's certainly our expectation as we get into 2022 and beyond and get to more normalized operation and occupancy.
joshua dennerlein -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and is that 93% built into that 12% to 15% ffo growth for 2022?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer
yeah. this is daniel, josh. it is. as we've said on recent calls and continue to expect and probably are even more confident in, we expect disney to basically be on pace with its original pro forma underwrite for the full year 2022 and that is at that 93% average occupancy.
joshua dennerlein -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, awesome. maybe one final one for me, for the third-party development awards that you got this quarter, were those projects you started working on pre-covid or something that kind of came up during covid?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yeah. they were both projects that we were tracking pre-covid, but really those processes, the awards all occurred during covid really in the last, call it, three to six months.
joshua dennerlein -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, awesome. thanks guys.
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from nick joseph with citi. please go ahead.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
hey. it's michael bilerma, here with nick. bill and daniel, i just wanted to sort of follow up on equity and nav and sort of just step back for a second. i'm sure you look through the reit sectors.
and you sort of look at the self-storage or industrial or nh, the gaming reits even from the apartment reits, that are trading at premiums to nav and obviously then have that extra cost of capital in their equity to drive accretive external growth.
and daniel from your comment on the call saying that, -- i think you said something like there's no way, shape or form that we're interested in issuing equity at these levels, effectively targeting an nav in the high 50s.
and you're selling assets, doing joint ventures to take advantage of the price of the assets relative to the price of your stock.
i guess, at what point do you sort of step back. and say, if the market's not willing to give us as cost of capital that the market is giving to other specialty asset classes. i guess, like what's the end game?
like, is this a six-month process, a 12-month process? just sort of help me reconcile those things?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yeah. and certainly, i'd say we're pleased to be at a point in time, where the questions about the industry's emergence from covid are finally being cleared up. and as i mentioned, we have not yet seen the cap rate compression that some of these other sectors have seen certainly multifamily. and we think that was some of the overhang from the initial response universities had to covid that created some misperceptions on the investment thesis. with those being put to bed and the recovery taking place quicker than people anticipated, all the positive trending, we're seeing with the tailwinds, we would expect people to look at the current discount to nav and think it's a great opportunity to own the stock. and certainly, now it's time for us to execute as we go forward. as daniel said, we're going to sell into this market now to harvest the value on that $200 million to $400 million, attempt to drive the stock to nav and implement it. we want to see how everything plays out.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
so it's basically and the timing of asset sales you think are -- i guess point like if we're sitting here, is it next june that you start to reevaluate? i'm just trying to understand what the next decision point process is? and i know your hope is that the stock trades at nav, but it hasn't been there pre-covid, right? i mean this is not a new phenomenon for acc, at the same time that you see all these other specialty asset classes continue to trade at premiums. so clearly, there's a disconnect somewhere.
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
yes. the differentiating factor, michael, is in earnings growth. and when you look at that pre-covid, it was 2019 that we came out and had the 5% earnings growth return after the last round of capital recycling, which again was the core -- noncore drive assets. now we're coming out of covid with an excellent earnings growth profile. and so with the tailwinds we talked about and that change in earnings growth profile, a lot of the investors are earnings per share driven and now they see the performance coming out of covid related to it, and we would expect that, that would be a key driver for the stock going forward.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
and then just in terms of that earnings growth, that 12% to 15%, can you sort of just break down broad strokes? how much of that is internally driven versus externally driven versus balance sheet driven just in terms of the different components? and i know as everything has reopened, i assume you're going to get more camps next summer and all the other rental income that comes with that, i don't know if that's adding 100 or 200 basis points. but just give a little sense of breaking it down that 12% to 15% growth?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer
yes. i think i'd say there's three components that are really the driver of that growth. one is, and i'd say it's about half of it is coming from internal same-store growth. and then the remainder coming from a combination of the accretive contribution from the disney phases that have been delivered. because you got to think about, we're getting a lot of extra accretion there from phases that were delivered and originally supposed to contribute noi in 2021 that are really just now ramping up as that program has come back here in the last few months, now contributing a full year in 2022.
the other area that we have some significant upside is in development fee income. when you look at our awards that we have, including both the new awards we got this quarter at emory and ut, but also in place awards that we had that we expect to start in 2022, we expect to be back toward that record level of third-party fee income we were delivering in 2019 in 2022. and so those are really the three components with about half of it coming from just internal core noi growth and the remainder coming from the other two.
michael bilerman -- citi -- analyst
all right. thanks, daniel.
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, treasurer

our next question comes from john pawlowski with green street. please go ahead.
john pawlowski -- green street -- analyst
thank you for taking the follow-up. bill, if the floodgates suddenly open up with ace opportunities, what is the maximum concentration to on-campus housing you'd be comfortable with in the portfolio?
william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
john, we have always talked about typically 30% to 40% being kind of an upper limit on our thoughts pre-covid. i think it's going to be interesting to play out and that so much of the development that we see being contemplated on campus is pure replacement housing in terms of modernization and not new supply. and so that is a trend that's very interesting in terms of the captive audience that comes with that first year residence hall housing that continues to make it very attractive. but ultimately, over the long term, typically, we have seen that be about one-third to a little over one-third of our portfolio. and i would expect the opportunities over the long haul over the next decade or two to be consistent in that regard of the ratio of two-thirds off, one-third on, but certainly something we want to close attention to, given the trending of what our capabilities are in that area.
john pawlowski -- green street -- analyst
okay. understood. thank you.

this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to bill bayless for any closing remarks.

william w. talbot -- executive vice president, chief investment officer
thank you, ryan. good morning, and thank all of you for joining us as we discuss our 2021 q3 results and the current operating environment. as you may recall, on our q2 call in july, we were still somewhat apprehensive as we had just surpassed last year's covid-impacted leasing velocity and the emerging delta variant was creating uncertainty around universities plans to move forward with in-person classes and a return of campus social activities. at that time, based on historical leasing velocity data, we continued to believe that the industry's covid recovery would not fully materialize until the fall of 2022. today, just three months later, we are extremely pleased to report that students all across the nation continue to flock back to their college towns and leased well into the months of august and september, and universities continued to press forward with their plans to return to in-person activities, including full attendance at college football stadiums across america. the result, the student housing industry has emerged from the covid pandemic in the fall of 2021 with its investment thesis fully intact and with the sector having tailwinds, the like of which we haven't seen in many years.
as outlined in our interim update earlier this month, we're pleased that the execution of our fall '21 lease-up produced an opening fall occupancy of 95.8% for our total portfolio and rental rate growth of 330 to 380 basis points for our 2021 and 2022 same-store property groupings, respectively. all these metrics are above the assumptions in the high end of our prior lease-up guidance. in addition to the extremely successful lease-up, our operational and financial results also exceeded our expectations in the third quarter, with ancillary income and operating expenses beating our forecast. in addition, the ongoing development and commencement of operations at flamingo crossings village, our community serving the disney college program, are also going quite well. during the quarter, we delivered the fifth phase of development and have now achieved 85% occupancy, in line with our expectations for this fall. notably, since the dcp program recommenced only five months ago, we have already executed leases with and moved in more than 4,500 residents, demonstrating the continued vibrant demand for the disney college program. our lease-up results and recent operational outperformance allowed us to increase the midpoint of our financial guidance by 4% to $2.08 per share, which is above the high end of our prior guidance range. based on the progress we've made this year, total property noi returned to prepandemic levels this quarter, a full year earlier than we previously anticipated.
and more impressively, rental revenue is expected to exceed prepandemic levels in the fourth quarter for our same-store properties from 2019. we now expect to grow earnings by 3% to 7% over 2020. all in all, the company's recovery and financial performance this year has certainly exceeded our expectations as cumulatively, we have exceeded our original guidance for the first three quarters of the year by $0.12 per share or almost 10%, as students continue to return to college campuses throughout the year. i'd like to now turn to the fundamentals of our industry. as reported by owners and operators attending the nmhc student housing conference earlier this month, occupancy and supply demand fundamentals of the sector are strong. and again, the industry is experiencing some of the most substantial tailwinds we've seen in many years. the broader comparable sector represented by the realpage/axiometrics 175 returned to prepandemic occupancy levels of approximately 94%, while also producing attractive rent growth of 2.5%. we saw robust admission applications at four-year public and private universities we serve and target. the strength in admission applications appears to have directly led to the highest level of first year student enrollment growth we have seen. in the 48 of 68 university markets for which we are able to collect first year enrollment data, there was an increase of 7.4% over fall 2020 and 6.4% above prepandemic fall 2019.
for perspective, for four-year public institutions, in the prior 30-year period, average first year enrollment growth was approximately 2%. this level of significant growth in first year students occurring this year indicates the emerging post-covid era demand from students wanting to attend high-quality universities in person and should provide significant recurring housing demand in the years to come. the record number of first year students, the reinstatement of on-campus housing policies and the resumption of in-person campus activities will once again allow us to implement our in-person and exclusive sports marketing program activities in the 2022 leasing season. historically, these programs have been an integral part of our early leasing season velocity outperformance and our final fall occupancy outperformance as compared to our peers. the significant increase in first year students led to the highest level of total enrollment growth in recent years, up over 1.5% versus academic year 2020 and prepandemic academic year 2019. in 62 of the 68 acc markets for which we've been able to collect total enrollment data, this represents the addition of over 30,000 students. sector tailwinds also include a reduction in national new supply, continuing at least through the 2022-2023 academic year.
this includes a projected decrease of over 25% in acc markets and represents the lowest level of new supply we have seen in over a decade. in total, we are tracking new supply of only 15,500 beds with only 1/3 of our noi being produced in markets seeing new supply. this compares to 55% to 67% of noi being produced in new supply markets over the last three years. we're also seeing significant demand from universities seeking to modernize their on-campus housing. during the quarter, we were awarded new third-party developments at emory university and the university of texas. and this month, we started a new third-party development on the campus of princeton university. in all, we are tracking more than 60 universities that are evaluating privatized residential projects, a continuing increase compared to prepandemic levels. in summing it up, we're extremely pleased with the progress that we and the sector have made in managing through the global pandemic. finally, with our sector's resiliency and investment thesis fully intact as we emerge from covid, institutional capital is once again focusing on the sector, with several notable transactions recently occurring in the space.
we are highly confident in our ability to fund our business through strategic capital recycling and free cash flow generation, while producing attractive earnings growth for our shareholders. with the sector's covid recovery now largely complete, we believe the current transaction environment affords us the opportunity to accretively fund recent and ongoing development activity and further strengthen our balance sheet in 2022. as such, we intend to accelerate $200 million to $400 million of disposition activity, which fully satisfies our projected funding needs. including the strategic capital recycling, we believe that ffom per share growth in the range of 12% to 15% is achievable in 2022. based on the positive fundamentals in the student housing industry and the accretive contribution from our ongoing development program, we are excited about the prospects for continued growth beyond 2022. we believe we are now well positioned to produce long-term earnings growth, net asset value creation and superior returns for our investors in the years ahead.
with that, i'd like to turn it back to the operator to start the question-and-answer portion of the call.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we now have our first question from the phone lines from alexander goldfarb of piper sandler. alexander, please go ahead.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, good morning down there. bill, maybe just focusing first on margins. i think you guys had said that from 2014 to 2019, you improved margins by about 300 basis points. i'm guessing that some of that was given up in covid.
so, one, how much margin degradation did you suffer with covid? two, where do you think that you'll end up? do you think that you will return to this 300-point exceed? and finally on that, given that you guys are doing less external, like you're not doing the big portfolio trades and all that that you used to do, are there any savings corporately that could also be layered on top of the portfolio margin efficiencies?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, alex. and as you appropriately pointed out and our investors will recall, we had a significant initiative starting in 2014 to improve margin. from 2014 to 2019, we drove 300 basis points from 52.7% up to 55.8%. we did have a diminishment last year due to covid where it dipped down to 53.7%.
and when you look at our guidance for '22, it implies a margin of 55.4%, so just about 40 bps off of the improvement that we've gotten to in 2019. and of course, that's trending with only four months of what we expect to be an excellent lease-up in fall of '22. we won't get the full benefit of that margin improvement until we move into 2023. and so, certainly, our expectation is to surpass the margin improvement that we had developed and achieved through 2019 and improve it going forward.
i'll let dp talk a little bit -- or daniel talk about that a little more in regard to your follow-up question.
daniel perry -- chief financial officer
yeah, alex. if you look at 2022 guidance, really on the headline g&a number, we are looking to experience about a 6% to 9% decrease in terms of our guided g&a. now granted that does include, in 2021 some, what we would call, not in the ordinary course of business charges specifically related to jim hopke's retirement and the vesting of his unvested shares and also some costs we incurred as part of the activism work with atlanta buildings. if you exclude those, we're still only increasing g&a in 2022 by 2%.
and so, certainly, we are seeing a slowdown in that growth that we've incurred here recently, but we also focus on g&a every year with the board. we do a lot of productivity studies, some benchmarking studies to see where we are. if you look at our productivity statistics in terms of g&a as a percent of revenues, as a percent of assets, i think we rank very well with regard to that and then specifically, when you consider the size of our company relative to other reits and where our ratio sits relative to all of those reits.
alexander goldfarb -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. and then the second question is on the fee development guidance. i think it's bigger in this coming year. i think, bill, you referenced the number of schools getting back into the normal scheme of third-party development.
so, i guess -- again, sorry for the two-parter. one, give us a little color on if those were only third-party considerations or if any of those were potential ace. and then two, the upside in the fee development that you're guiding for, for '22, is that sort of a one-timer, meaning in '23, it's going to go back down to some normal level? or is '22 a return -- so i'm trying to figure out how many of these projects were pent up and now the schools are doing them, but in '23, it would go back down or what you see in '22 for third party, that's actually what a normal run rate should be.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
sure. first, let's talk about the increase in the third-party aspect of those transactions. and when we look at the four transactions we talked about commencing development on, drexel and uc irvine, which are long-term clients, have always been -- uc irvine has always been a third-party client. that's been the financing mechanism they've used since 2002.
in drexel, the protocol has been we utilize ace on upper-division housing and third party on first-year residence halls, which they want to have a more vested interest in, which both of those products are. when you then look at princeton and mit -- and this is a little trend that we're seeing that we think is a positive for third-party revenue moving forward that we hope will begin to build a profile in years to come that will be above the prior levels. and that is you look both at princeton and mit and then also look at the announcements that we made previously on the award at ut and emory, all four of those transactions are graduate housing. and in part, what we believe is happening when you look at those particular institutions, boston, austin, atlanta, the cost of housing in metropolitan america is forcing universities to look at graduate housing and having to provide solutions.
and graduate housing has always been the most price-sensitive student housing market. typically, you've lost the support of mom and dad. you're more price-conscious. and so, in those particular transactions, the universities always want to use the lowest cost of capital available.
and so, in that case, there's a pretty good differentiation in terms of the cost of capital that they can float bonds at and/or that you can do credit enhancement on the project base that enable to get much lower rents for the graduates. ut, princeton, mit are all aaa. emory is aa2. and so, we do see a trend of more graduate projects coming beyond what the pre-covid expectation was.
and those tend to be third party. and so, as it relates to what the trend becomes post this year, we hope that you will see an escalation that continues to create a new stable bar, but that has to be proven out as we go.

thank you. we now have the next question from neil malkin from capital one. sir neil, please go ahead when you're ready.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
thank you. hello, everyone. great quarter, great guide, well done. first one, you had some success you called out in your sort of full fourth-quarter occupancy, obviously, subsequent to the start of the year at 95.8%, and you were at 96%.
so, i was just wondering, to keep alex's two-parter alive, one, what are some of the things that you did to achieve those occupancies? and then can you apply that -- especially with your sort of next-gen operating platform and techniques, can you apply that to future lease-ups and fourth quarters maybe get to sort of new highs in occupancy?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, neil. and you just answered the first part of your question with the second by bringing up next gen. and one of the things that you are seeing in terms of incremental, a little bit of a paradigm shift from our history, that last year, we thought, may just be a covid blip. but now -- having now two years of outperformance related to maintaining that fall occupancy and driving spring occupancy is a direct result of next gen.
and those of you that have followed the story long term, next gen originally was a system -- sorry, lams was originally a system that was solely focused on the very intense lease-up for the fall each year. and part of the development of next gen was to improve the current-period leasing, the interim backfilling of properties throughout the fall, the spring lease-up, the may backfilling with the same level of business intelligence and corporate support that went into the annual fall lease-ups. and so, we've now seen two years of improvement in terms of -- historically, we've been running about a 50% success rate of backfilling december-ending leases. this year, that was a 91% economic backfill.
last year, we saw may leases go from 50% to 85%. we haven't -- we have to go through spring to see if we have that level of success again. and then also, you've seen no-shows improve by about 10 bps. and so, you really look, there's been about $6 million of incremental revenue enhancement through the intensity of next-gen system, which creates significant value for us in that regard.
but also tied a little bit into dp talking about -- daniel talking about g&a, in that a lot of that g&a investment over the last several years has been in that next-gen system and now you're starting to see some of the benefits of that come to bear.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
no, that's great. thank you, bill. the other one, you talked about growth initiatives. obviously, we're successful at the -- selling the 45% interest.
but you also talked about where you'd be a 10% partner in sort of like a fund-like structure that something like prologis does and that was something that you wanted to grow and just to sort of take advantage of your skill set and the fact that asset pricing is very aggressive. i was wondering if you could maybe talk about how that's trended, if anything has changed in your mind and if you expect to announce anything from that fund or line of investments in sort of the tier 1 schools, the power 5 schools in 2022.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. and we certainly -- that initiative has moved forward at full speed. we have final partners selected in that regard. we're currently -- we're now starting to see some of the acquisition activity come to the market.
and so, we are beginning to actively underwrite transactions again. and any updates related to that particular venture, we would expect to announce when we have real transactions to talk about.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
ok. well, listen, thanks for the time, and i look forward to seeing you at our flamingo crossings event in orlando on march 23.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
we look forward to hosting you there.
operator
we now have a question from nick joseph of citigroup. sir nick, your line is open.
mike bilerman -- citi -- analyst
hey, it's actually mike bilerman here with nick. bill, i was wondering if you can just go through -- you talked a little bit about starting to underwrite transactions again. you obviously had the significant transaction with harrison street during the year and selling assets. i guess how are you thinking about -- now that the stock is like pulled off from that into your high, how do you plan to close the gap to nav versus using capacity to go out and deploy capital? i guess what is management and the board doing today to really get out of that discount? and what initiatives do you have going on to do that?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. and certainly, michael, i would say that -- let me quote you and your write-up last night, and i think you said it perfectly. and that is strong business execution is the best course of action to close the valuation gap. and so, certainly, we were very pleased in terms of the acceleration and momentum you saw in terms of the stock at the end of next year, moving very much close to nav.
i think we're actually at a 2.4% premium to your current nav at the end of december. and so, certainly, the geopolitical environment has had an impact on the broader market and on the u.s. reit index down about 11%. we certainly are there with them.
obviously, that's created a momentary disconnect. certainly, with the announcement that we have today and the acceleration that we have, and the industry fundamentals, pending the geopolitical environment getting resolved and correcting itself, we would expect to pick up on the momentum we saw at the end of last year and expect to see the performance of the stock move in concert with that. obviously, every decision that we make from an individual capital allocation perspective, whether it's in our own development pipeline or in the joint venture structure, will be handled in the context of how accretive it is to our investors in the long term. and the capital allocation committee is intimately involved in those reviews and processes.
mike bilerman -- citi -- analyst
i guess how do you think about -- obviously, executing harrison street gave you not only the mark on on-campus assets, but it also provided two years of funding for all the development and redevelopment. so, it secured both goals, i would say. now that your financials and the capacity -- liquidity is in place, i guess, are you interested at all, a, on buying back stock to help narrow the discount or accelerating additional asset sales or joint ventures just to continue down that path and provide -- and continuing to provide very strong capital cost to your shareholders?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think the -- starting with the end of your question. the one thing that we have heard from shareholders consistently over the last several months, they have been very appreciative of the thoughts that we are taking toward our capital allocation plan in terms of accretively self-funding but at levels -- at prudent levels that don't negatively impact the earnings-per-share growth profile that they have been waiting on for the last several years. and so, we feel as though we've been balancing that very well, and the asu transaction really gave us the opportunity to exemplify our ability to do that on the longer term.
i do want to comment a little bit on your point related to the asu transaction and that we are very pleased that we were able to undertake that. and a couple of notations about it. the price discovery as it relates to the on-campus ace assets that we have, first and foremost, the comment that i made in my script, it demonstrates that a well-structured on-campus equity transaction can be priced on par with off-campus, which we think was very important to demonstrate. the other thing that it pointed out, there's great diversity in the asu products among those eight assets.
there's two upperclassmen apartments, there's two fully immersed academic living-learning centers, there's a 1960s high-rise building redevelopment and renovation, there's a private off-campus apartment complex, and there's a greek village. and so, it really demonstrated throughout the entire product range of student housing that that price point can be achieved on par. and so, we think there's a lot of good discovery that took place in that. as it relates to your question about how much more of that would we undertake, again, at this point in time, our focus is on accretively self-funding and maintaining our earnings growth profile.
mike bilerman -- citi -- analyst
ok. just as a second topic, can rent growth in student housing keep up if inflation stays elevated? and is there a difference in practice in capturing higher rent growth for your on-campus versus your off-campus assets? obviously, you want to be a good partner to the schools, and so i wasn't sure if that imposed a restraint that may not exist for off-campus for the properties you own. and maybe just talk about the ability -- as you roll into the '23, '24 season, your ability to capture that excess rent growth that the multifamily landlords are certainly being able to capture today.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. excellent question, michael, in the context of the inflationary environment that we're in. i'd start by saying at the highest general level, the one thing we'd like to point out, certainly, when you look at covid's impact on rents overall in the residential section as a whole -- and certainly, you have geographic differences and product classification difference, but as a whole, multifamily was relatively flat for the couple of years during covid, and now we're seeing that explosive growth. student housing, as we've always talked about, which is the investment thesis, is even through covid, you saw a 1% rate growth, then 3.8% rate growth.
and we have implied rate growth, of course, in this guidance. and so, the thesis continues to be the same, of the consistency, of stability of cash flows without the volatility that you see in the revenue stream of multifamily, which we also saw through the great recession. as you talk about your -- the inflation question, the downside of student housing is that your rates are locked in for 12 months. and so, to the extent in the next three to six months, you see excessive inflationary growth, we're not able to reset that month to month like apartments can as they slowly roll on 8% a month.
we do, however -- and as you pointed out, in the off-campus market, we have all of the same abilities for open market pricing that you do in any other sector of real estate. and in the on-campus, one of the things -- and this is why you saw asu trade at the price it did. in all of our on-campus transactions, we always protect margin. and so, in the case of asu, there's no pricing limitations.
we're able to price rents as we choose based on the economic environments. and even at institutions where they were concerned about pricing and there are some collars in terms of how much rates can raise, in every one of those ground leases, we have margin protection to where we have a 12-month look back on inflationary expenses and also a look forward on budgets and have the rights to raise rents to protect the margin equal to those increases. and so, in actuality, how we will implement that if it comes into call will be market by market, assessing the ability to do so. but we do have the flexibility in how we structure the on-campus deals to treat them consistent with how we would off-campus.
mike bilerman -- citi -- analyst
just -- you mentioned nav a couple of times. street nav is at $59. we're using about a mid-4s cap rate. it would seem that your joint venture and certainly things going on in the industry would put that cap rate probably on the higher end of where real market is.
and obviously, you have a lot of other different pieces of the company other than just the asset value that could be attractive to others. i guess is there any plans to sort of put out a very detailed look at what you believe nav is when you take into account your development and redevelopment, your existing assets, the ventures, the fees, the management platform, all the things that are embedded in the entity? i guess is your plan to sort of put out a little bit more detail about where you sort of see value overall of the enterprise?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
obviously, that's a board decision to what level we would go through that process and have public disclosure. but certainly, it's something we're always looking at internally. and again, as we look at nav, nav is not something we think about at a moment in time. and again, i would point out to where we were at 12/31 in the context of nav and the trending.
obviously, the market is impacted today. we're always looking at the nav of the company in the context of future value that we would expect to be reflected in the stock versus where we're trading.
mike bilerman -- citi -- analyst
well, maybe there's some opportunities as we get to our conference in a couple of weeks to provide investors a little bit more granularity as to various values and whether the street is accurate or not. so, i appreciate it. thank you.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
thank you, michael.
operator
thank you, michael. we now have another question on the line from austin wurschmidt from keybanc capital markets. sir austin, please go ahead when you're ready.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. good morning, everyone. as you guys set the fall 2022 rental revenue guidance range, how did you think about the varying components? maybe the first-year residence halls in particular which i think were at elevated occupancy levels last fall relative to where you've been historically. so, curious if you kind of assume those sustained at elevated levels or reverted back.
and then just sort of backing into then a mid kind of 2% rate growth and occupancy around 97%. can you just give us some of the components of that, how you drew that up? 
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
sure. and as it relates to the on-campus ace, rental rate pricing was really unaffected by covid and remains consistent this year and going forward. and that -- and the recovery you saw, that was largely driven by recovery of occupancy as the students on the first-year basis came back to campus. most universities that we serve have always operated near full capacity in those residence halls.
and so, we saw that with the first-year increase in students maintained, and we believe it will be consistent. so, there's been stability as what you -- the returns you saw this year in terms of rate and occupancy on campus to pre-covid levels. and now we expect it to continue on in normalcy. as it relates to the off-campus market, that is all, again, as we always say, property by property, unit type by unit type, market to market, and maximization of rent at -- in each case on a -- driven by our systems.
and so, we do see -- the one thing that we -- jennifer commented in her remarks in the press release, that we do see the national trend in leasing has reverted to its pre-covid velocity. part of that is being driven by the fact that those large first-year classes that are on-campus are now back to the normal cycle. they're all on campus, they're attending all the sporting events, they're having all the extracurricular activities, and they're also back to the normal cycle of when they're looking for off-campus housing. and so, with the return of that market, that gives us the ability to utilize our systems off-campus to drive rents to the maximum level we can.
and you see that vary from inflationary to -- we always have several properties and markets we're able to drive rates as much as 5% to 7%. and so, you can see that our guidance implies, i think, at the midpoint about a 3.9% rental revenue increase. and so, we would expect it to be a healthy year in that regard.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and i wanted to switch over. so, when you guys last quarter provided the internal nav, i think you said high 50s, low 60 range.
and then you completed the asu transaction late last year. i'm just curious if there's been any movement in terms of how you thought about the cap rate you apply to the portfolio based on the price discovery in that transaction or what you're seeing -- i think you said sort of off-campus trading in line with that at high qualities and good locations. any change to kind of that internal estimate or range that you provided just last quarter?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. as you know, austin, we have always believed and always spoken that we believe ace should trade on par with off-campus assets in that vein. and so, the price discovery was to demonstrate to the broader investment community that the way that we structure our ace transaction -- remember years ago when you all would say, ""how did you lose that deal? how did you lose that?"" we always said because we never give on the premise of structuring these transactions so that they trade as real estate. well, we demonstrated that with asu.
and so, for us, that was proving up the value that we believe always existed. now, when you look at that 3.75% cap rate and you look at asu, it is a power 5 institution, a carnegie r1 institution, happens to also be u.s. news & world report's no. 1 most innovative university in america.
it has been metropolitan area, and it is fully integrated into their on-campus programs. and so, that does not -- that cap rate obviously does not translate to every asset of ace nor in our portfolio. and so, when we look at breaking down the valuation of nav internally, how we've always looked at it, you certainly have the components that are trophy assets like an asu, your best institutions. you then have to look at we certainly have products that once you move off-campus, that emulate power 5 and carnegie r1, but then we also have assets that are more rural college towns that aren't as well located as of the other.
and so, there's a great diversification in terms of those product attributes that we go through asset by asset. and i will tell you that for us, the asu transaction firmed up what we have always believed is the value of ace.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then just last one for me. i mean, with sort of the harrison street and allianz joint venture vehicles available to you, seemingly an attractive means of recycling capital. how large should we think about those two vehicles relative to the size of the wholly owned portfolio?
daniel perry -- chief financial officer
austin, this is daniel. i'd say that there is certainly appetite with both joint venture partners to do more. and i wouldn't say that there's a specific size targeted, but relative -- but more looking at it in terms of our annual capital recycling program that we've talked about in that $200 million to $400 million a year range. and so, of course, right now, we've got this year and 2023 addressed with the asu transaction.
but as we look to the future, we'll look to do more with them. and we might look to even expand the base of partners that we're doing stuff with. but certainly, more appetite from them, and i wouldn't say there's a specific size or limit on size that we're targeting with them but more of an annual program.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
understood. thanks, daniel.
operator
thank you. we now have chandni luthra from goldman sachs. sir, please go ahead.
chandni luthra -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good morning. congratulations on a strong quarter, and thank you for taking my question. as we start to think about the next leg of development looking beyond disney now that that's sort of toward the latter stages, how are you evaluating on-campus versus off-campus? what i'm trying to understand is, is off-campus -- is the appeal of off-campus perhaps a touch higher given inflationary environment and sort of just more room to perhaps raise rents there, looking out into 2023? how are you evaluating what the next leg of development could look like?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. and certainly, as we have previously communicated, our first priority from a capital allocation perspective, and certainly, in this environment, it is appropriate, is on-campus ace transactions. we still have some excellent pipeline of off-campus development transactions. it's more competitive right now off-campus.
we have construction pricing pressures and, of course, entitlement costs. and as we've always said, when you're looking at the on-campus transactions, you have a vested partner in the university. they are bringing the land to the table, and that land value is determined by the university based on their criteria of wanting to provide affordable rents to students. and so, they're not looking to maximize the value of the parcel.
they also in most cases are the entitlement governance entity and control that process very cost-effectively. they also in many cases bring a real estate tax exemption given its use of benefit for higher education. and so, certainly, in this environment, there is more -- and also, they tend to be larger, which gives you scale in helping accomplish the affordable rents and meeting feasibility. and so, the current environment, and as you also saw through the great recession when we were doing more on-campus based development than off, brings great benefit to being able to achieve our targeted yields, provide affordable student rents, and to meet the university's objectives.
there's still some great opportunities off-campus. we're very selective in that arena and only look at the type of development that we referenced would be equal to an asu-type on-campus transaction, trophy assets on legacy sites where we can accomplish affordable rents and get our return. and so, there'll be fewer of those, but it's not a situation where there won't be any.
chandni luthra -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. understood. and in your previous question, you guys addressed how kind of you might be looking to see more opportunity with jv programs and there might be more appetite there. on your 3q call, obviously, dispositions -- outright dispositions were also discussed.
is that something that you guys are still evaluating? or do you think that given you still have sort of the fee pipeline coming in from these jvs, outright dispositions are no longer on the table?
daniel perry -- chief financial officer
i would say -- we wouldn't say it's no longer on the table. and certainly, there's going to be times when we think it's appropriate to monetize assets that we consider to be toward the lower end of the noi growth profile or lower end of quality in our longer-term refinement of the portfolio. but right now, we really like the idea of using joint ventures in terms of monetizing a minority interest in assets and being able to replace any lost efficiency or scale with the management fees -- asset management fees that we can get off of that portion of a joint venture partner. so, i think most commonly, you will see us using this minority joint venture partnership structure like we did with the austin-allianz joint venture and the asu-harrison street joint venture.
chandni luthra -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we now have our next question on the line from john pawlowski from green street. sir john, please go ahead.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
thanks very much. william, if you went out and sold the bottom tier of your portfolio, pick a number, bottom 10%, what kind of a cap rate do you think that would fetch at maybe a second-tier university, a little further away from campus?
william talbot -- chief investment officer
obviously, you've seen a lot of the investment activity primarily focused at the major universities' core, and that's where that's trading in that sub 4%. but you've still seen compression across student housing investment, and you're seeing investment across a wider -- a wide array at a couple of the large portfolios that you saw trade at -- that harrison street sold at the end of the fourth quarter where i would say had assets that were consistent with what i call our bottom 10%. but that -- we think that that range is probably compressed down to that mid-4% range. obviously, a premium or a higher cap rate than what you're seeing for the core stuff but still has seen pretty significant compression.
and there's a pretty deep investor base for that because if you think about it, it's a very relative attractive cap rate and return compared to the significant compression you've seen on multifamily.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
sure. so, in terms of the buy-and-hold decision, i mean, if you give me a decision, i'd rather own asu at a 3.75% versus the bottom 10% of the portfolio at a mid-four. so, why not use the bottom tier in your portfolio as a source of funds versus asu, irrespective of the price discovery?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
well, that price discovery, we feel, is critical. and obviously, as we go forward, we look at what you just said in terms of evaluating the alternatives. but we have spoken on this call for over a decade of people asking, ""can you trade ace in equity and at what a cap rate?"" so, we felt that it was very important to put that out. the other thing i want to point out is, i mean, we love arizona state, and they are a wonderful partner.
and there's probably more to do there. and we also had a high degree of concentration. one of the things morgan olsen, their cfo, was excited about is that we talked about, in diversifying and taking some of the risk of a single market off the table, we have the ability to invest more at asu. and so, there were a lot of strategic reasons why that transaction made sense.
but certainly, as we go forward, john, every -- whenever we're looking at our capital allocation plan, we're looking at our entire portfolio and what is the most accretive trade that we can make that also enhances long-term sustainable cash flows.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
ok. thank you. final question for me, for jennifer. back to the inflation discussion.
so, enrollment is up, supply is down, and baseline inflation is well above recent history. i guess i've never run a student housing portfolio, but i don't understand why you can't push rental rates 5% to 7% to 8% on the off-campus portfolio versus the kind of 3% that's implied in the guidance.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah, john. and i actually answered that previously in the context of we can at certain assets in certain markets. and we have a very eclectic, geographically diverse portfolio. and when you bring all the rental rate growth together, you get that average we've always had over the years, 2.5% to 3%.
but within that 2.5% to 3%, you have a range of flat growth to 8%, sometimes, negative growth to get the occupancy. it's always about the revenue maximization every cycle. and so, this is also, when you look at ace versus off-campus, another thing that we think about in terms of the long-term profile of those opportunities. you can achieve prolific irrs off-campus, where you have the ability at times -- take our callaway house asset, where our rate growth in the first five years was well in excess of 7% on average versus the stability coupon clipping on-campus, that 2.5% to 3%, very little downside.
and so, when you look at setting rates and stability of cash flows, you absolutely have the opportunity off-campus to have that type of prolific great growth but not across the portfolio of 170 assets in 32 different states and 92 different markets. but you got to protect --
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
yeah. i guess my follow-up, why -- yes. i guess the follow-up. again, supply across the portfolio is down.
enrollment across the portfolio up. why are -- and your portfolio is well located. why have certain assets seen zero percent rate growth?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
if a property has zero percent rate growth, they are probably not in a market that has zero supply, and the supply dynamics are different. again, this is a very large, diverse portfolio with different product types. and as we -- the thesis of student housing, this reminds me -- some of the conversations we're having today remind me of 2012, 2013 when apartments were just starting to come off of the great recession where they had, had significant rental rate diminution and people were saying, ""why can't you? why can't you?"" and again, as we have always said, the benefit of student housing in a large, diverse portfolio such as ours is the consistent stability of rental rate growth and cash flows. but the one thing, the question that you're asking, that is not true, on an individual asset and investment basis, absolutely, you can have years of 5% to 7% rate growth.
and it occurs within our portfolio all the time. 17 years in a row of never having negative growth is the story of what that consistency of rental revenue equates to.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
ok. thank you for the time.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
you got it. thank you.
operator
thank you, john. we now have a question on the line from -- a follow-up from neil malkin from capital one. sir neil, please go ahead. i have you in your line.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks. just two quick ones. first, william, and i'm sorry if you answered this before, but after disney, just wondering about the pipeline of actual ace in that third party.
i know you said off-campus land values are increasing. but just -- obviously, most of these things went to third party and not ace. and i know you talked about the schools as kind of shifting focus from covid to sort of the core of their business. when do you think we're going to see that? and do you expect to announce some things near term to kind of build that pipeline? and that kind of leads into my next question.
william talbot -- chief investment officer
yeah, sure. and bill talked about this a little bit earlier. but yes, we've seen a lot of third-party projects that are very specifically related to the goals of those universities and the type of housing. a lot of focus on grad where affordability is the key and finding that lowest cost of capital, which usually is through those universities' balance sheet, is there.
but we have no different change in what we believe the appetite is overall for p3, and that relates to both the equity ace deals, as well as the third party. and so there's a vibrant pipeline. and if you look within our supplemental, cal berkeley, there's an ace project within there. northeastern is still targeted to be, and there's a number that are tbd that, based on what the goals of those universities and what the potential financing is, that could be ace.
so, when you look at that large pipeline we've been talking about and you're seeing the fruition of that come with these recent closings and announcements, that still includes a large mix of both ace and third party. and what ultimately turns out to be ace in equity and what becomes third party, it depends on the university, it depends on our investment criteria and the product. and so, that pipeline is as vibrant as it's been, and we'll continue to pursue it and hopefully win those projects. and you'll see more ace projects come along.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
ok. and i assume that that pipeline has grown in terms of rfps, right? it seems like every quarter, there's more.
william talbot -- chief investment officer
yes, it continues to grow and be strong.
neil malkin -- capital one securities -- analyst
ok. and then the last one, and i think this is kind of tying a lot of people's questions together. with rent growth obviously being less than multifamily, you talk about lower risk, reasonable cash flows. and i think the other part of it is the growth is going to come from external, right? it's the value of the oligopoly, so to speak, of the development and the on-campus revitalization that very few people have the skills to do.
so, maybe with that in mind, can you just talk about, as we look past covid, how are you thinking about long-term capital allocation and value creation sort of over the next several years?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yeah. and certainly, we are not -- sorry, my mic was off. certainly, we are in a position to really implement an accretive self-funding plan. and i want to point out, since you brought the recovery from covid, one of the untold stories that we put in our investor presentation at nareit.
if you actually pull up that presentation, it's page 28 of our nareit presentation. but we -- in '16 and '17, we did a lot of asset sales where we've refined the portfolio, we exited a lot of markets, we made the portfolio enhancement to where now it's all on-campus or pedestrian to campus with like rare exception. and as we track the markets that we exited prior -- during that period of time, one thing that we saw is that the markets that we continue to be in grew their enrollment by 840 bps over the markets we exited over the last five years. also, the occupancies at the markets we exited were 600 basis points more impacted by covid than we were in our own markets.
they were at 85% versus our 90.3%. and the bottom line is we have now repositioned this company, and the shareholders are now -- and we really appreciate the long-term shareholders that were patient through those years as we were implementing that long-term strategy to reposition the portfolio. you're now seeing the benefits of that being reaped in the context of strong earnings per share. but also, what you saw with asu and what we will continue to do with our portfolio is to very accretively self-fund.
with cap rates now being proven up in all aspects of our portfolio on an asset-by-asset basis in the 3s, as william said, probably we had a couple that are mid-4s, but as you've seen that shore up, we now have the ability. we've got about 200 basis points of upside in net asset value accretion in the development pipeline that we have before us. as you mentioned, we are in the best competitive position as it relates to on-campus p3 than we have ever been in, in the company's history. and so, we see a very bright future and a lot of tailwinds and a lot of accelerating momentum for the company as we are able to move forward in taking advantage of the opportunities that are before the company.

good day, and welcome to the american campus communities q4 2021 earnings call. my name is rica, and i'll be today's event specialist. [operator instructions] i would like to hand the call over to ryan to begin.

with that, i'll turn the call over to bill for his opening remarks. bill? 
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
thank you, ryan. good morning, and thanks all of you for joining us as we discuss our q4 and full year 2021 financial and operating results. 2021 was an outstanding year for the company and our shareholders. the acc team executed and successfully advanced our long-term strategy on many fronts.
we signed more spring and summer term leases than any prior period in our history, employing the enhanced capabilities of our next-gen operational systems. we also outperformed the high end of our expectations for fall leasing, achieving 95.8% opening occupancy and 3.8% average rental rate growth. we delivered nearly 4,000 beds at our development serving the disney college program on schedule and within budget despite the national labor shortage and widespread supply chain constraints, bringing our total beds delivered at disney to more than 6,000. we expect to achieve originally targeted yields beginning in 2022 and to hit our 6.8% stabilized yield in 2023.
with regard to our current portfolio, the company's performance eclipsed expectations. in addition to our total portfolio's noi returning to pre-pandemic levels, during the fourth quarter, property noi for our 2021 same-store property grouping also surpassed pre-pandemic levels, both of which occurred a full year earlier than expected. with regard to capital allocation activities, we successfully executed a well-timed $400 million bond offering, issuing seven-year senior unsecured notes at a yield of 2.26%. and to cap the year off, we formed a joint venture with harrison street's social infrastructure platform to recapitalize a 45% interest in our existing 8-property arizona state university student housing portfolio.
the transaction represented a 3.75% economic cap rate based on in-place rental revenue; escalated trailing operating expenses, including ground rent; and historic average capital expenditures. the transaction produced an unlevered irr of approximately 16%. it also provided price discovery for our on-campus ace portfolio and demonstrates that on-campus assets developed via properly structured public-private partnerships can be valued on par with private off-campus assets that reflect comparable market and product attributes. importantly, the transaction exemplifies our ability to capitalize on our ace investments while simultaneously maintaining the spirit of our university partnerships, illustrating the net asset value-creation opportunity in both our existing ace portfolio and our future pipeline of on-campus transactions.
the two-phase closing of the transaction is also beneficial as it mitigates earnings dilution, satisfies our 2022 capital needs, and provides additional proceeds moving into 2023, further positioning us to execute on our value-enhancing development pipeline. our solid operational execution and prudent capital allocation activities resulted in earnings per share cumulatively exceeding quarterly expectations throughout the year by $0.18 per share or almost 10%, and full-year ffom per share of $2.14 exceeded the high end of our most recent guidance by $0.02. in addition, our stock ended the year at an all-time closing high of $57.29. as we look forward, our optimism continues given our current momentum and the strong fundamentals the sector is experiencing.
in stark contrast to the media's headlines pointing out that college enrollment has been decreasing with regard to the broadest universe of institutions of higher education, student demand to attend america's tier 1 flagship universities, the ones we currently serve and target to do business, continues to experience growth and to set record levels of enrollment. this includes first-year student enrollment growth at the highest levels in over 30 years. these strong enrollment demographics, coupled with new supply for fall '22 being at the lowest levels in over a decade, provides a highly attractive supply demand environment. as jennifer commented in our release, industrywide pre-leasing is tracking in a manner more consistent with the sector's traditional pre-pandemic fall leasing velocity.
and we are targeting normalized occupancy levels and attractive rent growth for the 2022-2023 academic year with our guidance including same-store rental revenue growth of 3.2% to 4.6% for the fourth quarter of 2022. touching briefly on our on-campus public-private partnership business. our prior statements that opportunities for on-campus transactions may well be greater in a post-covid environment appear to be coming to fruition. since the end of q3, we have commenced the third-party development of four university projects: mit, princeton, uc irvine, and drexel university.
and we were awarded a new development with purdue research foundation. as the recognized leader, acc remains uniquely positioned to capitalize on this expanding opportunity. as we move into 2022, the company is firing on all cylinders with accelerating momentum as represented by our 2022 guidance, which represents earnings-per-share growth in the range of 12% to 16%. this is even more impressive when considering that our guidance includes the effect of the $270 million first-phase closing of the asu transaction and the fact that this growth is coming off of earnings for 2021 that exceeded the high end of our expectations.
in closing, i'd like to reiterate my remarks from the beginning of this call. 2021 was an outstanding year for the company and its shareholders. as we turn to the question-and-answer portion of today's call, we'll not be answering any questions regarding our recent disclosures regarding land and buildings. but instead, we'll focus on the strong performance of the company, our 2022 outlook, industry fundamentals, and our business strategy.
with that, i'll turn it back to the operator to begin the q&a.

[operator instructions] and this morning's first question comes from shirley wu from bank of america.
shirley wu -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
so given your experience that you've experienced so far with elevated supply at fsu, what do you guys plan on doing differently going into '19? and what's included in your assumption for guidance?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
i'm sorry, shirley. can you restate that question? we didn't fully catch it here.
shirley wu -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. so given like the elevated supply at some of these schools at fsu, you've had quite a supply. so what do you plan on doing differently going into '19? and how much of that have you assumed in guidance?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yes, and tallahassee is one of the markets that we talked about on last quarter's call, but certainly given the supply that's coming in is an area of a short-term concern for us. from a long-term perspective, we're very comfortable with our investments in the tallahassee market and think they will do will over the long term and meet our yields. obviously, last year, we were a little bit down in tali. occupancy was around 91.7%, i believe 91.5%.
we were a little conservative in our guidance this year, given the new supply that is coming in. we had a little bit of overall growth plan in the guidance. i want to say, it was about 1.5% to 2% overall and overall rental revenue consisting of occupancy and rate. it's still early, but we are doing extremely well in tallahassee this year.
our velocity is significantly outpacing last year, and so we believe we are in a position that we will do ok in tali from what we've assumed in our guidance.
shirley wu -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and so quick to that to your disney program, so it's definitely very interesting how you guys have pivoted from a traditional student housing into the disney internship development. what are your thoughts about maybe getting into corporate housing or different means of business besides your core?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yes. and while disney would be considered corporate housing as these students are employees of disney. it was a very natural pivot for us given that, again, the students that we are housing at disney are indeed the exact same target market that we have been serving throughout the company's history. and so it's in many case the same 18- to 22-year-old and in some cases, folks attending the exact same university that we're already serving.
and so from a floor plan design, from a programmatic design, the development of the disney education center is exactly on par with all the honors college developments that we've done at asu, northern arizona, university of arizona. and so it is a very consistent pivot. so at this point in time, it made great sense for us and we haven't made any commitments for explorations of a definitive nature beyond that program.
operator
and the next question comes from nick joseph with citi.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
how successful were you on backfilling december-ending leases? i mean, given that, what do you expect 1q same-store revenue growth to be?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yes, nick. it was a really good year for us. as we mentioned on last call, we had about 150 additional december ending leases. we were very successful when the backfill.
the team did a great job. the one notation that i would make is that those backfilling of leases, typically those december-ending leases, are at a premium price to the market rate because of the short-term nature. and then, when we backfilled them in january, they are either at market or sometimes at a discount to market. that can be what causes a little bit of the seasonality and why you typically see about a 20-point bp diminishment in rental revenue because of the rate variation in the backfilling.
also on occupancy basis, we did very good. and on a rent perspective, we wouldn't expect more than 10 to 20-basis-points diminishment from the 3.6%.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
great. and then, what's the expected development spend in 2019? and then based on the 2019 sources of capital you discussed, where do you expect net debt to ebitda to be at the end of the year?
daniel perry -- chief financial officer
yes, nick, this is daniel. so if you look at, i mean, and we really look at it not just '19 because we have development under construction for both '19 and '20 that we're committed on. and so, when we look at the amount of spend that we have throughout that time period, it's about $590 million of development spend to be funded and also the buyout of our presale developments. when we look -- and also, if you'll notice on our capital funding plan page, we have one less development for delivery in '19 than we had last quarter with the drexel calhoun hall redevelopment converting to a third-party deal.
so that took about $42 million worth of development funding out. but as you go through the funding of that $590 million, we obviously have cash on hand of $71 million, about $60 million a year in free cash flow available for reinvestment. beyond that, we would expect to fund the remaining $400 million through a combination of debt and equity or dispo capital being about $100 million of debt and $300 million of disposition or equity capital. obviously, with where our cost of equity is today, the intent as we include in our capital plan is for that to be via dispositions of about $150 million per year.
we have, at the midpoint -- well, we have a range of $100 million to $190 million in total disposition capital for this year. the other thing i'll point out, as you recall, on the last couple of calls, we've been talking about our intent to better time that disposition -- those disposition proceeds with the developments coming online to provide a better and more consistent earnings growth trajectory. so we are planning on those transactions occurring in the third quarter of each year when the ebitdar noi contribution from the developments comes on and you have a more of a timing match between capital raised and capital deployed.
nick joseph -- citi -- analyst
so just to follow-up on that, so guidance is assuming about $150 million of dispositions at the midpoint, but it could be up to $300 million of the combination of dispositions and equity, but right now, guidance assumes that that is debt, is that right?
daniel perry -- chief financial officer
no. it'd be $300 million over the next two years of debt and/or dispo and equity capital, which we would spread between the two years. so $150 million is what we expect in our guidance and in actuality for this year.
operator
and the next question comes from austin wurschmidt with keybanc.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
just curious, how much appetite does your capital partner have to continue to partner on joint ventures in the disposition side? and do they get first look on any potential sales?
william talbot -- chief investment officer
austin, this is william. so allianz, they viewed the venture as an entree into a partnership with american campus. they do have a greater appetite to grow that platform. however, we do not have any exclusivity with them or any first look, but would certainly look to them as our established partner when we look at other available capital resources to fund our growth.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and then you mentioned in your prepared remarks that cap rates had compressed further in the fourth quarter. and i'm just trying to understand, can you give us a sense of how much that was? and what we should be thinking about from an expectation of the dispositions you've assumed in guidance, where cap rates will shake out?
william talbot -- chief investment officer
yes. as we noted, overall, you saw cap rates compress and really more specifically, importantly, when we look and think about our dispositions, we continually saw those core pedestrian cap rates trading in the low 4% in line with what you saw the acc transactions of 4.1% and 4.4%. you saw other transactions that were in that similar low 4% cap rate range. and certainly, as we look and with the capitalized or venture out some of our corporate issuing assets, our expectations are in line with that low 4% cap rate range.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
appreciate that. and then just separately, i was curious as far as how the leases break down, what percent of your fall 2018, '19 leases have a 12-month term? and do you know off-hand what revenue growth was for that subset of assets?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yes. and when you look at -- and we have our residence hall properties and [inaudible] if i give any misnumbers please, give me the correct one. when we look at our 10-month residence hall properties, i believe in the q4 that represents about 18% of our noi [inaudible] of revenue -- 18% of our revenue. and actually, we had great rental rate growth there.
sorry, my mic was off. could you hear what i was saying, austin?
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yes, yes.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
ok. we were at 4.2% revenue growth on that 10-month property where the 12-month apartments were 3.5%. and so 18% from the academic year properties, what we would call academic year lease, and the 72% coming from the -- 82% rather coming from the 12-month apartments.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
so 82% at 3.5% and 18% at 4.2%?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yes. and the one thing that we would say and we started talking about this about two years ago is that the majority of ace transactions that we are now being awarded are residence hall products for first-year students that are on that academic year lease. and so we talked about you'll continue to see just a little variation in seasonality, especially in q2 as those residence hall leases roll-off and the apartment leases continue. and so just something to be aware that that trend will probably continue to see that potentially come in.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
when you look back, historically, maybe just one quick follow-up. when you look back, historically, have those 10-month leases outperformed the 12-month leases over the last several years when we've seen kind of the...
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
you got to break them into two categories, in that the majority of those assets are on-campus residence halls where you would see your rate profile be in the area of 2.5% to 3% coupon clipping revenue growth. we only have a couple of properties that are off-campus, private residence halls in the callaway house in austin and college station. those two assets that are two of our legacy flagship assets that have been some of our best performers have always pushed that rate up over the last five years. i would tell you that over the long term, and with the growing amount of that coming in the on-campus arena, you would expect that to be a more normalized, consistent 2.5% to 3% revenue growth over the long term.
operator
and the next question comes from samir khanal with evercore.
samir khanal -- evercore isi -- analyst
bill or daniel, i guess, i guess, what gives you the confidence that you'll be able to hit the midpoint or the lower end of the expense range that you provided for '19? and if i go back historically, right, in '18, you started off with 2.5% to 3.3%. you hit kind of at the higher end of that range. '17 was kind of a similar situation, it was 1% to 1.5%. and you kind of, i think, if my math serves me right, it was kind of at the high end of the range when you exclude the impacts from the hurricane.
so just trying to get color around sort of expense growth here and how you're thinking about it.
daniel perry -- chief financial officer
yes, samir, this is daniel. and when you look at 2018, we hit ultimately 3% expense growth versus a midpoint, as you referenced, of 2.9%. so we were at the end of 10 basis points of our original midpoint from the beginning of the year, which we consider to be pretty good performance relative to expectations. as you look at 2019, with a 2.7% operating expense growth, midpoint for same-store, it's a 30-basis-point improvement over 2018.
that is primarily driven by our expectations for a moderation in property tax growth. we came in really close to the property tax growth that we expected for 2018 albeit it was a high number. we expected that going into the year. this year based on our consultation with our tax advisors, we believe that a lot of the reassessments that we saw in 2018 have now pretty fully baked valuations.
we do have a few markets where we expect big reassessments this year that's built into our 4%, but we already have some of the new assessments in for 2019. for example, in philly, where we had $1 million increase in taxes, we already know our assessment, we have a very small increase. so we're pretty confident with that 4%. the other area that has caused some higher expense growth in the past is related to incident response cost related to hurricanes and other incidents like that pipe burst.
we've really tried to build in and allow for that better this year in our incident response budget. and so that's in our 2.7% growth, and so we feel pretty good about it. the other area that certainly is a focus for all industries is payroll. as i said in my remarks, we're expecting 4% growth in payroll this year.
if you remember, i think, we came in at 1.9% in 2018. that we feel like that gives us room to be able to perform well against any payroll increases. we also have pretty good management of our payroll. our inside track system provides a great bench of talent for any replacements that we need to do at the property level.
i mean, as you can imagine, those are new employees that may not be -- or certainly aren't more expensive than any existing employees you lose. so we feel pretty confident in those numbers as well.
samir khanal -- evercore isi -- analyst
just as a follow-up on the reassessment. i mean, how does that exactly work? i mean, as you sit here today, you have a pretty good idea of some of the reassessments for the next 12 months, i would think. but i mean, are there any surprises that that could come up? i mean, has there been instances in the past where three months later or six months later those came up and that impacted sort of your numbers?
daniel perry -- chief financial officer
yes. you do get surprises. fortunately, it tends to average out because you get surprises to the positive. so when we look at what our original expectation was for property taxes in 2018, it was 7.9%.
we revised it to 9%. we came in at 8.3%. so pretty tight band there of ultimate growth. and so we have multiple national advisors that we use for property taxes and they are able to give us pretty good direction in combination with our in-house experts, we're able to project those pretty close to what actually ends up turning out.
samir khanal -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. and i guess -- just one last one from me. i guess, what is your presale development pipeline look like right now? you got the two off-campus projects, it's the flex and the 959 franklin. i mean, what does that pipeline look beyond sort of '19?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
for us, that's something that we look at in concert with our overall capital allocation opportunities. as we say, our first priority is always on the owned development where we're still getting 225 basis points of spread to current market cap rates. and so, we allocate that as our no. 1 priority.
we look at presales and there is always good opportunities out there, but we are very selective in analyzing them in concert with the growth profile going forward and line them up against the capital allocation we have for our own development, and so that's something -- the pipeline is good, but we only choose to execute when it makes sense and it is not our highest priority with our development opportunities.
operator
and the next question comes from daniel bernstein with capital one.
daniel bernstein -- capital one securities -- analyst
just wanted to ask about the capital recycling guidance for '19. you did over $600 million in '18. 2019 guidance is $150 million. is that decrease just a matching to the development needs? or is there some other strategic decrease in recycling, especially in light of some of the cap rates that you've been quoting on '18 sales and decreasing cap rates in 4q.
i thought maybe the recycling number would be a little bit higher?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
if you really look at 2018, we had two things going on in terms of the amount of recycling we did. when we brought core spaces or entered into the core spaces transaction in 2017, you'll remember that was a three-year funding that we agreed to with that partner given their tax objectives. we were funding part of it in fall of '17, part of it in fall of '18 and part of it in fall of '19. and so the joint venture that we did in 2018 that produced proceeds of about $367 million was a funding mechanism for that core spaces transaction that we had planned when we entered into in 2017 and talked about.
we also did an additional $245 million of dispositions that we actually didn't anticipate when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, but the disney project came together during the year and we wanted to get capital in place for that project on the front end, so we felt comfortable with committing to a five-year development there. that's taken care of now, and so we're really looking at everything that we have in place and trying to now match time that better, and so it puts us in a position to do a little less and do it from a timing perspective with the delivery of the developments each year.
daniel bernstein -- capital one securities -- analyst
ok. so if the development picks up for some reason, then maybe the acquisitions will too, but otherwise it's kind of matching?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
yes. and we feel comfortable about where our balance sheet is at this point. if development picks up, we certainly will look at where cost of capital is but the intent would be to match time it better. that's something we talked about with wanting to bring more stability to our earnings growth trajectory and move to more of a match timing funding strategy.
daniel bernstein -- capital one securities -- analyst
ok. and then there was a -- as you may have seen, it seems like a lot of developers and investors are looking at alternative assets besides multi-family, mentioning student housing. so have you sought out or have any investment partners potentially sought you out as a new capital source besides allianz? just trying to see if you have the desire there to expand that.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
the answer to that, for the last three years to five years has been yes and continues to be yes. there is certainly plenty of money and opportunities to folks that would love to joint venture and partner. as william said, we're very pleased with our relationship with allianz. they do not have exclusivity or first look, but we are enjoying that relationship and have no reason at this point to necessarily look elsewhere unless someone had set a cost of capital that was so much more attractive, but certainly, there is no shortage of opportunity for us in terms of those sources.
operator
and the next question comes from alexander goldfarb with sandler o'neill.
alexander goldfarb -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
so i appreciate the comments on the equity side for capital funding. in the guidance for 2019, is there anything that you are budgeting you had to address, maybe taking an early stab at the 2020 maturities?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
well, what we have from a debt standpoint is, as we talked about, we already closed on an expansion of our revolver to more match up with the size of our ongoing development pipeline. we also have -- as you remember, we paid off multiple term loans in 2018 with the proceeds from our disposition activity. we do intend to do a small-term loan in the second half of this year. from a long-term kind of a fixed rate funding perspective, we are looking at doing another bond offering, probably in early 2020, as i commented in my prepared remarks, and also said that we had entered into a 10-year treasury swap for half of that transaction to mitigate any interest rate risk in the interim.
alexander goldfarb -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then, just another on the development funding side. it looks like if you take out the core spaces, which i think was $130 million, the one that you took down in the fourth quarter, the overall development pipeline shrunk by about $100 million but the amount spent to date stayed the same.
is that literally just happens to be just how core spaces worked out? or is there something else going on with the budgeting on the developments?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
net-net, it went down $100 million because you paid the $130 million, it was about $139 million, i think, on the core spaces deal. and then you had the $42 million deal with drexel calhoun come out. so that's the net $100 million change. so no real changes other than that from last quarter.
obviously, we continue to have, if you look at it by line item, funding that occurred, but everything else should be pretty consistent with what we disclosed before.
alexander goldfarb -- sandler o'neill -- analyst
ok. and then, just a final question. in looking at your development, the total commitment looks to be about 12% or so of your gross assets and you guys have been trying to do a much better job on the funding side to better match it up. is there sort of a target amount that you're seeing that you're more comfortable with having annually deliver, so that way, on the funding side, there seems to be maybe there is less discussion of what you need to source from dispositions or equity and it becomes something more sustainable through free cash flow and maybe a few asset sales versus something that gets a bigger conversation, if you will?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
i mean, look, we always look at that. it's something we discuss with our board. we've talked historically about we think that a 5% of assets per year development pipeline is appropriate. when you're talking about the ability to recycle capital in the low fours into 6.25 and above development, that's a really attractive trade.
and so we don't see any reason to change that capital allocation strategy at this point. even if you were to see cap rates start to tick back up a little bit, we still have so much cushion. right now, you're looking at almost over 200 bps of spread between what we can develop at and what we can recycle capital at. so that that continues to be attractive to us.
and so our 5% of assets kind of development strategy we think continues to make sense as well.

[operator instructions] and the next question comes from john pawlowski with green street advisors.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
william, a question for you on opportunity zones. i know it's very early and there's still a lot of uncertainty. there are a lot of low-income u.s. census tracts in and around college campuses.
do you foresee any of your markets seeing a supply wave from opportunity zone development?
william talbot -- chief investment officer
we really have looked at all the -- how the opportunity zones overlay within our existing markets and specifically where they are. but if you go back to our initial investment criteria, one of the things we really focus on is barriers to entry and that really existed prior to the opportunity zones. so while we see people looking at the opportunity zones, we really haven't seen an increase in supply as evidenced by the overall supply numbers that we've dictated that's been driven by that opportunity zone today.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
are you seeing a lot of pitchbooks floating around for plans to raise money in and around your footprint?
william talbot -- chief investment officer
not really on the student housing side, no.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
and then, jennifer, maybe a question for you on just the sensitivity to rental rate growth with the financial markets. i know you're more stable versus other real estate types. but if you could provide some color on, for instance, if the stock market goes down by 20%, ahead of next fall's lease-up, what could rental rate growth look like? does it go flat or just any sense for what you've seen historically in your pricing systems in terms of sensitivity to ebbs and flows of the financial market would be helpful.
jennifer beese -- chief operating officer
first question ever. i'm a little nervous, i must say, how are you today?
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
anybody at the table could.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
no. we'll let jennifer answer it.
jennifer beese -- chief operating officer
we do not see any fluctuation right now on our rental rates at this time.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
if you look, john, long term, whenever we've seen the macro environment change, certainly, throughout the great recession would be the greatest evidence. and through '09, '10 and '11, when you saw major macro crisis, we saw the most continued consistency in our rental rates and our cash flows. and so, the macroeconomics just don't tend to play out and impact us. and when it comes down to the macroeconomics of supply and demand in each university market and we see little variation hardly if ever.
the only time that we have ever really seen it in the company's history and you really got to go back and it was before the modern supply of student housing at the levels that it was today is back in the early 2000's, in '01, '02 and in austin or at university of colorado, which has the broomfield, northern denver sub-market, you would see multi-family softness somewhat impact and this is back when students didn't have the purpose-built product in walking distance to campus, but there was more of a shadow market in that multi-family, you'd start to see impacts then, but we have not seen in the last 15 years at all.
daniel perry -- chief financial officer
and if i can pile on to bill there, if you go back '08, '09 and '10, i think, that is a pretty perfect correlation to the scenario you're asking about, john. our same-store revenue growth in '08 was 4.2%, in '09 it was 4.9%, and in this is -- sorry, this is opening for the fall lease-up of each of those years and then in 2010, it was 4.4%. so really, really good revenue growth.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
we don't root for recessions, but when they happen, we tend to do really well.
daniel perry -- chief financial officer
if you go back and -- some of that is a combination of occupancy. some of it was rate, some of it was occupancy. the good thing was we had positive growth in both occupancy and rate throughout that time period. so that's the nice part of student housing.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
my own perspective there would be '07, '08, '09, the demographic wave was firmly at you guys back and now it's a slowing environment.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
the demographic rate may be slowing but the enrollment at the institutions that we're serving is not and this is the way you have to look at. when you look at the demographic of 18 to 22-year-olds and the amount of students that are available to go to college, we are operating at the premier institutions across america where there is incredible competition for those seats. and so we do not see any impact. when you look at the things that have been concerns over the last several years, macroeconomics, international student population, every seat of these institutions gets filled and there is a significant backflow for it.
we always talk about our home state of texas, the top 6% of high school students get into a&m and ut. the backlog of students waiting for those seats and that's consistent across your tier one public institutions across america. so the supply side of the equation and the buying power the student is truly not a historical risk nor the one that we see presently.
operator
and that concludes the question-and-answer session and i would like to turn the call back over to our management for any closing comments.
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
in closing, we'd like to first thank the entire american campus team for a very solid year in 2018 on what they produced, especially with the successful fall lease-up. it sets the stage for accelerating growth into 2019. also, being our 25th anniversary, we would like to thank every team member, every university partner and all of our vendor partners that have been instrumental in our success over the last 25 years. we look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming investor conferences and talking to you shortly in april about our q1 results.
thanks so much.

bill?
bill bayless -- chief executive officer
thank you, ryan. good morning, and thank you all for joining us as we discuss our fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 financial and operating results. i'd like to start by thanking the team for another year of same-store growth in rental rate, rental revenue and net operating income, making 2018 the 14th consecutive year of growth since our ipo. the stability of cash flows that our sector has consistently demonstrated continues to attract institutional investors, both domestically and globally.
transactions during the year reached a record, exceeding $11 billion as cap rates further compressed and are now on par with multi-family. 2018 also brought in some firsts for our company. during the year, we successfully completed the strategic joint venture partnership with allianz, which opened up another attractive source of capital to fund our value-creating development pipeline. and as william will discuss, we recently commenced construction on housing for the disney college program, a testament to one of our core values to drive evolution within the industry.
overall, despite the uncertainty within the macroeconomy, fundamentals in the student housing industry remain healthy and we believe that the stability of our business will continue to make student housing one of the most sought-after investments globally. with that, we at acc look forward to 2019 as we have the opportunity for accelerating revenue and noi growth over the prior year. i'll now turn it over to jennifer beese, our chief operating officer, to provide color on our operational results.
jennifer beese -- chief operating officer
thanks, bill. we are pleased to report another year of internal growth now marking the 14th consecutive year since our 2004 ipo of the same-store growth in rental rates, rental revenue and noi. as seen on page s5 of the supplemental, quarterly same-store property noi increased by 0.1% on a 2.2% increase in revenue and an increase in operating expenses of 5.3%, which was primarily driven by anticipated increases in property taxes due to reassessments of our markets. for the full-year 2018, same-store noi increased 1% on a 1.9% increase in revenue and a 3% increase in expenses.
our operational and asset management efforts resulted in annual expense growth for our controllable categories of approximately 1.5%. turning to our full-year 2019 outlook, we are projecting same-store noi growth of 1.6% to 3.4% based on total revenue growth of 2.3% to 2.9% and expense growth of 2.3% to 3.1%. our revenue guidance takes into account our in-place leases to the end of '18, '19 academic year lease term, as well as our projections for the 2019, 2020 lease-up. we are projecting opening fall same-store rental revenue growth for the '19-'20 academic year of 1.5% to 3% based on the combination of occupancy and rental rate growth.
as always, the low and high ends of our revenue guidance reflects execution risk of our fall lease-up, backfilling short-term leases, summer leasing initiatives and outcome of our other income growth projections. on the expense side, our same-store expense growth expectations of 2019 are inflationary in majority of our categories. property taxes, our largest expense category, was the most meaningful expense growth driver in 2018 and continues to be the largest contributor to our budget expense growth in 2019 at roughly 4%. the growth is lower than the increases seen in 2018 as we do not anticipate the same level of reassessment in 2019.
turning to new supply, the environment remains consistent with what we discussed on our q3 call. for fall 2019, in acc's 69 markets, we are projecting new supply in 36 of those markets, totaling approximately 28,700 beds or 1.3% of enrollment, in line with our long-term average. of the 36 markets with new supply this year, 20 had no significant new supply last year. the new supply we are tracking this year is much less concentrated than what was delivered in fall 2018.
as the average number of new beds per market receiving new supply is expected to decrease 20% from last year. this year's new supply is also less concentrated from a noi impact perspective, as the largest 10 new supply markets represent approximately 18% of acc's total noi versus 29% last year. we look forward to updating the market as we progress through the year. i will now turn the call over to william to discuss our investment activity.
william talbot -- chief investment officer
thanks, jennifer. turning first to development, we are excited to have executed the ground lease and broken ground on the first five phases of our 10,440 bed, $615 million development project that will serve participants of the disney college program. the community will be delivered in multiple phases with the first phase delivering 778 beds in may 2020 and will include one of two 25,000 square-foot amenity centers and the 25,000 square-foot disney education center. subsequent phases will deliver over the following years with final completion expected in may 2023.
the 10-phase development is expected to produce a 6.8% nominal yield upon stabilization. we also executed the ground lease and began construction in february on our second phase ace development on the university of southern california health sciences campus. the 272-bed, $42 million project is a continuation of our highly successful 456-bed first phase community that's had an average wait list in excess of 200 persons since opening in 2016. the new phase is expected to deliver in time for the 2020 academic year.
with this progress, we're currently under construction on eight owned developments and presales totaling 9,011 beds and $875 million targeted to deliver between 2019 and 2021. all acc owned developments are expected to achieve between a stabilize 6% in a quarter to 6.8% nominal yield and presale developments are targeting between 5.75% to 6.25% yield. with regards to our fall 2019 developments, we've seen excellent lease-up progress with the five communities currently 87% pre-leased for the upcoming academic year. with regards to on-campus third-party development, we are currently under construction on five third-party projects on the campuses of the university of california, irvine; the university of california, riverside; the university of arizona; the university of illinois, chicago; and delaware state with an additional three to five projects expected to break ground in 2019.
the redevelopment of calhoun hall honors residence at drexel university, which will house first year honor students is now a third-party development. drexel has traditionally used their balance sheet to own all their first-year housing and relied on the ace program to fund all other housing. the 400-bed project is expected to deliver for occupancy in time for this academic year. turning to the transaction market, 2018 produced another record year of investment in the student housing sector.
according to cbre's 2018 year-end student housing report, transactions totaled over $11 billion for 2018, highlighted by the greystar-blackstone acquisition of edr. cap rates continued to compress in 2018 with numerous core pedestrian properties trading at a low 4% cap rate range, including our sale of three assets to greystar at a 4.1% economic cap rate and our sale of a minority interest of existing assets into a joint venture at a 4.4% economic cap rate. it should be noted that investment volume remained strong and cap rates continued to compress during the fourth quarter despite increasing interest rates. investor interest remains very strong for student housing product of abundant financing resources widely available.
with that, i'll now turn it over to daniel to discuss our year-end financial results and 2019 guidance.
daniel perry -- chief financial officer
thanks, william. last night, we reported the company's final financial results for 2018, including fourth quarter ffom of $100.2 million or $0.72 per fully diluted share and full-year ffom of $319.8 million or $2.31 per fully diluted share. this was in line with the midpoint of our updated guidance. as jennifer discussed, same-store noi growth of 1% in 2018 was driven by a 1.9% increase in same-store revenues and 3% increase in same-store expenses, which was within 10 basis points of our original guidance midpoint provided at the beginning of the year.
with regards to new store properties, our 10 development and presale development properties opened in fall 2018 fully stabilized. their performance, combined with the strong year two leasing results for our 2017 development and acquisition properties resulted in total new store noi that was above the high-end of our original guidance for this group. as we look to 2019, we expect to see an acceleration in same-store noi growth driven by both higher revenue and lower operating expense growth relative to 2018. moving to capital structure, as of december 31, 2018, the company's debt-to-enterprise value was 34.6%, debt-to-total asset value was 36.5% and the net debt to run rate ebitda was 6.3 times.
as you will see in our own development update on page s-10 of the earnings supplemental, we have commenced construction on $765 million of development for delivery through 2021, with $525 million remaining to be funded over the next three years. in the capital allocation and long-term funding plan on page s-16, we reflect additional phases of the disney project through delivery in 2023, as well as the remaining funding on our presale development projects. through a funding mix of cash available for reinvestment, additional debt and equity joint venture and/or disposition capital, we anticipate maintaining a debt-to-total assets ratio in the mid-30s and a net debt-to-ebitda ratio in the high fives to low sixes. our capital plan for 2019 includes approximately $100 million to $190 million in proceeds from dispositions and the sale of a minority joint venture interest in existing properties.
we already completed increase in our line of credit from $700 million to $1 billion and a new $200 million term loan anticipated to close in the second half of the year. we also continue to have plans for an unsecured bond issuance, most likely in early 2020. to mitigate interest rate risk on that offering, we have entered into a 10-year treasury swap on half the expected issuance size. finally, turning to our 2019 earnings outlook.
we've provided an ffom guidance range of $2.35 to $2.45. you can turn to pages s-17 and s-18 of the earnings supplemental to get complete details on each of the components of our guidance. one specific item impacting our earnings guidance that is not consistent year over year is that under the new lease accounting standard, which i'm sure you have all been following, starting in 2019, we have to expense certain initial leasing and marketing costs that historically were capitalized. these expenses will show up in our new store operating expenses going forward and are expected to be approximately $1 million in 2019.
excluding these costs, ffom guidance would have been $2.41 per share at the midpoint in line with street consensus. other than that, some of the major assumptions in our outlook are as follows. same-store property noi is expected to increase 1.6% to 3.4%, driven by 2.3% to 2.9% revenue growth and 2.3% to 3.1% operating expense growth. our same-store revenue growth range includes the contribution to the first quarter and part of the second quarter of the 3.6% rental revenue growth achieved this past fall from our '18, '19 academic year same-store lease-up.
when we move into the summer semesters, as typically experienced, we expect to see lower seasonal revenue growth impacting the second and third quarters. and finally, we're targeting a 2.25% rental revenue growth midpoint for our 2019 lease-up, which will contribute to the third and fourth quarters. our same-store expense growth range is primarily driven by property taxes and salaries and benefits, which together represent over 40% of total operating expenses. both are projected to increase approximately 4% in 2019, with most notably, some moderation in property tax growth relative to the 8.3% experienced in 2018 due to significantly less impact from reassessments expected in 2019.
also, third-party fee revenue in the range of $26 million to $30 million is included in guidance for the year. this includes three to five third-party development projects that have been awarded to acc and are expected to close during the year. as noted in our guidance detail slides in the supplemental, this year, we are taking over facilities management of the existing disney college program housing until they are taken off-line as our new internship housing at disney's delivered into service. as part of this facilities management agreement, the existing staff will stay in place with disney reimbursing acc for the overhead cost of those employees.
as a result, from an accounting perspective, we are required to increase both third-party revenue and expenses by the estimated $3.2 million and reimbursement and overhead cost. with that, i'll turn it back to the operator to start the question-and-answer portion of the call.

juan sanabria -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, good morning. just a question on the developments -- it looks like you lowered the high-end of your yield target 25 basis points to 6.75. is there anything in particular that drove that? is it higher cost? is it skewed by more ace developments? if you could, just comment if the next school year is lease up, so, if you're targeting for those to be stabilized year one or if you think there's a possibility those could be two-year stabilizations.
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
yeah, juan. if you look at that high-end of that range, we've added 7%, really, for the last five years. when you look at most of the transactions we're doing are coming in between 6.25-6.75. in large part, there are a higher percentage of ace, as you pointed out. the key point i would make there is that cap rates over that point in time have come down probably 100 basis points.
so, when you look at the spread of that 6.25 to 6.75 at cap rates being between 4%-4.5%, the accretive spread from those targeted development yields to current market cap rates have significantly expanded. also, the second part of your question, we do believe that all the developments that we're targeting to come on line in fall of 2019 will stabilize year one just as you saw the current 2018 portfolio come in at that 97%.
juan sanabria -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. then just on the sources and uses, if you look at what you have out for a couple years, it's about $150 million per year, about $600 million in total that could be funded with dispositions or other sources. is that front-end-loaded given some of the disney spend and the developments or should we think about that $150 million per year being spread over the next few years?
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
generally, i think it could be spread throughout 2023. that being said, as you look at the needs throughout 2019 and 2020, we've got about $650 million of funding needs. if you look at the cash on hand and free cashflow available for reinvestment, that would leave about $480 million to be funded from debt and/or equity or dispositions. if we're targeting in the short-term that mid-30s debt to asset value, low-sixes, high-fives debt to ebitda, that would be a mix of about $100 million in debt and $370 million in dispositions.
so, implying that we would still be in that $150 million to $200 million over the next couple years. of course, given the outlook for the cap rate environment, it's something we will take into consideration or at least our expectation of the outlook and as to whether or not we choose to do any of that earlier to make sure we monetize at attractive valuations.
juan sanabria -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
the next question comes from nick joseph with citi. please go ahead.
nick joseph -- citigroup -- analyst
thanks. just given your sources and uses that you outlined on s16, what's the current appetite for acquisitions or presale deals beyond what you've already committed to?
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
nick, at this point in time, as william, i think, mentioned in his script, development continues to be our absolute highest and only focus on investment. certainly, presale developments as it relates to getting yields at the 5.75% to 6.25% depending upon market and growth profile could be attractive also. but certainly, our own accretive developments are the number one priority of the company.
nick joseph -- citigroup -- analyst
thanks. the 97% occupancy this academic year, what percentage of beds are december-ending leases and how does that compare to last year?
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
it's relatively on para with last year. i think on the entire portfolio, we ended up with 100 more december-ending leases. so, nothing material that gives us concern in terms of our fall-off from fall to spring occupancy to be anything more than it traditionally is.
nick joseph -- citigroup -- analyst
thanks. just finally, now that overall occupancy is back to its long-term average, do you think that 2.25% rental revenue growth mid-point is a good longer-term run rate?
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
i think this year, you have a little bit more headwinds, perhaps. in tallahassee, that we mentioned, it has a little bit of a drag on that. i think the historical run rate is closer to 2.5%. it continues to be the 2.5% to 2.6%, what i would say is more of your long-term. tallahassee, as i mentioned in my comments, will be a little bit of a tough comp going forward this year with the new supply coming in, which i think is a little bit of a drag on the revenue numbers, but overall -- as jennifer mentioned in her script at 97%,
i think our historical average is still 97.6%. so, you've got potential 60 points basis of occupancy to our historical averages. that coupled with rate growth, that 2.5% is something we're really comfortable with.
nick joseph -- citigroup -- analyst
thanks.
operator
the next question comes from sami kanal with evercore. please go ahead.
samir khanal -- evercore isi -- managing director
hey, guys. good morning. as you sit here today, could you talk about some of the markets that may be at risk beyond the ones that we -- there's austin, tallahassee, college station, florida state -- are there any other that are kind of in your radar from a supply standpoint at this time?
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
yeah. from a supply perspective, as i mentioned in my comments, we actually feel better about going into next year's supply that even '18. while it's up nominally 2,000 beds across the portfolio, as i mentioned, that's in 34 markets versus 26 last year, also 20 of those 34 had no development last year. so, the natural barriers to entry in the space continue to be proven. i mentioned that the new supply coming online is 1.3% of enrollment, which mirrors what the 14-year average has been since we went public.
certainly, as we mentioned, the focus markets from last year, tallahassee is the only one that really was a little tougher than expected. as we go into next year, we set rates there down 2% going in. that's why the comment to nick about tallahassee being a little bit of a drag on the overall portfolio, but austin continued to perform well and have same-store noi growth in what people thought was going to be a challenging year and austin continued to contribute positively.
college station, again, kudos to the team -- we're at 97%+ occupancy there, up 160 basis points from last year. we're also pleased to see the college station market as a whole reach 90%. last year, it was down in the low 80s. so, you're starting to see some of that absorption in the prior year's enrollment growth kick in. and in all the other markets in the top ten, as i mentioned, we'll have 18% of our noi. so, it's more normal and ordinary supply as you've seen to historical content.
i don't think supply -- we do point out tallahassee as a market, given the dynamic there, that it's not a high enrollment growth school when you have another trench coming on next year of good pedestrian supply that we think will have short-term absorption pressures. shy of that, it's really more of the normal, consistent supply versus demand curve we've seen in the space for the last 12 to 15 years.
samir khanal -- evercore isi -- managing director
okay. thanks bill.
operator
next question comes from drew babin with baird. please go ahead.
alex kubicek -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
good morning. this is alex kubicek on for drew. i'm generally looking for some color on how the core-based acquisition assets performed in the '18-'19 lease up and how do you expect them to perform in your '19-'20 expectations?
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
yeah. core came in right at about 96%, which is right in line with the expectations. we had to give a specific guidance by portfolio. with the 97% occupancy average at the midpoint of our guidance, i would say we expect that subcomponent to operate no less than that. so, a little bit of room for improvement there of 100 basis points of occupancy, i would say, built into that.
alex kubicek -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
great. that's really helpful. so, assuming the '19-'20 lease up is more rate driven given tougher occupancy comps, do you expect a similar distribution of rent growth outcomes for the assets, given the occupancy buckets you provide in the supplemental and are you guys more hesitant to push rate on those properties that are under 95% until the occupancy kind of breaks that threshold?
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
that's a great question. if you look at the breakdown currently on page s8 of the supplemental and you look at that first category this year where the properties that were 98% or greater contributed 3.8% rental rate growth, i would point out that all of our tallahassee properties from the year before were in that bucket. so, that 3.8% strong growth well above the median in the portfolio was including tallahassee being in that bucket.
well, tallahassee is now in the lower bucket of the 95% or blow. that 98% or above currently consists going into next year of 59,000 beds or 63% of our portfolio, so a little higher average. i would say that category has greater pricing potential this year than last because of the makeup of what is in there.
as it relates to the bucket that is 95% and below, this is one where we do not in any form or fashion get hung up with what the headline rental rate number is on that in that it's all about maximization of rental revenue. so, we will always in that category market by market -- i mentioned tallahassee, tallahassee we ended up in the market coming in about 92% occupancy. we're down on setting rates in that market next year targeting about 2% below that currently, but we believe we got 700 bits of occupancy to make up for it.
so, when you look at that category this year, it was the greatest contributor with rental rate growth -- i'm sorry, with rental revenue growth -- being 6.1%. so, we're really agnostic as to how that growth ultimately materializes. so, it's not unusual for us to see -- this year, we had a great opportunity with that portfolio being at 84.1%. you saw us make hey with where that group leased up to at the 92.8%.
the last time we saw that much occupancy potential in that category was back in '08 when we bought gmh. you saw the same type of metrics as you see on this page in terms of that year we had rental rate down in that category to produce that growth. it also gives you a good foundation of rental rate off of which to grow going into future years, which you'll see in that portfolio this year as it moves in. so, yeah, you'll see a consistent probably management of rate versus occupancy in that category as you've seen previously.
alex kubicek -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
thanks. that's really helpful. one more question from me -- we were curious as to whether this year's lease up exposed any indications of distress among the private developers and if so, whether any opportunities exist where acc might seek to acquire some of those properties down the road.
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
the one thing -- if any of you all visited the nmhc student housing conference, one of the questions that was asked during my panel, there was a quote by chris merrill that they asked us to comment on at harrison street. you have a lot of what had been merchant developers in the space that now have equity available to them with the global influx of capital and they are now looking at longer hold periods and for the first time in their company's history, turning from a merchant developer where they have one or two-year old properties they stabilize and flip into now going to operate those properties on a more three-to-five year horizon.
candidly, we're two to three years into that. our greatest opportunities for growth have come in past years when the acquisition and the consolidation cycles were in play and people that were attempting to build larger portfolios don't have the operating platform that we do and it creates the opportunities for us when we do get back into an acquisition mode to create that upside in occupancy.
so, i think that you will see over the next let's call it three to seven years in the cycle, maybe two to seven years in the cycle, start to see some of those shorter term funds three to five years that are putting those portfolios together with folks that had been merchant developers, come to market and those portfolios are going to offer more operational upside than what you've seen in the last two to three years with the first year stabilization taking place and then the flips.
so, i do think from an investment trend perspective -- again, we're completely out of the acquisitions game at the moment, but the cycles will come and go and there will be a point in time we'll back in and i do think over the decades-long strategic plan, we will be the industry consolidator and you'll see those opportunities for us to have more growth potential organically as we integrate larger m&a opportunities down the road that have that operational upside.
alex kubicek -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
thanks for all the help.

next question comes from alexander goldfarb with sandler o'neill. please go ahead.
alexander goldfarb -- sandler o'neill -- managing director
hey, good morning down there. i appreciated the ""smokey & the bandit."" so, just a few quick questions here -- one of the things with the topic on last quarter's call was the ability for you guys to grow in 2019 after you guys have done the balance sheet and portfolio repositioning. so, can we just talk about two items -- one, daniel, the cost efficiencies, you mentioned hurricane was a positive this quarter, but also some cost saves.
so, how much cost saves, given that you're going to have like the 2.25 midpoint on revenue, it sounds like operating expenses are going to be key to driving noi next year. and then two on the capital markets front, we can get a sense where bond yields are, but just curious on the disposition side, assume that any dispositions would be for handles rather than higher cap rate assets. so, if you could, just provide a little comment on two of those as we think about 2019 and earnings growth.
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and treasurer
sure. obviously, we certainly know the market would like to see a return to more normalized earnings-per-share growth, as would we. as we get ready to give guidance on the next call, the things we'll be assessing through the rest of the year here are exactly as you point out -- on the same-store noi growth, the revenue side is laid out. you have the lease up from this fall generating 3.6% opening revenue growth. the 2.25 that you just referenced is for next fall.
when you bring the two of those together and the seasonality that impacts the summer months, you're going to come up with something in the high two's in terms of revenue growth. so, the other side of the noi equation is what we can do on the operating expense side. we have seen a lot of benefits of the asset management initiatives. we think over the long-term that there are continued benefits from that.
whether or not those will generate additional savings relative to this year is hard to determine at this point. also, when you consider that property taxes are 25% of our operating expense budget, if you're seeing 5%+ growth in your property taxes, you'd have to have 2% growth in the rest of your more controllable operating expenses to keep same store operating expense growth around 3%. so, the real mover that unfortunately we can't control are the property taxes.
so, we assessments come in through the end of the year here, we'll get a better handle on that and our thoughts for next year and what we will do for guidance.
the second part of the equation is what we do on the capital front. as you mentioned, we know where bond yields are today. as we look at bonds or other sources of long-term debt capital that we might use to term out our floating rate debt, that can have an impact. so, we will look at what triggers we want to pull there with the idea of obviously managing our exposure to the interest rate market for the long-term but also trying to generate earnings growth.
then lastly, on dispositions, as i talked about on the earlier question, we can do about $150 million to $200 million of dispositions a year to manage the funding need, which is very reasonable through 2023. whether or not we decide to go ahead and do any of that earlier, though, is what can certainly swing earnings. we like where the cap rate environment is today and being able to monetize assets in that 4% to 4.5% range. those are the types of assets that we would be looking at recycling. but whether or not we want to do more of it could certainly have an impact on earnings.
we always at this time of year are going through a full assessment of the portfolio now that we've completed the lease up and seen what markets we think it's the right time to go ahead and harvest capital in. that will drive how much we come out with in terms of a guidance for disposition.
i think the $200 million that we talked about on the last call is still a decent starting point for people to think about and then we will look about whether we're going to do $150 million or $300 million next year and give that as part of our guidance.
alexander goldfarb -- sandler o'neill -- managing director
okay. and then the second question is for bill -- bill, on the revenue expectations for the next school year, the 1.5% to 3% -- at the low-end, at the 1.5%, if you described a scenario where the supply outlook is improving, it's spread over a lot more markets and it's less of your noi impacted, i understand tallahassee, but every year, there's always some sort of market that's an issue. what would cause revenue growth to only be 1.5%? what are some of the negatives that go there versus something in the 2% to 3% range?
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
yeah, just all occupancy variation, alex. as you finish out the lease up on the portfolio of 168 properties and look at all of the potential outcomes throughout the marketplaces, you could collectively end up at a lower occupancy based on small minute variations in numerous markets. so, it's all part of a potential realistic range of outcomes. certainly, from a rate perspective, to fall very low in occupancy and have your rate diminishment fall to that level, that would be a rare situation that we haven't seen occur throughout the portfolio, where you've seen both of those instances happen.
so, the 1.5% to 3% is something that, as jennifer mentioned in her comments, with the 97% occupancy, that is a variation that is pretty much predicated upon your rental rate variation throughout the lease up. so, as we did mention, the percent of the portfolio and those top ten supply margins is only 18% of the noi this year versus 30%. so, the overall profile is one that we're comfortable with in terms of that 1.5% to 3% being a very realistic range that we can operate within.
alexander goldfarb -- sandler o'neill -- managing director
thank you, bill.
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
thank you, alex.
operator
the next question comes from austin wurschmidt with keybanc capital markets. please go ahead.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, good morning, guys. i wanted to touch a little bit on the capital allocation side. you talked about potentially evaluating some of the presale deals to the extent they were in the right markets with the right growth. but just curious -- with the stock trading off today, i've got it trading at a 6 implied cap rate. my numbers are probably higher after today's move. you start to approach a development-type yield on your existing portfolio, given the transaction environment, would you consider selling additional assets to buy back stock?
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and treasurer
i would tell you the first comment you made there was around presales. certainly, in the environment we're in, that drops on the priority list. the developments, as bill talked about, remain the top priority. we do have a development pipeline through 2023, not obviously completely to the size that we've had historically, but we've got an in-place development pipeline that we need to address.
so, the first priority would be recycling assets to make sure we're in a strong position to fund that. we don't want to be putting ourselves in a situation where we're using our capital from recycling to buy back stock and then get stuck in a position where we would have to drive up leverage to complete our development pipeline.
so, the question that you always go to when you're talking about stock buybacks is how persistent is the discount going to be on your stock price and is it something that is going to persist for several years to where you can make a fundamental shift in your strategy, but until we see something like that develop, we're going to be focused on making sure we're in a position to manage the health of the balance sheet and complete the development pipeline we have in place, which will create value.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. appreciate your comments there. bill, from your comments with regard to alex's question, it seems like the 1.5% to 3% range is a range you're very comfortable with, i'd say, in the current environment. and even speaking to the properties this year that were 95% and above occupied achieved revenue growth of 3%.
so, it seems like that's a fairly reasonable range and something, i guess, that setting a little bit of a lower bar versus the prior couple of years, how will you think about evaluating reassessing that range given you did that a few times this year and ultimately there was a little bit of more challenged market conditions in a market like tallahassee that ultimately has you coming in a little softer than expected toward the end of the pre-leasing season.
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
yeah. and certainly, those last two years of reassessing that range, when we look at that 1.5% to 3% being very realistic given the current market conditions and the outcome, we do believe that's a good realistic basis for our guidance moving into next year and something we are comfortable with. it is based upon where actual current market conditions are and the lease that we've just gone through and how we believe the opportunity is to perform.
austin wurschmidt -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
again, if you have a question, please press * then 1. the next question comes from john pawlowski with green street advisors. please go ahead.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
thanks. just sticking with the guidance for next year's lease up, i was just curious about the process on supply growth. you went through axio's numbers. the short question is do you just take axio's supply growth forecast -- is that embedded in the 2.25% at the midpoint?
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
certainly, we look at axio in terms of the industry fundamental statements that we make, but we have absolute rock solid data in our markets that we operate in that we share with axio to make sure that they have everything consolidated int heir projections and utilize that market by market data in relation to our own portfolio.
that is a very in-depth -- i'll give you an example here. just to take you through, you look at the development that is taking place at florida state and where we mentioned florida state. most of that development that is taking place at florida state is core pedestrian properties in close proximity to campus that are direct competitive comps to the current assets that we own in that marketplace and we evaluate what those particular assets coming in impact may be on our rental rate growth ability and velocity of leasing.
by contrast, you look at san marcos, which is in the top ten, all of that development coming in in san marcos is more of a long bicycle, candidly more of a drive portfolio of properties being developed versus our core pedestrian across the street. so, the impact on new development in those two markets is completely different as we assess our own assets individually in setting rates for last year and how it may impact velocity. then we utilize the lands program week by week, day by day, to validate the initial strategic decisions that we're making off of what i just mentioned in terms of managing that throughout the process.
so, the axiometrics level is great to determine the broader macro for the environment. we drill down much more intimately with our own data in the markets we're operating on and assess that direct competitive impact versus just the market.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
thanks. is that direct competitive ring you draw around properties, is it processed the same for this year's process versus last year in terms of how wide you set that competitive range?
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
yeah. that is probably the most intimate part of our rate-setting process that we do. at times, it comes down to -- at the end of the rental rate process, candidly, the team will schedule a meeting with me and jim and jennifer where we'll go through the three or four markets that look the most challenging or where there's a variation of opinion in terms of what are the direct competitive -- this year, one of the greatest examples we had in our portfolio is syracuse.
if you talk to our competitors, they'll tell you that's one of the toughest comps. we did very well in syracuse last year. if edr was still public, they'd be commenting on syracuse as one of the markets they're most concerned about. we're virtually done with our lease up in syracuse next year with solid metrics because of how we analyze that direct competitive comp versus what was happening in the marketplace.
so, it really is a market by market assessment. your data and your business intelligence gives you data points to study and to look at. but at the end of the day -- this is where american campus and why you see the 14 years of consecutive growth -- at the end of the day, there is always a little bit of human subjectivity that has to come in to making the calls in the tougher markets.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
okay. syracuse, since you mentioned it, just as an example of a university that's pushed for on campus mandates for sophomores and even debating juniors living on campus -- just curious, any of your other schools, are they currently evaluating on campus -- mandatory on campus living for upper classmen?
william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
if you look over the 15 years that we've been public, those situations have been few and far between. so, syracuse doing so -- this is where investment criteria and selection are paramount. when you look at our assets in syracuse and why we're doing very well is because we are in those pedestrian legacy sites that are comparable in location to the on-campus housing. the people that are getting hurt are those properties that are further out from campus that don't perform as well.
now, sometimes, you've seen those housing initiatives take place. for example, you see asu went from no housing policy to on campus expectation for freshmen, largely driven by us and all of our investment on campus.
so, the one thing i would say as a general statement is that we have always said at american campus even where we own off-campus properties and don't have any investment on campus, we like to see the university having a very large -- we don't mind if it is an increasing on campus base, whether it's a first-year housing requirement or a first-year and a sophomore because the most likely tenant to live in an american campus community, where we focus on emulating an academic environment just like the university does, those are our number one target market each year.
for example, this year, at virginia commonwealth university, we opened an ace transaction that was a 1,200-bed facility that was adding to the number of residence hall beds on campus. it wasn't a change in policy, but there were 1,200 more residence hall beds on campus than previous that we brought online. we also own three off-campus assets that have a little bit of a variation in their occupancy this year because of those 1,200 beds we brought on.
long-term, those three apartment complexes we own off-campus are going to have better prospects every year because of those 1,200 extra beds feeding off campus every year. so, that's not necessarily a negative thing when universities do that if we own the right assets and the right location.
john pawlowski -- green street advisors -- analyst
okay. thanks, bill.

william c. bayless jr. -- chief executive officer
thank you, ryan. good morning and thank you all for joining us as we discuss our third quarter 2018 financial and operating results.
as the team will detail during the call, the quarter was highlighted by the following -- the successful completion of the 2018 lease up, which positions us for our 14th consecutive year of growth in same-store rental rate, rental revenue, and noi, strong internal growth, with same-store noi for the quarter of 4.5% over q3 of the prior year, the successful delivery of 10 high-quality core pedestrian assets on-time, under budget, and fully stabilized at 97% opening occupancy, and further progress in regards to on campus development awards.
beyond american campus' performance, at the recent nmhc student housing conference, industry participants reported another successful lease up and a vibrant transaction market. additionally, axiometrics reports solid industry fundamentals nationally regarding the more than 453,000 same-store portfolio, which they track, with core pedestrian assets located within a half-mile of their respective campuses increasing 50 bits to 95.1% in fall of 2018 from 94.6% in the prior year and with rental rates increasing by 1.7%.
axiometrics also expects new supply for fall of 2019 to decline nationally, with a decrease of 6% to 14% based on how actual construction starts to materialize. in acc markets, we're tracking new supply for fall of 2019 consistent with historical levels, with new supply representing approximately 1.3% of enrollment.
while we're tracking approximately 28,000 new beds in fall of 2019 versus 26,000 this fall, it's important to note that next year's anticipated new supply is spread over 34 of our markets versus 26 markets this year, translating into a smaller number of new beds per market. it's also worth noting that the top 10 new supply markets for 2019 represent only 18% of our noi versus this year's top 10, which represented 30% of our noi. additionally, over 20 of the 34 new supply markets for next fall received no significant new supply in 2018.
we do expect new supply to continue to impact the florida state market in the short-term, as 2,168 new beds are scheduled to come online in fall of 2019, in addition to the 2,375 beds that came online in the fall of 2018, with the overall market occupancy only reaching 90% in this fall.
overall, broad industry fundamentals remain healthy and we look forward to another successful lease up for the fall of 2019-2020 academic year.
with that, i'll turn it over to jennifer beese, our chief operating officer, to provide additional color on our operational results.
jennifer beese -- chief operating officer
thanks, bill. as bill mentioned, our third quarter 2018 same-store operational results were in line with our expectations. as seen on page s5 of the supplemental, quarterly same-store property noi increased by 4.5% on a 2% increase in revenue and a decrease in operating expenses of 0.2%, consistent with the quarterly growth profile outlined in prior calls. our 2% third quarter revenue increase reflects a combination of the '17-'18 and '18-'19 academic years.
our expense profile in the third quarter was largely in line with our expectations, with the majority of our expense category showing savings or inflationary growth. we are very pleased with our controllable expense categories, both for the quarter and year to date, with q3 resulting in controllable expense savings of 1.5% in year to date controllable expense growth of only 0.7%.
these results have been positively impacted by our asset management focus on items such as utilities, where we will continue to benefit from additional phases of our led lighting initiative, as well as leveraging our national purchasing power with our cable and internet providers.
turning to leasing, as bill highlighted, both our 2019 same-store portfolio and our 2018 development and presale properties were 97% occupied on september 30th. the acc team did an outstanding job of once again producing industry-leading leasing results. we are especially pleased to have returned to our long-term track record of opening our new properties fully stabilized.
based on our initial rate setting and occupancy projections for the '19-'20 academic year, our 2020 same-store properties are expected to produce opening fall rental revenue growth ranging from 1.5% to 3%. since our portfolio finished this lease up at an occupancy level consistent with our long-term average of approximately 97%, we expect the majority of this revenue growth will be driven by rental rate increases.
we look forward to updating the market on our next call with the specifics of our 2019 guidance expectations. i will now turn the call over to william to discuss our investment activities.
william talbot -- chief investment officer
thanks, jennifer. turning first to development, we successfully delivered 10 owned assets and presales this fall, totaling almost 7,000 beds and $670 million in cost. all these projects were delivered on time and on budget with a starting fall occupancy of 97%. development remains our top investment priority, with yields in excess of 200 basis points above current market cap rates for similar products.
we continue to build our future delivery of owned developments with the execution of the ground lease and start of construction of the 584-bed apartment community on the campus of san francisco state. the $129 million project represents the first private developer-owned on campus p3 housing community within the california state university system and is targeted to deliver in fall of 2020.
we are currently under construction on six owned developments and presales for delivery in 2019 and 2020, totaling 3,744 beds and $534 million, with all projects targeting between a 6.25% to 6.75% nominal yield per developments and 5.34% to 6.25% for presales.
in addition, we are on schedule to break ground on our 10,440-bed, $615 million development on the campus of walt disney world in q4 of this year, subject to final project feasibility and receipt of final permits. the first phase will deliver in may of 2020 and upon completion of the final phase in 2023, we expect to achieve a 6.8% nominal yield.
with regards to on campus third-party development, we continue to progress on our four projects under construction on the campuses of the university of california, irvine, the university of arizona, the university of illinois at chicago, and delaware state. all four projects are targeted to open in fall of 2019 and generate $15.9 million in development fees. we are pleased to announce we have been awarded a fifth development on the campus of the university of california, irvine. the project is in pre-development and is expected to deliver in 2021.
turning to the investment market, we continue to see tremendous private investor interest in the sector. with the sale of edr to greystar and blackstone that was completed in september, transaction volume through the third quarter totaled over $12.8 billion, eclipsing the all-time volume of annual investment in the sector, according to the baml hff third quarter market update. with a significant amount of transactions on the market under contract, most brokers are anticipating a strong fourth quarter of investment activity.
with that, i will now turn it over to daniel to discuss our financial results.
daniel perry -- executive vice president, chief financial officer, and treasurer
thanks, william. as reported, total ffom for the third quarter of 2018 was $60.6 million or $0.44 per diluted share. results for the quarter were in line with our expectations. compared to the third quarter of 2017, ffom declined approximately 2% due to $614 million of capital recycling activity completed in the second quarter of 2018, resulting in lost noi and non-controlling interest of approximately $5 million and $2.9 million in higher third-party fee income in the third quarter 2017 associated with the closing of the uci for development.
as jennifer discussed, our same store operating results were strong at 4.5% noi growth, but also in line with our expectations. as always, the third quarter is a mix of two academic years, the final summer months of the '17-'18 academic year and the very beginning of the '18-'19 academic year that both influence the same-store revenue growth for the quarter. accordingly, the third quarter same-store revenue growth of 2% includes the lower revenue growth coming off of the fall 2017 lease up.
with regards to same store operating expenses, we achieved a 0.2% reduction expenses for the quarter. as we have discussed throughout this year, we expected to generate expense savings in the third quarter due to the benefits of the cost control initiatives associated with our asset management program as well as significant hurricane expenses incurred in the prior year quarter.
as we look to the fourth quarter of 2018, we do expect an increase in same-store operating expense growth given that we achieved a 1.8% reduction in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017. when some of our current face of expense control initiatives started to materialize.
from a balance sheet perspective, as of september 30th, the company's debt to enterprise value was 34.3%, debt to total asset value was 36.2%, and the net debt to run rate ebitda was 6.2 times. our floating rate debts now stands at 17.3% of total debt. as you will see in our supplemental, we will update our capital allocation and long-term funding plan on page s16 to reflect the completion of the 2018 development projects.
with the commencement of the san francisco state ace development, we have now incorporated our first 2020 development outside of the disney student housing project announced last quarter. including the current 2019 and 2020 owned presale developments and the first faces of disney, expected to be delivered in late 2020, we have approximately $650 million in development cost, which we expect to fund throughout 2019 and 2020 with a mix of cash on hand, cashflow available for reinvestment, and $450 million to $500 million of additional debt, equity, and/or joint venture and disposition capital over the next two years.
as always, we will monitor the markets and access the most attractive sources of capital throughout this time period, both from a weighted average cost of capital perspective and with a focus on maintaining the health of our balance sheet. with that in mind, until we see an improvement in the cost of our equity, we will look to take advantage of the very high-demand environment we are seeing for core student housing from private capital around the globe through a continuation of our annual capital recycling program.
turning now to our 2019 earnings outlook -- taking into consideration the results of the fall 2018 lease up and operating performance through the third quarter as well as expectations for the remainder of the year, we are tightening our 2018 ffom guidance range to $2.29 to $2.33 per fully diluted share and maintaining the expected midpoint of $2.31 per share. all changes to the components of guidance were net neutral to the previous midpoint of same-store noi, total noi, and overall ffom, and are detailed on pages s17 and s19 of the earnings supplemental.
with that, i'll turn it back to the operator to start the question and answer portion of the call.
