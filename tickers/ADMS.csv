thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from marc goodman with svb leerink. your line is now open.
rudy li -- svb leerink -- analyst
hi. it is rudy on the line for marc. so i'm just wondering -- first question is, how the physician and patient feedback so far with free drug program, have noticed any notable changes on the treatment landscape, on the dynamics? second question is, we planned for the patient awareness campaign in june, i'm just wondering, can you provide more color on that program? thanks.
gregory went -- co-founder, chairman & chief executive officer
thank you very much for the question. vijay, you want to tackle both of those?
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
sure. let me begin with the free trial program. the program is being perceived right now, in terms of feedback, as being one of the most generous among all of the peer set. it is a 28-day free trial program. the adoption among current users of gocovri has been very robust. and as i said, our goal moving forward is to expand knowledge and awareness of that program and trial of that program among non-adopters and new patient types.
in terms of your second question. we have initiated a program called the go getter patient education program. it is currently in market. it was fielded toward the end of may, beginning of june. it is just a little early to speak to what the impact of that program is, but we'll keep you posted in future calls.
rudy li -- svb leerink -- analyst
thanks. that's very helpful.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david amsellem with piper jaffray. your line is now open.
david amsellem -- piper jaffray -- analyst
thanks. so, just a couple. first on commercial consideration for gocovri in ms. are you expecting -- this is really for vijay, are you expecting a step through toward dalfampridine in order to gain access to the product? and i realize that you don't have the data, but talk about the -- how restrictive you think the payer landscape would be vis-a-vis dalfampridine? a follow on, number two, would you consider partnering with another company for the commercial launch or are you completely wedded to launching it on your own? and if so, how many reps are you going to add to support the launch in ms gait? thanks.
gregory went -- co-founder, chairman & chief executive officer
vijay?
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
yes. so, two-part question, i see. so the first question in terms of ms itself, it all depends on the clinical profile of the drug and what the clinical studies show us and what that readout is. we all eagerly anticipate toward the end of this year. what i will comment on in the ms market is, was commented on in the prepared remarks is, a lot of learnings for us from where we are in the pd market and what we can apply to in the ms market. now it is a well-established market for ms walking. it is a market which has seen specialty neurology drugs for a long period of time. the patient demographics are younger, more motivated to seek help and to proactively talk to their physicians about new treatment options. so we expect a different and more active dynamic for how that drug launches in that market.
to your second question, we have done some preliminary analysis of where the account concentration and physician prescriber concentration is for ms, it does remain highly concentrated. so, we'll keep you posted about our plans for the sales force. but currently, i believe we are right-sized for what we need to do.
david amsellem -- piper jaffray -- analyst
okay. thank you.
gregory went -- co-founder, chairman & chief executive officer
thanks, david.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from tim lugo with william blair. your line is now open.
myles minter -- william blair -- analyst
hi. this is myles on for tim. thanks for taking the questions. just the first one on your 40% to 50% conversion rate for the free drug program, i am wondering how many of those patients actually experienced a neuropsych adverse event? and whether or not, there is obviously more conversion from free drug to paid drug in patients that happen to have that bad experience? and then secondly, just in terms of the inroads trial and now assessing dalfampridine discontinuations and native treatment, was that trial when you responded was it already powered to view those two groups on and off drug on your primary endpoint there and what are your pairing assumptions in general? thanks.
gregory went -- co-founder, chairman & chief executive officer
vijay, you want to go first again?
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
so, we have done an analysis of patients who received drug through the free trial program in order to understand where the gaps were in them converting to maintenance scripts. the vast majority of patients actually drop-off because of operational considerations, right? there are prior authorizations that are still in process. there are steps that a physician's office needs to complete. there are steps that a patient themselves need to complete. that's where we believe we can have the most impact, which is why one of the focus areas that i articulated, in terms of fulfillment, focuses on the operational effectiveness to make it simpler, and more transparent and reliable. and actually the aes are not one of the big reasons why they drop off as far as we've seen in our initial analysis. let me pass on to rajiv.
rajiv patni -- chief medical officer
and onto the inroads stay design, as i shared in my prepared remarks, the trial based on fda feedback at the end of phase 2 meeting was powered to compare active to placebo, a assumption of 33% inactive versus 20% placebo. and equally importantly is that each subgroup i commented on is reasonably sized, permitting us to characterize the effect on those patients who are treated with dalfampridine in the past versus who were not.
myles minter -- william blair -- analyst
beautiful. thanks for the clarification and congratulations, alf.
alfred merriweather -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from ken cacciatore with cowen and company. your line is now open.
ken cacciatore -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks, guys, for the questions. vijay, i know you're new in going through all the different parts of the operation, but just wondering your view of osmolex and its implications to the launch and is there any way in which we can avoid them or somehow have that impact mitigated? and then secondly, can you get into a little bit deeper into this fulfillment issue with these number of patients that you're talking about, new patients starting? it seems as if you could really give a white-glove service almost on an individual level to get them going.
so just confused as to what is happening that somehow with this view of patients we're losing not properly processing paperwork and getting the drug to them. and then lastly, can you just talk about the co-pay and the charities that are available to help? any sense of what's going on with those? and is the co-payment and that issue causing some problems as well? thank you.
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
sure. so let me begin with the first part of your question, which was with regard to osmolex. here's what i've learned in my listening tour the last couple of months. as i said in my prepared remarks, gocovri really stands out as a differentiated drug, in this space because of the clinical profile which has been demonstrated through a couple of clinical trials, right. so the only drug to have clinical efficacy demonstration in a large clinical trial, both on the dyskinesia side and secondarily on the off side and also in recent post-hoc analyses to show the increase in continuous on-time the reduction of disruptive episodes in a patient's day, so really a remarkable clinical profile is how physicians characterize it to me. so i think the other competitors are in the market, but we don't believe that they are making as many inroads or having a significant impact on our presence in the marketplace. so that's your question one.
in terms of fulfillment, which was your second question, i think we are looking at various aspects of the process, the steps in the process, the complexity of the process, the lack of -- or i'd rather frame it as a white space that exists between a physician spending in a treatment form and then finally getting confirmation that their patient is on drugs. there are a lot of elements during this process where we could potentially look and improve our services and that's where our focus is. so. the option that you proposed is on the table and we're looking at all options.
the third question you had was about co-pay and charities. i presume you're referring to foundations and where assistance to patients is being offered. we are continuing to see that patients are able to access our drug both on the commercial side and on the medicare side, and we're continuing to see that happen. i think you raised a larger question in terms of cost of some specialty drugs. and we're looking at the various options to continue to drive access.
ken cacciatore -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from tazeen ahmad with bank of america. your line is now open.
bill -- bank of america -- analyst
hi, this is bill on for tazeen. so i have two questions. first of all, gocovri for lid has a pretty clear story around the time-dependent biology where you want to wake up with therapeutic levels on-board to avoid the morning off. how does the same time dependent in biology translate into ms walking where the diurnal pattern isn't as clear? and then for vijay, you mentioned expanding the free drug program and getting more non-adopters to, take it up. on your listening tour, what have you heard from the non-adopters as their primary reason for not adopting gocovri at this point? thanks.
gregory went -- co-founder, chairman & chief executive officer
hey, bill. it's greg, thanks for the question. i'll take the first one and then i'll see if rajiv wants to add to it. you know i think the reason why folks are familiar with the time-dependent hypothesis around dyskinesia and often parkinson's is because we're well beyond our phase 3 program where we've demonstrated it and we've talked about the underlying science to a much greater deal. in the ms area we began with a very similar understanding of the pathways that are involved in allowing people to move. we understood how those were coupled to our circadian patterns that crucially drove the hypothesis and we proved that program out, beginning with pre-clinical studies, moving it into animal models and moving it into human proof-of-concept. so, as we look and see the data coming out here and have more confidence from completed phase 3 programs we'll begin to tell that story, the basic science story, and the symptom coverage story in a more public forum.
rajiv patni -- chief medical officer
and the only thing i would add, greg is, encourage you to see our poster from aan where we began explaining to the community the time dependency of ms walking impairment for the first time.
gregory went -- co-founder, chairman & chief executive officer
and vijay, yeah the have a second one for you.
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
sure. i think that the question was about the reasons that are stated in terms of my listening tour in terms of non-adopters. right? they really boil down to two areas. i think the first is what i alluded to in terms of the opportunity with educating physicians because i think what i've heard so far is confusion around dyskinesia, how does it manifest? is it bothersome? that conversation that happens with patients, is that enough on a once every 3 to 6-month basis to identify the patients for consideration. the relationship between dyskinesia and off and i think when they learn about our clinical profile more, that shows us as an opportunity for us to really talk about gocovri and get them along the continuum. the other reason that they talk about most often is cost and perceptions of cost. and as we share some of our real data from the last year-and-a-half of experience, that seems to help them as well in terms of making that choice.
bill -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you.
gregory went -- co-founder, chairman & chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from serge belanger with needham. your line is now open.
serge belanger -- needham -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. a couple questions for me. first on the payer landscape, how satisfied are you with the current landscape? what else needs to be done there? and do you think it'd be a driver for sales in the second half of the year?
gregory went -- co-founder, chairman & chief executive officer
vijay, you want to take that?
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
sure. so, let me sate upfront, right, we are committed to making gocovri as broadly available to patients as possible. and we continue to see from what we have tracked in the first part of 2019 that prescriptions are being paid through the prior auth mechanism and coupled with the medical necessity for both commercial and medicare plans. we've seen no significant change in access in the first part of 2019. so i want to make sure that that folks you are aware. we continue to evaluate the payer landscape and we evaluate contracting as a means to drive access to simplify the prior auth process, to reduce physician burden in terms of process. but in the meantime, i think the greater area of focus for us, would be educating them about dyskinesia and the value of gocovri there. the real simplification of our fulfillment process to make it simpler for the physicians practice, and really making them aware of the free trial program. even trial the drug, and those are the three areas we can focus on.
serge belanger -- needham -- analyst
okay. and just looking at my notes, in terms of new patients, that number has been in the 700 range for the last few quarters. should we expect that to move up as the free program gets a little bit more implemented?
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
so i would say, are we satisfied with our number? no. we are continuously looking at ways for us to educate all stakeholders and improve that number. i think it's a little early for me to speak to when that turnaround will happen, but that is definitely the goal is to get us on a trajectory of robust growth in that number.
serge belanger -- needham -- analyst
thanks. all right. also i want to offer my congrats to alf.
alfred merriweather -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instruction] our next question comes from ram selvaraju with h.c. wainwright. your line is now open.
ram selvaraju -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
thanks very much for taking my questions. i just wanted to get some additional clarity on the 28-day sampling program. do you have a sense of how long you expect to keep that in place? if that's going to be sort of core component of the sales and marketing strategy for gocovri indefinitely? or if you have a plan to sort of eventually phase it out or change it in any way? and if so, what might the changes be that you would make?
and then i also wanted to ask if you're seeing any potential promotional impact from osmolex er? obviously that's been kind of around for a while, but i don't know whether you're actually seeing any promotional activities of that product coming up against you in the marketplace? if you could provide some color on that, that would be helpful.
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
to your latter question, your second question, the answer is, no. to the first question, i would say in terms of the free trial program, the current plan is --in the current format, to remind folks it's a 28-day free trial, where the drug is shipped directly to the patient, in that format we plan to continue it through the end of the year, as we have previously announced. but part of what i'm looking at right now is all of the various options open to us in addition to looking at the key metrics that come off of the current program. we're looking and evaluating at various options, one obvious option is, do we with one of the other ways of getting a free trial to a patient? so we are evaluating all options, and i'll keep you posted in the coming quarters.
ram selvaraju -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
okay, and then just -- do you have any further updates at this time on the status of the qui tam lawsuit?
gregory went -- co-founder, chairman & chief executive officer
i'll take that. no, we don't and we don't, as you imagine, we don't comment on ongoing litigation.
ram selvaraju -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
okay. thank you.
gregory went -- co-founder, chairman & chief executive officer

gregory went -- co-founder, chairman & chief executive officer
thank you, peter, and good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining us today. i'm here with vijay shreedhar, our new chief commercial officer, dr. rajiv patni, our chief medical officer and alf merriweather, our chief financial officer.
our two priorities for adamas in 2019 are driving toward commercial success by broadening and deepening gocovri's use in patients with parkinson's disease with dyskinesia and delivering top-line phase 3 data for an additional indication for gocovri in multiple sclerosis patients with walking impairment.
turning to our second quarter total gocovri paid prescriptions, which excludes patients from the free trial program rose to 6,160, up about 6% from q 1, 2019. this growth continues to be driven by patients refilling gocovri. new patient starts were up about 2%, to 740, primarily from patients using the new free trial program. while it's early days for this program, the initial conversion to paid prescriptions is running at 40% to 50%. we look to improve utilization with better promotion of the program with our physicians and increase conversion by improving operational efficiencies with the process.
patients refilling their prescriptions remains a key driver of gocovri's growth and provides a strong foundation for our future commercial initiatives. persistence remains very solid, with 55% to 60% of patients remaining on gocovri at 6 months and 45% to 50% at 12 months. maintaining this level of persistence from 6 to 12 months is a strong indicator of the value that gocovri is bringing to patients and these numbers are compelling.
for context, rasagiline, a commonly used and widely considered, well tolerated adjunctive treatment for parkinson's disease, showed persistence rates of 49% and 37%, at 6 and 12 months respectively, in our recently presented poster.
turning now to our development programs, our inroads phase 3 trial completed enrollment this quarter and is set to read out at the end of 2019. rajiv will walk you through the final enrollment details later on this call.
it's important to note that this is an already established market. today, we believe there are approximately 270,000 multiple sclerosis patients with moderate to severe walking impairment. out of those patients approximately 50,000 are receiving ongoing treatment with dalfampridine. another 100,000 have tried dalfampridine and discontinued it, and the remaining a 120,000 are dalfampridine naive. we anticipate that our initial commercial focus will be on those who've tried and discontinued dalfampridine and we look forward to seeing the top-line data from our inroads study prior to finalizing that strategy.
now, i am pleased to introduce vijay shreedhar, who joined us last quarter to lead our commercial efforts. vijay is a proven commercial leader who has grown multiple brands across multiple therapeutic areas of amgen over the past decade. what is particularly impressive about vijay is a strong scientific and broad business background. he has demonstrated success at amgen in roles spanning the commercial continuum, from sales to marketing to brand management. vijay has used his skills to both launch and realize the value of some of amgen's key brands.
i am delighted to have vijay join us to lead our commercial team and help drive us forward. over to you, vijay.
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
thank you, greg. and good afternoon, everyone. it is great to be speaking with you today. in the last two months or so that i've been at adamas, i have been in listening and learning mode, interacting with a range of key stakeholders to develop a deep understanding of our business. i have visited top movement disorder centers and neurologists to observe practice considerations, attended the international association of parkinsonism and related disorders congress to meet with thought leaders and gather insights from the leading healthcare providers on our speakers bureau.
additionally, i have visited our specialty pharmacy partner to assess the operational elements of our fulfillment and distribution process. internally, i have spoken individually and collectively to our entire sales and broader commercial teams to collect learnings and assess our organizational needs to fully unlock the commercial potential of gocovri . these interactions have confirmed the optimism and excitement for the potential of gocovri, which drew me to adamas in the first place.
i have been impressed to hear from many of the physicians and nurses, who have clinical experience with gocovri about the positive impact that the drug has on patients and caregivers lives. these healthcare practitioners see gocovri as a drug with proven clinical data and a differentiated clinical profile, as a result of these data. the recently published individual patient level analyses of the diary data from our pivotal phase 3 program, corroborate the prescriber feedback to me, that gocovri represents a paradigm shift, because of its concomitant effect on dyskinesia and off. many of the clinicians, i have interacted with, have positive patients stories and are excited about the prospects for gocovri moving forward. in short, the clinicians i've spoken with, believe the drug works very well.
my interactions with our sales force, have shown me both their commitment and passion to improve the lives of people affected by parkinson's disease, and the depth and relevance of their experience in neurology and with previous launches.
however, my interactions have also highlighted that we have work to do. there are three key areas, where i will focus intensively in the weeks and months ahead. first, we need to do a better job in educating healthcare practitioners to recognize the disruptive impact of dyskinesia, its relationship to off, and its impact on the effective treatment of parkinson's disease. while prevalent in patients treated would leave levodopa, dyskinesia is still relatively poorly understood or appreciated by both prescribers and patients. it is often confused with tremors and the impact that it may have on many aspects of a patient's daily life is not effectively highlighted. educating healthcare practitioners on these aspects, and on how to systematically identify appropriate patients for consideration of gocovri therapy offers an opportunity for enhancing patient care.
second, based on my recent observations, there is an opportunity to improve our operational effectiveness in the fulfillment process. from the moment when a physician sends in a treatment form to when a patient gets the drug, i have noted some level of frustration among prescribers and we are working actively to address this, and to improve the customer centricity of our overall fulfillment process. to ensure that we create one that is simple, reliable and transparent.
third, we need to better educate a wider audience about our 28-day free trial program, which we hope will expand trial of the drug among non-adopters. we will look at every element of the program in order to make progress on this front.
while i'm initially focused on these three areas, i continue to examine every element of our strategy and execution, and i look forward to sharing additional details about our strategic and operational plans in future calls. all of the interactions that i have described have deepened my belief in the opportunity that initially drew me to adamas. i have heard how gocovri has a significant impact on patients with parkinson's disease and have come to appreciate the impact it may have over time in other indications.
i'm particularly excited about the first of these other indications in ms walking and will turn the call over to rajiv to discuss our progress.
rajiv patni -- chief medical officer
thanks, vijay. i'm happy to report that enrollment is complete in our inroads phase 3 trial of ads-5102 in ms patients with walking impairment. this is a significant milestone in our development program. we are on track to report top-line data in late q4, 2019. this study is a three arm randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study of two dose levels of ads-5102. the primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of responders in each treatment group. a responder is defined as a patient who experienced at least a 20% increase in walking speed from baseline, as measured by the timed 25 foot walk test.
key secondary endpoints include the mean change from baseline in walking speed, the timed up and go or tug and the 2-minute walk test. the baseline demographics are noteworthy, because these data provide a snapshot into the real world effectiveness of dalfampridine. approximately, 50% of enrolled patients had received dalfampridine in the past and discontinued. this represents the dalfampridine discontinued subgroup.
the other 50% of enrolled patients represent the dalfampridine naive subgroup. in the dalfampridine discontinued subgroup, the reason for discontinuation prior to study entry was limited efficacy in 48% and adverse events in 21%. since the dalfampridine discontinued and naive subgroups are each reasonably sized, pre-specified analyses will provide an opportunity to characterize the treatment effect of ads-5102 in both subgroups. our thesis remains that the treatment effect will be consistent irrespective of prior dalfampridine use.
if the phase 3 data from inroads supports our thesis, and ads-5102 has the potential to be a treatment option for the breadth of the ms population with walking impairment. we believe the initial unmet medical need is in patients who discontinued dalfampridine in the past due to limited efficacy and/or in tolerability. our current estimate of the size of this population today is about 100,000 patients. we look forward to the read out of this trial late in fourth quarter of 2019. if successful, we expect to initiate a second pivotal study to support approval. if approved on this pathway and timeline, we would plan to launch gocovri for this new indication in 2022.
i will now turn the call over to alf.
alfred merriweather -- chief financial officer
thanks, rajiv. in the second quarter of 2019, we recorded gocovri product sales of $12.7 million. this was recorded on the sell-in method with revenue recognized typically upon delivery to our specialty pharmacy. the approximate number of total paid prescriptions was 6,160 in the second quarter, compared to 5,820 in the first quarter of 2019, about 6% higher than the prior quarter.
gross to net was consistent with the prior quarter and our commentary on the last call. regarding our overall operating results.
net loss for the quarter was $24.9 million or a loss of $0.90 per share compared to a loss of $34 million or $1.26 per share in the second quarter of 2018.
cash and investments as of june 30, 2019 were $169 million, compared to $211 million at december 31, 2018. overall, cash burn for the quarter was consistent with prior quarters at approximately $22 million.
let me now turn the call back over to greg.
gregory went -- co-founder, chairman & chief executive officer
thanks, alf. thanks, rajiv. and thanks, vijay. i want to thank the whole adamas team for their continued commitment to building a sustainable business based upon the discovery, development and commercialization of our time dependent medicines. as we reported in the press release earlier today, we announced that alf will retire on december 31, 2019. he will be succeeded by chris prentiss on november 1, the company's current senior vice president of finance and chief accounting officer. i am deeply appreciative you, alf, for your contribution to adamas' growth and your role in mentoring chris as your successor. i also appreciate your continued involvement to ensure a smooth transition. many of you will already know chris from our interactions with you on the road. he has been a leader in our finance organization since he joined us in early 2015 and has played an integral role in building our financial infrastructure. finally, i'm thrilled to have the vijay's leadership as he reshapes and focuses our commercial efforts to better drive the adoption of gocovri by physicians and patients. i am also excited for our inroads top-line results in late q4, which, if successful we expect it'll add significant potential to gocovri.
and with that i'd like to open up the line for questions. operator?
",2019-Q2,ADMS,0.85815,,
,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of jason butler with jmp securities. please proceed with your question.
jason butler -- jmp securities, llc -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress. i guess just a couple on gocovri. can you speak to the recent dynamics on patients returning to the clinics and what you've seen post the end of the quarter into july and august? and is that having any impact on the nrx? and then i guess, just, sorry, if i missed this, but given the success of the off launch, can you give us a breakdown of what proportion of the nrx for the quarter are coming from off versus dyskinesia or both? and i know it might be hard to break down, but just give us a sense of what proportion of the growth is being driven by the authentication? thanks.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
hi, jason. thanks for the question. this is neil, and i'll hand it off to vijay in a moment. but let me start by saying how proud i am of the strong demand momentum. we leave q2 with 97% year-over-year growth in our nrx number to 730. but i think as importantly, 24% quarter-over-quarter growth from q1 to q2. let me ask vijay to touch on the recent dynamics in terms of the patients and some of the off launch being on track. vijay?
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
yeah, thanks, jason. i would say that the situation remains fluid and dynamic and complex. we have seen some return of patients to clinics, as evidenced by our year-over-year trends. but based on the 17% decline that we see in the claims data for carbidopa/levodopa, it is obvious that all patients are still not back in doctor's offices. and we're still in a relatively challenging situation, which is why our performance in q2 is really so strong and remarkable. so we do need to see those carbidopa/levodopa scripts come back to growth. in the meantime, we're leaning in on tactics to get as fast -- fast of growth as possible.
to your second question, in the off launch, we're pleased to see that we have mix of patients with off dyskinesia or both. the fact is that we see the majority of those scripts coming in dyskinesia, which is not surprising given that we're in the first full quarter of launch of the off episodes. but the fact that we're getting the mix across the spectrum shows us we're making progress toward changing the paradigm of care.
jason butler -- jmp securities, llc -- analyst
okay, that's great. and then, neil, just a quick one on 4101. can you give us a sense of what potential partners have been looking for and specifically to what degree the new ip here could be a catalyst in your discussions? thanks.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
sure. so i think it's important to note that there's such an incredibly unmet need here, right in the epilepsy market. and not a lot of -- there are quite a few products that are out there being developed, but not a lot of products out there that are in late stage. so we have a phase 3 ready asset. we've started to get the intellectual property issues, and that's really been what we have been working with potential partners on the path forward and the ability to be able to get this product to patients that have an unmet need.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of tim lugo with william blair. please proceed with your question.
lachlan hanbury-brown -- william blair & company, l.l.c. -- analyst
hey, guys, this is lachlan on for tim. thanks for taking the questions. i guess, two if i can. first of all, on the addition of the alternative packages for gocovri, what was the rationale behind that? is that addressing vulnerabilities you've seen? or are you expecting to need the additional capacity for future growth within your indication or something else there? and second, in terms of the osmolex er pilot launch, can you just outline sort of what you'll be looking at to determine if you want to continue the program? i mean, is that going to be based on sales or script volume or more qualitative feedback from the market?
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
thank you, lachlan. and to answer your first question, let me start there in terms of our ability to get a second and alternative packager. having single source manufacturing is not something that as we lean into the growth trajectory that gocovri is showing with the strong demand that we've shown in the last number of quarters, that we want to have a single source. so as part of our long-term growth strategy, we implemented, a year or two ago that we needed to be able to have duplicative manufacturing capacity. and this was one of the reasons why we did that. so vijay, you want to talk a little bit about the osmolex next steps in our gated investment plan?
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
sure, neil. thanks for the question. lachlan. i would say that for osmolex, it is important to remember, we are primarily focused on gocovri here and fully living up to the potential that gocovri has to change the paradigm of care in parkinson's disease. with osmolex, we have a very disciplined gated investment plan in psychiatry. and we -- the volume of what the product is has been in the past, has been relatively minimal. and we are encouraged by the market research that tells us that there's opportunity for an extended release product in that space. and so we are in the early stages of launch, and we'll keep you updated.
lachlan hanbury-brown -- william blair & company, l.l.c. -- analyst
awesome, thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ken cacciatore with cowen. please proceed with your question.
ken cacciatore -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, neil and team. congratulations on all the progress. neil, as i listened to you, and your enthusiasm always really comes through, i think about it and listen to your commentary on dtc, and as i step back, you think about gocovri, where it is, it's a broadly covered drug, so we're not having any managed care issues. it's been on the market a sufficient amount of time that it's lead indication, and now we have off, it's a known molecule to the clinician. so i'm just wondering, why aren't we pushing the advantage even more aggressively through dtc? it would be my belief that, not only would you be activating patients, but even activating clinicians in a general sense to make them even more aware about the product that is there and kind of activate them, in addition to pushing the patients in, understanding the commentary about the market dynamics now. so i'm just trying to understand why we don't get even more aggressive, and wanted to hear a little bit more about the metrics that you're getting from your kind of initial dtc? thanks a lot.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
thanks, thanks, ken. my enthusiasm comes from the fact that gocovri has such a large opportunity and the team here has continued to drive strong demand and executing in this fluid environment. so they're the reason why i'm so motivated. and maybe i'll ask vijay to talk a little bit about some of the efforts in are multi-channel marketing that we're doing.
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
hey, ken, totally appreciate the question in terms of dtc. this is something that we've looked at carefully, and we're choosing to do it in a very efficient manner. and we're going after pockets of patients that we know, exist in certain social media platforms. and we've done our research in terms of how to most effectively reach those patient groups. and our lifetime access tv segment was one example of how we're unlocking that opportunity in a very efficient manner by going with a media platform, which we know will reach the right audience at the right time. and then we're taking and repurposing those assets through our multimedia channels in order to get the content out there as efficiently as possible. and we're tracking metrics such as engagement in our websites, in our digital assets, downloads of materials that we have out there, how many patients are watching the videos, and so on and so forth. there is a variety of metrics that we're tracking, all of which are positive. so, we're very excited that it's working so far. and we plan to continue to keep these efforts up.
ken cacciatore -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of marc goodman with svb leerink. please proceed with your questions.
marc goodman -- svb leerink -- analyst
yeah. hi. a couple of questions. first, on your payer discussions, as we move into next year, can you give us a sense of whether everything is going to be stable or whether we're going to have some improvements? are we losing some contracting? just curious how that's working out? second is, given how successful everything is going, i'm just curious, neil, if we've moved forward on business development a little bit, if there's anything else going on kind of behind the scenes? and third, just remind us, how much are we spending on osmolex, just from an advertising and promotion support? is there really anything being spent right now? and what's your plans going forward? thanks.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
thanks for the questions, mark. why don't i start with your middle question in regards to business development, then i'll ask vijay and then chris to answer some of the more detailed questions. i think it is an important -- important to note that, our focus is on the growth of gocovri. we have a large opportunity that our off indication, it just doubled our addressable market to 400,000 to 500,000 patients. the demand that we've seen is great. but there's a long way for us to go. so i think that it's important that we continue to focus on gocovri. we also focus on the integration of osmolex in the drug induced epr. that being said, we have a very efficient late-stage development team that's just finalized a very strong msw program and finalized the long-term safety study there. and we have a commercial organization that is also really clicking in regards to the execution that they're able to do in this very fluid and dynamic environment we're in. so we're actively evaluating both internal and external opportunities, and finding ways to leverage our infrastructure, because delivering value is our top priority. vijay, you want to hit on some of the payer discussions?
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
sure. mark, as you know, we are committed to broad access and affordability for gocovri. and we are actively engaging in conversations with payers, focused on the clinical and health economic value of the product. because we honestly believe that with its differentiated profile, gocovri has that opportunity to bring about a paradigm shift. and we're getting good engagement in terms of these conversations that we've had with payers. in that context, it is even more important to remember that, as a specialty medication, we do see a high rate of payer approval through our prior authorization process, the off launch is being paid for as well with those scripts. and we're seeing a 93% approval rate and 75% of patients, medicare or commercial combined, have an under $25 out of pocket costs. so, the signs are good, but we're still working on it. and stay tuned.
christopher b. prentiss -- chief financial officer
from an osmolex perspective, from a macro sense, our sg&a expense guidance for 2021 is really in line with what we spent in the prior year in 2020. so specifically, we have a very small, targeted tele detail sales team that's focused on osmolex. and we'll continue to evaluate as the year goes on and determine if we need to make further investments at that point in time.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of david amsellem with piper sandler. please proceed with your question. mr. amsellem, can you check to see if your line is on mute, please? thank you. our next question comes from the line of ram selvaraju with h.c. wainwright. please proceed with your question.
mason -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
hi, this is mason [phonetic] for ram. thanks for taking our questions, and congrats on the quarter. so just regarding your published paper in june of this year, which revealed, gocovri may be impacting gait freezing. is this something that you've propagated in your marketing and education efforts? and if not, do you plan on doing so?
christopher b. prentiss -- chief financial officer
thanks, maz [phonetic]. we're glad that you asked us a question that we can hand off to adrian, but he might need some additional clarity in regards to which papers, because we've had a number of papers published in the last couple of months.
mason -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
so this was the second one, which showed that gocovri may be impacting gait freezing on the mds-updrs part ii, so this was the post-hoc analysis.
christopher b. prentiss -- chief financial officer
great. adrian?
adrian quartel -- chief medical officer
yeah, thanks for the question. so this is the house of paper we published in june this year, but it -- we performed a sub-analysis on the mds-updrs part ii, which really focuses on the motor complications that patients have, or that the parkinsonism issues that patients have, who have parkinson's disease and the effects of gocovri on that. as part of that, scale that has been used, gait freezing is indeed one of the 13 questions that the patients can answer, and we saw a statistically significant improvement in gait freezing in those patients and overall, of the 13 sub issues addressed by this mds-updrs score, 12 were improved in top of those subscales, patients have probably improved compared to placebo. i'll hand it over.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think your next question was with, are we able to promote that? and we promote based on our label, and that's not currently in our label.
mason -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
okay, fantastic. makes sense. and then just finally, this may be a naive question, but is there any scope to draw on historical osmolex er trial data to perform, a similar kind of post-hoc analysis, as you've done with gocovri? and would this be of any value?
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
great question, maz [phonetic]. so i think we mentioned that our q1 call, as we finalize the acquisition of the product, that it is our intent to get the data from the phase 3 trials out. adrian is working diligently with his team and the investigators to do just that. so i think there is opportunity for us to learn from the data. and there's opportunity for us to make sure that we lean in to ensuring the continued differentiation of the two products between gocovri and osmolex. stay tuned.
mason -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
all right. excellent. congrats on the quarter.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of david amsellem with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
david amsellem -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, thanks for fitting me in, and sorry about that. so just real quick, on the off time indication, and i apologize if i missed this. but, over time, it seems like you're accessing, i mean, it doesn't seem, but that i think it -- you've confirmed us that that you're accessing a wider parkinson's population. so, i guess with that in mind, should we think about any expansion of the commercial infrastructure over the long-term? and i know you addressed business development, but maybe as a sort of corollary to that topic, what's your appetite for taking on any r&d risk to the extent that you are to buy an asset? thanks.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
thanks, david. let me let me ask vijay to touch on the first question in regards to the off indication. and we definitely are accessing a wider market opportunity, right. we went from 200,000 patients with dyskinesia and off to an additional 200,000 to 300,000 patients with off, which gives us 400,000 to 500,000 patients now. so i think that -- we are definitely seeing this large opportunity in wider patient population to try and to provide the opportunity for gocovri. vijay, can you talk a little more about off, and i'll get into the -- question.
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
sure, neil. thanks for the question, david. i would say it's important to keep in mind that while the population of patients has expanded, it is a very highly concentrated marketplace with these patients being treated by the same physicians we were targeting with the dyskinesia launch. so we believe that we are right-sized with our sales force, and we are intensifying our efforts to provide coverage through a multimedia digital campaign. and we believe that, that is sufficient to get to the opportunity efficiently.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
so david, in regards to the bd question and the appetite for r&d risk, i think it's really important, to delivering value is our top priority. and our largest opportunity to deliver value today is being able to continue to execute on our off launch, and drive the foundation for what we can do in the future. there's also the element that i spoke about briefly in the prior question, around the ability to leverage our infrastructure. we've proven that we can do late-stage neurology development in the ms, multiple sclerosis phase. we've proven that we can get additional lifecycle completed with our snda for the off episodes indication. and we're now proving that we can commercialize drugs in a very complex environment and drive strong demand momentum. i think as part of that, we need to also figure out in the long-term, based on our current strength of our foundation, how we leverage our infrastructure and build value over time. so today, our value driver is gocovri, and launching it into this wider and larger opportunity. in the future, we need to find a way to leverage our expertise in the infrastructure that we have.
david amsellem -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thanks, neil.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer

greetings and welcome to the adamas pharmaceuticals' second quarter 2021 financial results and corporate update conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to peter vozzo, investor relations representative for adamas pharmaceuticals. please go ahead, sir.
peter vozzo -- investor relations representative
thank you, michelle, and good afternoon, everyone. on the call with me today are neil mcfarlane, chief executive officer; vijay shreedhar, chief commercial officer; and chris prentiss, chief financial officer. we also have dr. adrian quartel, chief medical officer on the call to answer questions during the q&a.

i will now, turn the call over to neil mcfarlane.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
thank you, peter. good afternoon, everyone. thanks for joining us today. i will provide an overview of the second quarter and on our progress executing our growth strategy. then vijay and chris will give more details on our performance.
let me first say how proud i am of our continued growth, which is a true testament to the team's resilience and their commitment to making everyday life significantly better for people affected by neurological diseases. while we are encouraged by this growth, we are keenly aware that the broader environment remains challenging for the healthcare community as the pandemic continues. i'm very pleased how our team is adapting to this fluid situation, and i believe our strong demand and revenue growth in 2020 along with our performance in the first half of this year demonstrate our ability to thrive in a constantly changing market.
regarding the second quarter, i'm pleased with the revenue growth from gocovri and osmolex er, as well as the royalties earned from namzaric. this growth along with our disciplined investment brought our quarterly net operating cash burn down to single digits and $9.2 million. we remain focused on gocovri, and are expanding the number of prescribing physicians and increasing the number of patients on therapy.
we are also seeing positive trends in the launch of our second indication for off episodes. most notably, i am encouraged by the significant increase in new paid prescriptions or nrx in the second quarter, the highest level since we began reporting this metric, and a key leading indicator of future growth. this is our first full quarter of the off launch. and while early, the increase in new patients coupled with strong 12-month patient persistence gives us confidence that the expanded label has the potential to meaningfully grow the market opportunity for gocovri.
the focus of our messaging to people with parkinson's and their healthcare providers revolves around the goal of treatment, which is to have as much good on-time as possible. gocovri has demonstrated the ability to meaningfully increase good on-time in the pivotal studies, and is the first and only medication approved to treat dyskinesia in parkinson's patients receiving levodopa-based therapy, and off episodes as adjunctive treatment to levodopa/carbidopa. additionally, it's night time dosing provides continuous coverage throughout the day, while minimizing sleep disturbances. the unique ability of gocovri to decrease both ends of the motor complications spectrum allows physicians treating patients along the continuum of care, instead of trading increased off time for reduced dyskinesia or vice versa.
to achieve this paradigm shift in treatment, we are keenly focused on delivering comprehensive stakeholder education across the parkinson's community, regarding gocovri's differentiated profile and novel attributes. as part of this effort, recent publications in peer-reviewed journals include, new data analyses suggesting that gocovri may meaningfully reduce the impact of motor symptoms on activities of daily living, and the review article by leading neurologists supporting gocovri as a clinically significant advance in treating motor complications.
to support the growth of gocovri, we further bolstered our supply chain with the supplemental nda approval of a second and alternative packager. we also announced two new patents for gocovri that covered the drug product and methods of use. these patents are the first issued in this patent family, and strengthen our long-term patent portfolio, now going out to 2038. additionally, we recently received our first international patent covering ads-4101, our investigational drug candidate in epilepsy. this patent issued in japan, follows two recently issued u.s. patents, and we believe will assist us as we continue our efforts to partner or out-license this program.
in summary, we entered 2021 with a clear operational plan to drive growth. first, by advancing our neurology portfolio. second, by strengthening the foundation of our business, and third, by leveraging our fully integrated infrastructure. we have made substantial progress against all three of these objectives. and the first six months of the year, reflects our solid execution.
i'll now turn the call over to vijay to review our commercial progress.
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
thank you, neil, and good afternoon, everyone. i will begin my comments with highlights of our gocovri performance in q2 and provide an update on osmolex er.
starting with performance. q2 total gocovri paid prescriptions or trx, excluding product from the free trial program grew to 9,400, a 19% year-over-year increase versus q2 of 2020, with a 8% sequential growth versus the prior quarter. we saw 97% growth in new paid prescriptions or nrx versus q2 last year and a 24% increase versus the previous quarter, with a total of 730 nrx. 12-month patient persistence remained strong at 45% to 50%.
we are pleased with this performance for three key reasons. these are, the strong quarter-over-quarter and nrx demand growth, the year-over-year trends suggesting patients returning to clinics, and the early positive signs from the launch of our off indication. let me give more detail around each of these.
the robust quarter-over-quarter growth in numbers of new patients coming after the strong nrx results we reported in q1, highlights the demand momentum for gocovri. in the quarter, we saw an increase in our breadth of prescribers, as well as an increase in depth of prescriptions per physician. we believe these results reflect the consistent execution of our commercial strategy: to raise urgency to treat; to differentiate gocovri; and to enhance the customer experience.
upon approval of the off indication, we revised our speaker program content to further differentiate the gocovri clinical story. and in q2, we executed a mix of live and virtual speaker programs with this updated content, continuing to broaden our outreach to prescribers and patients. to further enhance our patient education, during parkinson's awareness month, we launched a direct-to-patient segment on lifetime access tv. this featured a gocovri patient, their care partner and a healthcare professional discussing the impact of orphan dyskinesia on daily life, and the benefits they have seen with gocovri treatment. the segment with the potential reach of 83 million viewers contributed to a 20% increase in patient engagement and a 200% increase in physician engagement in our digital content. it has since been distributed through our multimedia platform.
our sales force maintained live interactions with prescribers wherever possible, educating them on the differentiated clinical profile for gocovri. and we continue to explore new ways to allow our field team to be even more effective. as an example, we are piloting a program to rapidly determine the access to healthcare centers and to facilitate appointments to increase the proportion of live calls to prescribers. we further optimized our gocovri onboard services, resulting in a higher level of customer satisfaction. and expanded our gocovri care coordinator team to meet the demand increase that we have seen.
the strong year-over-year growth in demand was aided by the gradual return of patients to in-person appointments at clinics. we also saw some increase in sales rep access to offices, highlighting a slow return to normalcy. however, we remain in a fluid situation, as has become clear in recent weeks. the sustained impact that the pandemic is having on treatment of parkinson's patients was reflected in a 17% year-over-year decline in patient claims data for levodopa/carbidopa, in the latest three months, february through april versus the same period a year ago. this suggests the number of parkinson's patients receiving care has still not returned to pre-pandemic levels. and our strong q2 performance is remarkable given this headwind.
finally, we are pleased that our launch of the off indication continues to show positive signs in the first full quarter since approval. we have seen an increase in demand with prescriptions for gocovri and are particularly encouraged that we see patients with off dyskinesia or both, all being prescribed the drug. this indicates that our differentiated clinical profile is resonating. gocovri is the first and only product indicated both for the treatment of off episodes and dyskinesia, thereby increasing good on time. this unique differentiation helps prescribers avoid compromises when managing the two extremes of motor complications in their parkinson's patients. we have seen several physicians who prescribe gocovri early in the dyskinesia launch, but then last return to the product with the new off indication. additionally, we're pleased with the 93% payer approval rate through the prior authorization process, which indicates patients are getting access to gocovri regardless of formulary status.
our conversations with payers continue with a focus on ensuring easy and affordable access to gocovri, through the selective articulation of the clinical and health economic value of the product. the large addressable patient population and the increased momentum we have seen from the off launch give us confidence in the growth prospects for gocovri, while we continue to pursue broad access in a fiscally prudent manner. the momentum in q2 gives us optimism that communicating the differentiated clinical profile of gocovri systematically throughout the neurology community, will trigger a paradigm shift in the treatment of parkinson's motor complications, from symptomatic treatment of off or dyskinesia to comprehensively addressing both ends of the motor complications spectrum.
while growing gocovri is our primary focus, we also execute it against our two goals for osmolex er. first, to ensure current patients on drug receive uninterrupted care, and second, to advance the gated investment plan to launch osmolex er into the psychiatry market for patients with the labeled indication in drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions. towards the first goal, we provided ongoing support to current prescribers and realized operational efficiencies. as for the second goal, we are actively promoting the product into the epr market using our tele detail team.
q2 results were in line with q1 and influenced by two factors: pre-acquisition inventory build normalizing in q2; and the conversion of those on patient assistance programs into paid prescriptions. q2 continue to present a challenging situation in the marketplace, and we are incredibly proud of our team for remaining focused on our mission to serve patients.
i will now turn it over to chris to provide an overview of our financial performance.
christopher b. prentiss -- chief financial officer
thanks, vijay, and good afternoon, everyone. please refer to our press release issued earlier today for a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of 2021.
total revenues for the second quarter 2021 were $22 million, which includes gocovri product sales of $20.1 million, osmolex er product sales of $500,000 and royalty revenue earned from namzaric of approximately $1.4 million. product sales of gocovri in the second quarter, increased 12% over the same quarter last year, primarily driven by volume growth and partially offset by higher gross-to-net discounts.
gross-to-net for the quarter was in line with the guidance range we previously provided. we expect gross-to-net adjustments for the second half of the year to decline to the low-to-mid teens, driven primarily by patients moving through the medicare part d coverage gap.
r&d expenses for the second quarter 2021 were $1.4 million, compared to $2.6 million for the prior year quarter, primarily due to the completion of the ads-5102 multiple sclerosis open label extension trial. we would like to thank everyone who worked on this well executed development program, and especially those who participated in our trials. we plan to publish our clinical trial data, which we hope will benefit the ms community.
second quarter 2021 sg&a expenses were $29.2 million, compared to $23.2 million in the prior year quarter. sg&a expenses for the current quarter represent the execution of our gocovri commercialization strategy, as well as our education efforts positioning osmolex er for drug induced epr.
we are maintaining our 2021 operating expense guidance of $115 million to $130 million, including $9 million of stock-based compensation. r&d expenses are expected to be between $5 million to $10 million, based on the closeout of our msw open-label trial. we expect sg&a expenses to be within a range of $110 million to $120 million. maintaining this guidance reflects our investment to accelerate the growth of gocovri.
cash and investments as of june 30, 2021 were approximately $118.3 million, with net operating cash burn for the quarter of $9.2 million. achieving this level of net operating cash burn is a key metric, reflecting the momentum of our revenue growth coupled with our disciplined investment. this is an important marker of our progress as we execute on our long-term strategic plan.
this concludes our prepared remarks. with that, i will now open the line for questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of jason butler with jmp securities. please proceed with your question.
jason butler -- jmp securities, llc -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress. i guess just a couple on gocovri. can you speak to the recent dynamics on patients returning to the clinics and what you've seen post the end of the quarter into july and august? and is that having any impact on the nrx? and then i guess, just, sorry, if i missed this, but given the success of the off launch, can you give us a breakdown of what proportion of the nrx for the quarter are coming from off versus dyskinesia or both? and i know it might be hard to break down, but just give us a sense of what proportion of the growth is being driven by the authentication? thanks.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
hi, jason. thanks for the question. this is neil, and i'll hand it off to vijay in a moment. but let me start by saying how proud i am of the strong demand momentum. we leave q2 with 97% year-over-year growth in our nrx number to 730. but i think as importantly, 24% quarter-over-quarter growth from q1 to q2. let me ask vijay to touch on the recent dynamics in terms of the patients and some of the off launch being on track. vijay?
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
yeah, thanks, jason. i would say that the situation remains fluid and dynamic and complex. we have seen some return of patients to clinics, as evidenced by our year-over-year trends. but based on the 17% decline that we see in the claims data for carbidopa/levodopa, it is obvious that all patients are still not back in doctor's offices. and we're still in a relatively challenging situation, which is why our performance in q2 is really so strong and remarkable. so we do need to see those carbidopa/levodopa scripts come back to growth. in the meantime, we're leaning in on tactics to get as fast -- fast of growth as possible.
to your second question, in the off launch, we're pleased to see that we have mix of patients with off dyskinesia or both. the fact is that we see the majority of those scripts coming in dyskinesia, which is not surprising given that we're in the first full quarter of launch of the off episodes. but the fact that we're getting the mix across the spectrum shows us we're making progress toward changing the paradigm of care.
jason butler -- jmp securities, llc -- analyst
okay, that's great. and then, neil, just a quick one on 4101. can you give us a sense of what potential partners have been looking for and specifically to what degree the new ip here could be a catalyst in your discussions? thanks.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
sure. so i think it's important to note that there's such an incredibly unmet need here, right in the epilepsy market. and not a lot of -- there are quite a few products that are out there being developed, but not a lot of products out there that are in late stage. so we have a phase 3 ready asset. we've started to get the intellectual property issues, and that's really been what we have been working with potential partners on the path forward and the ability to be able to get this product to patients that have an unmet need.
jason butler -- jmp securities, llc -- analyst

hey, guys, this is lachlan on for tim. thanks for taking the questions. i guess, two if i can. first of all, on the addition of the alternative packages for gocovri, what was the rationale behind that? is that addressing vulnerabilities you've seen? or are you expecting to need the additional capacity for future growth within your indication or something else there? and second, in terms of the osmolex er pilot launch, can you just outline sort of what you'll be looking at to determine if you want to continue the program? i mean, is that going to be based on sales or script volume or more qualitative feedback from the market?
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
thank you, lachlan. and to answer your first question, let me start there in terms of our ability to get a second and alternative packager. having single source manufacturing is not something that as we lean into the growth trajectory that gocovri is showing with the strong demand that we've shown in the last number of quarters, that we want to have a single source. so as part of our long-term growth strategy, we implemented, a year or two ago that we needed to be able to have duplicative manufacturing capacity. and this was one of the reasons why we did that. so vijay, you want to talk a little bit about the osmolex next steps in our gated investment plan?
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
sure, neil. thanks for the question. lachlan. i would say that for osmolex, it is important to remember, we are primarily focused on gocovri here and fully living up to the potential that gocovri has to change the paradigm of care in parkinson's disease. with osmolex, we have a very disciplined gated investment plan in psychiatry. and we -- the volume of what the product is has been in the past, has been relatively minimal. and we are encouraged by the market research that tells us that there's opportunity for an extended release product in that space. and so we are in the early stages of launch, and we'll keep you updated.
lachlan hanbury-brown -- william blair & company, l.l.c. -- analyst
awesome, thanks.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of ken cacciatore with cowen. please proceed with your question.
ken cacciatore -- cowen and company -- analyst
hey, neil and team. congratulations on all the progress. neil, as i listened to you, and your enthusiasm always really comes through, i think about it and listen to your commentary on dtc, and as i step back, you think about gocovri, where it is, it's a broadly covered drug, so we're not having any managed care issues. it's been on the market a sufficient amount of time that it's lead indication, and now we have off, it's a known molecule to the clinician. so i'm just wondering, why aren't we pushing the advantage even more aggressively through dtc? it would be my belief that, not only would you be activating patients, but even activating clinicians in a general sense to make them even more aware about the product that is there and kind of activate them, in addition to pushing the patients in, understanding the commentary about the market dynamics now. so i'm just trying to understand why we don't get even more aggressive, and wanted to hear a little bit more about the metrics that you're getting from your kind of initial dtc? thanks a lot.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
thanks, thanks, ken. my enthusiasm comes from the fact that gocovri has such a large opportunity and the team here has continued to drive strong demand and executing in this fluid environment. so they're the reason why i'm so motivated. and maybe i'll ask vijay to talk a little bit about some of the efforts in are multi-channel marketing that we're doing.
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
hey, ken, totally appreciate the question in terms of dtc. this is something that we've looked at carefully, and we're choosing to do it in a very efficient manner. and we're going after pockets of patients that we know, exist in certain social media platforms. and we've done our research in terms of how to most effectively reach those patient groups. and our lifetime access tv segment was one example of how we're unlocking that opportunity in a very efficient manner by going with a media platform, which we know will reach the right audience at the right time. and then we're taking and repurposing those assets through our multimedia channels in order to get the content out there as efficiently as possible. and we're tracking metrics such as engagement in our websites, in our digital assets, downloads of materials that we have out there, how many patients are watching the videos, and so on and so forth. there is a variety of metrics that we're tracking, all of which are positive. so, we're very excited that it's working so far. and we plan to continue to keep these efforts up.
ken cacciatore -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of marc goodman with svb leerink. please proceed with your questions.
marc goodman -- svb leerink -- analyst
yeah. hi. a couple of questions. first, on your payer discussions, as we move into next year, can you give us a sense of whether everything is going to be stable or whether we're going to have some improvements? are we losing some contracting? just curious how that's working out? second is, given how successful everything is going, i'm just curious, neil, if we've moved forward on business development a little bit, if there's anything else going on kind of behind the scenes? and third, just remind us, how much are we spending on osmolex, just from an advertising and promotion support? is there really anything being spent right now? and what's your plans going forward? thanks.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
thanks for the questions, mark. why don't i start with your middle question in regards to business development, then i'll ask vijay and then chris to answer some of the more detailed questions. i think it is an important -- important to note that, our focus is on the growth of gocovri. we have a large opportunity that our off indication, it just doubled our addressable market to 400,000 to 500,000 patients. the demand that we've seen is great. but there's a long way for us to go. so i think that it's important that we continue to focus on gocovri. we also focus on the integration of osmolex in the drug induced epr. that being said, we have a very efficient late-stage development team that's just finalized a very strong msw program and finalized the long-term safety study there. and we have a commercial organization that is also really clicking in regards to the execution that they're able to do in this very fluid and dynamic environment we're in. so we're actively evaluating both internal and external opportunities, and finding ways to leverage our infrastructure, because delivering value is our top priority. vijay, you want to hit on some of the payer discussions?
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
sure. mark, as you know, we are committed to broad access and affordability for gocovri. and we are actively engaging in conversations with payers, focused on the clinical and health economic value of the product. because we honestly believe that with its differentiated profile, gocovri has that opportunity to bring about a paradigm shift. and we're getting good engagement in terms of these conversations that we've had with payers. in that context, it is even more important to remember that, as a specialty medication, we do see a high rate of payer approval through our prior authorization process, the off launch is being paid for as well with those scripts. and we're seeing a 93% approval rate and 75% of patients, medicare or commercial combined, have an under $25 out of pocket costs. so, the signs are good, but we're still working on it. and stay tuned.
christopher b. prentiss -- chief financial officer
from an osmolex perspective, from a macro sense, our sg&a expense guidance for 2021 is really in line with what we spent in the prior year in 2020. so specifically, we have a very small, targeted tele detail sales team that's focused on osmolex. and we'll continue to evaluate as the year goes on and determine if we need to make further investments at that point in time.
marc goodman -- svb leerink -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from the line of david amsellem with piper sandler. please proceed with your question. mr. amsellem, can you check to see if your line is on mute, please? thank you. our next question comes from the line of ram selvaraju with h.c. wainwright. please proceed with your question.
mason -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
hi, this is mason [phonetic] for ram. thanks for taking our questions, and congrats on the quarter. so just regarding your published paper in june of this year, which revealed, gocovri may be impacting gait freezing. is this something that you've propagated in your marketing and education efforts? and if not, do you plan on doing so?
christopher b. prentiss -- chief financial officer
thanks, maz [phonetic]. we're glad that you asked us a question that we can hand off to adrian, but he might need some additional clarity in regards to which papers, because we've had a number of papers published in the last couple of months.
mason -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
so this was the second one, which showed that gocovri may be impacting gait freezing on the mds-updrs part ii, so this was the post-hoc analysis.
christopher b. prentiss -- chief financial officer
great. adrian?
adrian quartel -- chief medical officer
yeah, thanks for the question. so this is the house of paper we published in june this year, but it -- we performed a sub-analysis on the mds-updrs part ii, which really focuses on the motor complications that patients have, or that the parkinsonism issues that patients have, who have parkinson's disease and the effects of gocovri on that. as part of that, scale that has been used, gait freezing is indeed one of the 13 questions that the patients can answer, and we saw a statistically significant improvement in gait freezing in those patients and overall, of the 13 sub issues addressed by this mds-updrs score, 12 were improved in top of those subscales, patients have probably improved compared to placebo. i'll hand it over.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think your next question was with, are we able to promote that? and we promote based on our label, and that's not currently in our label.
mason -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
okay, fantastic. makes sense. and then just finally, this may be a naive question, but is there any scope to draw on historical osmolex er trial data to perform, a similar kind of post-hoc analysis, as you've done with gocovri? and would this be of any value?
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
great question, maz [phonetic]. so i think we mentioned that our q1 call, as we finalize the acquisition of the product, that it is our intent to get the data from the phase 3 trials out. adrian is working diligently with his team and the investigators to do just that. so i think there is opportunity for us to learn from the data. and there's opportunity for us to make sure that we lean in to ensuring the continued differentiation of the two products between gocovri and osmolex. stay tuned.
mason -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
all right. excellent. congrats on the quarter.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
thank you very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of david amsellem with piper sandler. please proceed with your question.
david amsellem -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey, thanks for fitting me in, and sorry about that. so just real quick, on the off time indication, and i apologize if i missed this. but, over time, it seems like you're accessing, i mean, it doesn't seem, but that i think it -- you've confirmed us that that you're accessing a wider parkinson's population. so, i guess with that in mind, should we think about any expansion of the commercial infrastructure over the long-term? and i know you addressed business development, but maybe as a sort of corollary to that topic, what's your appetite for taking on any r&d risk to the extent that you are to buy an asset? thanks.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
thanks, david. let me let me ask vijay to touch on the first question in regards to the off indication. and we definitely are accessing a wider market opportunity, right. we went from 200,000 patients with dyskinesia and off to an additional 200,000 to 300,000 patients with off, which gives us 400,000 to 500,000 patients now. so i think that -- we are definitely seeing this large opportunity in wider patient population to try and to provide the opportunity for gocovri. vijay, can you talk a little more about off, and i'll get into the -- question.
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
sure, neil. thanks for the question, david. i would say it's important to keep in mind that while the population of patients has expanded, it is a very highly concentrated marketplace with these patients being treated by the same physicians we were targeting with the dyskinesia launch. so we believe that we are right-sized with our sales force, and we are intensifying our efforts to provide coverage through a multimedia digital campaign. and we believe that, that is sufficient to get to the opportunity efficiently.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
so david, in regards to the bd question and the appetite for r&d risk, i think it's really important, to delivering value is our top priority. and our largest opportunity to deliver value today is being able to continue to execute on our off launch, and drive the foundation for what we can do in the future. there's also the element that i spoke about briefly in the prior question, around the ability to leverage our infrastructure. we've proven that we can do late-stage neurology development in the ms, multiple sclerosis phase. we've proven that we can get additional lifecycle completed with our snda for the off episodes indication. and we're now proving that we can commercialize drugs in a very complex environment and drive strong demand momentum. i think as part of that, we need to also figure out in the long-term, based on our current strength of our foundation, how we leverage our infrastructure and build value over time. so today, our value driver is gocovri, and launching it into this wider and larger opportunity. in the future, we need to find a way to leverage our expertise in the infrastructure that we have.
david amsellem -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thanks, neil.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer

i will now, turn the call over to neil mcfarlane.
neil f. mcfarlane -- chief executive officer
thank you, peter. good afternoon, everyone. thanks for joining us today. i will provide an overview of the second quarter and on our progress executing our growth strategy. then vijay and chris will give more details on our performance.
let me first say how proud i am of our continued growth, which is a true testament to the team's resilience and their commitment to making everyday life significantly better for people affected by neurological diseases. while we are encouraged by this growth, we are keenly aware that the broader environment remains challenging for the healthcare community as the pandemic continues. i'm very pleased how our team is adapting to this fluid situation, and i believe our strong demand and revenue growth in 2020 along with our performance in the first half of this year demonstrate our ability to thrive in a constantly changing market.
regarding the second quarter, i'm pleased with the revenue growth from gocovri and osmolex er, as well as the royalties earned from namzaric. this growth along with our disciplined investment brought our quarterly net operating cash burn down to single digits and $9.2 million. we remain focused on gocovri, and are expanding the number of prescribing physicians and increasing the number of patients on therapy.
we are also seeing positive trends in the launch of our second indication for off episodes. most notably, i am encouraged by the significant increase in new paid prescriptions or nrx in the second quarter, the highest level since we began reporting this metric, and a key leading indicator of future growth. this is our first full quarter of the off launch. and while early, the increase in new patients coupled with strong 12-month patient persistence gives us confidence that the expanded label has the potential to meaningfully grow the market opportunity for gocovri.
the focus of our messaging to people with parkinson's and their healthcare providers revolves around the goal of treatment, which is to have as much good on-time as possible. gocovri has demonstrated the ability to meaningfully increase good on-time in the pivotal studies, and is the first and only medication approved to treat dyskinesia in parkinson's patients receiving levodopa-based therapy, and off episodes as adjunctive treatment to levodopa/carbidopa. additionally, it's night time dosing provides continuous coverage throughout the day, while minimizing sleep disturbances. the unique ability of gocovri to decrease both ends of the motor complications spectrum allows physicians treating patients along the continuum of care, instead of trading increased off time for reduced dyskinesia or vice versa.
to achieve this paradigm shift in treatment, we are keenly focused on delivering comprehensive stakeholder education across the parkinson's community, regarding gocovri's differentiated profile and novel attributes. as part of this effort, recent publications in peer-reviewed journals include, new data analyses suggesting that gocovri may meaningfully reduce the impact of motor symptoms on activities of daily living, and the review article by leading neurologists supporting gocovri as a clinically significant advance in treating motor complications.
to support the growth of gocovri, we further bolstered our supply chain with the supplemental nda approval of a second and alternative packager. we also announced two new patents for gocovri that covered the drug product and methods of use. these patents are the first issued in this patent family, and strengthen our long-term patent portfolio, now going out to 2038. additionally, we recently received our first international patent covering ads-4101, our investigational drug candidate in epilepsy. this patent issued in japan, follows two recently issued u.s. patents, and we believe will assist us as we continue our efforts to partner or out-license this program.
in summary, we entered 2021 with a clear operational plan to drive growth. first, by advancing our neurology portfolio. second, by strengthening the foundation of our business, and third, by leveraging our fully integrated infrastructure. we have made substantial progress against all three of these objectives. and the first six months of the year, reflects our solid execution.
i'll now turn the call over to vijay to review our commercial progress.
vijay shreedhar -- chief commercial officer
thank you, neil, and good afternoon, everyone. i will begin my comments with highlights of our gocovri performance in q2 and provide an update on osmolex er.
starting with performance. q2 total gocovri paid prescriptions or trx, excluding product from the free trial program grew to 9,400, a 19% year-over-year increase versus q2 of 2020, with a 8% sequential growth versus the prior quarter. we saw 97% growth in new paid prescriptions or nrx versus q2 last year and a 24% increase versus the previous quarter, with a total of 730 nrx. 12-month patient persistence remained strong at 45% to 50%.
we are pleased with this performance for three key reasons. these are, the strong quarter-over-quarter and nrx demand growth, the year-over-year trends suggesting patients returning to clinics, and the early positive signs from the launch of our off indication. let me give more detail around each of these.
the robust quarter-over-quarter growth in numbers of new patients coming after the strong nrx results we reported in q1, highlights the demand momentum for gocovri. in the quarter, we saw an increase in our breadth of prescribers, as well as an increase in depth of prescriptions per physician. we believe these results reflect the consistent execution of our commercial strategy: to raise urgency to treat; to differentiate gocovri; and to enhance the customer experience.
upon approval of the off indication, we revised our speaker program content to further differentiate the gocovri clinical story. and in q2, we executed a mix of live and virtual speaker programs with this updated content, continuing to broaden our outreach to prescribers and patients. to further enhance our patient education, during parkinson's awareness month, we launched a direct-to-patient segment on lifetime access tv. this featured a gocovri patient, their care partner and a healthcare professional discussing the impact of orphan dyskinesia on daily life, and the benefits they have seen with gocovri treatment. the segment with the potential reach of 83 million viewers contributed to a 20% increase in patient engagement and a 200% increase in physician engagement in our digital content. it has since been distributed through our multimedia platform.
our sales force maintained live interactions with prescribers wherever possible, educating them on the differentiated clinical profile for gocovri. and we continue to explore new ways to allow our field team to be even more effective. as an example, we are piloting a program to rapidly determine the access to healthcare centers and to facilitate appointments to increase the proportion of live calls to prescribers. we further optimized our gocovri onboard services, resulting in a higher level of customer satisfaction. and expanded our gocovri care coordinator team to meet the demand increase that we have seen.
the strong year-over-year growth in demand was aided by the gradual return of patients to in-person appointments at clinics. we also saw some increase in sales rep access to offices, highlighting a slow return to normalcy. however, we remain in a fluid situation, as has become clear in recent weeks. the sustained impact that the pandemic is having on treatment of parkinson's patients was reflected in a 17% year-over-year decline in patient claims data for levodopa/carbidopa, in the latest three months, february through april versus the same period a year ago. this suggests the number of parkinson's patients receiving care has still not returned to pre-pandemic levels. and our strong q2 performance is remarkable given this headwind.
finally, we are pleased that our launch of the off indication continues to show positive signs in the first full quarter since approval. we have seen an increase in demand with prescriptions for gocovri and are particularly encouraged that we see patients with off dyskinesia or both, all being prescribed the drug. this indicates that our differentiated clinical profile is resonating. gocovri is the first and only product indicated both for the treatment of off episodes and dyskinesia, thereby increasing good on time. this unique differentiation helps prescribers avoid compromises when managing the two extremes of motor complications in their parkinson's patients. we have seen several physicians who prescribe gocovri early in the dyskinesia launch, but then last return to the product with the new off indication. additionally, we're pleased with the 93% payer approval rate through the prior authorization process, which indicates patients are getting access to gocovri regardless of formulary status.
our conversations with payers continue with a focus on ensuring easy and affordable access to gocovri, through the selective articulation of the clinical and health economic value of the product. the large addressable patient population and the increased momentum we have seen from the off launch give us confidence in the growth prospects for gocovri, while we continue to pursue broad access in a fiscally prudent manner. the momentum in q2 gives us optimism that communicating the differentiated clinical profile of gocovri systematically throughout the neurology community, will trigger a paradigm shift in the treatment of parkinson's motor complications, from symptomatic treatment of off or dyskinesia to comprehensively addressing both ends of the motor complications spectrum.
while growing gocovri is our primary focus, we also execute it against our two goals for osmolex er. first, to ensure current patients on drug receive uninterrupted care, and second, to advance the gated investment plan to launch osmolex er into the psychiatry market for patients with the labeled indication in drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions. towards the first goal, we provided ongoing support to current prescribers and realized operational efficiencies. as for the second goal, we are actively promoting the product into the epr market using our tele detail team.
q2 results were in line with q1 and influenced by two factors: pre-acquisition inventory build normalizing in q2; and the conversion of those on patient assistance programs into paid prescriptions. q2 continue to present a challenging situation in the marketplace, and we are incredibly proud of our team for remaining focused on our mission to serve patients.
i will now turn it over to chris to provide an overview of our financial performance.
christopher b. prentiss -- chief financial officer
thanks, vijay, and good afternoon, everyone. please refer to our press release issued earlier today for a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of 2021.
total revenues for the second quarter 2021 were $22 million, which includes gocovri product sales of $20.1 million, osmolex er product sales of $500,000 and royalty revenue earned from namzaric of approximately $1.4 million. product sales of gocovri in the second quarter, increased 12% over the same quarter last year, primarily driven by volume growth and partially offset by higher gross-to-net discounts.
gross-to-net for the quarter was in line with the guidance range we previously provided. we expect gross-to-net adjustments for the second half of the year to decline to the low-to-mid teens, driven primarily by patients moving through the medicare part d coverage gap.
r&d expenses for the second quarter 2021 were $1.4 million, compared to $2.6 million for the prior year quarter, primarily due to the completion of the ads-5102 multiple sclerosis open label extension trial. we would like to thank everyone who worked on this well executed development program, and especially those who participated in our trials. we plan to publish our clinical trial data, which we hope will benefit the ms community.
second quarter 2021 sg&a expenses were $29.2 million, compared to $23.2 million in the prior year quarter. sg&a expenses for the current quarter represent the execution of our gocovri commercialization strategy, as well as our education efforts positioning osmolex er for drug induced epr.
we are maintaining our 2021 operating expense guidance of $115 million to $130 million, including $9 million of stock-based compensation. r&d expenses are expected to be between $5 million to $10 million, based on the closeout of our msw open-label trial. we expect sg&a expenses to be within a range of $110 million to $120 million. maintaining this guidance reflects our investment to accelerate the growth of gocovri.
cash and investments as of june 30, 2021 were approximately $118.3 million, with net operating cash burn for the quarter of $9.2 million. achieving this level of net operating cash burn is a key metric, reflecting the momentum of our revenue growth coupled with our disciplined investment. this is an important marker of our progress as we execute on our long-term strategic plan.
this concludes our prepared remarks. with that, i will now open the line for questions. operator?
