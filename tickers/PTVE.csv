good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the pactiv evergreen, inc. fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to pactiv evergreen.
unknown speaker
thank you, operator. before we begin, please visit the events section of the company's investor relations website at www.pactivevergreen.com, and access the company's supplemental earnings presentation. management's remarks today should be heard in tandem with reviewing this presentation. before we begin our formal remarks, i need to remind everyone that our discussions today will include forward-looking statements.
these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. these statements are also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. we refer all of you to our recent sec filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our future operating results and financial condition. lastly, during today's call, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating our performance.
the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap. and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures are available in our earnings release. on the call today, we have john mcgrath, chief executive officer; and michael ragen, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. with that, let me turn the call over to john mcgrath.
john? 
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
good morning and welcome to the q4 2020 pactiv evergreen earnings call. this is john mcgrath, ceo of pactiv evergreen. today, both myself and mike ragen, our cfo and coo, will present. before we begin, i'd like to make a few comments.
i continue to be very proud of the 14,600 pactiv evergreen employees that have kept this company functioning throughout the covid-19 pandemic. despite significant challenges, we have managed to keep our plants and warehouses operational while ensuring the safety of our employees. we are seeing a reduction in the number of daily positive cases companywide as well as the number of employees out with covid-related illnesses. we are working with states and local municipalities to ensure that when vaccines are available, we offer them to our workforce.
we are optimistic that over the next several months, our operations will continue to stabilize. please turn to slide 3. during this presentation, we will discuss key takeaways and q4 and full-year 2020 highlights, a business update, our q4 and full-year 2020 financial performance for continuing operations and our 2021 outlook. we will conclude with ",".
please now turn to slide 5. as an overarching theme for today, as the country reopens and mobility increases, pactiv evergreen is best positioned to benefit. there are six key takeaways from today's presentation. we successfully completed our ipo and debt refinancing transactions.
our 2020 adjusted ebitda of $615 million was at expectations despite the ongoing pandemic. our strategic investment program is on track from both a spend and a benefit perspective. covid continued to affect our business resulting in a $178 million impact in 2020. this was partially offset by our strategic investment program, procurement and sg&a savings and other items totaling $102 million, resulting in a $76 million shortfall to 2019.
we have initiated a comprehensive beverage merchandising review as well as our next-generation pactiv evergreen waste elimination program. our net pension obligation on pepp, our largest pension plan, reduced from $654 million in 2019 to $439 million, a $215 million reduction. and finally, from an outlook perspective, we are expecting 2021 full-year adjusted ebitda to be between $700 million and $715 million as covid-19 continues to impact the business. additionally, we expect q1 adjusted ebitda to be between $110 million and $120 million, driven mainly by covid-19 and mill outage timing.
these results exclude any onetime impacts caused by the recent deep freeze in the southwest and southeast. please now turn to slide 6. now let's move to q4 2020 highlights. net revenue of $1.175 billion was down 10% from q4 2019 due to the ongoing impacts of covid-19 as well as lower pricing due to contractual raw material pass-throughs.
net income from continuing operations was $18 million, and earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.10. adjusted ebitda of $170 million for the quarter was down slightly from q4 of 2019 due to both commercial and operational covid-19 impacts. these results were offset by favorable raw material and employee costs. free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda less capex, declined to $82 million in q4, driven by higher capex versus prior year.
and finally, our strategic investment program is on track and delivered $20 million of benefits in q4. please turn to slide 7. now let's look at full-year 2020 results. net revenue of $4.689 billion was down 10% versus full-year 2019 due to the impacts of covid-19 and lower pricing from raw material pass-throughs.
adjusted ebitda of $615 million was off of 2019 due to covid volume impacts, lower production volumes, plant-related corporate costs and mill outages. these events were offset by favorable raw material pricing and lower employee costs. free cash flow of $333 million, as defined by adjusted ebitda less capex, was down versus prior year due to lower 2020 adjusted ebitda. and our strategic investment program is on track and delivered $65 million of benefit in 2020.
since the program's inception, the strategic investment program has delivered $121 million of benefit. please now turn to slide 9. as we have previously discussed, we have many significant ebitda growth drivers that we expect will deliver benefits in 2021 and beyond. as the overall economy begins to rebound and covid subsides, we should realize significant volume upside and decreasing operational costs.
in our foodservice business, volume will improve as people return to pre-covid activities and food and beverage consumption patterns resume, such as stopping to get coffee at starbucks on the morning commute. both our commercial and noncommercial segments will see an uplift with school reopenings driving growth in both foodservice and beverage merchandise. the incremental costs associated with operating during covid should also decline. covid-19 has changed where, when and how people consume food and beverages.
we believe the shift to online ordering, delivery and takeout will continue post-covid, which bodes well for us. we have invested in incremental food container capacity and repurposed underutilized assets to ensure we can meet these demand shifts. as sustainability continues to drive purchase decisions, we are well positioned to benefit. our extensive product portfolio allows customers to choose packaging based on their sustainability goals, costs, appearance and functionality.
we continue to expand our earthchoice line of sustainable products and continue to look for opportunities to address unmet market needs. and finally, we have several defined cost reduction initiatives that will continue to contribute to ebitda growth. in summary, there are many drivers of ebitda growth. please now turn to slide 10.
product and material innovation will continue to be a big focus for pactiv evergreen going forward. we make our products out of 14 different fiber, metal and resin-based materials giving us the ability to sell the customer what they want, not what we have. industry trends will continue to drive innovation as e-commerce, delivery, food safety and sustainability all play key roles in shaping packaging design and functionality. we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends with our extensive in-house product and material development capabilities.
we have included on this slide a case study that highlights our continued efforts to drive sustainable new product introductions. from q1 2020 through the end of q1 2021, we will have introduced 94 new earthchoice products made from six different sustainable substrates. these products align with today's customer preferences for alternate materials. we expect substantial growth from these and other new products introductions.
please now turn to slide 11. we continue to drive toward esg excellence through our entire operation. the areas we are focused on are protecting our planet's resources, delivering sustainable products to our customers, valuing our people and our communities and promoting effective governance. between 2015 and 2019, we decreased our greenhouse gas emissions by 10%.
we also were recognized last year by the american forest and paper association with the 2020 sustainable forest management award. we are currently in the process of launching 94 new sustainable products made from six different sustainable materials, all of which will be in the market by q1 2021. safety continues to be our no. 1 area of focus.
and in 2020, we were three times better than industry benchmarks. and from a governance standpoint, we have a majority independent, diverse board of directors. please now turn to slide 12. we have several significant improvement initiatives in 2021.
our strategic investment program has delivered $121 million and is on track from a cost, benefit and timing standpoint. we have kicked off a comprehensive review of our beverage merchandising business. this review will include our operational improvement program that is focused on returning our plans to the productivity levels previously demonstrated, a thorough product offering review in which we're evaluating the various products we make and sell, and will determine the optimum product portfolio. our previously discussed commercial integration program, in which we have identified numerous opportunities to utilize paper or board for new foodservice and food merchandising products.
these projects are in various stages in their evolution. the next-generation pactiv evergreen waste elimination program will examine numerous facets of our business to determine the optimal organizational structure and operating models. we will also proceed with the next phase of our supply chain optimization program, as well as the complete review of all direct and indirect costs. additionally, we have other operating and cost initiatives around staffing, price management and efficiencies as well as ongoing plant and warehouse initiatives to offset inflation.
we will update on the progress and results of these programs in subsequent calls. i will now turn it over to mike ragen for a detailed financial review.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
thanks, john. moving to slide 14. looking at our fourth-quarter 2020 financial performance. net revenue was $1.175 billion versus $1.303 billion in the same period last year, a decline of 10%.
the decline was due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and lower pricing, mainly due to lower raw material costs passed through to customers. adjusted ebitda was $170 million versus $173 million in the same period last year, a decline of 2%. this was due to lower volume and higher manufacturing costs, offset by favorable raw material and employee costs. one segment was up and two were down year on year, but the overall adjusted ebitda result is testament to the resilience of the business.
free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda less capex, was unfavorable to same period last year due to higher capital spend. our fourth-quarter 2020 results continue our strong recovery from covid-19 lows in q2 2020 with covid-19-related headwinds offset by strong underlying business performance. moving to slide 15 and a deeper dive by segment for q4. our foodservice segment saw net revenues down 13% versus same period last year due to the impact of covid-19 on volumes and lower pricing due to pass-through of lower raw material costs to customers.
adjusted ebitda for the segment was down 4% versus same period last year due to lower sales volume, partially offset by lower raw material costs. and adjusted ebitda margin improved from 14% to 15% this quarter versus same period last year. our food merchandising segment saw net revenues flat to prior year, driven by favorable volume, offset by lower pricing due to raw material price pass-through and mix. adjusted ebitda was up 6% on favorable material costs.
adjusted ebitda margin improved from 18% to 19% this quarter versus same period last year. our beverage merchandising segment saw net revenues down 13% versus same period last year due to the impact of covid-19. adjusted ebitda for the segment was down 33% versus same period last year due to lower revenue and higher production costs, partially offset by lower raw material costs. as mentioned in our last call, we had higher production costs at our canton, north carolina mill due to the fire that occurred in our mill outage.
adjusted ebitda margin declined from 13% to 10% this quarter versus same period last year. moving to slide 16 and our full-year 2020 financial performance. net revenue was $4.689 billion versus $5.191 billion in the same period last year, a decline of 10%. the decline was due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and lower pricing, mainly due to lower raw material costs passed through to customers.
adjusted ebitda was $615 million versus $691 million in the same period last year, a decline of 11%. this was due to lower volume and higher manufacturing costs, offset by favorable raw material and employee costs. free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda less capex, was unfavorable to same period last year due to lower adjusted ebitda. in summary, we had a good year considering the major headwinds from covid-19 and are well positioned to benefit as mobility increases.
moving to slide 17 and a deeper dive by segment for full-year 2020. our foodservice segment saw net revenues down 16% versus prior year due to the impact of covid-19 on volumes and lower pricing due to pass-through of lower raw material costs to customers. adjusted ebitda for the segment was down 28% versus prior year due to lower sales volume and higher manufacturing costs, partially offset by favorable freight costs. it should be noted that $84 million of the $95 million decline in foodservice adjusted ebitda for the year was in the first two quarters of 2020, following the onset of the covid-19 pandemic.
the quick reaction and mitigation actions of our team quickly put us into a stronger position. adjusted ebitda margin declined from 16% to 13% in 2020 versus 2019. our food merchandising segment saw net revenues up 1% to prior year, driven by increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable fx impacts. adjusted ebitda was up 13% on favorable material costs and higher pricing.
and adjusted ebitda margin improved from 16% to 18% in 2020 versus 2019. our beverage merchandising segment saw net revenues down 9% versus prior year due to the impact of covid-19 on volume and price. adjusted ebitda for the segment was down 24% versus prior year due to higher manufacturing costs due to planned mill outages and production inefficiencies and lower pricing and sales volume, partially offset by lower raw material costs. adjusted ebitda margin declined from 12% to 10% in 2020 versus 2019.
moving to slide 18. here, we estimate the impact of covid-19 to our business for both q4 and full-year 2020. our foodservice and beverage merchandising segments have been hit hard by the impact of covid-19 with reductions in sales revenue, operating cost increases and delayed in mill outage timing in our beverage merchandising segment. for full-year 2020, we estimate the impact to pactiv evergreen as a reduction in revenue of $400 million and adjusted ebitda reduction of $178 million.
as we have discussed previously, we reacted quickly to mitigate the impact of the company, introducing cost savings initiatives and driving the ongoing benefits from our strategic investment program. whilst covid-19 impacted our adjusted ebitda by $178 million, our efforts to mitigate the effects of covid-19 generated $102 million of offsets, reducing our year-on-year adjusted ebitda decline to $76 million. we are well set to continue to see benefits from our cost reduction initiatives and to get back the impact of covid-19 as mobility increases. moving to slide 19.
our strategic investment program is a four year $661 million program that commenced in 2018 and focuses on growth capex for capacity expansion and the launch of sustainable products, productivity capex, most notably our automation, integrated supply chain, factory asset intelligence and other cost-saving initiatives and onetime equipment reliability and facilities improvements. we continue to invest in our strategic investment program, having, to date, spent $484 million of the $661 million total program spend, and we will continue to invest through 2021. we expect to see two, two and a half year year annualized benefits from the program, having, to date, realized $121 million of annualized adjusted ebitda benefit to date. to be clear, we look at the annualized adjusted ebitda benefit from a two year payback program as half of the investment, with a substantial benefit to be realized from our strategic investment program.
moving to slide 21. looking at our outlook for 2021, the ultimate impact of the covid-19 pandemic to pactiv evergreen remains uncertain. in our forecast, we have made certain assumptions regarding a second half recovery of foodservice and beverage merchandising revenues that are dependent upon increased mobility and may not eventuate. we have been neither conservative nor aggressive in these assumptions.
for full-year 2021, we expect adjusted ebitda between $700 million and $715 million. our key focus areas will be revenue recovery in foodservice and beverage merchandising, recovery of raw material commodity prices, our strategic investment program and other key initiatives outlined earlier by john and operations improvement. we are assessing the impact of the following at this time, the ongoing effect of covid-19 and the deep freeze in the u.s. south.
any estimates that we are providing today exclude the onetime impact of cost increases due to the deep freeze, which we will clearly articulate in future earnings calls. at this point, the onetime operational cost impacts to the business in february could potentially be $25 million to $30 million or more. finally, while we will not normally provide quarterly guidance, at this point, we feel it is prudent to provide guidance for q1 2021. we expect q1 2021 adjusted ebitda to be between $110 million and $120 million, with the key drivers of variance to last year being the ongoing effect of the covid-19 pandemic and timing of a mill outage.
as mentioned before, this is before any impact from the deep freeze in the u.s. south. thank you for your time. as an appendix to this document, we have included q4 and full-year 2020 revenue and adjusted ebitda bridges versus same period last year, consolidated statements of income loss and a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda and free cash flow.
i'll now pass it back to john for closing comments.
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
thanks, mike. this concludes our presentation. we will now open the line for questions.
 :
operator
[operator instructions] our first question has come from the line of ghansham panjabi with baird. please proceed with your question.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
yes. good morning.
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
good morning ghansham.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
so maybe you can just give us a sense as to how to think about the progression in ebitda on a quarterly basis, apart from what you've guided for 1q. i mean, there's just so much going on with higher costs and volume variability by segment, especially foodservice. how do you see this summing just thinking about the progression? maybe second half versus first half, i think you're betting some sort of improvement from a mobility standpoint. just provide some parameters as it relates to volumes and also the ebitda progression, please.
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
sure. mike, do you want to start and then i'll join in?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah sure. good morning, ghansham. so i'll just -- why don't i address q1 first and then i'll talk a little bit to volumes after that. so for q1, our expectations, and this is all before the impact of the deep freeze.
our expectations are that foodservice and food merchandising segments, they should be a little ahead of prior year in terms of adjusted ebitda. in terms of volumes, they'll both be -- like foodservice versus 2020 will be down by around 7% -- 7% to 8%, and beverage merchandising will be down a couple of percent. sorry, food merchandising down a couple of percent. so the impact in q1 to adjusted ebitda is all around the beverage merchandising segment.
and so while covid is affecting the volumes and revenues for foodservice and food merchandising. in terms of beverage merchandising, the total amount that will be down year on year is all due to beverage merchandising and for four key pieces to that. the first one is price and volume. and we discussed those a lot.
and that's all impacts due to covid-19. the second one is resin. resin has increased substantially, as we all know, and that won't be recovered in the quarter. so that's problematic.
we had -- i did -- in the last call, i also talked about outage timing and that we moved the outage for one of our mills from late last year into q1. so that's the third reason why beverage merchandising will be down in q1. and then the fourth reason is year on year, there's been an operations -- a small decline in operational performance. so they are the four reasons, and that's the reasons behind the decline in performance in beverage merchandising.
so then looking ahead to the rest of the year, and i'll talk a little bit to volumes year on year for the foodservice first. but i'll also compare them versus 2019 to give you a feel for how we compare. so in q2, we'd expect volumes to be up versus 2020 by about 22%. now that's still 7% down versus 2019.
and as you'll recall, in q2 last year, that was when everything fell out in foodservice. so while we're up 22% versus 2020, we'll still be down versus 2019. and then as we go into q3 versus 2020, we're thinking we'll be up about 13%, but still down versus prior year by 2% or 3% and then the same in q4. so while we're thinking we'll be up in terms of our volumes in foodservice versus prior year, we'll be down versus 2019.
in terms of food merchandising, food merchandising, we're looking at -- in q2, we think we'll be about 10% up versus prior year and about 8% to 9% in q3 and q4. as you know, in food merchandising, we weren't affected so much. there were some effects during the year, but it varied by segment, some were up, some were down. and so versus 2019, q2 would be about 5% up, q3 about 7%, and q4 about 18%.
so that's the way those sort of volumes play themselves out. and then for beverage merchandising, we expect sales volumes to increase in q2 through q4. and that will get back to similar levels to 2019. and so because volumes declined in q2 so much, we'll be about 20% up, q3 about 15%, and q4 about 14% versus 2020.
so at a high level, we expect q2 to be better than last year, simply because last year was the lowest point in the covid time line. q3 and q4, we expect a gradual ramp-up as mobility increases.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
ok. that's super helpful. and then as it relates to the beverage merchandising operational review and also the next-gen waste elimination program, can you just give us some high-level views in terms of what specifically you're doing? what do these operational reviews entail, etc.?
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
sure. so thanks for the question, ghansham. so on the beverage merchandising comprehensive review, there's really a couple of pieces to that. the operational improvement program has been ongoing.
we're tracking that for our pmo. that's part of it. the other part is converting some of the other beverage merchandising facilities onto some of the legacy pactiv programs around energy, around just staffing operations, a lot of things like that. so that's the operational improvement program.
the big change here, though, is we're -- we've retained a third-party to look at our entire product portfolio. so we're looking at every product that we make coming off the machines in both of our mills and assessing going forward which products make sense for us to be in and which products might not make sense. after that -- and we're about two or three weeks into that right now. after that assessment is done, that will drive what -- some decisions that we'll make around potentially footprint, capacities, markets that we participate in, organization, things like that.
but this will be pretty much a top to bottom review of the entire business. we felt it prudent to start with the product piece, understanding from a going-forward basis, what should our product portfolio look like, and that will drive a lot of the other initiatives that would be associated with perhaps a different product portfolio. from the next-generation pactiv evergreen waste elimination program, there's really three components here. we -- when we put pactiv and evergreen together, there was another piece of our business -- kind of a corporate piece called reynolds leveraged services.
we have not yet gone through and looked at integrating all three of those together. so from an organization standpoint, that will take place. also, we have phase 2 of our supply chain program. so we've implemented the warehousing and transportation modules of our supply chain optimization program and we are seeing the benefits.
in fact, warehousing, our exit rate in 2020, we were up about 40% in productivity as expressed in throughput cube per man hour worked. so with that behind us now, we're moving to the next phase of supply chain optimization will be around planning and around scheduling, and we do think there's opportunity there. and then finally, we'll complete a thorough direct and indirect spend review. nothing in this next-generation pactiv evergreen program is comprehended in our budget or in our plan, nor is any of the incremental things that we're doing around the beverage merchandising comprehensive program.
that would be in addition to what we've already outlined for our plan. we will again then continue with our strategic investment program where we got $65 million in 2020. we would expect 2021 to be vastly similar to 2020 in that we should realize around that $65 million mark. and then finally, we have ongoing plant and warehouse initiatives to offset inflation and these are just things we do every year.
so four components of what i'll call ebitda improvement programs with pieces of this that are obviously not included in anything we've discussed thus far.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
perfect. thanks so much for all the detail.
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. our next question has come from the line of george staphos with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, everyone. good morning. thanks for all the details. i guess i wanted to dig in a little bit more into the cost question.
so john, michael, the $20 million to $25 million or $25 million to $30 million or more of deep freeze impacts that's not in your guidance, what is actually in that figure? is that logistics around the foodservice and food merchandising business? is that resin pass-through? is that some one-off mill outages? what's in that number, so we know how to disaggregate or aggregate the figures as we're forecasting for 1q? and then i guess the related question, it seems like most of what you're seeing in the reduction is around covid and the pace of reopening. but if i could ask, relative to 3q, relative to the ipo, what has actually changed the most in 1q versus your prior expectations? if you could enumerate that, that would be great.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
ok. so the $25 million to $30 million deep freeze there, george, it's essentially two components, right? the first one is energy rate. and you saw that energy sort of spiked up in different areas, not just in texas but in arkansas, so that was a big piece. and the second piece is we had nine locations that were forced to close for varying pieces of time.
and those locations incurred costs around them. for all sorts of things and -- not only some of the things that you mentioned, but restarting sites and those sorts of things. so generally, it's both of those things. we haven't included resin or anything like that in this.
in terms of what's the change versus the ipo in the first quarter? at the highest level, i think our assumptions around covid recovery on volumes is the first one. that would be -- that's the first piece. the second piece is the operational -- the timing of all of the various mill outages, the two mill outages, they changed and pushed everything back because we couldn't get people into do the mill outages. we obviously had the fire, which increased cost in q3 and q4.
and quite frankly, the operational performance in the beverage merchandising segment -- because of the delays in terms of doing these outages, we've not seen the improvement that we would have expected through the ipo process.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok.
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
yes. so again, george, the big change is around the beverage merchandising, pretty much foodservice and food merchandising, what we would have talked about during the ipo is there or thereabouts of what we said with the exception of, as mike indicated, a volume component on foodservice. and that's mainly around -- we would have thought that in q1, we would have seen a whole lot more of the noncommercial food service operations open, whether it be schools or lodging or travel or business and industry. we're just not seeing that in the first quarter.
so that's a shortfall on foodservice. and to mike's point on the beverage merchandising, he kind of ticked off the reasons there. but -- so to think about q1 up in foodservice, up in food merchandising a bit versus where we thought, corporate costs are a little bit favorable and the negativity comes from beverage merchandising.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's helpful, guys. i want to then swing over to beverage merchandising and it sounds, again, like you're going to be reviewing the business i think, john, you said top to bottom, and reviewing products and mix, what you're going to offer, what you're not going to offer on a going-forward basis. if you -- given what you know right now, and i realize you're going to learn a lot more, are the issues primarily at the mill level? i mean, that would be our assumption having tracked you for the last few quarters. and do you need the mills to offer -- i wouldn't expect that you would necessarily to offer the fiber-based packaging, which is so important to your mix.
how should we think about your view on that currently and how the evolution might be? and then my last question, and i'll turn it over, to sip, not that it's a big deal but i think at one point in time, sip was supposed to generate about $80 million of benefit for 2021. you hit the $65 million number in '20. your run rate has been $20 million a quarter in the last two quarters. why are you off a little bit on sip? is that just beverage merchandising not being where you want it to be and so therefore, the pull forward on the sip isn't where you'd like it to be? thanks you guys and good luck in this quarter/
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
thanks. ok, george, i'll take the first part. the question of whether or not we need to be in the mills in order to service our business. look, we like liquid packaging board.
we think being vertically integrated makes a lot of sense for our business. we like being vertically integrated in cupstock. i think we have a competitive advantage there as it relates to our foodservice business. we do in both of the mills, though, we run other products that that's what we'll be assessing.
i mean i think at the end of the day, liquid packaging board will look to continue to improve, obviously. same with the cupstock but the other paper segments are what is getting a lot of our attention right now. so really too soon to tell how that's going to play out. but if you look at the complexity in both of our mills, we run -- we run liquid packaging board at both of our mills, but then we also run coated groundwood and uncoated freesheet along with that.
so strategically, if there was an opportunity to do something different there, could it be a benefit? our suspicion is yes. again, too soon to tell. but based on where we come out on, what our optimal product portfolio is going forward, that will determine a lot of the other initiatives that we'll be undertaking around, again, things like that we -- things that we have already discussed, capacity footprint, the markets we're in, pricing, things like that. mike, on the sip, the question of run rate versus...
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. so in terms of run rate, i acknowledge what you're saying, george. there has been some challenges around some of the implementations on where we need to be in plants and warehouses and they've been a little slower than we could, obviously, because we can't get people in the right places at the right time with given challenges around travel, etc. we do think you're talking $80 million in 2021, we'll be -- we're expecting to be up sort of on this year in terms of our dollars.
whether or not we'll be quite at $80 million is -- remains to be seen, but we should be $70 million or above.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. yeah, understand. it's a big part of your long-term ebitda progression. that's why we're checking on that.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
agree.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of anthony pettinari with citi. please proceed with your question.
anthony pettinari -- citi -- analyst
good morning. just following up on ghansham's question, is it possible to quantify the impact of price cost in 1q either with the storm or without the storm? and then can you talk a little bit how you'd expect price cost to inflect, how you'd expect to recover cost over the next few quarters? and any kind of specific pricing actions you've taken or just kind of remind us what the lags tend to be.
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
sure. so look, on the raw material run up, i think we've discussed in previous calls that on the legacy pactiv side, foodservice and food merchandising, we're hedged across most of the -- or a lot of the materials that we participate in. so we will not see the raw material impact in q1 in food merchandising and in foodservice. and as we roll into q2, that hedge coverage will give us the ability to raise our price in q2 through our contract resets.
beverage merchandising does not hedge. the main material is polyethylene. it's polyethylene that's used to coat the board. and we would envision in the quarter somewhere between a $9 million to $11 million impact.
however, that will be recovered in subsequent quarters. mike, do you have anything to add to that?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
no. i -- in terms of the -- i don't know whether, anthony, you were also talking about price, but in terms of the pricing peak, we -- what we look at in spread. and so what -- we look at spread, the variance between price and materials. and so foodservice merchandising is favorable, but beverage merchandising, to john's point, is unfavorable, and that's the circa -- including the resin number that john included, circa $20 million.
anthony pettinari -- citi -- analyst
ok. ok. that's very helpful. and then in beverage merchandising, you discussed some of the operational issues and the impact from the winter storm.
i'm just wondering, separate from your own execution, how is demand in that market trending? and then i think that there's an outstanding price increase for sbs in march. there's anything around the winter storm or is it operational issues complicate the implementation of that price increase? can you just talk about general sort of demand trends in that business?
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
yeah. so from a demand standpoint, our beverage carton business sold into supermarkets for plant-based milk alternatives, healthy juices, those kind of things. that continues to remain good, to remain healthy. i mean, we're probably up 1% to 2% down.
we see that continuing. school milk is way off as only 63% of all school districts are open with full-time teaching or in-person teaching. so we -- until that changes, we will continue to be down in school milk. it has kind of a double impact, not just on our carton sales, but we also sell liquid packaging board to two of our competitors that participate heavily in that school milk segment as well.
so we will continue to see softness in our cartons and in liquid packaging board as it relates to schools. on the cupstock side, our softness in cupstock will mirror the softness in paper cups that we're seeing in our foodservice business. and again, that's 100% covid related. and then on the paper segment, it's kind of a mixed bag.
we saw a pretty significant decline in the paper segments in q3, q4. early indications in q1, i was starting to see some of that come back.
anthony pettinari -- citi -- analyst
ok. and then no issues implementing price increase, just given some of the operational issues?
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
no.
anthony pettinari -- citi -- analyst
great. that's helpful. i'll turn it over.
operator
thank you. our next question has come from the line of kyle white with deutsche bank. please proceed with your question.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey. good morning. hope everyone is doing well. is it possible to get a little bit details on your cash flow, some of the items there? what do you expect for capex, working capital, cash taxes or any other material items?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
sure. so in terms of working capital, clearly, what we'll see is, as revenue increases, we'll see a usage of working capital. so if i was modeling it, i would just use the days that you've seen and however you're going to model your revenue. in terms of cash taxes, we expect an inflow this year.
and mostly, that's returns from prior years. so that's the -- i would say, it won't be -- it will be less than $30 million of inflow. debt repayments, we announced a debt repayment that we will focus on mandatory repayment. and interest, we've given guidance to around $160 million of interest payments.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. did you give capex or did i miss that?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
capex, i apologize. similar to what we've been talking about in the past around $305 million.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then shifting gears a little bit here, focusing on your earthchoice brand. the 94 new products offering that you're launching in 1q, can you just provide a little bit more context on this? how does this compare to maybe a normal quarter for you in earthchoice in terms of your product launches? and then how much of these product launches would you classify as, i don't know how to characterize it, but actually new products and not going to cannibalize existing volumes in your system?
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
yeah. so the 94 products would be more than we typically would introduce in a year's time. this has been an exceptionally aggressive, if you will, new product year. we analyzed our portfolio and came to the conclusion that we did have some gaps.
so a lot of this product is in addition to what we have and it's not cannibalization. i think a lot of the products that you're seeing or that you will see introduced are around takeout and delivery. so we would have seen the takeout and delivery trend even before covid growing, and we positioned ourselves to develop containers that would be suitable for takeout and delivery. so all of that growth would correspond with the growth that we're seeing in takeout delivery.
some the other products, we were -- we have a line of compostable plates and bowls. we're not in that business today. so that would be additive. we're launching a line of what we're calling onebox.
it's a carry-out container made out of board. it's kind of a foldable board that would replace other types of carry-out. but again, this is specific segments of the market that we don't participate in. because of this product, so that will be additive.
so again, i'm not saying there won't be any cannibalization because typically, when we look at earthchoice, the price points are a little bit higher. and if people decide that they want the enhanced sustainability and the enhanced benefit of going with those products, they pay a little bit more. so we're ok if there is some cannibalization because we tend to margin up from that standpoint. and i'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
no. i think you answered it there on the cannibalization part. that was the second part. i appreciate it.
i'll turn it over.
operator
thank you. our next question has come from the line of arun viswanathan of rbc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i guess, first off, on 2021. it appears most of the reduction on the full-year guidance is focused on q1 and is mostly in beverage merchandising. i guess just to reiterate, could you confirm that to be the case? and again, maybe that's due mainly to the resin and some of the operational issues. you spelled out those four factors.
but i'm just surprised that there's -- is that the right way to read this that it's mostly in beverage merchandising, it's mostly in q1?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
that is correct. yes.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. so given that's the case, you also mentioned maybe some inability to get in and do some of the strategic investments and some of those benefits. but when you look out into '22 and '23, is there any reason to believe that there's been some structural or lasting impacts in '20 and '21 that prevent you from getting to where you want it to be in '22 and '23? or you still feel comfortable with the trajectory you're on?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
john, do you want me to take that one?
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
i'm sorry, from a beverage merchandising standpoint?
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
no. from an overall standpoint. i mean you've called for a recovery, i guess, in the second half in foodservice and beverage merchandising, and i think that's fair. but i'm just curious if there's any structural issues across the company, operationally that would prevent you from getting to your '22 and '23 kind of trajectory.
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
at this point, no.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and then lastly, just related to that, given what you're doing in beverage merchandising, do you feel that there's actually incremental gains to -- that would be realized there that would lead you to maybe better-than-expected results in '22 and '23? i mean is it the case that you feel that maybe '22 is back at 2019 levels or above that level?
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
i think on this comprehensive review of our beverage merchandising business, it's -- we're still very early. it really is too early to speculate on what the benefit might be. my personal opinion is, i do believe there's going to be benefit here.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok, thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question has come from the line of roger spitz with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
roger spitz -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
perhaps you said this during the prepared remarks, but could you say what the percentage volume down in q4 year over year was for food merchandising and beverage merchandising? and in 2020, overall, food merchandising volume down on a percentage basis?
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
mike, do you want to grab that one?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
food merchandising volume was essentially flat 2020 versus 2019.
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
and foodservice?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
foodservice was down 13%.
roger spitz -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and is that 2020 or q4? that was 2020, i'd take it.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes, that's for full-year 2020.
roger spitz -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and what was -- the pine bluff mill maintenance outage in q1, what was the ebitda impact of that? i don't know if you separated that out or not.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
i didn't, but it's $9 million.
roger spitz -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
there are no further questions at this time. i would like to hand the call back over to management for any closing comments.
john mcgrath -- chief executive officer
thank you. look, covid-19 had a significant impact on our business in 2020 and will continue for the first part of 2021. the fact that we were able to quickly capitalize on the changing consumption trends by adding capacity and repurposing underutilized assets as well as aggressively reducing costs allowed us to mitigate much of the downside that was caused by the pandemic. and now as the economy begins to reopen and people return to pre-covid activities, we really do believe we're uniquely positioned to benefit and to drive ebitda growth.
i think if you -- in closing, i think there's really three drivers that are going to be enablers for our success. number one is the ebitda improvement programs that i talked about, our strategic investment program, the beverage merchandising comprehensive review and the next-generation pactiv evergreen waste elimination programs. we have to execute on those, and we will. that's number one.
number two is we're gaining foodservice volume as covid subsides. we need to get our foodservice volume back. and then to continue to drive the recovery process in our mill. those three are really the drivers for success.
and just in closing, we will continue to manage and drive improvement in those areas that we have control over. obviously, there are some things that are outside of our control. we'll do the best we can to mitigate those but the things within our control, the ones we're focusing on. and that's what we will continue to drive for sustained improvement.
so with that, i'll close. thank you very much for your participation.

operator
thank you for standing by. this is the conference operator. welcome to the pactiv evergreen first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] the conference is being recorded.
[operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to dhaval patel, senior vice president of ir and strategy. please go ahead.
dhaval patel -- senior vice president of investor relations and strategy
thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. thank you for your interest in pactiv evergreen and welcome to our first-quarter 2021 earnings call. with me on the call today, we have michael king, chief executive officer; and michael ragen, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. before we begin, please visit the events section of the company's investor relations website at www.pactivevergreen.com and access the company's supplemental earnings presentation.
management's remarks today should be heard in tandem with reviewing this presentation. before we begin our formal remarks, i would like to remind everyone that our discussions today may include forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. these statements are also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.
we refer all of you to our recent sec filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our future operating results and financial condition. lastly, during today's call, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating our performance. the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap. and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures are available in our earnings release.
with that, let me turn it over to michael king. mike? 
michael king -- chief executive officer
thank you, dhaval. good morning, everyone, and welcome. before jumping in and with this being my first earnings call as the ceo of pactiv evergreen, i thought it might be helpful to give a bit of insight on my background leading up to now. i'm a pedigreed chemical and as a mechanical engineer.
my career started in the operations and development space of the automotive industry, and it's rapidly progressed into both private and public sectors with companies like lear corporation. ti automotive, fram, and autolite as well as huhtamaki packaging and just most recently, graham packaging. my sweet spot is in driving business transformation through culture, manufacturing turnaround and end-to-end systems integration. my approach is hands-on and be collaborative.
i'm very results focused with a keen eye to long-term and short-term viability of the business. i have to say that it's been a pleasure to meet so many of our pactiv evergreen employees over the past two months as i've taken over as the ceo. in my short tenure, i also visited our mill operations and several of our converting facilities. i'm confident that we have an amazing team of talented individuals across the organization that are well suited to manage the current challenging environment as well as some opportunities for the future.
the first quarter in 2021 presented a number of challenges as our covid-19-pressured business was also impacted by an unprecedented winterstorm, uri, as well as a scheduled cold mill outage. despite these challenges, we managed to deliver solid results across the segments and remain laser focused on improving our paper mills and eliminating waste a host of strategic initiatives. if i could turn your attention to slide 3. during this presentation, we will discuss key business takeaways and first-quarter 2021 highlights.
we'll give a -- we'll provide an update on the business. we'll go through the first-quarter financial performance. we'll provide an update on our full year 2021 outlook. and we'll conclude this with "," today.
if i could direct your attention to slide 5. our first-quarter results have continued to see steady improvement, and underlying business activity were negatively impacted by continued depressed volumes due to covid-19 along with winterstorm uri and our planned cold mill outage. in foodservice and food merchandising, we actually saw year-over-year adjusted ebitda improvement of 9% and 4%, respectively, for the quarter despite the negative impacts of covid-19 and the winter storm. the total company volume was 3% up from the month of march.
we expect the stronger year-over-year volume growth to continue for the remainder of 2021. we are still relatively early in this process of our operational review of the beverage merchandising segment and our next-generation pactiv evergreen waste elimination program. we do not have an update for you at this time but we also plan to provide you further details in the coming months. the company has continued to focus on paying down debt and has repaid $59 million of notes in the quarter.
please now turn to slide 6. now let's move to quarter 1 2021 highlights. net revenue of $1.164 billion was down 4% from our q1 2020 due to the continued impact of covid-19 as well as lower raw material costs passing through the system. we also note that net sales are recovering and were up 7% year over year for the month of march.
net loss from continuing operations was $15 million, and earnings per share from continuing operations was a loss of $0.07. adjusted ebitda of $77 million for the quarter was down 47% from q1 2020 due to the impacts from winterstorm uri, the cold mill outage as well as covid-19. these results were partially offset by favorable raw materials. free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda less capex, was $17 million and declined versus q1 2020 driven by the depressed ebitda.
finally, our strategic investment program is on track and delivered $23 million of benefits in the first quarter. and if i could direct you to slide 8. as we have previously discussed, pactiv evergreen continues to have many ebitda growth levers that will deliver benefits in 2021 and beyond. as the overall economy continues to rebound and covid-19 subsides, we should realize significant volume upside and leverage operational costs.
the incremental operating cost during the covid-19 pandemic will decline as mass vaccination continues across the country. the secular shift to more online ordering, delivery and takeout will also help drive our volume growth. we plan to continue investing in our incremental capacity to meet customer demand. we view sustainability as another pillar of our growth story and also a differentiator for the business.
we are able to provide a broad portfolio of sustainable products to our customers as well as work with customers to develop new and sustainable products as they shift their product offerings to meet customers' preferences. finally, cost reduction initiatives and optimization will also continue to contribute to ebitda growth. please now turn to slide 9. as one of the largest companies in our food and beverage packaging industry, we recognize the responsibility we have to lead and inspire when it comes to esg issues.
in our latest sustainability report, we have outlined where we are headed and we are committed to updating all our stakeholders on our progress toward excellence. when it comes to protecting our planet's resources, we are currently finalizing our 2020 greenhouse gas emissions data and then examining our options to accelerate our reductions to date and help mitigate climate change. one data point that we can share today shows our commitment to another focus area, and that is sustainable forestry. in 2020, 30% of the fiber we procured came from third-party certified sources, up from 23% in 2019.
related to the products pillar, we're building the broadest offering of sustainable packaging in the industry, which helps us reach our goal then by 2030, 100% of our products will be made with recycled, recyclable or renewable materials. during the first quarter, we launched 10 new products which were all fiber based. that brings the total number of new items we've introduced to 94 in the last year and a half. valuing people has also been a top priority at pactiv evergreen.
and in the first quarter, we saw overall injury rates come in below target and 3x better than industry averages. looking beyond our people, we celebrated national volunteer week by launching a new program that rewards actions for our employees and their families to better their communities. finally, as a newly public company, we are now working with our board of directors to develop transparent policies that promote effective governance, and we look forward to sharing more in the future. we'll be providing greater external reporting on esg topics in the coming quarters and years, and we invite you to view more details at the link included in our presentation.
please now turn to slide 10. another key focus for pactiv evergreen has been innovation. we have continued to invest in capabilities to make products from a number of substrates. the integration of evergreen into pactiv only further enhances those capabilities.
this will allow us to be the right partner to work closely with our customers as they tackle the challenging requirements of a dynamic consumer that has evolving needs and preferences of functionality and sustainability. we have now also launched a total of 94 new earthchoice products with 22 launched in the first quarter of 2021 as we focus on sustainability-oriented products to align with today's customer preferences. in addition, we are launching new products focused on food safety and tamper evident to address customer needs. we have not only developed a number of projects to realize $6 million of ebitda and synergies in 2021 from the combined pactiv evergreen, but we've also identified an additional $25 million of some potential synergy opportunities.
please now turn to slide 11. we remain on track to complete our strategic investment program in 2021. we will have spent a total of $661 million by the end of the year on a number of programs that has a total average a 2- to 2.5-year payback. we are in maturing stages of our beverage merchandising operational review and our next-generation pactiv evergreen waste elimination programs.
we plan to really provide more information here on these programs over the coming months and quarters as we start to implement actions across the business. i will now turn it over to mike ragen for some detailed financial review.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
thanks, mike. moving to slide 13. looking at our first-quarter 2021 financial performance, net revenue was $1.164 billion versus $1.212 billion in the same period last year, a decline of 4%. the decline was primarily due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.
it is important to know that we saw a strong year-on-year improvement in march 2021 with revenue up 7%. our march 2020 numbers were not yet affected by the covid-19 pandemic, and so this is a strong lift of our prior year baseline. adjusted ebitda was $77 million versus $145 million in the same period last year, just a decline of 47%. our foodservice and food merchandising segments were up 9% and 4%, respectively, despite the effects of covid-19 and winterstorm uri.
in the quarter, our beverage merchandising segment was affected by a number of factors. we will discuss them in some detail later in our presentation. free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda less capex, was unfavorable for the same period last year due to lower adjusted ebitda. moving to slide 14 and our results by segment for q1.
our foodservice segment saw net revenues down 4% versus same period last year due to the impact of covid-19 on volumes, particularly in january and february. we're seeing a strong recovery in our foodservice volumes in march, which is continuing. adjusted ebitda for the segment was up 9% versus same period last year due to the favorable raw material costs, net of lower cost pass-through, partially offset by some higher manufacturing costs and lower sales volume. our food merchandising segment saw net revenues down slightly with volume down 4%, mostly offset by favorable pricing, net of mix.
adjusted ebitda was up 4% on favorable material costs, net of lower cost pass-through, mostly offset by higher manufacturing costs. in our beverage merchandising segment saw net revenues down 10% versus same period last year due to the impact of covid-19. adjusted ebitda for this segment was down $81 million versus same period last year, the key drivers being: the effect of winter storm uri, which cost $34 million; a cold mill outage, which cost $16 million in the quarter; mill operational performance, which cost $16 million; and the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, which impacted the business $14 million. moving to slide 15.
here, we estimate the q1 impact of the covid-19 and the winter storm uri to our business. the q1 adjusted ebitda impact of covid-19 was $38 million mostly driven by volume, price and higher manufacturing costs most notably in our foodservice and beverage merchandising segments. in q1, winterstorm uri had a onetime impact to our business of $39 million. the impact was concentrated on our facilities in arkansas and texas, where we have incurred higher energy costs and the needed to shut down sites quickly, incurring damage in the process.
we estimate that we will also see a further $10 million of costs in q2 due to damage incurred during the storm and higher unrecoverable raw material costs to ensure certainty of supply to our customers. moving to slide 17. looking at our outlook for 2021, the ultimate impact of the covid-19 pandemic to the pactiv evergreen also remains uncertain. in our forecasts, we have made certain assumptions regarding a second half recovery of foodservice and beverage merchandising revenues that are dependent upon increased mobility and may not eventually.
we have been neither conservative nor aggressive in these assumptions. at this time, we are updating the full-year adjusted ebitda guidance to $630 million to $645 million from our earlier projection. approximately $50 million of the change to our guidance is due to the impact of winterstorm uri, while $20 million is related to mill operations within the beverage merchandising segment. turning around the mill operations within the beverage merchandising segment that remains a priority.
we have the resources in place to effect the turnaround and are continuing to invest to ensure that the turnaround takes place. we expect the strong performance in our foodservice and food merchandising segments to continue throughout the year. one quick note on q2. in addition to the residual impact of $10 million from the winterstorm uri and the recent raw material spikes will negatively impact second quarter results.
our contractual price pass-throughs will then take effect during the second half of 2021, and we expect to see strong margin improvement in the back half. thank you for your time. as an appendix to this document, we have included q1 revenue and adjusted ebitda bridges versus same period last year, consolidated statements of income/loss, a reconciliation of our net income/loss to adjusted ebitda and free cash flow and a summary of the progress in strategic investment program. i'll now pass back to mike king for closing comments.
michael king -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. in closing, while the first quarter was challenging, we look forward to the continued opportunities ahead of us as business activity returns and drives continued recovery in our foodservice and food merchandising businesses. i also look forward to turning around the performance in our beverage merchandising business and, in particular, our mill operations. with that, we will now open it up for questions.
operator?
 :
operator
[operator instructions] the first question is from anthony pettinari from citi. please go ahead.
anthony pettinari -- citi -- analyst
good morning and welcome, mike. given the unprecedented resin inflation that you're seeing, can you just maybe remind us or put a finer point on the time line to get caught up on that inflation in terms of the lags, sort of are they one quarter, two quarters? and then just your assumptions for the direction of resin prices for the remainder of the year that's embedded in your outlook.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. so this is mike ragen. good morning, anthony. so i'll take that one.
what we're going to see in q2 is we will see somewhat of a disconnect between our revenue and our costs. the resin prices spiked early in the year. a lot of that is still in inventory for us. as you know, we hedge the lag in -- particularly in foodservice and food merchandising, and we will see -- but that's not 100% perfect in terms of our hedging.
we will see a lag through q2 but in q3, our pricing will be back up on top of the resin, and we will restore our normal margins. we are expecting resin costs to subside through q3 and then sort of flatten out through q4.
anthony pettinari -- citi -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. and then, mike, understand that you're still undertaking your review and it's early days, but is it possible to identify one or two things that you think the company could improve on either operationally or commercially that really stand out to you as an opportunity given your history and experience?
michael king -- chief executive officer
yes, yes, good question. there's a host of reliability issues that we've been solving in parallel in both mills. our converting operations, i would tell you, run fairly well so the focus is truly the mills. i would also say commercially, we're evaluating pricing across the board.
that certainly stuck its tongue out as an opportunity for us. and really, just as we continue the strategic review, holistic look at product proliferation and give you a sense of the body of work around our uptimes and how that's tying to labor challenge in the country right now with our largest competitor being the u.s. government in terms of labor. we're managing that.
and so insulating ourselves on labor, uptime efficiency, and then commercially looking at price, all those are levers right now.
anthony pettinari -- citi -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. i'll turn it over.
operator
the next question is from ghansham panjabi from baird. please go ahead.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everybody and congrats, michael and dhaval, on your new roles.
michael king -- chief executive officer
thank you.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
i guess following up on anthony's question on just kind of looking at the construct of guidance. you lowered ebitda for 2021 by about $70 million. and you called out $50 million from the winter storm uri and then $20 million from the mill issue but costs are obviously much higher, just not resin but freight, labor, as you mentioned, et cetera. are you assuming that you fully recover price/cost specific to these issues by the end of 2021 or are there any positive upsets that we should consider relative to your initial guidance?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. this is mike ragen again. so we are -- look, if i just take a step back. in our foodservice segment, 80% of our revenue is on pass-through.
and in food merchandising, it's a similar number. and in beverage merchandising, on the carton side of the business, it's around 80% as well. and the remainder of the business, a lot of it is market based. so we are expecting to recover the bulk of our input costs increases or get our prices up to cover that.
and that's contractual, and that's the way we've modeled things out. now are there upsides to that? look, if resin drops, if input costs drop, sure, and we might see some upside but the way that we've modeled it is, as i said to anthony, is that it drops a little and then sort of flattens out in the back end of the year.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
ok. just to clarify, if resin stays flat between now and year-end, would you recover everything by the end of 2021 or will that spill over into 2022?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
we'll recover by the end of 2021.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
got it. perfect. and then i think you mentioned 3% volume increase in march year over year. just kind of give us context as to what march 2020 look like.
and then what are you seeing so far in april across the board by the three segments?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
sure. so -- and i'm going to -- hopefully, this isn't too much of a -- too much information but i like to look at 2019 rather than 2020, but -- particularly for april. but look, in total, our volumes were up in march, as we stated, foodservice volumes in march. everyone needs to be -- to understand that 25% of our business in foodservice is institutional.
so things like schools, stadiums, offices. and they still haven't really opened or they've opened to a certain extent but they're not also fully open. and so when i look at this versus -- for foodservice versus 2020 in march, we're up around 7%, and we're about flat with 2019 in terms of volumes. in april, we're up versus 29 -- i don't even want to talk about 2020 because that's when the world stopped.
but we're up 1% or 2% in april on the 2019 numbers, so positive there. in food merchandising, we were a little down in march versus 2020. we're about 3% down in march, but versus 2019, we're about 6% up. and in april, we're looking -- we're about 7% up on 2020 and around 3% to 4% up on 2019.
and then in beverage merchandising for 2021 versus 2020, we're about 3% up, and we're about 12% up on 2019 in march. and we're seeing 2021 about the 3% that's up on 2020 and a little down on 2019. so -- and obviously, month-to-month, you can see pulls -- pull forwards, pushbacks and all that sort of stuff, so that's why i give you the two months. and so i think what we're seeing is we're seeing strong recovery in foodservice with upside to come as further openings occur in the areas that i mentioned around the institutional part of the business, 25% of the foodservice business historically.
food merchandising, we're seeing good, solid volumes. we will obviously see a little bit of a pullback in things like protein trays, in cartons, and just those sorts of things. but we will see growth in areas that almost disappeared last year, things like bakery containers that -- as people weren't celebrating graduations and things like that. we will see that return this year.
and then in beverage merchandising, we think we'll see -- as schools go back, we'll see more school milk. we'll also see the pull-through from foodservice on cupstock, the cups -- paper cups that will go into a lot of the foodservice customers. so we're encouraged. we're not declaring victory yet but we think the volumes that they're currently strong, and we think that they're going to continue like that as this economy continues to open up.

the next question is from arun viswanathan from rbc. please go ahead.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great thanks for taking my question and welcome, dhaval and mike. so i guess i just wanted to ask about the strategic investment program that was described during the ipo process. maybe could you update us on your progress there, especially in light of the $20 million of headwinds that you've been experiencing within beverage merchandising? thanks.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
sure. so as an appendix to the presentation on slide 23, it provides the summary. to date, we've spent $498 million of the $661 million in the program, and we continue to spend at rate.during the first quarter, we saw a benefit of $20 million from that, which is very positive. i think last year, we were at -- for the full year, we were at $65 million.
so $23 million in a quarter means that we're accelerating on those savings, which is great to see. through q1, we spent -- in the mills, we took down the pine bluff mill. mike king also outlined the cold mill outage, and i mentioned that, that cost us $16 million in ebitda in q1. however, we invested substantially, and we rebuilt a boiler.
we did a lot of investment at that time, which is great. and we will spend circa $100 million in the evergreen beverage merchandising business this year, the bulk of which will be in the two mills. so we're continuing to invest there. and we'll continue to invest to see the benefits that we're expecting this as the mills turn around.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
so as a follow-up, just given what you said and given some of the cost pressures, so i imagine you would be caught up on resin price inflation by the end of this year. you'd get the $50 million back from the storms next year, and then you'd add in the increases from the sip or the benefits. so would you expect 2022 to look more like '19 then? and obviously, i guess that's dependent on the foodservice recovery to a full extent but is that a fair characterization of how you're thinking about the longer term for the next couple of years?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
so i don't want to overcommit here, but i would expect that 2022 would be better than 2019. and if i just sort of walk you through my thoughts on it. the second half of this year, i mean, you can infer the numbers that we're expecting to see in the second half of this year, and a lot of that is on the recovery from covid, the benefits from our strategic investment program and essentially just costs in our plants coming down as we've really increased costs there. and so -- and plus, to your point, we are recovering and we'll recover through our contract pass-throughs the increased costs in resin and other raw material inputs.
so our exit run rate should be very strong, and we will also continue to see these benefits from the strategic investment program. we will continue to see -- we're not saying that by the end of the year, we'll be recovered from covid. that will linger into next year. and we also have other programs that mike king have outlined, which we will provide further clarification on in future calls.
so my personal view, and i think what mike and i have discussed, is next year, we'll exceed 2019.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks.

the next question is from george staphos from bank of america. please go ahead.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks. hi, everyone. good morning. again, welcome, dhaval and mike.
i want to start with -- my first is question really more around volume, and then i want to get into evergreen and the mills to the extent that we can talk. so mike or mike, the little bit of weakness that we saw in food merchandising volumes in the quarter, is that just what we would expect a little bit of weakness because of the reopen? so you're getting it in foodservice, so that means we're not shopping the perimeter of the store as much for food at home or is there something else behind that? and a unrelated volume question, how are you marketing earthchoice and the plastic packaging you make in that business as sustainable? what's your -- what are you finding as most resonating with the customer there? is it the recyclability or something else that is allowing you to present that as a sustainable choice?
michael king -- chief executive officer
ok. will you let me take earthchoice?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes, please. you go ahead, mike.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yes. so i'll answer your second question, george. on earthchoice, it's both. it's recyclability, for sure, but it's also recycled content as we look at those levers.
it's not the same across the board but certainly, those are the two -- out of the three pillars, the two that we're leveraging in the poly side of earthchoice.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and how much recycled content are you using right now within earthchoice or across the whole platform?
michael king -- chief executive officer
i'll have to get back to you on that. do you know, mike ragen?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
i'm sorry. the question was how much recycled content?
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yes. i don't know if -- it's 15% or 20%. i'm not -- we can get that exact number. i don't -- we don't have it off the top of our head.
it's [inaudible]
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's fine.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
it depends on the product itself. we can do -- for example, recycled pet, we can do 100%. it just depends on the clarity required and so -- and the cost and things like that. so -- but we -- we'll balance that out, and so it's not one answer across the board.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
we can save it for later. i was just asking in total where you are right now versus '20, how much content did you use but we can sort of dig into that off-line. and on the food merchandising volume trends and what's driving that?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. so what we've seen, we have -- we sell into the consumer channels. we've seen some lower volume there and we've seen a small pullback in protein trays and egg cartons, which we'd expect.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. turning to evergreen and the mills. i guess the overarching question is, if we look back, the guidance for the business and for the whole company, which is largely -- the reduction has been largely driven by beverage merchandising, it's been well over $100 million. as you've been able to look at this, and what has been the biggest driver of the variance if you grew that number within evergreen? it sounds like it's mostly reliability.
and what are you finding is causing you most of the problems right now just in terms of the reliability at the two mills? is it the head box? is it something else? and what gives you the confidence, given what you know right now that you'll be able to resolve those issues? because old mills sometimes take a lot more than investment to up the curve than initial expectations based on past experience. so what's giving you the confidence there? thanks, guys. i'll turn it over.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yes, i'll take this one. so not a simple answer, and it's certainly different. we have two mills, as you know, and both are in different stations in their excellence journey. i would tell you, if you break a mill into its seven or eight sub-facilities, there isn't one of those sub-facilities that hasn't needed special attention to get to the best place we can on our cost curve.
i would tell you pine bluff -- and just generally, you should think about pine bluff as a bit further in their journey. our operational metrics are all headed in the right direction. we're just coming out of a cold mill outage, where we've been able to invest heavily in all eight of those sub-facilities, if you will, whether it's chip production, pulping, bleaching. every one of those sub-facilities is getting a lot of attention, and we're seeing that improve.
i would say, to your granular question, our paper production side or in our board production side, our paper machines run well. so it's not just the head box issues of pine bluff. it's not -- we're not having overhaul-related or major issues. it's really a story of reliability on all the upstream and making sure that those things which have, frankly, otherwise been hampering uptime don't hurt our ability to be efficient on the paper and board side.
and similar story in canton, frankly. there's been a lot of investment in canton. we did not have a cold mill outage. so we're doing a lot of things.
we're flying the plane and fixing major items that we -- as we look at the medium- and long-term viability of that operation, without having a cold mill outage, we're doing everything we can to, again, not see the downtime manifest itself into our paper and boiler production, so similar story. it's all in the upstream and getting consistent labor and consistent -- taking advantage of the downtimes and we have to keep the machines up is the focus. and so it's not like there's one big rooming item. it's more systemic, and that's why we're somewhat reluctant to go into a lot of detail on this strategic review until we get through what might be some step function changes we can make there.
so i hope that answers your question, george.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
no, michael, it's very helpful. more work to be done, but we appreciate it. i'm gonna turn it over here. thanks very much.
operator
the next question is from kyle white from deutsche bank. please go ahead.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking the question. mike, dhaval, congrats on the new role. mike, i know it's relatively early days here in your role.
but when you take a look at the business portfolio, specifically looking at beverage merchandising, just trying to understand your thoughts in terms of what you -- how you do that segment in regards to the overall portfolio at pactiv evergreen.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yes. so i kind of think of it as liquid boards and cupstock and things that we vertically integrate, and then i think of everything else. so our coated groundwood or uncoated free sheet businesses. i kind of look at it that way.
and i don't have any -- i can tell you that it's exciting to see what these synergies are really the benefits that our converting facilities across the board will realize as we continue to straighten the mills out on the liquid packaging side, liquid paper side. but i -- it's too early for me to be able to comment on coated groundwood or uncoated free sheet spaces, all of which what we're now -- we have pretty good saturation in those spaces, on our skus. and -- but i can tell you that we're rolling all areas of each segment over and looking at it from -- whether it's commercial levers and pricing to profitable sku mix to where we want to lean in on products like earthchoice. and so this is a full end-to-end look.
i know i didn't give you probably what you're looking for because we're just not there yet on all the segments, but that's kind of how i think about it, as the three big buckets, one of which is very exciting, i can tell you that. the other two we're reviewing in detail.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
no, that's helpful. thank you. on the $25 million of additional synergy projects that you have identified, do you have a time line on when you expect to realize these? and what's kind of driving these synergies?
michael king -- chief executive officer
yes. it's premature to be able to give you an exact or even an indicative. i'd like to get through the strategic review before we go live on that.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
all right. sounds good. i'll turn it over. good luck in the quarter.
michael king -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
the next question is from sam mcgovern from credit suisse. please go ahead.
sam mcgovern -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. with regard to the impact from the texas storms, can you talk a little bit more specifically about how it impacted you and whether there's any recoveries that you guys would anticipate from any business or insurance?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
mike, do you want me to take that?
michael king -- chief executive officer
let me take the front end, and i'll let you talk about the recovery potential.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
ok.
michael king -- chief executive officer
the -- to say it was an eclipsed of event that was somewhat unfortunate -- we planned a cold mill outage for the week after when the storm hit. what the storm did was force us to pull the cold mill -- take this mill cold sooner than we wanted. so it was, no pun intended, a perfect storm. it hit us right at the worst time it could.
so taking a mill cold during a cold snap in the south, freezing pipes, exposing the already weak linkages. there wasn't one -- if you think of the mill as kind of eight or nine sub-facilities, there wasn't one of those sub-facilities that wasn't greatly impacted. and so just a couple that with the cost -- the rising cost of energy for us, particularly natural gas, having to commit to purchase natural gas to keep things heated, coupled with the breakages and really a cold storm in a mill that far south really exposes anything that's weak, things that would normally be maintained. and so it was really -- it exacerbated our ability to, a, focus on the things that we had already planned in the cold mill, but it also -- a lot of these things that we hadn't planned to work on needed to get fixed quickly.
so we were down longer than we wanted to be and certainly paid more for the energy during that period of time. and the body of work and the scope of work that we had planned in that outage, whether it will be the recovery boilers, whether it be -- a lot of what failed was pumps. we had several pump failures, turbines and energy -- backup turbine generators. there's a whole host of such things that exposed themselves during that -- the storm for us in the pine bluff mill.
and then mike, i'll let you talk to the energy side of that and potential for recovery, etc.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. so in terms of recoverability, we're reviewing all our options as you'd expect. we're not sure that we'll get anything back, but we're pushing forward, so we're hopeful. we haven't factored anything into our forecast here.
the energy piece is -- as you'd expect, energy prices spiked. and before we shut down, particularly in arkansas, the mill, we saw natural gas prices through the roof, and that obviously cost us a lot of money as well.
sam mcgovern -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. great. thank you. that's helpful.
and then just with regard to the rising raw material and other costs, how should we think about the impact to the working capital line in terms of cash flows as we roll through 2021?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. so we have seen -- in q1, we saw a $50 million increase in our inventories due to the increased raw material costs. so we're managing our inventories right now and trying to somewhat offset that but we did all -- in q1, we saw a $50 million increase to working capital. and through the end of the year, that will be somewhat higher due to rate, but we are -- we've been doing a lot of work on our -- what we have talked about through our ipo process, our integrated supply chain program.
and one of the benefits of that program is to allow us to bring our inventories down. so we will now see that as an offset to that, the higher rate number. but -- and that's -- so physical inventories will come down, but we're expecting to see total inventory to be up by $30 million, $40 million at the end of this year because of higher raw material costs.
sam mcgovern -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you very much. i'll pass it along.
operator
the next question is from mark wilde from bmo. please go ahead.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning, mike and mike. mike, i -- mike ragen, i wondered if you are able to quantify the second quarter impact from the resin mismatch.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
well, i can and have personally but in terms of what i'm expecting to see in terms of our guidance for q2, we're expecting to see that as we've said already, strong volumes. however, a lot of that volume impact will be offset by the higher raw material costs in the quarter. so i would not expect to see it as materially higher quarter than last year. however, then, we'll recover and we'll see higher margins through to q3 and q4.
does that help?
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yes. i just -- what i was hoping for is that maybe you could give us sort of a range in terms of millions of dollars of impact from just the resin mismatch in the second quarter.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
ok. so it's around $50 million to $60 million.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. all right. and then another question i had was just what type of volume expectations on a year-over-year basis you have built into the second half at this point? is it possible to give us some guidance about what you're embedding in the numbers right now on a segment-by-segment basis?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
sure. i'll give you some guidance. so what we're expecting to see is -- in foodservice, what we've embedded in the numbers is to be -- it's easier for me to talk versus 2019 because i don't know whether --
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
that's fine. that's fine. that's fine.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
2020 was a little all over the place but -- so we've sort of said in our foodservice numbers to be 4% to 5% down versus 2019. and as i've said earlier, that hasn't manifested itself in march and april. in beverage and food merchandising, where we would expect to be around flat to 2019, and in beverage merchandising, we would expect to be a little down in the early months and then pick back up in the back end to be flat to 2019.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. all right. that's very helpful. and then mike, if i could.
last summer when the management provided many of us on the call with projections for 2021, those numbers were almost $200 million higher than the current guidance. now if we leave aside some of the issues from the first quarter, there's still a big gap there. can you just talk about what the two or three drivers have been to kind of reduce guidance over the last eight or nine months? and then also, what you're doing going forward to kind of improve that guidance.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. ok. so mark, i think as you know, i think the big variance is in beverage merchandising, and that's what george alluded to before. so -- but let me give you the easiest one first.
foodservice outlook versus the -- what we had when we discussed this with you, it's off about $20 million. and we made certain assumptions back in 2020 around how quickly we'd recover from covid, how quickly children would go back to school, et cetera, et cetera, and some of those didn't play themselves out. and i think that that represents about $20 million of the outlook. now as i said earlier, we are seeing stronger volumes than what we had in the outlook.
so who knows where that will manifest itself. the big down is in beverage merchandising. and between the last call -- well, sorry, the guidance that we gave you guys and then where we went to last call, we came off about $80 million, and i'd also split that to two different things: price and volume and essentially the recovery of the mills and the timing around that. so in terms of the price and volume, we've seen lower pricing, particularly in the paper segments.
also, some pricing on board volumes because we want to keep the mills full. and we've had to also chase the volume there to make sure that we are keeping -- we're not taking any downtime. so -- and so we've had to sell board volumes at lower pricing than what we had assumed, again, around recovery. secondly in that area, schools.
again, i mentioned that in foodservice, same in beverage merchandising, it's a big part of our business, school milk. and this manifests itself in our board as well because we also sell to competitors who convert into school milk. so they're the big pieces on price and volume, and that's about half of the $80 million. the other half is mill recovery timing, $40 million, ok? so the speed at which the mills are turning around is not as fast.
and then what we just outlined this morning was they're not recovering here as quickly than what we had assumed in our prior guidance, and that's brought it down another $20 million, ok? and then the last piece is obviously the storm, $50 million. and so that should walk you backwards from where we were to where we are today.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. very helpful. and kind of going forward, mike?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
so going forward, you mean about like how we sort of --
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i mean, just sharpening the guidance, yes, because this is a -- it's a huge drop over the last eight or nine months.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
sure. so i'd sort of look at this year as a bit of a tale of two halves. this year, q1, you've seen the results. q2, we're going to be -- we'll be weighed down somewhat by the raw material increases and us catching the price back up.
however, i think what you -- what i hope to see and what we're starting to see is stronger volumes. so you'll be able to see that, and that should give you some confidence here and what we're saying about q3 and q4. obviously, proof is in the pudding. then in q3, q4, we should see stronger volumes.
we will have caught up on price. and we would expect that some of these positive trends that we're starting to see in the mills continue to improve such that we're exiting 2021 at a nice exit run rate. in terms of what next year looks like, and i'm not going to commit to any numbers, but the way that i look at it is we'll see continued recovery from covid, we'll see continued benefits from our strategic investment program, which will play themselves out over the next year or two. and some of these other programs, which we'll outline in upcoming calls, we should see some benefits from that.
so the volume tailwinds that we have in front of us, combined with us reducing costs in our plants around covid, plus getting on top of the mills, again, we haven't demonstrated that, but we've got these right structures around that, i think, will lead to improved results in the back half of the year and then going into 2022.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. i'll turn it over. thank you, mike.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
no problem, mark.
operator
next is a follow-up question from george staphos from bank of america. please go ahead.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks. hi, guys. i'll try to make a quick lightning round here. so mike or mike, when would you expect to have a new leadership for the mill system at evergreen? number one.
number two, can you remind us what was the capital spending outlook? and might some of the required remediation lead to more spending? and then lastly, with canton, do you need to take a cold outage this year so that you're not trying to, as you put, fix a plane while flying it at the same time? thanks, guys, and good luck in the quarter.
michael king -- chief executive officer
so thanks, george. and now i'll piggyback because i have the answer to the question. i couldn't tell you on the recycled content as well. but new leadership, our hope is before we have our next earnings call, we have a new leader in place or sooner.
capital outlook, i think our number for the year is $305 million. we don't anticipate doing over $305 million. canton, no, we will not be taking a cold mill outage, and we're not anticipating that in 2021. and the answer to your prior question on recycled content is the minimum is 25% in our poly earthchoice.
and it can go as high as 100%, but the minimum is 25%.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thanks very much, michael. good luck.

good morning, and welcome to pactiv evergreen's second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. during the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.
i would like to turn the conference over to dhaval patel, senior vice president of investor relations and strategy. please go ahead.
dhaval patel -- senior vice president of investor relations and strategy
thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. thank you for your interest in pactiv evergreen, and welcome to our second-quarter 2021 earnings call. with me on the call today, we have michael king, chief executive officer; and michael ragen, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. before we begin, please visit the events section of the company's investor relations website at www.pactivevergreen.com and access the company's supplemental earnings presentation.
management's remarks today should be heard in tandem with reviewing this presentation. before we begin our formal remarks, i would like to remind everyone that our discussions today may include forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. these statements are also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.
we refer all of you to our recent sec filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our future operating results and financial condition. lastly, during today's call, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating our performance. the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap. and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures are available in our earnings release.
with that, let me turn the call over to michael king. mike? 
michael king -- chief executive officer
thank you, dhaval. good morning, everyone, and welcome. yesterday, after market close, pactiv evergreen released its second-quarter 2021 results that were broadly in line with the guidance we have provided in the last quarter. we saw a noticeable improvement in our volumes across our business segments, especially in foodservice as consumers recover from the covid-19 pandemic.
we expect this trend to continue into the second half of 2021. on the cost side, we saw a similar dynamic as across the industry with inflation in raw material and logistics putting pressure on margins as input prices for resin and paper rose substantially. as you know, these input costs are linked to indexes and the lag in pricing recovery impacted q2. assuming the rate of increases in input slow or turn around, we would expect it to recover raw material cost in the second half.
in q2, we began to make progress in turning around our beverage merchandising business. while we are pleased with the progress, there's still more to be done. as part of that plan, we are pleased to announce a new addition to our team. byron racki will be joining us as the president of our beverage merchandising unit effective august 16.
he brings a wealth of knowledge and experience in the paper industry, including a successful turnaround history, and we look forward to having him join our team. i'm very proud of our teams as they remain focused on maximizing our businesses to service our customers and meet our stakeholders' expectations. please now turn to slide no. 4.
during this presentation, we will discuss key business takeaways in second-quarter 2021 highlights. we'll provide a business update. we'll go through our second-quarter financial performance and discuss our full-year 2021 outlook. we will conclude with ",".
please now turn to slide 6. our second-quarter results saw a material improvement to the top line when compared to the peak impact of the pandemic in 2q 2020. in foodservice, the segment most acutely impacted by covid-19 in the second quarter of 2020, we saw a healthy recovery with volumes up 33% year over year and within 1% of the second-quarter 2019 levels. in food merchandising, we saw volumes improve by 4%, and they were within 1% of the second quarter of 2019 levels.
the beverage merchandising segment saw a volume improvement of 13%, with volumes now reaching above what we saw in the second quarter of 2019 by 3%. as we had indicated on the last earnings call, despite the volume improvement, ebitda margins were pressured in the quarter due to the impacts of inflation and higher material and logistics costs. we increased prices in q2 to offset some of these cost increases. we will continue to monitor inflation carefully, take further price actions as appropriate.
we anticipate margin recovery through the remainder of 2021 and beyond. we are encouraged by the healthy recovery and continued improvement in volumes and are taking the appropriate steps to navigate the labor shortages, continued escalations in raw material costs, and a possible uncertainty due to the delta variant around covid-19. in the past few weeks, we have also made some important announcements. we have provided our first update and plan of action from our beverage merchandising operational review with the decision to exit the coated groundwood paper business by the end of 2021.
it was a difficult decision, but necessary to help us focus more on our core competency. we also announced the execution of an agreement that will reduce our gross pension liabilities by $950 million. we funded this transaction using existing plan assets. we believe these actions are in the best long-term interest of the company.
please now turn your attention to slide 7. now let's move to q2 2021 highlights. net revenue of $1.352 billion was up 22% from q2 of 2020 as we saw a strong volume recovery from the prior year when we experienced the biggest negative impact from covid-19. net income from continuing operations was $8 million, and earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.05 per share.
adjusted ebitda was $130 million for the quarter, up 2% from q2 of 2020 due to strong volume recovery and better pricing. the quarter was impacted by $11 million from winter storm uri. free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda less capex, was $59 million. finally, our strategic investment program is on track and delivered $14 million of additional annualized adjusted ebitda benefit in the second quarter.
if i could turn your attention to slide 8. turning to our year-to-date highlights, net revenue was up 8% to $2.516 billion due to strong volume recovery and increased pricing. year-to-date adjusted ebitda was $207 million, which includes a $50 million one-time impact from winter storm uri, an estimated $43 million impact from covid-19, and a $16 million impact from a planned cold mill outage. please now turn to slide 10.
as we have previously discussed, pactiv evergreen continues to have many ebitda growth levers that will deliver benefits in 2021 and beyond. we're starting to see the impact from some of these levers as we see strong year-over-year volumes as the economy recovers. we believe that in addition to the economic recovery, the secular themes around sustainability, shift to more online ordering, delivery, and takeout will also help drive our volume growth. we also remain focused on cost-reduction initiatives and optimization, especially in the current environment of higher raw materials and logistics costs.
if i could turn your attention to slide 11. we are continuing on our esg journey and remain focused on initiatives around the planet, products, people, and governance. when it comes to essential metrics like greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water, and waste, we know we can't manage what we don't measure. for that reason, we have identified a best-in-class platform that will allow us to better track these key metrics at all of our 60-plus facilities.
after this robust data-gathering exercise, we plan to be able to set performance targets at both the facility and corporate levels. related to our products pillar, we continue to build the broadest offering of sustainable packaging in the industry, which helps us reach our goal that by 2030, 100% of our products will be made with recycled, recyclable, or renewable materials. our long-standing commitment to the environment and customer choice continued during the second quarter. we launched 13 new product skus, which included first-to-market, tamper-evident french fry cartons and tamper-evident take-out containers, both made of paperboard and support today's growing delivery market.
additionally, we have expanded our meat tray offering with a new version made from recyclable pet. that brings the total number of new items we've introduced to 97 in the last year and a half. diversity, equity, and inclusion is top of mind for pactiv evergreen as it is for a growing number of companies. we have created a new internal dei team and are undergoing a diversity spend analysis of our suppliers.
this will inform our future policy and help us to understand where we can make improvements. finally, we recognize the critical role our board plays in overseeing our esg initiatives. the directors recently formalized their responsibilities as they relate to esg, and we'll continue to receive quarterly updates from our chief sustainability officer. more details on these and other activities may be found at our investors.pactivevergreen.com in the esg section.
if i could turn your attention to slide 12. we shared this slide in the last quarter to provide an overview of our strategy to return to a more profitable pactiv evergreen. as an update, we remain on track to complete our strategic investment program in 2021. we've announced our first steps in the beverage merchandising operational review with the exiting of the coated groundwood business.
we also remain on track with the planning of our next-generation pactiv evergreen waste elimination program. there will be more to come on these programs later in the year. with that, i'll now turn it over to mike ragen for a detailed financial review.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
thanks, mike. moving to slide 14. looking at our second-quarter 2021 financial performance, net revenue was $1.352 billion versus $1.107 billion in the same period last year, an increase of 22%. the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume largely due to higher demand as the economy recovers from the covid-19 pandemic, as well as favorable pricing.
adjusted ebitda was $130 million versus $127 million in the same period last year. the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable pricing, mostly offset by material costs net of higher costs passed through to customers, higher logistics costs, and higher manufacturing costs in our beverage merchandising segment. free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda less capex, was unfavorable to the same period last year due to higher capital expenditures. moving to slide 15.
looking at our year-to-date 2021 financial performance, net revenue was $2.516 billion versus $2.319 billion in the same period last year, an increase of 8%. the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume largely due to the higher demand as the economy recovers from the covid-19 pandemic, as well as favorable pricing. adjusted ebitda was $207 million versus $272 million in the same period last year. the decrease was primarily due to the impact of winter storm uri, the continued impact from covid-19, and incremental costs from a cold mill outage.
free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda less capex, was unfavorable to the same period last year due to lower adjusted ebitda. moving to slide 16 and our results by segment for q2. our foodservice segment saw net revenues up 41% driven by strong volume recovery and higher pricing to recover raw material cost increases. foodservice volumes for the quarter were up 33% on 2020 and within 1% of 2019 volumes.
adjusted ebitda for the segment was up 88% versus same period last year due to strong sales volumes, partially offset by higher logistics costs and higher material costs. our food merchandising segment saw net revenues up 11%, driven by favorable pricing and volume. food merchandising volumes for the quarter were up 4% on 2020 and within 1% of 2019 volumes. the slight decrease in adjusted ebitda was due to higher logistics and manufacturing costs, mostly offset by higher sales volume.
our beverage merchandising segment saw net revenues up 11%, driven by strong volume recovery. adjusted ebitda for the segment was down $23 million versus same period last year. the key drivers being higher manufacturing costs, higher material and logistics costs, and unfavorable pricing and customer mix, partially offset by higher sales volume. moving to slide 17.
here, we estimate the impact of covid-19 and winter storm uri to our business. the year-to-date adjusted ebitda impact of covid-19 was $43 million mostly driven by volume, price, and higher manufacturing costs, most notably in our foodservice and beverage merchandising segments. in q1, winter storm uri impacted our business. the impact was concentrated on our facilities in arkansas and texas, where we incurred higher energy costs and needed to shut down sites quickly, incurring damage in the process.
the year-to-date adjusted ebitda impact is $50 million. we do not expect any further impact. moving to slide 19. looking at our outlook for 2021, the ultimate impact of the covid-19 pandemic to pactiv evergreen remains uncertain.
in our forecast, we have made certain assumptions regarding a second-half recovery of foodservice and beverage merchandising revenues that are dependent upon increased mobility and may not eventuate. we've been neither conservative nor aggressive in these assumptions. we are maintaining our full-year adjusted ebitda guidance at $630 million to $645 million. we expect the volume recovery to continue through the second half of the year with key risks to our forecast being material cost pressures and labor shortages.
we continue to push price to recover these cost increases. thank you for your time. as an appendix to the presentation, we have included q2 year-to-date highlights by segment; q2 and q2 year-to-date revenue and adjusted ebitda bridges versus same period last year; consolidated statements of income loss; a reconciliation of net income loss through adjusted ebitda and free cash flow; and a summary of progress in our strategic investment program. i'll now pass it back to mike king for closing comments.
michael king -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. in closing, the second quarter came in consistent with our expectations and the guidance we provided at the end of q1. as consumers return to pre-pandemic activities, we anticipate continued increases in volume in the second half of 2021. if raw material input costs moderate, our contracted pricing actions will catch up and lead to improved margins.
long term, we remain committed to the plans we have in place to improve our beverage merchandising business. we took an important step by exiting the coated groundwood segment and are very pleased to have byron racki joining our team. across the business, we are intensively focused on increasing productivity, reducing costs, and taking steps to maximize our cash balances. we will monitor closely the rate of inflation and price our products appropriately in the marketplace.
finally, i'm confident that the people of pactiv evergreen will work hard every day to serve our customers and enhance the value of the company to all of our stakeholders. with that, we will now open it up for questions. operator?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from the line of ghansham panjabi with baird. please proceed with your question.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. on the foodservice improvement, which is quite significant in 2q versus the 1q run rate, do you think there was any sort of benefit from inventory restocking as mobility increases and channels get sort of normalized? and then also, was there any prebuy ahead of pretty significant resin cost and ahead of your own price increases? or was that not the case?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
so, hi, ghansham. this is mike ragen. so what i'll tell you is i can't be 100% certain on either of those things. having said that, we have been working hard to service every single customer.
we've been very measured in what we've pushed out because labor challenges continue to be a major problem in plants, and we're working hard on those. and where we would see that, where we would see any prebuy prior to price increases or restocks, we would have held back not because we don't want to fulfill those orders. it's simply because the stress on the whole supply chain, whether it's the inward raw materials all the way through to our own manufacturing, our own inventory levels, etc., etc., plus the tightness of the logistics market, has meant that we've been servicing people to what we think is really they're out the door. and i think a lot of that, we see some of our key customers, we see their out-the-door sales and they're flying as well.
so we're not really seeing that. but i can't be -- i can't say with 100% certainty that there isn't pockets of it.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
got it. and then for my second question, i mean, obviously, $207 million of ebitda for the first half and a pretty significant step-up in the back half. a, can you sort of give us a breakdown between the weighting between 3q and 4q? and then second, what was unfavorable price-cost do you think for 2q? and then what do you think a realistic number is for 3q based on what you know at this point?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah. so the unfavorable price-cost in q2 was around $52 million. so it hit us hard. just taking a step back in terms of the halves, i just want to give a bit of background because i know that this is going to be something that people are going to ask me.
so look, when we did our last forecast, we would have expected a pretty even balance between the two -- the third and the fourth quarter, ok? and you guys can infer from our guidance what those numbers would be. as to our year-to-date numbers, we kind of have come in where we said we'd be. and we would have expected third and fourth quarter to be approximately half each of the remainder of the year. when we did our q1 guidance, we were expecting around -- year on year around $300 million in raw material cost increases due to rates.
that's gone up to $400 million, ok? and as you know, we chase price. we have a circa four-and-a-half-month lag. and so what i'll tell you is, while we've maintained our guidance, mike highlighted some risks and so did i when i talked to the guidance, there's been a push of the ebitda from q3 into q4 to the extent of sort of $40 million to $50 million. so where i would have thought that q3 and q4 would have been the same or similar sort of ebitdas, now there's been a sort of a push of that out into q4.
does that answer your question, ghansham?
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
it does. it does. thank you so much.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of kyle white with deutsche bank. please proceed with your question.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking the question. i wanted to follow up on the price-cost that you just laid out. i guess i'm a little confused if i look at slide 23, the kind of the year-over-year bridge that you have, you have a pricing mix of $50 million and then a material headwind of $70 million.
one, can you break out the parts of the material headwind? how much was driven by kind of lag in the pass-through of resin? and then does that mean mix was roughly a $32 million benefit based on what you just said price-cost was? thanks.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
sorry. so you said that quite quickly, sorry. so slide 23, did you say?
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes. just at the end where you have the -- kind of the bridge on ebitda year over year.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
got it. yeah. so what i'll tell you is the, what i'd call, spread, price/mix, and material, you can see there, that's negative $20 million. and you can also see that there's higher logistics costs of around $17 million and higher manufacturing costs there.
those higher manufacturing and logistics costs are mostly driven by rate. and so when i look at this, that bridge, the price mix, we are pushing price to recover not only the materials but also higher labor costs and higher logistics costs. and so the net debt is really the number that you should really be looking at, not just the price mix versus material because we try to cover off the whole inflation rather than just materials only. does that answer your question, kyle?
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes, that does. that makes sense. i see how you get to the $52 million now on that. could i just follow up? how much of the material was driven by the lag in the pass-through of resin, though?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
it's about -- in terms of the difference there, it's about $30 million.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then my second question, could you just kind of discuss the rationale for exiting the kind of the coated groundwood market? and then what kind of financial implications should we expect from this decision?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. ok. so i'll -- because i'm answering questions at the moment, i'll answer that, and then mike can come in after me. that's sort of a high level.
so in terms of the coated groundwood market, i don't think anyone -- it's no surprise to anyone that magazines are -- have gone down even worse through the pandemic. and so for us, that's meant an obvious reduction in volume and reduction in price, ok? so not to mention that this is in a -- we produce this in a plant where we also produce liquid packaging board, which is our most important product, which goes into our cartons and that we sell on the open market. and in that facility, we have challenges around labor, and we're constantly investing. so first and foremost, there's a financial implication here.
in terms of last year's sort of ebitda numbers, look -- and obviously, with price and volumes changing all the time, i'll just talk to last year. look, it would be probably a positive ebitda benefit of around $10-ish million by closing this down. but more importantly, we're going to be avoiding $15 million to $20 million of capex on a line of product that is in decline, and that's per annum, $15 million to $20 million per annum. it's a dying market.
we don't need to be in it. and oh, by the way, what we can do is we can protect our profitable core business better in the pine bluff mill. we can focus on producing liquid packaging board. we can concentrate the expertise in people in that mill on producing our most profitable product.
so it's very much cash flow positive and also allows us to concentrate more on our core business. mike, do you have anything to add?
michael king -- chief executive officer
no, mike, i think you said it well. i would say summarizing what you said, it's better financially for us on a lot of fronts. but bigger picture, it declutters our mill and lets us get back to the basics.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. sounds good. appreciate all the details.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of anojja shah with bmo capital markets. please proceed with your question.
anojja shah -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. i just wanted to go back to the inflation pressure since it's such a big issue. you managed to hold guidance constant for the full year, as you said, which is quite an achievement given that inflation.
what are the offsetting factors? are you getting help from, i guess, rising paper, rising sbs prices? can you just walk us through the offsets there?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
so it's -- anojja, how are you? it's mike ragen again. it's a bit of a nice fight at the moment [inaudible]. first of all, we're out getting price. that obviously lags.
i think you can obviously see the volume tailwinds that we're getting. we have upped our procurement efforts. our team is working hard to try and find offsets to hold back on inflation where we can. and we continue to drive our strategic investment program to realize savings out of that.
and in all the other programs we have on the go in every single plant. so there's a lot going on. those are the key things that we're doing. i think the price increases are pretty much -- we're just pushing price everywhere that we possibly can.
anojja shah -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you. and i just wanted to go back to that pension transfer that you announced. does that mean -- can you just talk through any financial implications? and does it mean you will no longer have an underfunded position in your pension once it's done?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
so the pension -- at the moment, the pension liability or the net position is -- and this changes on a daily basis, but it's circa 99% funded, ok? so somewhere between 98% and 99%. what we've done is we have effectively transferred both assets and liabilities to an external insurer. there's no detriment to pensioners, but it reduces that risk on our balance sheet. so where we had circa $4.2 billion of liabilities in the past, we now have $1 billion less, round numbers, and we have $1 billion less assets, round numbers.
you can see that there was a -- in the announcement, that there was -- or there will be a profit recognized from that, which would mean that by a small margin, we transferred less assets than liabilities across. i mean, the whole idea of this is as the pension gets more and more funded to reduce the risk to our business, to reduce the risk to future cash flows, and we've taken, let's call it, 25% of our liabilities out. so it's a really good result for us with no detriment to pensioners.
anojja shah -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yes. got it. that's clear. thank you very much.
michael king -- chief executive officer
the only other add, mike, i would say is we didn't use any of our cash to do this. this was all done with assets, just to be clear.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah. that's correct.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of anthony pettinari with citigroup. please proceed with your question.
asher sohnen -- citi -- analyst
hi. this is asher sohnen standing in for anthony. around the time of the ipo, i think there was a view that company ebitda margins could ultimately get back to more historical levels. i think you did around 17% margins in 2016, 2017.
and there's obviously a lot of moving pieces with inflation, covid, and the beverage review. but looking longer term, do you see any structural reason that you can't ultimately get back to the sort of mid- to high-teen ebitda margins? maybe anything structurally changed for either the three businesses?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
i'll answer that, and then mike, you can weigh in as you want. short answer is no. i don't see any -- well, i do see hard work ahead of us, absolutely. but i don't -- i think we can get there.
if i look at our foodservice business over the last couple of years, we were hit by inflation pressures. and we were obviously hit by covid. however, we're continuing to push price. our margins are coming back.
and we would expect to see improvement through all of the various programs we have, most notably the strategic investment program. and so i think we can get back to historical levels there. in terms of food merchandising, food merchandising has historically been above that sort of the average of the business. and so similarly, they should see tailwinds on cost as the strategic investment program rolls in.
and i guess then when we look at the beverage merchandising business, it's been suffering. and it's been suffering for a few reasons. covid has impacted it. we had winter storm uri.
we've had a lot of investment in our mills and downtime associated with that. in terms of getting back to those historical margins, well, you heard me talk about coated groundwood. while negative ebitda margins, we'll lose sales, but ordinarily, that's going to help, right? in terms of if you've got negative ebitda margins as a result of a product in your portfolio and you discontinue it, well, that will be accretive to the margins. and then it comes down to returning the mills to somewhere near to where they've historically run.
so from our perspective, the ongoing business pieces in the beverage merchandising segment, they can absolutely, on a weighted-average basis, get back up to historical levels. so i mean, it's a long-winded way of me going back to my initial point, which is yes, i think we can get back there.
asher sohnen -- citi -- analyst
thanks. that's very helpful. is it just possible to talk about the performance of the first-choice portfolio and your other sustainability products? are they growing faster than company average? and then just from a broader esg perspective, are you seeing any particular consumer preferences within substrates, for example, a faster growth in paper versus plastic or metal?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
ok. in terms --
michael king -- chief executive officer
do you want, mike? yes. i think right now, we're in an environment where people will take any substrate they can get. so it's tough to answer that. there's no preference per se, and we have shifted customers to our more earth choice and environmentally friendly substrates.
but we've actually, if anything, seen an acceptance of any substrate, particularly when you look at our protein tray or meat business or protein businesses where we saw a large transfer to other substrates that we've had to rebirth some of the less earth-friendly assets to meet demand. so it's a difficult way of saying that right now, demand is outpacing, i think, the priority on some of the substrates. and i think it will be that way until inventories and the supply chain pressures reduce.
asher sohnen -- citi -- analyst
thanks. i'll turn it over.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of george staphos with bank of america securities. please proceed with your question.
unknown speaker
hi. this is [inaudible] sitting in on behalf of george today. just looking at your strategic investment program, it appears that there was a bit of a shift in spending from automation to combined digital transformation, supply chain, and cost reduction. what was the main driver behind this?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
so in terms of -- so your question really goes to the total spend on the digital transformation, integrated supply chain, and cost reduction. is that what you're asking, sorry?
unknown speaker
correct. and kind of just the split between those and kind of why there may have been a shift from automation to the others.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah. so i think automation, we've already spent the full program. however, we're continuing on with that. and we'll continue to push automation.
and not only because -- we're doing it more because now we're shifting our focus from pure cost out to we need to service our customers and there's a war for people out there at the moment. we just can't get enough people into plants. so we're going to have to automate positions out. so our automation program continues at pace.
in terms of the digital transformation piece and the integrated supply chain piece, other areas where we're sort of doubling down, we've -- i think it's fair to say on our integrated supply chain piece, we started the journey at -- on a five-level journey, we were probably a one. i would say we're a four. we're continuing to invest. we're continuing to invest in people, into systems.
and we want to get to a five. and so we're continuing to invest there. in terms of digital transformation, we've done a lot, but i would say we can do a lot more. so again, we're continuing to invest there.
so in terms of that shift, numbers on a page may look like we're shifting. like it's almost like we're doubling down, in my opinion, on all of those categories.
michael king -- chief executive officer
the thing i would add, mike, is just you shouldn't think of these things mutually exclusive. digital enablement enables automation. i mean, there's a lot of cross-pollination. it's hard to draw the line.
so we haven't changed the geography of our spend. we may bucket it or label it different, but it is interlinked. digital enablement does enable some of the automation, and there is some cross-pollination. so i wouldn't think -- i wouldn't take any of the bucketing as us backing off one or the other.
and to mike's point, it's actually us leaning in much smarter with cross-pollinated initiatives.
unknown speaker
great. that's helpful. and then i guess just going back to the reduction of the pension liability. will this impact earnings in any way with regards to pension income going away?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah. i think pension income, it's adjusted out of ebitda, but it's obvious a net income benefit at the moment where we're earning money off the assets. so if we have less assets, arguably, we'll earn less off that. but to us, earning money off a pension is not really where we're focused.
what we're focused on is reducing risk and making sure that the pensioners are looked after and reducing the risk of having to pay out large amounts in the future. and to us, that's far more important than the -- almost a noncash profit number that's shown in our p&l for pension income.
unknown speaker
great. thanks.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of sam mcgovern with credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
sam mcgovern -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning. just with regard to the working capital line, when i look year over year, obviously, it's sort of breakeven in the first six months of this year versus a significant use of cash a year ago. how should we look at what that looks like in the back half of this year and what we should expect going forward?
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes, sam, i think like you're a little faint there, but i think what you were talking about was the use of cash in terms of working capital. so let me phrase it up for you. during the first half of this year, we've used cash on working capital because raw materials have run up so much. the dollar value of our inventory has increased substantially due to higher raw material costs.
however, our physical inventory is down. and they've been driven down by a couple of things: number one, being the demand and the snapback; and number two, because of our integrated supply chain program, we've been working toward optimizing our inventory levels. and so what we would expect to see in the second half of the year is as raw materials stabilize, we wouldn't expect to see a use of cash from that. however, our physical inventory levels will probably increase a bit as we get our feet underneath us in our plants and the snapback becomes more normalized.
sam mcgovern -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and hopefully, my audio is a little better now. getting back to ghansham's question earlier about prebuying and sort of the restocking ahead of reopening.
i mean, it sounds like you feel like that really hasn't been the case. i mean, in terms of what you guys are seeing week by week or the conversations you're having with your customer base, i mean, what are they seeing in terms of a return to normal? are they seeing changed consumer behaviors? or is there anything that makes you feel like the business looks different a year or two from now versus what it was pre covid?
michael king -- chief executive officer
i can take a run at that, mike, and then you can fill in.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
ok. good.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, there's certainly some shifting in the consumer. obviously, as mobility increases, i think the buy-in of home delivery and takeout, there's going to be -- all signs point to a new normal. and so the shift in categories for us, there's things we're tracking that you look at people's return to work.
largely, people aren't coming into the office. so the shift from a hot cup of coffee in the morning, like a starbucks or something like that, they're getting up in the middle of the day and getting a cold cup. and so shifts from hot cups to cold cups is something that is putting pressure on the cold cup category or the poly cups. we're seeing that on the takeout side with our takeout to-go containers.
i think of the numbers in the mid-40% of the meals now are in the home but in a takeout or delivery fashion. and that's a big shift. and as those things stick and consumer behavior moderates, who knows what happens two years from now. but what we can say is the pressure it's putting on the supply chain, not just with our customers, but on the manufacturing side, even outside of our business, i'm not sure that the capacities -- until those capacities and those categories catch up, that that pressure goes away.
and so in terms of rebuilds of inventories, i would say it's slim. i don't think anybody is getting out in front of that yet based on our customer discussions. and largely, the snapback specific to categories, i think that's a -- if somebody had a crystal ball, we'd love to see it. but it's, like mike said, a nice light in terms of our ability to address that shift in consumer demand and where the categories that will win and lose end up.
and so when i said sustainability being a focus, the question around where our esg-friendly product set, people are taking any product they can get right now still. and so until that moderates, i think this pressure is here to stay a bit. and we're going to see that pressure on the supply chain. and our customers are feeling it just like we are.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. yeah. i guess congrats on the turnaround in a couple of those businesses there and especially bev merch.
so i just wanted to, i guess, get your -- get an update on your thoughts here. as you kind of now turn the corner here or at least kind of look at the operations a little bit more, would you say that you're well on your way to some of the improvements in bev merch in the mill operations? and then similarly, with foodservice, i guess, maybe you can just characterize as to if there's any specifics that you're looking forward to signal that the business is kind of back to a full recovery. what should we be kind of thinking of in that vein? thanks. 
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. so i'll just say that nobody has declared victory on the beverage merch business within our team here. i think we're still largely in recovery mode and that we've -- while we've done a lot to diagnose the business, we still have a lot to do to bring our mills back to what i consider standard and best practice. and in our food -- it's really a tale of two cities.
so controllable elements of the beverage merch, we feel like we've got a handle on the fundamentals in the business. we've got a handle on, and we've made some decisions around strategic product as we've shared on the coated groundwood. and the teams are focused on the right stuff. so time is our friend and time is our enemy there.
on the food -- in our food businesses, i think it's largely volumes are recovering nicely. if things continue the way we anticipate and we're able to see the input cost and the input supplies moderate, we're well-positioned to see the -- i feel really good about where we are in terms of our ability to perform. and our supply chain engine will function, and we have every reason to win in that space controllably. and certainly, the manageable elements are what we're focused on there.
so controllable elements of the beverage business well into uncontrollable elements of the -- or the manageable elements of our foodservice business are understood and we're tracking. 
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
understood. and just as a follow-up, when you think about price-cost, obviously, you've taken some action here and you continue to take action to offset the inflation. do you usually hold on to those price increases, i guess, when raw materials recede? maybe you can just discuss how we should think about '22, assuming raw materials are stable from here.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
so in terms of whether or not we hold on to price increases, look, most of our business is contracted. and if price goes up -- if raw material goes up, then we follow on price. so essentially, if raw materials go down, prices will go down, but there will be a lag to that, similarly to when the raw materials go up. in terms of where we're not contracted, we would aim to, as most people do, hold on to price if we can.
ultimately, i guess there's going to be pressure on those prices depending on what happens with raw materials. it's a competitive market. we'd expect competitors to -- as materials go down, to take prices down. but we would logically try to hold on to price, but there's no guarantees there.
so next year -- we have been lagging in terms of cost inflation and getting price back. and so there might be a little bit of a tailwind next year. but that all depends on what happens with raw materials.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. thanks.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of andy scheffer with onex credit partners. please proceed with your question.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. in terms of exiting the coated groundwood, can you describe for us what the cash costs might be and then the capex for converting that over to coated carton? and then how does the timing work in terms of you exit by the end of the year? does that mean that you fully converted that line by the end of the year? or is that -- does that go into 2022?
michael king -- chief executive officer
so i'll just speak to the fact that there is no planned conversion. i just want to be clear. this isn't a product shift. this is a takeout of capacity.
i don't want to mis-set the table that this is a shift of our resource or our assets. so there's no strategic element of that. no addition of capacities. i'll let you talk to the numbers, mike.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
in terms of the costs, you know, we recognized in the quarter some costs around severance. it was circa $7 million. and then there will be some capex spend over the next few years that is really around reconfiguring various pieces of the mill. and it will be in the realm of $14 million, $15 million.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
ok. thank you. and then if you could give us any insight in terms of what you're seeing currently on the raw material front in terms of -- or are they leveling off abating, maddeningly holding steady, not going down? just what you're seeing because prices that we as investors may see don't always correlate exactly on the timing front. and any discussion there would be helpful.
michael ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
so at the moment, in terms of raw materials, it's a week-to-week proposition, i'll say. and supply chains are tight. it varies by the type of raw material, whether it's polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene, pet, board. all of those things have different dynamics in the market.
what we are seeing, though, is that material costs are not really abating at the moment. there has been some ups, some downs, but they're not coming off. so without getting into specific substrates, it's a little -- i've sort of got to answer in a very general way like that.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
thank you.

good day and welcome to the pactiv evergreen third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to dhaval patel, senior vice president of ir and strategy.
please go ahead.
dhaval patel -- senior vice president of investor relations and strategy
thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. thank you for your interest in pactiv evergreen, and welcome to our third quarter 2021 earnings call. with me on the call today, we have michael king, chief executive officer; and michael ragen, chief financial officer. before we begin, please visit the events section of the company's investor relations website at www.pactivevergreen.com and access the company's supplemental earnings presentation.
management's remarks today should be heard in tandem with reviewing this presentation. before we begin for our formal remarks, i would like to remind everyone that our discussions today may include forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, you should not put undue reliance on them. these statements are also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.
we refer you -- all of you to our recent sec filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our future operating results and financial condition. lastly, during today's call, we will discuss non-gaap financial measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating our performance. the presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap. and reconciliation to comparable gaap measures are available in our earnings release and the appendix of today's presentation.
with that, let me turn the call over to michael king. mike? 
michael king -- chief executive officer
thank you, dhaval. good morning, everyone, and welcome. yesterday after market closed, pactiv evergreen released its third quarter 2021 results that were broadly in line with the update we provided you on september 8. our quarterly results demonstrated the resiliency of our product and our portfolio.
demand recovery remained on track and total volume improvement was 3% in the quarter. price mix was up 14% in the quarter. in addition to ongoing contractual pass-through of cost increases, we took additional pricing actions across both our contracted and street customers. these pricing actions were necessary because of continued inflationary pressures across not just materials, but also conversion costs and higher rates of transportation.
in addition to pricing actions, we are addressing the labor challenges by continuing to focus on recruiting efforts, and along with retention bonuses and wage increases to address the shortage. we are making continued progress and expect a more normal labor market by late next year. we are also mitigating logistic cost pressures through a more focused approach on optimizing inventories and maximizing lane and truck usage. while ebitda and ebitda margins remain muted in q3, we believe they are on track for recovery over the coming quarters.
please now turn to slide 4. during this presentation, we will discuss key business takeaways and 3q 2021 highlights, provide a business update, go through our third quarter financial performance and discuss our near-term outlook. we will conclude with ",". please now turn to slide 6.
net sales in the quarter were up about 17% due to continued volume recovery and strong price mix. customer and consumer demand remained strong across our end markets with total volume up 3%, as we have discussed before. ebitda margins remain pressured because of the continuation of higher raw material, labor, and supply chain costs. in the face of this inflationary pressure, we remain focused on managing the variables that are in our control.
throughout our manufacturing and supply chains, we remain aggressively focused on productivity and efficiency. in addition to the ongoing contractual pass-through of increased cost, we took additional pricing actions in our portfolio. the combination of these factors contribute to price mix being up 14% across the system for the quarter. we may continue to see significant inflationary pressure in the near term.
if we do, as others expect, we will have to pass through these cost increases through additional pricing as we remain committed to maintaining margins and profitability. while we have made some early strides, there is still some work here to be done. fortunately, i have the team in place to help position the company to manage any challenges while we focus on growth in the future. byron racki has been with us for over two months as the president of the beverage merchandising business and already helping drive a culture of change in urgency.
i'm also happy to tell you that the closure of the coated groundwood business is ahead of schedule, and the majority of the work was completed by october 31st. byron remains focused on improving the pricing and profitability of the business unit while also continuing to lead the business review of beverage merchandising. doug owenby, our new coo, has been with us for a little over six weeks. he's hit the ground running and is focused on improving productivity and reliability, driving new and better standards across the operations.
we will also be focusing on employment retention and automation opportunities. in addition, we announced a number of actions to better position the company for future growth. on september 8, we announced our plans to acquire fabri-kal, and the acquisition was completed on october 1st. i'm excited to have fabri-kal join the team, and welcome them to the pactive evergreen family.
a month into the acquisition, i would like to share that we have internally already laid out our integration strategy. we have begun to execute on that plan and remain on track to deliver synergies. now that we have closed on the transaction and further analyzed the business, we are even more confident and excited about the combined company's breadth of sustainable product offerings, market reach, and the synergies potential. we will provide more information on such transaction in the coming quarters.
in q3, we also announced the pending sale of beverage merchandising's middle east business in order to remain focused on growth in our core business. if i could turn your attention to slide 7. let's move to q3 2021 highlights. net revenue of $1.394 billion was up 17% from q3 of 2020 as we saw continued volume recovery from the prior year and strong price mix improvement of up 14%.
net income from continuing operations was $2 million and earnings per share from continuing now in operations was $0.01. adjusted ebitda was $119 million for the quarter as raw materials and logistics inflation, along with labor challenges continue to impact the pace of the ebitda recovery. free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda less capex, was $51 million. finally, we announced and closed our acquisition of fabri-kal.
turning to slide 8. turning to our year-to-date highlights, net revenue was up 11% to $3.91 billion due to increased pricing and strong volume recovery. year-to-date adjusted ebitda was $326 million, which includes a $50 million one-time impact from winter storm uri. please now turn to page 9.
two years ago, we created a path for the company that included ambitious and measurable esg commitments. this plan built on our long history of supplying sustainable products and developing responsible manufacturing processes. so in 2020, we announced the goal of 100% of our products to be made with recyclable and renewable materials by 2030. this year, we are specifically focused on gathering the internal data and organizing our reporting on operational metrics related to greenhouse gas emissions, energy, water, and waste.
sustainable innovation is a top priority at pactiv evergreen to support our customers' goals and our own. since 2019, the company has introduced over 100 new sustainable products that are specifically designed to also improve customers and our consumers' experience while reducing the post-use impact on the environment. a major part of this effort is a focus on sustainable material research. additionally, our commitment to integrity translates to continued improved communications around sustainable claims for packaging.
this includes systematic, on product labeling for third-party certified compostable products. we believe it will contribute to reinforce trust in our company and our industry. from a manufacturing perspective, we are looking to reduce water and energy consumption. we recently undertook a water stress analysis for all company locations.
the results indicated that 97% of water usage is in areas with low water stress. we continue to strive to reduce our overall water usage. we also initiated greenhouse gas emissions analysis for our paper mills, our largest source of emissions. to identify improvement opportunities, using these learnings will be incorporated into our goal setting exercise.
transparency is how we know we are doing what's right. this summer, we published our first public cdp disclosures on climate change and water security, and we are really planning on releasing the saas meet and gri disclosures in the coming months. more details on these and other activities may be found at investors.pactive.com in the esg section. i will now turn it over to mike ragen for a detailed financial review.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. moving to slide 11, looking at our third quarter 2021 financial performance, net revenue was $1.394 billion versus $1.195 billion in the same period last year, an increase of 17%. the increase was primarily due to favorable pricing from raw material pass-through and price initiatives, along with higher sales volume. adjusted ebitda was $119 million versus $173 million in the same period last year.
the decrease was primarily due to higher raw material and logistics costs and labor challenges constraining production and increasing costs, partially offset by higher sales volume and favorable pricing. free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda less capex, was unfavorable to the same period last year due to lower adjusted ebitda. moving to slide 12. looking at our year-to-date 2021 financial performance, net revenue was $3.91 billion versus $3.514 billion in the same period last year, an increase of 11%.
the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume largely due to higher demand as the economy recovers from the covid-19 pandemic as well as favorable pricing. adjusted ebitda was $326 million versus $445 million in the same period last year. the decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing, the logistics, and material costs, net of price increases, and the impact of winter storm uri. free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda less capex, was unfavorable to the same period last year due to lower adjusted ebitda.
moving to slide 13. this slide helps to bridge q3 year-on-year revenue and ebitda. looking at revenue, when comparing to q3 last year, we saw some volume favorability of $32 million with the key driver of our revenue growth being price increases of $169 million. for adjusted ebitda while volume was marginally favorable, given labor-related production constraints, pricing was favorable by $176 million, but this was more than offset by $231 million of high costs.
it is important to note that in q4, we expect that year on year our increase in price will be approximately in $40 million higher than the increase in cogs, reversing the q3 negative. moving to slide 14 and our results by segment for q3. our foodservice segment saw net revenues up 26%, driven by higher pricing to recover cost increases and steady volume recovery. foodservice volumes for the quarter were up 5% on 2020 and down 7% on 2019 volumes.
demand in foodservice is strong. however, labor constraints are impacting our ability to meet demand. and adjusted ebitda for our segment was down 21% versus same period last year due to higher manufacturing, logistics, and material costs, partially offset by favorable price and higher sales volume. our food merchandising segment saw net revenues up 10%, driven by favorable pricing, partially offset by lower volume.
food merchandising volumes for the quarter were down 6% on 2020 and down 8% of 2019 volumes. as with our foodservice segment, demand is strong. however, labor constraints are impacting our ability to meet demand. adjusted ebitda for the segment was down 32% versus same period last year due to higher cogs and lower sales volumes, partially offset by favorable price.
our beverage merchandising segment saw net revenues up 12%, driven by strong volume recovery. adjusted ebitda for the segment was down $8 million versus same period last year. the key drivers being higher cogs, partially offset by higher sales volume and favorable pricing and customer mix, and additional costs related to tropical storm fred. moving to slide 16.
we are maintaining our full-year adjusted ebitda guidance at $550 million. we are holding this guidance despite the anticipation of the continued inflationary pressures that --and with the expectation that resin prices will remain flat in q4 into q3. all of our segments are seeing strong demand with our ability to meet demand being dependent upon increasing labor levels in our manufacturing facilities. our efforts to increase labor are helping to lift our production output, and we expect to see this improve in q4 and into 2022.
we expect a strong year-on-year lift in our pricing of around $200 million in q4. as mentioned previously, we expect year-on-year price increases to exceed cogs increases by approximately $40 million in q4. also, the integration of fabri-kal is ongoing, and the business review of beverage merchandising remains on track. thank you for your time.
as an appendix to the presentation, and we have also included q3 year-to-date highlights by segment. q3 year-to-date revenue and adjusted ebitda bridges versus same period last year consolidated statements of income and loss, a reconciliation of net income and loss to adjusted ebitda and free cash flow, and a summary of progress in our strategic investment program. i'll now pass it back to mike king for closing comments.
michael king -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. in closing, while the third quarter was in line with our september update, we continue to believe we are in a transitionary environment, and our results do not reflect our true potential. while we still face a number of challenges in the near term, i am confident our team and employees are up to the task and we'll continue to take actions to improve our performance. we continue to believe that if and when raw material input costs moderate, our contracted pricing actions will catch up and lead the improved margins.
in addition, we have closed the acquisition of fabri-kal and began its integration and remain on track on the business review of the beverage merchandising segment. we will provide further updates on these initiatives in the near future. finally, i would like to thank all the pactiv evergreen workforce for their continued hard work to serve our customers and to enhance the value of the company to all of our stakeholders. with that, we will now open it up for your questions.
operator?

operator
[operator instructions] and the first question comes from ghansham panjabi with baird. please go ahead.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
thank you. hey, guys. good morning. i guess, first off on the 3q to 4q sort of ebitda bridge over $100 million, there's a lot going on with fabri-kal, price, costs, volumes, labor shortages, etc.
can you just help us bridge that differential on a sequential basis for us.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
yeah. good morning, ghansham. this is mike ragen. how are you?
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
good. thank you.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
good. so if on slide 13 of the presentation, you would have seen that essentially price is up by -- this is the q3, price is up $176 million. the cogs were up to 231, so negative of 55 there. the expectation is for q4 that price will be up some over $230 million while -- this is year on year while cogs will be up around $190 million.
so there's sort of a $90 million to $100 million swing in the price cogs dynamic between the quarters. and then over and above that, fabri-kal adds about -- it's around $10 million into the quarter. volumes, quarter on quarter no major change. we're expecting you know labor challenges to continue but they're improving.
we're getting better. we're getting more people into the plants but it does take a little bit of time to train them up and make them effective.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
sure. thank for that. and then in terms of food merchandising, the volume declined -- i know you called out labor challenges there but is there some degree of just mean reversion where mobility is boosting food service but coming at the expense of grocery stores, etc., or is it just purely the constraints that you cited there?
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
it's -- so the biggest thing here in food merchandising is, to your point, a little bit of that. and what i'll point to is that egg sales are down versus 2020. they're down 15% to 20%in the quarter. as you know, we're the -- sort of leading packager in egg cartons and so that's a key driver there.
and over and above that, meat trade volumes are down somewhat. both of those surged in the -- in 2020 because more people were eating at home and so there is a bit of a reversion there. most of the other areas are pretty much flat year on year.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
thank you very much.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
no problem.
operator
the next question comes from chris parkinson with mizuho. please go ahead.
chris parkinson -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thank you very much. good morning. you've recently made a few new hires in your team and are still assessing several strategic initiatives or opportunities across both your cost structure as well as the portfolio.
can you simply give us a quick update. what's been potentially a pleasant surprise thus far, what's kind of the incremental opportunity, and -- or potentially there are other things you believe are going to be more challenging? just anything you can give us for '22 or '23 would be appreciated. thank you.
michael king -- chief executive officer
thanks, chris. yeah. so i am -- as i mentioned in the call here, i am been pleasantly surprised with the add to the team. specific to byron racki, the president of our beverage merch business, i think bringing in an experienced guy that knows the paper making and board-making world has been beneficial.
certainly no secret that our mills have been challenged. getting velocity and turning around those mills while we take the time to strategically review our product portfolio, our operations, our footprint, all those things. he's -- brings a lot to the table there and we're already seeing the green shoots from his short tenure. as it relates to operations, getting some velocity, positioning our operations to be world class in terms of digital enablement, automation, things that we see, ongoing headwinds in the markets around labor, our goal there being to insulate ourselves and, frankly, position ourselves to win on the back end of the current supply chain.
doug owenby brings a lot to the table there. as we get fitness around what we're considering a new labor force and a very dynamic labor force, we don't expect that to change. insulating our factories from the variables that come with that and really have an optionality around automation as we're seeing progress in the last kind of two months that as we position the business to win there, doug brings a lot to the table and yeah, i'm excited about that. we've had a handful of others, really all the other adds on the team and visibly and behind the scenes have all been to give velocity, not just on productivity, but really as you started to see our acquisition activity and strategic looks at product mix and positioning the business, not just for a good next 12 months, but a good next five years and beyond has become a focus.
so getting proactive with all elements of the strategies of the business is really i would tell you generally where i've seen progress in the last six months is whether it be how we procure product, position or supply chain, go after strategic and tactical productivity items, and frankly, just get on our front foot with the realities of what -- mother nature and some of the macro/micro economic challenges that face us, those things don't slow down. so having the bandwidth to proactively manage, i can tell you that we're in a better position today than we were six months ago, and that's largely because of the adds and the team i have in place.
chris parkinson -- mizuho securities -- analyst
that's helpful color. and just as a quick follow up, can you just give us, let's say, two points on volume trends for each segment as we head into 2022 and then hopefully your improving ability to meet that demand's post '21 supply chain disruptions and labor headwind? just any color on that would be very helpful. thank you.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
mike.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah, mike, you want to do that or are you -- i'm happy to either way.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
yeah, up to you, mike.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah, go ahead and i'll fill in ok.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
ok, sure. i think in foodservice, we've continued to see strong volumes around containers and as the economy opens up and people start to get back to work, we're seeing strong demand in cups as well. and that ties closely to the sort of noncommercial sector opening up again, things like schools and universities and ballparks and things like that. so we're seeing strong demand there.
in food merchandising, i mentioned before that protein and egg sales are down a little bit, which is the inverse of the foodservice trends. but with -- overall, we'll expect to see ones normalize but everything else should continue to be strong. and then in beverage merchandising we're seeing school milk come back, which is great to see. that drives both our cotton sales and our external board sales.
and as food service cuts come back, paper cups specifically, we see better board sales as well, not to mention that we're also seeing for [inaudible] we're seeing some stronger demand there as well. so that would more or less summarize by segment what we're seeing.
chris parkinson -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
next question comes from george staphos with bank of america. please go ahead.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks. hi, guys. good morning. thanks for taking my questions.
hope you're doing well and thanks for the details. i wanted to first hit a little bit on operations. and segue to fabri-kal, so mike and mike, can you talk a little bit about how you will and how we should try to observe and measure your ability to improve on the labor situation? i think you'd said you hope it normalizes, and you're not alone here so we're not blaming you guys by any stretch, by later in 2022. and i noticed that, mike, you said -- mike ragen that fabri-kal will be roughly about $10 million in ebitda in the quarter.
i seem to remember that the ltm for fabri-kal when you announced the deal was somewhere in the mid-50s. so maybe that's just operating friction when you're first bringing in the business but is there any labor issue there that also needs to be normalized for fabri-kal looking out to 2022?
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. so i'll give you color on labor and then i'll let mike talk to the fabri-kal question in terms of earnings. so fabri-kal is and no different -- they're faced with the same challenges as i think everybody who's in manufacturing in the country right now, so we didn't get a larger-than-expected surprise on labor. what i can tell you is that the green shoots we're seeing headed into q4 and the progress we're making, adding humans to both businesses is positive.
we're not seeing a regression in terms of labor. we're seeing it go the other way. i think what you heard me say on the call, and i certainly welcome more clarity as we move into 2022, but you know it doesn't feel like the controllable elements aside, it doesn't feel like things are going to slow down in a meaningful way. and even if they did in terms of unemployment and bringing people back to manufacturing jobs, i think we're all chasing the curve still.
our modeling and what we see based on the progress here headed in q4, we do anticipate getting whole in 2022. when that is whether it's q3 or q4, that -- there's a lot of things we don't control that will dictate that.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
what do you think your labor inflation might look like here on year '22 versus '21, including -- if you normalize for fabri-kal, obviously.
michael king -- chief executive officer
well there's two, so that's a tough one but i'll take a run at it. we've added a lot of labor inflation in-year, frankly. so we've taken a lot of that pain this year. in a normal year, i think our labor inflation is between 2% and 3%.
and we're going to be order of magnitude twice, maybe three times that if you added two -- the 2021 moves we've made and what we need to do to position ourselves to keep humans in 2022.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
yeah, george. i'll just weigh in a little bit on that to give you -- and mike directionally is right. dependent on where we are in the country depending on which plant 7% to 10% is what we're expecting year-on-year increase in labor.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
makes sense. and that's -- i appreciate that. i just wanted to hit one more question on growth then i'll turn it over. so i wouldn't have expected you to continue at the fantastic growth that you saw -- obviously, comps were easier in 2q for food service where you're over 30%.
this quarter you're up, i think the volume was 5%. are there any things in your view that would trouble you about the 5%? are you happy with that? are you seeing any signs that the pricing that you need to put into the market, we totally understand, is having any kind of demand destruction in your business or not? relatedly, mike and mike, can you tell us where the cup and led business is versus 2019. you're obviously up a lot versus last year. and if you could give us any kind of view on plastic versus fiber based in food service.
is there one sector that's growing paper versus plastic more than the other? and if you could quantify that, that would be great. thanks. i'll turn over and have a great quarter.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks, george. so on the pricing or the commercial elements of demand, we can sell every container and cup and item we can make. so the pricing action we've had to take isn't curb demand. we're constraining our demand through our ability to make product at the moment and we're moderating that based on keeping stable inventory.
so truthfully it's -- demand's not the concern. the concern is making sure we're positioned to meet and recover inventories and demand heading into the next qs. go ahead.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
george, versus 2019, our cup-led volumes were about 9% down in the quarter. and most of that is driven by fiber cups, and that's a lot to do with the number of people that are going to work and picking up a coffee on the way to work. we'll start to see that sort of pick up a little bit, we think, in the near future but plastic cups are very strong.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
all right. thanks, guys. i'll turn it over.

the next question comes from adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone. so i guess my first question is thinking about this price cost balance in the third quarter and then kind of flip that you're expecting to -- it's a positive in the fourth quarter.  in 3q, you talked about cogs being $231 million year-on-year headwind. can you break that down a little bit into whether the pure raw materials, supply chain, logistics, kind of where can help us think about the different buckets of that cogs inflation, how you would think about that tracking in the fourth quarter?
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
so pure raw materials are around $180 million of that and then the only remaining piece is -- of $50 million is higher, manufacturing and logistics costs.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and how would that look in 4q?
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
in 4q, it's -- hang on a sec. it's mostly materials year on year.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
and why would the supply chain logistics on a year-on-year basis not be a headwind? i'm just making sure i'm clear on that.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
it's because in the last year we had a mill outage in our canton, north carolina facility. and so year-on-year, those costs won't repeat.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok and then just a clarifying point on guidance, i believe when you had -- when you announced fabri-kal in early september and you've taken the full-year guidance to $550 million, at that time the $550 million i didn't believe actually included any contribution from fabri-kal because it hasn't closed yet. now obviously the $550 million does. i just wanted to make sure that's true and if so, just make sure we're clear just -- is it just more raw material pressure and labor constraints that are in the fourth quarter that are offsetting the incremental fabri-kal earnings?
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
yeah, it does include fabri-kal. as i mentioned before, it's circa $10 million for fabri-kal. and so we're maintaining our $550 million number. and we'd like to be better than that but we're just sticking with the $550 million.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and then if i could just squeeze one more. the -- if you look at the labor constraints and the impact that it's had on on your volumes, any way to quantify or frame what you think that cost on a volume basis in 3q and how much of that is still costing you in 4q from a production perspective?
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
it's a little bit. how long's a piece of string really. i think we know that the demand is there, we know that our customers want more product, we know that other people out in the market don't -- other customers or potential customers are coming to us asking for product, particularly in food service. and in food service, could we see 10% higher, maybe.
it's -- it would be a guess.
ok. all right. i appreciate the color. i'll pass it along.
thanks.
operator
the next question comes from mark wilde with bank of montreal. please go ahead.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thanks and good morning. mike and mike, i wonder -- first of all, can you give us any help in just thinking about sort of the magnitude of the pricing initiatives that have been announced over beverage merchandising and board and paper and how you would see that kind of cadencing in over the next few quarters?
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
so what i can tell you is that year on year, we're expecting pricing in the beverage merchandising segment to be around $30 million favorable in q4. and so we -- what we've been out pushing price whether it's -- we've obviously got a lot of contracts in place around the [inaudible] that we've been taking out of market price increases and pushing those as hard as we possibly can. so quarter-on-quarter q4 versus q3, we're expecting around $60 million of higher pricing in that segment.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then how should we think about what it is yet to come over the next couple of quarters when we factor in lags? and also i think you guys were out with more price increases just earlier this week.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think in coming quarters we'll continue to see you know the full effect of the -- of our increases. i think year on year if i was looking forward to 2022, i'd expect price to be up over $100 million in that set.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. all right. then weren't -- just the kind of broader one for both you and mike king, and i'm just curious about what you're actually seeing on the ground there in terms of customer pressure to move out of plastics and other substrates. we hear about all of this potential movement yet a couple of weeks ago one of your competitors announced that they had picked up a big piece of qsr business that was moving from paper into plastics.
so just curious kind of across your portfolio how much pressure you're really seeing on plastic packaging.
michael king -- chief executive officer
i think -- so i'll take this. i think we're seeing a -- i don't want to call it a pause but i do see that we're seeing people or customers more interested in getting containers and packaging today given demand. so some of the pressures on, for example, foam -- gingerly foam containers, things that we're trending out of service and we're seeing that kind of rebound and we've had to bring assets back to life, so to speak, to meet demand or try to meet demand. i don't think we're seeing a big reversion to non-green or non-environmentally friendly substrates but we certainly are seeing people an acceptance of alternatives to get the -- to meet demand.
i think that if you just look at the regulatory environment, there's been no slowdown there. so we've you know we've had things -- we've had to make some moves to different substrates to address that too so to keep it balanced. i'd say it's slowed but i don't think it's gone away and we certainly expect that those pressures continue albeit they're a bit curved at the moment being outpaced by the desire for volume. and as -- if i take the example you gave there, there's still a victory speech on the environmentally front with the move that was made there.
so fiber versus the plastic, it's -- they're both kind of in the same category if you dig into that one. so that one -- those moves are happening and we're benefiting from those moves as well.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
i've just -- mark, i'll just add one small thing. there is one area that we are seeing a push from retailers and that's really around [inaudible] moving out of moving out of foam into molded fiber and [inaudible].
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and the last one i had was on just i understand that you've just gone through a pretty big capital cycle at the pactiv evergreen. i'm just curious with these tight labor markets and the real escalation in labor costs, does it suggest that there -- you may need to take yet another step up in terms of capital for plant automation, things like that.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah that's a really good question and in fact one of the areas where, as i mentioned, we dug on the -- we are taking a bit of a different look there, certainly insulating our factories from the dynamics in the labor force but also just really positioning our factories to be more efficient. we are we are looking harder at automation for sure. so if you look at their capital intensity that we've had, we had a large a large portion of our strategic investment program has been around automation. and you can expect that we do look harder at that moving forward.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok, very good. i'll turn it over. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. i guess i just wanted to go through the guidance a little bit. so assuming the midpoint -- assuming $550 milllion for the year, that implies kind of a $224 million number for q4.
if i take off $10 million from fabri-kal, we're still at $214 million, which is up about $100 million from the q3 number. so how are you thinking about that 100 sequential improvement? is that kind of food service getting closer to about $100 million itself. i think you did that number in q2 of 19 excuse me and then maybe a doubling of bev merch to the $30 million or $35 million level. and that again would imply kind of you know closer to $100 million number for food merch, which is a doubling.
so just it seems quite a large magnitude of an increase sequentially. so maybe you can just help us understand that bridge a little bit. thanks.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. thanks, arun.  so if you think about each of the segments, i'll give you a steer on that. foodservice will be over $100 million and add a lot -- and again a lot of that is driven by the higher pricing and net of some cogs increase. food merchandising, i'm expecting that to be in the set -- like somewhere between $65 million and $75 million.
and then beverage merchandising is a large lift between $50 million and $60 million. and so why the big lift? it's predominantly price increases and price actions, partially offset by higher cogs in that segment. so it's a decent lift in that segment but a lot of those price actions are contractual and we're fully expecting that segment to hit their numbers.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for that. and as a follow up, maybe we can just kind of extend that into '22. so given that you're going to be exiting the year at, say, a $225 million run rate and then mayb you assume a little bit more synergy capture, maybe some progress on restructuring, and price cost, is $225 million kind of the right quarterly run rate that we should think about from here on and improvements to that and that would kind of imply a kind of a longer term $900 million annualized ebitda level? is that kind of what you're headed toward or already there? or is -- is there something specific that jumps the q4 number above that level?
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
yeah, there's a bit of a tailwind in q4. so no, i wouldn't just multiply by four. but getting to a normalized number, you -- we'll see margins starting to get back to normal in q4 and -- but there is a bit of a margin tailwind in that quarter that won't -- isn't necessarily indicative of ongoing.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and then just lastly, if i could. on bev merch you laid out some of the issues that you were facing there in the past within the mills and noted that maybe progress needed to be made in each of the eight stages in the production process. could you provide an update on where you stand maybe in that that evolution? thanks.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. so yeah, just -- for those who maybe refresh -- we look at our mills as kind of eight or nine sub-factories. each one of those sub-factories has had faced need for efficiency and productivity gains and reliability gains. i would tell you that we have made progress in all phases of those sub -factories.
we've also faced some challenges with flooding and lagging effects of a winter storm. so those things have hampered some of those sub-factories but i can tell you from a from a decluttering of our focus exiting the covered ground wood business in pine bluff that shutting that complex down has been beneficial. we've been able to displace humans into open positions and fully staff the mill. that's been a big win for us.
and then in canton, recovering from the floods that we had in q3 as well as being able to address some of the reliability, the break-fix type items, we've gotten after the spending that's why some of the excitement you'll hear in our voices around q4 there. we're seeing better days, so we have made progress on all fronts and we have a lot to do still and and we'll keep doing that. but we've made we've made progress despite some of the challenges in each one of those kind of sub-factories.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks.
operator
the next question comes from kyle white with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking the questions. i wanted to follow up on arun's first question but i ask you in a little bit different way. the fourth quarter outlook implies kind of an increase of $54 million year over year on ebitda.
your price cost is expected to be up $40 million. and then you have fabri-kal of $10 million coming in. that makes up almost entirely of the increase. i guess why shouldn't we see a stronger fourth quarter than the outlook implies considering expected volume growth? is it just some conservatism in the guide or is volume contribution expected to be kind of impacted by the supply chain environment?
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
yeah, that's that's correct. the supply chain challenges will mute volume at least that's what we forecast. we're pushing to produce as much as we possibly can but we do expect -- the challenges are there. they're there today.
we're one month into the quarter already and there's still way -- but it is getting better.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. thanks. and then on price cost, as you look to 2022, a lot of moving parts considering you should be catching up on resin and you have some paper board price increases rolling through. are you able to give us a sense as to what you expect price cost to be next year in total either using the kind of current pricing environment or however you want to phrase it?
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
yeah, we are expecting -- i think we talked about this. i think it was when we revised guidance. we were expecting to have a little bit of a tailwind into 2022 because pricing lags probably $50 million to $60 million.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
perfect. i'll turn it over now. thanks.
operator
the next question comes from andy scheffer with onex credit partners. please go ahead.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. can you give us an expectation on capex for the fourth quarter?
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
what i can tell you for the full year will be between $275 million and $285 million.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
ok. and then as it relates to the labor inflation that you were discussing earlier, 7% to 10%. is that in total and should we think about that as it's a 7% to 10% increase on a, call it, 95% of full staff?
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
yeah. that's the pure inflation. as we add people in, we get additional output. so that gets factored into the cogs, the marginal increase in cogs.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
and then the [inaudible] beverage, what will the cash proceeds be for that?
michael king -- chief executive officer
i'm sorry. what did you say?
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
the joint venture that you're selling, the beverage packaging business in the middle east. what will the cash proceeds be for that?
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
it's $40 million to $50 million.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
and then can you sort of walk us through the labor issues just in terms of how the journey's been and where you stand now and and describe for us how we get to that normalization in the third and fourth quarter? just in terms of magnitude of headcount and what you think the drivers are and maybe what's maybe working for you in terms of success and bringing people back.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
sure. we're short probably 1,500 people in our plants. our total population of people is around 15,000, so circa 10%. it's -- in terms of what you do to get that back, we have -- what, like i guess swat teams that go round to each plant, they deep dive the data.
they go through to work out what the issues are with getting people in that particular area. they come up with detailed solutions, detailed tracking, and then go through an execution phase, onboarding, training, and then embedding people into the plant. now it's not a one and done thing. it's something that we have to do.
it's an ongoing process because people leave all the time. someone opens a new amazon facility down the road or someone else reacts to what we're doing, so it's a bit of a knife fight and it's different in every single area.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
and then is there. is there any overriding reason that that's the one thing that you see in the press is it? there's no good explanation as to or maybe it's not maybe it's that there's not a one size fits all but you know what has been driving it and what's caused it to last so long.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
i'd be speculating.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah, the recipe is different everywhere. i mean that's why what works in one region isn't working in other regions. so there's a host of ways to address it. we know it's bigger than just wages and money, so there's definitely a work-life balance element.
so being flexible with peoples had to be a big part of our recipe for success. retaining people -- getting people is one thing, retaining them is the other. so don't want to overlook the fact that curbing vacancy is one thing but curbing people walking out after you invest in training. so having retention elements in our approach has been a win for us in all areas but people -- there's a work-life balance element that we can't overlook when it comes to making it a place people want to work.
and manufacturing versus other sectors, i think, are particularly pressured in that regard.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
ok. and then my last question is you were discussing answering some questions regarding the fourth quarter. and i just want to make sure what i took away was accurate. volumes will still be up but they will be up less obviously because of labor, raw materials, sourcing, and then whatnot.
and that it's the increased costs, in addition, is offsetting some of that volume increase. it's not that the supply chain and other issues are creating a situation where volumes will not increase. they're just not increasing at the same rate, one. and then there's added cost pressure that's continuing.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah, that's correct.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
thank you.

[operator instructions] the next question is a follow up from george staphos with bank of america. please go ahead.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking the follow-ons. i'll try to be quick about it. first of all, we showed good progress on sap both in the quarter and the year.
as we look out to '22 will you keep updating us on sap? how are you going to continue to communicate the productivity and the return on the investments that you're making relative to what you've said in the past. that's question number one. my question number two, recognizing that you're catching up now on price cost, which of your resins are still the most problematic in terms of obtaining supply for us so that for your converting operations? and then last question i just want to come back to the growth of plastic versus paper recognizing, as you pointed out, with that qsr example you can have a plastic package that is as as sustainable as a paper based one but what are you seeing in aggregate in your portfolio? year-on-year growth either in the quarter or year to date, plastic versus paper and if there are any highlights that you would point to. i think prior, you're just talking to the cups piece.
thanks guys, and good luck in the quarter.
michael ragen -- chief financial officer
i think, george, in -- with regard to sip, you can see that in the update that we have in the sort of revenue generating areas at the top of the table, we've most of the money there. and so we're almost through that automation. we're going to continue to do that. where we're not doing so much of the spend is in the areas that are a lower payback around cost reduction at the bottom of the table.
in terms of keeping updated i think what we'd like to do is to now incorporate this into our ongoing -- just our ongoing way of life right. we're going to have capex. we're going to be looking at capex from the point of view of what's profit generating and what's maintenance. and then talking about that moving forward and well obviously there's some trailing benefits to come but that's probably the way the best way for us to talk about this because we'll get into mixed and interspersed with new investments next year.
in terms of resin supply, at the moment in terms of supply itself, nothing for us is really overly problematic. we get issues here and there. price is more our issue right now. occasionally you get you know something like last week getting benzene to one of the big converters was -- the conversion sites to polystyrene was a problem in this set and the other.
but overall, it's not as big an issue. and then in terms of the paper piece. year on year obviously we're seeing our patents in beverage merchandising coming back in schools. so that's positive.
in terms -- i talked about the drink containers but also a lot of the -- there's a lot of growth in other containers like food containers in paper as well but no more so than what we're seeing in plastic. and in fact, plastic is -- continues to be more favorable when carrying food or hot food in particular. and then in things like meat trays and egg cartons and things like that, egg cartons we are seeing a trend toward fiber. meat trays, we're not really seeing much going out of plastics.
and any other sort of containers that are in supermarkets, i think plastics is still leading so we're not seeing trends away from that at the moment.

mr. patel, you may begin. 
dhaval patel -- senior vice president of investor relations and strategy
thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. thank you for your interest in pactiv evergreen, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. with me on the call today, we have michael king, chief executive officer, and michael ragen, chief financial officer. before we begin, please visit the events section of the company's investor relations website at www.pactivevergreen.com and access the company's supplemental earnings presentation.

mike? 
mike king -- chief executive officer
thank you, dhaval. good morning, everyone, and welcome. yesterday, after market closed, pactiv evergreen released its fourth quarter 2021 results. we finished 2021 with momentum across all of our business segments, achieving 30% year-over-year revenue growth in the q.
this included a 23% improvement in price/mix due to contractual cost pass-through and pricing actions that partially offset inflationary pressure in materials, conversion, and transportation costs. we were able to deliver a quarterly adjusted ebitda of $205 million. this is our highest level as a public company. that said, due to the continued labor constraints impacting our industry that worsened in the fourth quarter due to omicron-related absenteeism, our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results remain below the revised full year fiscal 2021 adjusted ebitda target we provided in september.
while these industry challenges will likely continue for several quarters, the company remains committed to strengthening our innovation pipeline, increasing productivity and exceeding our valued customers' expectations. i am proud of our employees, their perseverance and the sequential progress we've delivered over the past few quarters. we have taken a number of steps to stabilize, strengthen and better position the company for long term, but our work is not done. i will go through this later in more detail.
but first, i wanted to turn it over to mike regan to walk us through the financials for the fourth quarter.
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
thanks, mike. moving to slide 6 and touching on our q4 2021 highlights. we are encouraged by what we see in our q4 results. net revenue was $1.527 billion, up 30% from prior year.
net income was $34 million, up 89% on prior year, and adjusted ebitda was $205 million, up 21% on prior year and 72% on q3 2021. moving to slide 7. for full year 2021, net revenue was $5.437 billion, up 16% on prior year. net income was $33 million.
and adjusted ebitda was $531 million, down 14% on prior year. moving to slide 9 and a deeper discussion of our q4 2021 performance. net revenue was $1.527 billion versus $1.175 billion in the same period last year, an increase of 30%. the increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, primarily due to higher material costs passed through to customers across all segments as well as a benefit from the foodservice segment acquisition of fabri-kal on october 1, 2021, partially offset by slight declines due to lower volumes as well as the impact of a disposition in the first quarter of 2021.
adjusted ebitda was $205 million versus $170 million in the same period last year, an increase of 21%. the increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, partially offset by higher material, logistics and manufacturing costs. free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda, less capex, was $122 million versus $95 million in the same period last year, driven by higher adjusted ebitda. moving to slide 10.
looking at our full year 2021 financial performance, net revenue was $5.437 billion versus $4.689 billion in 2020, an increase of 16%. the increase was attributable to favorable pricing, principally due to higher material costs passed through to customers within the foodservice and food merchandising segments, as well as higher sales volume within the foodservice and beverage merchandising segments, largely due to higher demand as markets continue to recover from the covid-19 pandemic. in addition, the foodservice segment's acquisition of fabri-kal on october 1, 2021 contributed $106 million of higher sales for the year ended december 31, 2021, as compared to prior year. adjusted ebitda was $531 million versus $615 million in the same period last year.
the decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing, logistics, and material costs, net of higher cost pass-through to customers. these decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume. adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31, 2021 included $50 million of additional costs incurred related to the impact of winter storm uri. free cash flow, defined as adjusted ebitda less capex, was unfavorable to 2020, primarily due to lower adjusted ebitda.
moving to slide 11. this slide helps to bridge q4 year-on-year revenue and adjusted ebitda. looking at revenue, when compared to q4 last year, the key drivers of our revenue growth were price/mix of 265 and $96 million from the acquisition of fabri-kal, net of the disposition. for adjusted ebitda, price/mix favorability more than offset higher costs, while the benefit of the fabri-kal acquisition added $9 million.
moving to slide 12 and our results by segment for q4. our foodservice segment saw net revenues up 57%, driven by higher pricing to recover cogs increases as well as the impact from the acquisition of fabri-kal and higher sales volume. foodservice volumes for the quarter were up 19%, including the fabri-kal acquisition and up 4% organically on 2020, and up 3% on 2019, including the fabri-kal acquisition, or down 11% on an organic basis. adjusted ebitda for the segment was up 46% versus same period last year, primarily due to favorable pricing and the impact from the acquisition of fabri-kal, partially offset by higher material and manufacturing costs.
our food merchandising segment saw net revenues up 17%, driven by favorable pricing, primarily due to higher material costs passed through to customers, partially offset by lower sales volume, primarily due to labor shortages. food merchandising volumes for the quarter were down 7% on 2020 and down 2% on 2019 volumes. adjusted ebitda for the segment was up 5% versus same period last year due primarily to favorable pricing, partially offset by higher material and manufacturing costs, as well as lower sales volume. our beverage merchandising segment saw net revenues up 13%, driven by favorable pricing, primarily due to higher material costs pass-through to customers, higher sales volume due to the market recovery from the covid-19 pandemic, and favorable product mix.
beverage merchandising volumes for the quarter were up 3% on 2020, but down 7% on 2019. adjusted ebitda for the segment was up 25% versus same period last year, primarily driven by favorable pricing, lower manufacturing costs, and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher material and logistics costs. i'll now pass it back to mike king for further comments.
mike king -- chief executive officer
thanks, mike. now if you'll turn to page 14. while we have faced a number of challenges in market volatility during this time, we do believe we have made steady progress over the past 12 months. we have taken additional pricing actions to help offset inflationary pressures.
we have started to stabilize the performance of our paper mills, and we've made progress on our strategic review of our beverage merchandising segment, including the completion of our exit from the coated groundwood business. we also announced the sale of our 50% interest in naturepak beverage packaging as well as our carton packaging and filling machines business in china, korea and taiwan, as we focus on growth in north america. the proceeds from the sales will also lower our net debt and leverage ratios. we acquired fabri-kal and are making steady progress on integrating the business and unlocking growth synergies.
we announced a second pension lift out that significantly reduces our pension obligations. please turn to slide 15. we also continue to make progress on our esg goals. as a paper manufacturer and converter, we believe that supporting sustainable forestry is critical to our long-term success.
one way we do this is by procuring fiber from third-party certified sources. in 2021, 32% of our fiber was purchased from these certified sources, up from 30% in 2020. all pactiv evergreen facilities follow the sustainability metrics benchmarking the company introduced last year, including the recently acquired fabri-kal facility. in addition to providing sustainable products, we believe that we must also support organizations that educate consumers about recycling and composting and provide opportunities for consumers to recycle or compost our products.
we are proud to collaborate with our industry partners on these important initiatives and celebrate each milestone. for example, as a result of these initiatives, paper cups are now accepted for recycling in atlanta, georgia, detroit, michigan, and madison, wisconsin. further, as we make progress on our esg journey, we actively report on our activities through a variety of value disclosures. we already started to see improvements in our esg ratings, notably from cdp and sustainalytics in the fourth quarter, and we invite shareholders to view our disclosures and other reports found in our investors.pactiveevergreen.com site in the esg section.
most importantly, as you'll see on the slide, in 2021 our safety record improved. pactiv evergreen's overall injury rates ranked more than 2.5x better than industry averages. more specifically, total case rates were down 19% compared to 2020 and lost time, restricted time case rates were down 24% during the same period. in addition to our employees' physical safety, pactiv evergreen values our employees.
overall, while being in the fourth quarter, the company introduced an enhanced paid time-off benefit for our u.s.-based salaried employees. we believe this improved benefit will drive our people-centric culture by providing our employees increased flexibility and by empowering employees to prioritize mental and personal well-being. now if you could turn to slide 16. we are providing our fiscal year 2022 adjusted ebitda guidance of $705 million.
this guidance assumes continued pricing actions as needed to offset continued inflationary pressures. the guidance also takes into account the continued labor challenges, which we expect to persist in the first half of 2022 before improving in the second half. we expect volume recovery to be more muted as our business segments face tougher comps and we focus on rebuilding inventories to improve service and reliability. our forecast includes a full year contribution from the fabri-kal acquisition and accounts for scheduled mill outages in the second half of this year.
at this time, i would like to thank all of the pactiv evergreen workforce for their commitment and continued hard work to serve our customers and enhance the value of the company for all of our stakeholders. we remain focused on continuing to improve our production capabilities and service our customers to the best of our ability. with that, let's take your questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of chris parkinson with mizuho. please proceed with your questions.
chris parkinson -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thank you so much for taking my questions. mike, i'd say the first one is just taking a step back from everything that's going on. given the management changes, the strategy evolution over the past few quarters, as well as the general op initiatives, especially the mills, how would you just broadly grade your efforts thus far? and how should you expect your investors expect this to further evolve over '22 in terms of potential benefits? thank you.
mike king -- chief executive officer
yeah. so a lot there. thanks, chris. we -- so given the circumstances and the things that we all have faced in this industry, i think we grade ourselves fairly well.
setting some of those circumstances aside and getting to the controllable elements of our business, i'm very pleased with the team that i'm building and the velocity that we're getting, especially as we exit q4, in early days here in q1 of 2022. so our strategy, both micro and macro within the business is working. and i think if you just look at the q4 results and the challenges in the prior qs, we're starting to see our plans take traction. and that's broadly across all three of our segments.
chris parkinson -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thank you. and just a quick follow-up. just given all the inflationary pressures the business is facing in terms of the raw material basket and even labor, can you just highlight just your expectations for the cadence throughout the year? you had a few comments on slide 16.
but if you could further dig down and just offer some additional color as well as how we should think about non-pass-through pricing efforts? thank you.
mike king -- chief executive officer
yeah, just generally speaking, pass-through or non-pass through, we've taken a pretty aggressive stance in terms of making sure we're staying on the right side of the rising inflationary pressures we're getting. the cadence will be as it has to be. and so we continue to take aggressive steps on both the raws, also just broadly with the kind of this inflationary environment, the open dialogues both ways, i would just say, we've gotten a lot of support. the customer base is very aware and living the same challenges we are.
so i think all the way to the store shelves, we're going to continue to see that. and i think you can expect us to stay aligned, if not somewhat ahead of that pace through 2022 and beyond.
chris parkinson -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ghansham panjabi with baird. please proceed with your question.
ghansham panjabi -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. so i guess, first off, in terms of the bridge between '21 and '22 in terms of ebitda, can you just give us some high-level parameters? what are you baking in terms of volumes by segment? you had $130 million unfavorable price cost in 2021.
what does that look like for '22? and then the impact from the mill outages, can you just sort of disaggregate that relative to the variance of the -- which is from uri impact of $50 million from '21?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah. good morning, ghansham. this is mike ragen. so in terms of volumes for next year or for this year actually, what we'd expect to see is some growth.
obviously, foodservice will have the benefit of the fabri-kal acquisition, and we expect to see growth in both foodservice and food merchandising. and so the impact from volume there should be quite substantial in both of those segments. in terms of beverage merchandising, because we closed the coated groundwood complex and we're just going to -- and also we're just rebuilding our inventories there, there won't be much volume effect year on year. i just want to note though that one of the things that we are doing in terms of volume is we've got to rebuild our inventory so that we can continue to service our customers.
so with what you would expect to see may not be exactly the way that it comes through in our financials. so we want to build inventory so that we service our key customers. and so the volume recovery might not be as high in both of the food segments as you'd expect. but it will be reasonably substantial.
and -- but a lot of the additional production that we're going to be pumping out is going to into inventories. so in terms of pure dollars or pure numbers, i think foodservice will be up because of fabri-kal, probably around 10%, food merchandising up a couple of percent.
ghansham panjabi -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
ok. great. and then on the food merchandising segment, i mean, this is -- you've called out labor issues specific to that segment over the last, at least over the last quarter as well. is there something unique about the construct of that business that's more labor-intensive than the other two segments? any insight there? and then also, as it relates to maybe out-of-stocks for that segment, has it already peaked? and are we on the flip side of that? or how should we think about the recovery curve specific to that segment?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah. it's not unique in terms of the labor issues. however, there's been a couple of things there that was -- it was mostly driven by labor issues in some of the dedicated plants for food merchandising plants. we're spread very much across the u.s., but some of our plants on the east coast have been hit a lot harder than others.
and so it just -- that's just sort of the way the cards fell. and so in terms of getting labor into those plants, the labor thing was really around getting full-time workers in, but also the various regions that the food merchandising plants were in were just hit harder by omicron all at once. so there was a lot of absenteeism and that was problematic for us. and so it just -- as i said, it was just kind of why the cards fell there with those plants.
mike king -- chief executive officer
the other thing i would say is we are seeing the same progress we've seen in the other segments. we're seeing the same improvement. so it's not more exposed just to mike's point was really around where imicron really was dense at that period.
ghansham panjabi -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of george staphos with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning. thanks for all the details. just piggybacking on ghansham's question, mike, if you mentioned it, i apologize, i missed it, but can you parse out some of the bigger bridge items to the ebitda, 705 from the 531 this year.
fabri-kal, what do you expect that to add $40 million, plus or minus, do you recover the price cost negative this past year, which is $130 million? and if you've mentioned what the outage cost was, i missed again, what do those items look like going from 531 to 705. that's question number one. question number two, what is your goal for net leverage by the end of '22? within that, what cash flow, true free cash flow do you generate that you can apply to deleveraging after dividends, after taxes, after interest? thank you.
mike king -- chief executive officer
yeah. sure. no worries, george, and good morning. so in terms of the benefit from fabri-kal, it's about $50 million in that bridge.
ok? in terms of the price cost dynamic, we're expecting to see costs continue to go up. and we have, but we do think that we do get on top of the pricing and we have already as you saw in q4. so there's probably a $50 million benefit from that price cost dynamic. now obviously, there's a lot going in the world at the moment, some things that.
what i'll tell you also with regards to -- there are some increases in our sg&a and other that probably weren't factored into anyone's bridges. just some things like transition services arrangement income and things like that, some bonus, resetting the bonus and the long-term incentives there that do drag on the forecasted earnings there. and so -- and then the remainder being higher volume in the business. so -- and like i said, george, we're not going to sell through all of the additional volume that we're manufacturing this year because we want to get back to normalized service levels and to continue to be the best part that we can to our key customers.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. so that drag, what would it be? and again, the outages, what would it cost if you had mentioned it before, i apologize, but i didn't hear it in your response there, mike.
mike king -- chief executive officer
the drag probably around $40 million.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
40.
mike king -- chief executive officer
yeah.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. and the outages?
mike king -- chief executive officer
the outages, net debt outages will probably increase costs this year of about 10.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. thank you. and on the leverage and cash flow.
mike king -- chief executive officer
so the leverage we're expecting to be somewhere between five and five and a half times by the end of the year. and then in terms of cash flow, it really all depends on what happens with working capital. we are looking to -- we have -- in terms of pure numbers, the ebitda we've talked about. capex, we're probably expecting to be somewhere between -- somewhere similar to this year, maybe a little higher, between 280 and 310.
and then in terms of working capital, if we continue to increase our working capital, if that could be a cash outflow of up to $100 million, now we can sell that inventory through. but i just want to call that out that we are looking to build inventories again to get back to service levels. so we do think -- and over and above that, we do have the asset divestitures that the beverage merchandising asia and middle east divestitures that we've announced, which should bring in substantial cash flow if they close. 
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you, michael.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mark wilde with bank of montreal. please proceed with your question.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
good morning, michael and michael. i wondered just to start off, could you give us some sense, mike ragen, of what the year-over-year benefit will be from all of these increases that are out there in bleached board and uncoated paper pricing?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah. look, i think in terms of the beverage merchandising segment, we're expecting just pure pricing to go up over $100 million in that segment.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
all right. and how would you expect that to roll in through the year? do you have any sense of that?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
it will be reasonably consistent through the year. a lot of the announcements have already been put through, maybe a little lighter in q1 than the other three quarters.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then over on the labor issues, i'm just curious, mike king, whether you -- whether you expect these to persist for some time? and also, whether it's just changing how you're thinking about work processes and investment in automation in those businesses?
mike king -- chief executive officer
yeah. we're absolutely focused on doing two things. so the world has changed a lot in the last couple of years. and the virtual work opportunity people have today versus manufacturing jobs is something we're addressing and how we bring people to work and we retain them.
and we're seeing that shift in, we'll call it, the manufacturing culture take hold. and we're retaining people and doing things that i think are table stakes now versus maybe historic manufacturing employment environment. outside of that, absolutely, you hit it on the head. automation has been a core focus of ours through our strategic investment program, historic kind of creamy.
but i would tell you that we are looking at every way that we can insulate the business from that absenteeism dynamic that we continue to face.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. just finally on the labor...
mike king -- chief executive officer
all three segments as well. that's not...
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
and mike, i'm just curious, with all the labor issues, it seems like all companies are seeing more turnover. and can you just talk about how that's affected productivity? i mean you have a lot of people cycling through. you've got people who are new to jobs. any idea what that's done to just productivity for you?
mike king -- chief executive officer
yeah. i would tell you the biggest challenge we have is adapting to change, which is coming fast in for us, whether it be weather events, whether it be new waves or variants and the pandemic. all those things are what are contributing to, we'll call it slower than desired momentum on our major initiatives. and i think we had an estimate of last year's impact of well over $150 million in terms of our ability to get after productivity and really get out in front of the mills, specifically in the business.
this year and really into q1, we did get caught up on labor. we think the retention element is a dynamic battle that will continue to have to address through retention programs and sign-ons and things like that. but to pin down a number, it's really -- it's squishy, and it's definitely real. but i'd say that we're most hampered in our ability to manage and adapt to change quickly versus execute the projects.
what should have taken in the quarter last year, it took us three quarters for instance.
mark wilde -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
ok. very good. i'll turn it over. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. and i guess just following up on this line of questioning, you guys have definitely gone through a lot of difficulties and changing dynamics over the last couple of years. if i recall back around the time of the ipo, we were modeling kind of an $830 to $850 million number on ebitda for '22.
if you were to think about now the guidance being in the $700 million or so slightly above that range, that's maybe 130, 150 delta. so is that the right thinking? and if you -- and if it is, maybe could you help us kind of understand maybe some major buckets of that say, $100 million plus? is it maybe resin, say $50 million or so, then the impacts from some of the labor and other issues that you called out and then maybe the beverage merchandising also another $50 million. so equally split between those? or how do you kind of think about the delta of where you are now versus where you thought you'd be, say a couple of years ago?
mike king -- chief executive officer
yes. i think the biggest -- i'll start with the biggest and work my way backwards. so the largest variance really is around the beverage merchandising segment. and essentially, the mill performance, we would have expected to be some $70 million to $80 million better than where it is today.
so that was where we would have expect it to be. and it's just taking a whole lot longer than expected to recover that operational performance. and then over and above that, the inflation, the operational performance of the business and these labor challenges over -- and also we would have expected that we would have seen a greater recovery from covid, that makes up the remainder there. when we were modeling the -- back at the ipo time, we would have expected covid to be done and dusted in early 2021.
well, we all know that the lag on that it's been up and down and the effect has been far greater. initially, the effect for us was really around foodservice volumes and some school mill issues and things like that, but the effect has really been much larger in terms of the workforce, in terms of absenteeism, the amount of time that has gone on between what we would have expected and what has actually happened around covid.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. and i guess just as a follow-up then, do you see a path, i guess, to getting back to those levels? where would you say that we are on, say, bevmerch? and then the other areas, it does seem that some of those could be potentially addressed through pricing and obvious -- and then maybe some moderation in inflation would help too. but is there a path back to those levels over the next two years?
mike king -- chief executive officer
absolutely. so certainly, those levels and the changes in our business have to come into account as i look at this, but we got divestitures, we've got some -- we've executed the closure of coated groundwood. so the world has changed a little bit. we've acquired fabri-kal.
so you got to take those things into account. but absolutely, in terms of all the things you just rattled off and more inclusive of our own internal initiatives, it's not unreasonable to expect us to be back at those levels.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. yes. thank you. good morning, everyone.
mike king -- chief executive officer
good morning.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
so i guess a bunch of questions following up on some of the earlier discussions on the 2022 guidance bridge. maybe first, as we think about volumes across food merchandising and foodservice, labor kind of -- my understanding was caused some volume loss, especially in the second half of '21. you couldn't -- did not have the people to actually run your plants full and sell what you wanted to sell. do we take that -- how do we think about that from a comp perspective in '22? is that the point just we might be building inventory as opposed to -- actually as opposed to actually increasing our sales volume, just feeling that there's some pretty easy volume comps, especially in the food merchandising business in the second half that doesn't seem to be reflected in the guidance?
mike king -- chief executive officer
yeah. in terms of the guidance, i'll start with food merchandising. we're expecting to see growth in food merchandising in a number of areas. in 2021, obviously, there was some labor challenges and we expect to be on top of those.
there's growth expected in certain pieces of that business. in 2021, we're in an area that were lower than historically and even lower than pre-covid. so we'd expect to see that come back. and we also are expecting to see conversions away from cartons that we don't produce into molded fiber and clear pet head cartons that we do produce.
and so -- and then in that segment as well, our mexican business continues to grow strongly as does our protein trade business. so we do expect to see good volume growth in food merchandising. in foodservice, the key for us there, obviously, we've got the year-on-year benefit from fabri-kal. but the key for us in foodservice is to ensure that we can service our large food service distribution customers so that they can win in the market.
and that's where we want to build our inventory somewhat. and then we'll be selling through all of that volume as we get later in the year. so there is a little bit of a take a step back to move forward. it's best for the long term of the business.
but within 2022, you won't see the benefit of that large growth in volume. and we have actually strategically exited a couple of customers just to make sure that we are servicing our key customers as best as we possibly can. 
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then just a couple of clarifying questions. so first, the volume pressures -- the labor challenges related to omicron in the fourth quarter, is it reasonable to assume that those would have persisted in january and might be coloring some of your more guarded comments on labor for the first half? and then does the guidance assume that you've divested the asian beverage packaging and filling business? or still assume a full year contribution from that in the 705? 
mike king -- chief executive officer
so the 705 does assume that we have divested both of those beverage merchandising businesses throughout the year. and in terms of the labor impacts through q1, as with any sort of data out there, you can see the number of cases in terms of omicron, they've come down. and we've seen early on in january there was a massive spike and there was absenteeism. but we're getting back to sort of normalized levels now.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thank you. i'll pass it on.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of kyle white with deutsche bank. please proceed with your question.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks for taking the question. you made a number of divestments and exited the coated groundwood recently, the business there.
do you still have more to go in terms of assets that you view as noncore? or do you think you have the portfolio where you want it now? and then kind of relatedly, is the strategic review still ongoing?
mike king -- chief executive officer
so just in line with what i've shared historically on this is we are -- we continue to evaluate the beverage merchant. and truthfully, we've tried to be as transparent and as i mentioned before, it's going to be an iterative process. so as we've kind of arrived at intersections where we can make the decisions and be very open, we continue to plan to do that. i would tell you, we're still very heavily engaged in the review process that's going to be ongoing.
by no means do we have any other decisions to share at this point. but yeah, i would just say largely similar to 2021 activities is ongoing and we'll be open about decisions as they come forward.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. great. and then on the inventories, understanding the rationale to try to build up inventory so you can better service some of your key customers longer term. but are you able to give us a sense of, one, when do you expect to reach your target levels? and are you trying to get back to pre-pandemic levels? or do you expect to still run a little bit leaner relative to pre-pandemic?
mike king -- chief executive officer
so we're targeting kind of getting healthy on inventories across all the segments in q3, late q3-ish. and yeah, so no, i don't believe we will target a pre-pandemic inventory levels in all cases. certainly, as you look at buy-ins and consumer buying trends, we need to move with some of those. and so in some cases, we'll look to raise inventories.
and in other cases we'll look to optimize and reduce. the other thing i just want to say because it continues to come up is service levels are a huge piece of the need to rebuild inventories. but the other side of that is we have to take cost out of the system. and so if you can imagine the efficiency of our trucking and transportation costs, not having the right level of inventory, not being able to fully cube trucks is a big deal.
and so improving our efficiency on transportation, which is when you look at one of the biggest inflationary levers impacting the business, no secret there. and so servicing customers, but taking cost out of the system for everybody is a part of that strategy as well. and so it's not just the right thing for our customers. it's the right thing for the overall business as well.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. thank you for the details. i'll hand it over.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of anthony pettinari with citigroup. please proceed with your question.
bryan burgmeier -- citi -- analyst
hi. this is actually bryan burgmeier sitting in for anthony. is it possible to say what level of contribution you expect from the strategic investment program in 2022? i think around the time of the ipo you were looking for maybe a $50 million contribution in '22. is that still reasonable? and is that included in the price cost guidance that you gave earlier?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
i think -- well, what we'll see is that for what we've spent, we'll see the remaining piece just play itself out. so in terms of -- we're sort of moving away from being focused on that because we spent most of those categories. we're moving into other spends. we're doubling down on automation and those sorts of things.
but in terms of the plan itself, i think we would expect to see some residual benefits probably in the $30 million, $40 million amount that flow in through 2022. frankly though, bryan, we've sort of been looking at all of our capex, not just specific to the strategic investment program because we have new investments in 2022 that we'll see benefit then. and so the benefits from capex are sort of all on together. i even gone through and said, this one was part of this program and this one was part of another one.
mike king -- chief executive officer
yes. and so largely, we're shifting and we kind of rounded out strategic investment program as discussed previously in 2021. and so as we talk about automation, we talk about digital enablement, we talk about reactive capacities. those are the things in the areas that we have to focus on to insulate our business from not just the labor challenges, but improve our ability to manage change.
and so that's the shift you'll see. we'll see much more benefit on a run rate basis from the prior sip. the last phase of the sip, if you recall, was a much -- it was a longer-term run rate payback. so automation programs with longer tails and we're kind of rounding that out now.
bryan burgmeier -- citi -- analyst
got it. thanks for that. and just on the capex number, i think around time of the ipo, you were looking like $250 million for '22. obviously, you've done fabri-kal, so it's going to go up a little bit.
you're looking for north of $300 million this year. is it still reasonable to think maybe 50% of that goes toward growth and productivity projects and 50% toward maintenance? any detail you can provide there would be great.
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. i think as a rough split, that's a reasonable number, like 50-50.
mike king -- chief executive officer
the other thing i would say that normalized $250 level, i think, is also reasonable as well. i mean, our spend is elevated currently if you look at the work we're doing in our mills on the maintenance side and the reliability side. so i don't think that's indicative of normal, just to reiterate that.
bryan burgmeier -- citi -- analyst
yeah. makes sense. so i'll turn it over. thanks a lot.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of andrew scheffer with onex credit partners. please proceed with your question.
andrew scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. can you inform us what you're seeing on the labor front that informs your expectations that labor will improve in the second half of the year?
mike king -- chief executive officer
yeah. so we've got several kpis we look at, and it's site to site. so it's a very integrated view of the world for us, and it's different region to region. but the key things we look at are vacancy rates, retention rates and the curves, both proactive and reactive metrics to tell us that we're getting on the right side of it.
and we've been making progress since kind of late summer with some ebbs and flows linked to known spikes, weather events, you name it, and the data shows that we're winning. we're not shedding humans. we're gaining humans in that facilities and we're retaining them. so both those metrics are what give us confidence.
andrew scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
ok. and then on the asset sales, remind us what the expected net after tax and fee proceeds will be if those sales both go through?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yeah. around $330 million.
andrew scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
ok. and then just on the mill outage, can you remind us which ones and what the timing is in which particular quarters? and is it roughly 50-50 split?
mike king -- chief executive officer

thank you. ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning is a follow-up from the line of george staphos with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, guys. i'll try to make it quick. so following on bryan's question, if we think about productivity for pactiv on an ongoing basis, how much can you get at on an annual basis without applying much capital, just best practices and the like? and how much would require further capital investment? is there a way to quantify that? that's question number one. question number two, as we think about 1q and trying to have some loose guardrails around it, what would you offer to us? should we just simply take last year and add back storm uri? how would you have us sort of begin to model that? and then for mike king.
mike, you're the relative newcomer, so to speak. how do you think about the dividend overall in terms of value return and capital allocation? why do you see it important? is it important? obviously, the company has got a lot of other things that can generate more return. how do you view the dividend? thank you, guys. good luck in the quarter. 
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
ok, george. so i think first, this is mike ragen. i'm going to answer. and in terms of the dividend right now, like when i look at this, with our current share price, we're running at a circa 4% dividend yield.
and to me that's pretty damn good. and so it may well be that it's not the dividend or the share price issue. but anyway, i quite like to look at that, particularly what we spend off in q4 for adjusted ebitda and the way that we've restructured our balance sheet, our gearing in terms of -- as we sort of blow forward the ebitda and then over and above that, our maturity profile on our debt looks kind of good. but in terms of the benefit that -- or the uplift in terms of output that we can get at without investing capital, we have multiple manufacturing platforms just so it's not one size fit all.
but look, if we can get an extra 5% out of our assets, sweat the asset somewhat, i would say that's a go-get for us. and i think it's something that we can do. and can we get more? well, i think i'll hand that over to mike king, but he's sort of coming in and from what i'm hearing from him, he thinks we can get more.
mike king -- chief executive officer
so you're hearing us taper optimism here. but yes, so look, there's certainly value to unlock without having to spend a bunch of capital. reality is there's enough choppiness in the network right now that we talked about earlier. it's all about momentum, being able to focus on waste elimination and keep an eye on profitable growth as well as manage inventory growth.
those are the priorities and resources we've got. is there a $100 million worth of opportunity in the system? we think there is. it's all about philosophy, which we believe we can get that on top of rebuilding inventories, keeping people coming through the door. and that's really it.
so with stability, absolutely are confident in that number. the pace at which we can get after that and manage through the change is the real dynamic we're managing for.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
and any thoughts on 1q? thanks, guys.
mike king -- chief executive officer
george, in terms of q1, i think q1 for us is generally a lower quarter demand. to me, in q1 we should be upwards over $150 million. you can look at the impact of winter storm uri. i think this time last year demand wasn't as strong as well.
but i think, let's say $140 million to $160 million, i'll give you that spend in q1.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's fantastic, guys. thank you. good luck in the quarter. i appreciate all the time.
mike king -- chief executive officer
thank you.

please go ahead.
dhaval patel -- senior vice president of investor relations and strategy
thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. thank you for your interest in pactiv evergreen, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. with me on the call today we have michael king, chief executive officer; and michael ragen, chief financial officer. before we begin, please visit the events section of the company's investor relations website at www.pactivevergreen.com.

mike? 
mike king -- chief executive officer
thanks, dhaval. good morning, everyone, and welcome. yesterday after the market close, pactiv evergreen released its first quarter 2022 results i'm pleased to report that we have started the year building off the momentum we saw late last year and realized strong year-over-year performance in the quarter. revenues were up due to strong pricing while adjusted ebitda benefited from the strong pricing, net of higher cost as well as the benefit from the fabri-kal acquisition and the benefit from winter storm uri and the scheduled cold mill outage, which did not reoccur this year.
in general, we are seeing more stability in our mill and converting operations and improved profitability in the business which is helping us start the year well. it is also helping us to demonstrate our ability to deleverage the business as our ltm net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio improved from 7.6 times at the end of 2021 to 6.2 times at the end of the first quarter and remains on track to be in the low-5s by year end as we stated in the last quarter. let me now turn it over to mike ragen to walk us through some more detailed financials for our first quarter. mike?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
thanks, mike. moving to slide 6 and touching on our q1 2022 highlights. we are encouraged by what we see in our q1 results, this following a strong q4 2021. net revenue was $1.495 billion, up 28% on prior year.
net income was $43 million, with diluted eps $0.24. and adjusted ebitda was $182 million, up 136% on prior year. moving to slide 8 and a deeper discussion of our q1 2022 performance. net revenue was $1.495 billion versus $1.164 billion in the same period last year, an increase of 28%.
the increase primarily related to higher material costs passed through to customers and pricing actions, plus the acquisition of fabri-kal. volume was down 5%, primarily due to labor challenges and our exit of the coated groundwood paper business. adjusted ebitda was $182 million versus $77 million in the same period last year, an increase of 136%. the increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, the benefit from winter storm uri and scheduled cold mill outage costs in q1 2021 that did not recur and the impact of the fabri-kal acquisition, partially offset by higher material, logistics, and manufacturing costs.
free cash flow, defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capex, was $70 million versus negative $51 million in the same period last year. please note that we have updated how we define and discuss free cash flow. we now define it as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capex versus previously defining it as adjusted ebitda less capex. we believe the new definition is a more accurate proxy for our cash generation activities and is a definition that more closely aligns with our peers.
moving to slide 9. this slide helps to bridge q1 year-on-year revenue and adjusted ebitda. looking at revenue, when compared to q1 last year, the key drivers of our revenue growth were price/mix of $304 million and $93 million from the acquisition of fabri-kal, net of a disposition, offset by lower volume. for adjusted ebitda, price/mix favorability more than offset higher costs.
also, benefit of the fabri-kal acquisition added $22 million. moving to slide 10 and our results by segment for q1. our foodservice segment saw net revenues up 54%, driven by higher pricing to recover cogs increases, as well as the impact from the acquisition of fabri-kal. adjusted ebitda for the segment was up 90% versus the same period last year, primarily due to favorable pricing and the impact from the acquisition of fabri-kal, partially offset by higher material, manufacturing, and logistics costs.
our food merchandising segment saw net revenues up 18%, driven by favorable pricing, primarily due to higher material costs passed through to customers and pricing actions, partially offset by lower sales volume, primarily due to labor shortages. adjusted ebitda for the segment was up 9% versus the same period last year due primarily to favorable pricing, partially offset by higher material and manufacturing costs, lower sales volume and logistics costs. our beverage merchandising segment saw net revenues up 13%, driven by favorable pricing, primarily due to pricing actions and higher material costs passed through to customers and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower sales volume due to our exit from the coated groundwood business. adjusted ebitda for the segment was $24 million versus negative $32 million in 2021.
the key drivers were higher pricing, the benefit related to $34 million of winter storm uri costs, and $16 million of scheduled cold mill outage costs in q1 2021 that did not recur, partially offset by higher material, manufacturing, and logistics costs. i'll now pass it back to mike king for further comments.
mike king -- chief executive officer
thanks, mike. if i could have you please turn to slide 12, i'll provide a brief update on our esg progress before my closing remarks. when it comes to environmental, social, and governance initiatives, we continue to make progress on our journey. a highlight from the first quarter was our participation in the launch of mcdonald's new circular clear cups sourced from equal parts of post-consumer recycled and biobased materials.
what's particularly exciting is that the bio-based material is crafted in part from mcdonald's used cooking oil. these cups, currently being trialed in 28 mcdonald's stores in georgia, can also be recycled along with other polypropylene items. in addition, an important highlight to mention is that we undertook an analysis of our climate-related risks and opportunities as well as examined scenarios to test our resilience in the face of physical and transitional risks. we expect this work will form the basis of future climate-related reports and other disclosures that we make.
to learn more, we invite shareholders to view our disclosures and other reports found at investors.pactivevergreen.com in the esg section. now please turn to slide 13. while we're off to a good start for 2022, we are maintaining our adjusted ebitda guidance of $705 million at this time. we are seeing conditions in the labor markets start to improve and believe we remain on track to see those challenges moderate in the second half of 2022.
at the height of our labor challenge, we had an over 10% vacancy rate across our enterprise, but believe we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. the next challenge we are working on is training up all of our new staff. and again, we are making good progress and believe we are on track to see the labor no longer be a drag on the business; again, all by the second half of 2022. we are also seeing continued progress on our mill operations and reliability in general for our operations across the enterprise, but there also remains broad challenges and uncertainty in the market.
global energy prices have been significantly volatile due to the conflict in europe. while we have no direct operational impact from the conflict, the volatility in the global energy markets can impact our raw materials, energy, and logistics costs. the general inflationary pressures also remain elevated, so we believe it is more prudent to maintain our guidance at $705 million for the full year. at this time, i'd like to thank all of the pactiv evergreen workforce for their commitment and continued hard work to serve our customers and enhance the value of the company for all of our stakeholders.
we remain focused on continuing to improve our production capabilities and service our customers to the best of our ability. with that, let us take your questions. operator?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] the first question is from ghansham panjabi with baird. please go ahead.
ghansham panjabi -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everybody. michael, as you zoom out on the foodservice segment the last couple of quarters, q4 up 4% and then down a little bit in the first quarter. was there any impact from prebuys as customers try to adjust to resin variability during the quarter? i guess i'm just trying to understand why that segment declined with relatively easy comps from a year ago first quarter.
mike king -- chief executive officer
yes. good question. so i think we were open as we -- actually q4 and earlier as well, our goal is to also reestablish service levels and inventory. our -- i wouldn't say that we've seen any demand changes.
so to answer your question, no, our customers would buy just about every unit we make still. so the decline you see in our foodservice segment specifically was really around our strategy to reestablish inventories on our c, d, and e items as well as we had a slow start to q1 with omicron. so our ability to service that january and up until late february was slowed by our own ability to deliver.
ghansham panjabi -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
gotcha. and then for my second question, in terms of your embedded resin assumptions for the rest of the year, obviously, there's a big spike in energy cost, natural gas is starting to blow out to the upside in the u.s. as well, and that's clearly a raw material for resin, both of them are. just curious as to what your specific guidance is embedding at this point.
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. it's mike ragen here. so we've assumed continued increases in resin as forecast in the curves. and also at the moment, there are a number of force majeure events that we're seeing as well.
and this is one of the reasons why our guidance is -- we haven't raised the guidance given the uncertainty around the resin markets, just to give you a feel for -- through the end of the year, what we're expecting to see in overall cogs. our year-on-year cogs increase, just pure inflation, will be over -- last year's cogs was around $4.9 billion, $5 billion. will be up over 10%, 12% in aggregate cogs. and that's changed since we did our plan substantially.
so it's gone up by a couple of hundred million dollars, which is why we're very cautious about the back end of the year and that forecast. so our assumptions are to continue to trail up as per all of the various forecasts that are out there, but we're also a little bit more pessimistic than what the forecast would say.
ghansham panjabi -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
very clear. thank you. yeah.
operator
the next question is from chris parkinson with mizuho. go ahead.
chris parkinson -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thank you so much. you've made a very conscientious effort to improve the operations of various assets throughout your portfolio, including the mills. and it feels that our effort has really taken hold, especially over the last six to nine months, including some new managers.
can you just give us a quick update on your, let's say, near, intermediate, and perhaps even longer-term thoughts of those efforts and how do you assess your current performance?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. so we completely agree. i'd say, the horizon you gave, over the last six to nine months, we have started to see a shift in a few things at all of our operations. not just our mills have seen the benefit of us being able to fill more of our hourly workforce.
and so i think i had mentioned that during the height of the labor challenges we were seeing near 10%, if not just a little over 10% vacancy rate. taking new approaches to get those seats filled has been a big help. i think year on year across our enterprise, our oe, our throughput rates have seen double-digit improvement, and that's allowed us to start to reestablish inventories and service levels. the strong demand helped pull through some of that.
but at the same time, we've been able to be in a position for the first time in a long time to moderate how we want to -- we're not shipping everything we make anymore. we're reestablishing health, and i expect that to continue. we've seen -- q1 has been indicative of the same results, both in our mills and in our converting operations. and that fitness is benefiting our warehouse and distribution networks as well.
and so that part -- the controllable part, so to speak, of our operations is on track and that plan is coming together. and some of the results, while we're going to talk a lot about our price/cost dynamic. that's also enabled by just what you mentioned there and our ability to get after it in our operations.
chris parkinson -- mizuho securities -- analyst
that's very helpful. and just as a quick follow-up. can you just give us a quick update on the fabri-kal acquisition, how that's going versus the original plan? and just given all the moving parts since the deal's closed, what the rough ebit contribution would be for this year versus, let's say, your initial assessment? just any broad color would be greatly appreciated. thank you.
mike king -- chief executive officer
i'll give a couple comments, and then i'll let mike give you the numbers. we're very -- we continue to be very pleased with our ability to get after synergies. and that integration of that fabri-kal business, i would say, we're ahead of plan and have continued to find new ways to create values in both our historic pactiv evergreen businesses as well as in the fabri-kal business. so, i would say, generally, we're very pleased.
i'll let mike speak to the numbers.
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
chris, it's mike here. so the -- yes, i would just reiterate what mike said, we're going a lot faster. we'd expected the synergies to run over three to four years, and we're hoping to have most of them done within two. in terms of what the contribution this year will be, we would expect, somewhere between $60 million to $70 million for the full year.
so we are really getting after the original synergies and we're looking to build on top of those as well.
chris parkinson -- mizuho securities -- analyst
thank you, as always.
operator
the next question is from arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. yes. i guess i just wanted to revisit the guidance.
so a very nice beat in foodservice, so congrats on that. and looks like the pricing is really taking hold there. i understand that bev merch maybe still a work in progress. but is it possible that your guidance is just conservative? i understand that the resin prices are still somewhat uncertain, and we do see some increases for q2.
but does it also assume that you give back some pricing as you move through the year? or i guess, are you building in some conservatism when you think about the full-year outlook? and could it actually be better than what you're thinking?
mike king -- chief executive officer
i would say, we certainly are optimistic that it could be a little better. i would tell you that when we look at the uncertainty around oil and resin, the history is our teacher. mike had mentioned the other several force majeures are already created some choppiness, if you will, in the supply chain of our major raw materials. that's -- i would say it's us being realistic and not conservative.
secondly, the global supply chain currently is very choppy, whether it's capital projects or machine purchases or imports on materials, both from an inflationary and the cost and timing perspective, it's certainly something that we've got to keep our eye on. and i would say, more back-half related for us. it's just q2, i would say, we feel we have pretty good visibility, and i would say, are very optimistic similar to this q, but it's the back half of this year where the things i just mentioned are why we're maintaining our guidance. we've said all along...
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
on bev merch, is there a possibility that bev merch gets into the $30 million-plus range, i guess, with the work that you've completed in the mills and maybe some recovery on reopening?
mike king -- chief executive officer
well, i missed the front end of your question. i'm sorry.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i was just saying, do you think that bev merch could get into the $30 million-plus range on ebitda per quarter given a lot of the work that you've completed and some of the progress within the mills?
mike king -- chief executive officer
yes. i don't think that -- i'll let mike ragen speak to the quarterly run rate, but $30 million a q i think is within reach for sure.
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. arun, i think that $30 million a quarter absolutely is within reach or beverage merchandising. and obviously, there can be large costs with mill outages that swing that around quarter-on-quarter. but on average, $30 million is -- we would, in the future, be hoping for a lot more than that.
but this year, that's a reasonable run rate. i think just talking to and following on to what mike said, i'd said to the earlier question from ghansham that between when we did our budget or plan for this year, our cogs have increased a couple of hundred million dollars in terms of the full year forecast. so you talk about pricing coming down, we don't expect that. obviously, the market will do what it's going to do, but we've got to go and get another couple of hundred million dollars in pricing to cover that.
so we see it the other way that with costs going up, we've got to go and get after price even more so than what we have. we saw the good results in the quarter, and we are doing that. but we -- as inflation keeps ticking up, we have to keep chasing this. so that's where a lot of the risk is.
over and above that, with interest rates going up and all of these other different things going on in markets, demand may soften. so we're just looking at the full year in a pragmatic way. we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, even though we had a good q1.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks.
operator
the next question is from george staphos with bank of america. please go ahead.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the quarter. and a couple of things, too. one, it's a busy earnings day.
really appreciate you keeping the remarks short. putting the release out last night helps the analyst. and congratulations on changing the fcf format as well to be in line with everybody else. my question is, guys, one, can you give us a bit more on the mcdonald's cup, number one? number two, as you are restricting to some degree, your shipments to rebuild inventories, which is what you said last quarter, so that's not a change, is that helping you at all in terms of being able to get more pricing, which you need, obviously, given the inflation? and then lastly, as we look at the 2q, i'm not trying to go too much quarter by quarter, but i guess i am to some degree, you're up against some tougher comps in foodservice versus last year as i recall.
what's the outlook for volume growth for the foodservice segment in 2q?
mike king -- chief executive officer
i'll jump on the mcdonald's cup here. it's one of many streams we've got going from an innovation standpoint where we're partnering with our customers. certainly, as we look for new ways to be sustainable to do -- to be a leader in the space of social responsibility. it's just one of the many things we've got going.
specific to that, it was a collaboration really between mcdonald's and our technical teams to bring something forward that no one had done really before using a circular approach. so we are excited to do it. we are optimistic that the 28 locations that are currently selling those cups expands to something bigger. and i think it's indicative of what you should expect from us in the future in terms of bringing interesting, new, and innovative, sustainable approaches to the market.
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
ok. and with regard to your other two questions there, george, in terms of restricting shipments and helping price, that's certainly not our intent at all. for us, it's all around getting service back to the levels -- the historical levels that our key customers expect of us and continuing to maintain those. and we are seeing good progress in that regard.
in terms of the tougher comps for q2, in terms of foodservice, we would say that we will be up year on year in q2 when backing out the effect of fabri-kal 1% or 2%. essentially, we have restored the inventory levels to where we want them to be for foodservice. and so we would expect a normal flow of inventory out in foodservice. so we don't see any issues with q2 year-on-year comps in terms of expected growth.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, michael. turn it over.
operator
the next question is from adam samuelson with goldman sachs. please go ahead.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah. thank you. good morning, everyone. i guess the first question is around the food merchandising outlook.
i'm just trying to get a sense of volumes in the period and the outlook going forward and maybe disaggregating the impact you've had around lower inventories and some of the conscious decisions you've made around rebuilding your own stocks versus lower end market demands. and then how do we think about those volume trends moving forward? and any specific categories or parts of the store that you would call out as being particularly maybe stronger or weaker would be helpful. thank you.
mike king -- chief executive officer
yes. so our food merchandising business is -- from a segmentation standpoint, it includes our ag business, our egg business, protein business and as well as some of our consumer business. so it's several channels. and it's -- there's not a one-size-fits-all answer.
but what i can tell you is similar to what you -- we've commented on foodservice, our approach is the same in terms of inventories. what we've noticed is between seasonality and some events like the avian influenza that we've seen with the poultry, it does have an impact on product availability, which does impact demand. so we have seen some softening, but we do believe it's seasonal on products like egg. conversely, we see demand rapidly increasing, given seasonality in demand on areas like our agriculture or our produce business.
so it's a moving target in some of the channels. so we're adapting and the goal to reestablish inventories and allow us to improve service levels is where we continue to see ourselves be strong. and that's what our plan is, is to win despite those one-off challenges in each of our segments. we're watching our consumer channels closely for demand.
right now, through q2, things seem to be fairly stable. but again, with things we talked about in terms of this back half are something that specific to our food merch business, we're watching closely.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. all right. that's helpful. and then maybe following -- i think it was chris' question earlier on fabri-kal, it seemed like the ebitda framing for that business for this year was maybe higher than you would have said at the time of the acquisition.
what's that business growing organic volumes? and is that outlook improved because that's going to start rolling into your base later in the year. so i'm just trying to think about how that starts to layer in.
mike king -- chief executive officer
mike, do you want to take that one?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. sure. the business itself is growing in line with foodservice volumes in -- particularly around the esg-type products. the cups that fabri-kal sells are very much the recycled pet and other esg-considered products.
so we're seeing good growth there in terms of those volumes. in terms of the outlook in the latter part of the year, yes, we do expect as the synergies start to kick in, that we will see a lift from fabri-kal through the back half of the year.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and if i could just take a quick modeling question at the end. the corporate unallocated in the period was up pretty notably year on year. and is there a cadence or anything noisy in there? and what should we think about for corporate unallocated for all of '22?
mike king -- chief executive officer
i'm expecting that it will be reasonably consistent with the in-quarter results. so it will be up a little bit. we have added headcount. we've got higher personnel costs.
and then over and above that, we're spending a lot more money on things like cybersecurity and those sorts of things. so we do expect it to be up and to continue to trend up.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. i appreciate all that color. i'll pass along. thank you.
operator
the next question is from anthony pettinari with citi. please go ahead.
bryan burgmeier -- citi -- analyst
hi. this is actually bryan burgmeier sitting in for anthony. i understand pactiv doesn't provide free cash flow guidance. but is it possible to provide some context around free cash flow conversion for the year, with raw material costs rising, some other producers are citing a working capital headwind despite improved earnings, so i'm just trying to gauge that impact to pactiv and if that could potentially impact deleveraging.
mike king -- chief executive officer
so we -- when we talked last quarter, i said that one of the headwinds in terms of free cash flow would be that we'd be building working capital during the year. and so i estimated a circa $100 million headwind on cash flow conversion because we're building inventories. the good news is that we have been able to offset some of that in terms of improving our receivables and payables. and so what i'd expect to see is that rather than that being $100 million, it will be probably on an annual basis, december to december, probably more like $50 million increase.
so -- and what i mean by that is inventory will continue to come to go up, but based off strong cash collections and other efforts around payables will offset some of that headwind on inventory.
bryan burgmeier -- citi -- analyst
got it. thanks for the color there. and on your full year ebitda guidance, foodservice was obviously really strong in 1q. so i'm just trying to think about the different segments -- the level of year-over-year growth for the different segments for the full year.
do you expect foodservice to see the largest portion of that growth? obviously, beverage merchandising was up quite a bit as well. i'm just trying to think about the year-over-year ebitda growth and how that could layer into each segment.
mike king -- chief executive officer
yes. sure. no doubt the foodservice will see a lot of growth year on year. that's driven by the fabri-kal acquisition and then natural growth as we've come back from covid.
and so i guess, in terms of where we're seeing it, we'd expect foodservice to grow from last year slightly below $300 million to more like 400-ish. and then beverage merchandising, when i think about that segment, last year, it had some big hits in terms of winter storm uri and the flood in canton. and so those are natural tailwinds for that segment of, let's call it, $50 million round numbers. and then over and above that, we'll see improvement because of the closure of the coated groundwood complex at pine bluff and then some other improvement there.
so, roughly speaking, we'd be going from the 40-odd million dollar number last year to somewhere between $115 million and $130 million. so -- and then the remainder would be in food merchandising potentially.
bryan burgmeier -- citi -- analyst
got it. thanks, mike. good luck in the quarter. thank you.

next question is from anojja shah with bmo capital markets. please go ahead.
anojja shah -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. i'm just thinking about the fact that consumers have been eating and cooking at home a lot more over the past two years. do you think some of that behavior is sticky? and then medium-term demand, do you think demand for foodservice might shake out lower than it was pre-pandemic?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
i think it will be more of a personal view than anything. but in terms of people wanting to stay home and cook, i think there's some people would have -- i think what we're seeing is that people have started doing that, but people really want to get out and spend money and get out and go to restaurants. having said that, in this economic environment, it's a little difficult to tell. that was certainly what we had been seeing, but what will happen in the future.
i'm just not sure.
mike king -- chief executive officer
the thing i would add to that, mike, is what we've seen with the home delivery. so where people are home, that's correct, we've seen a significant shift in the consumers' behavior to the likes of a doordash or home delivery model, which is from a takeout foodservice container standpoint, additive to growth. so it's -- yes, they're home, but they're buying in their food.
anojja shah -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
all right, makes sense. ok. and then just one follow-up question. we've been hearing quite a bit recently about pfas chemicals particularly -- in food packaging, but particularly in the qsr channel.
do you have any comments or views on that?
mike king -- chief executive officer
not particularly. forever chemicals is something that's a challenge we're all faced with. and certainly, we're partnering with our customers to address the challenge that we all face. so is there a specific to that? it's something we're certainly aware of and taking it serious.
outside of that...
anojja shah -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yes, just if you're seeing any impacts, like significant impact then?
mike king -- chief executive officer
i wouldn't say significant impacts at this time.
anojja shah -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

the next question is from kyle white with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks for taking the question. just wondering if you could update us on your labor levels and where you're at relative to where you'd like to be? what's the current vacancy rate? and also on this, do you have a sense of the headwind you're carrying from the -- i imagine the increased training that's going on as well?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. i'll take this one, mike. so we -- in terms of where we are versus where we expected to be, just as a bit of color, we came into the year behind in terms of our labor levels as to what we planned. but now we're on track and actually slightly ahead.
in terms of the vacancy rate, mike king had spoken before about being -- in the past, we've been over 10% vacancy. and then when you add over and above that covid-related absences, we could see up to 15% vacancies at any point in time between the sickness absence and the actual shortage of labor employees. so now we're down at the circa 5% levels, and we're continuing to trend favorably there. in terms of the headwind around training, look, we are spending whatever it takes to get people into our plants and trained up safely and to get them through our system to retain them.
we are seeing a lot of turnover still. in terms of aggregate costs around that, our labor inflation in total is up over the 10% levels but mostly driven by our plants. in terms of the training itself, the costs associated with that are probably in the -- somewhere around $30 million per annum. it's a difficult one to actually quantify because a lot of it is internal training.
it's just stuff that our plant leadership does on a day-to-day basis. every single day they're out, they're teaching people, but the direct cost would be around $20 million to $30 million increase year on year.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. and then you made a number of strategic decisions and divestments over the past year. you pruned the portfolio a little bit. you had the strategic review in the beverage merchandising segment.
are you happy and content with the current portfolio now? are you happy with the path forward that you see for that segment with the improved mill performance that you've talked about? or is anything in terms of the return threshold of that those mills make you more content to be the owners of that business, or is it something to where maybe you're not the logical strategic owner of those two mills? thanks.
mike king -- chief executive officer
yes. so what i'll say is our strategic review, as i've mentioned in prior qs, is an ongoing iterative process. so both -- all of our businesses as a part of our internal process, we continue to look at the portfolio and what makes sense and what might not. in terms of beverage merch, i would say for where we are, we are pleased with our ability to improve our mill performance.
and certainly, our converting operations continue to deliver and do well. i would say that it would be irresponsible of us not to continue to move forward in the strategic review process. we are looking at ways to further improve and enhance our portfolio. so it's still too early to say -- to answer the latter part of your question -- your line of questions there, but i would just say that our process continues.
and as we make decisions, we will be very forthcoming with those decisions.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thank you and congrats on a strong quarter.
operator
the next question is from ed brucker with barclays. please go ahead.
ed brucker -- barclays -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong quarter again. i just wanted to get your -- or see if you're able to share the use of proceeds for the carton packaging machinery business in asia. i think it was $335 million.
just wanted to see what you're planning to do with that.
mike king -- chief executive officer
yes. at this stage, we'd be planning to pay down debt with that.
ed brucker -- barclays -- analyst
got it. and then just from a capital allocation perspective and given that commentary, you're looking to pay down debt, you're looking to deleverage, but i just wanted to get your priority list, i guess, for how you view shareholder returns, how you view debt reduction, and then how you view potential m&a in the future as well.
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
yes. i don't think anything has changed there for us. we do want to deleverage. that's first and foremost what we want to do.
in terms of paying the dividend, we do want to continue to do that. we think it's a good practice for us. in terms of capital investment, we still think we're pushing ahead with our capital programs and investing into our business. we talked in the past of being somewhere around $290 million, $295 million this year in those investments.
in terms of acquisitions, similar to fabri-kal, we are out hunting. we aren't doing anything like that. but if the right thing comes along, we'd consider it. but that's nothing new there.
so i think our priorities remain the same.
ed brucker -- barclays -- analyst
please go ahead.
operator
the last question is from andy scheffer with onex credit partners.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for taking my questions. regarding your comments on inflation in the back half of the year.
is the hesitancy any concern about the ability to ultimately pass it through and customer pushback? or is it purely a timing issue?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
it's the timing.
mike king -- chief executive officer
yes. timing for sure.
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
it's a timing issue.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
ok. and then your comments on force majeures. can you expand a little bit upon that in terms of how -- the size of them, how often, and the circumstances surrounding them?
mike king -- chief executive officer
yes. so the last 24 months seems to be a bit of a new normal when it comes to force majeure. and so whether it's chemical facilities, constituent factories or even some of our -- the cracker facilities for these large resin companies, there's just events that are continuing to expose weakness all throughout the tiered supply chain. and whether it's aluminum or it's styrene monomer, there seems to be a new weather event or a breakdown, equipment reliability concerns whether in the supply chain or even what's happening across the world have all led to just choppiness, i would call it, more than significant, and it's put pressure and allocations on several of the constituent parts of our supply chain.
and that's something we've been faced with for the better part of the last 36 months and hasn't really slowed down.
andy scheffer -- onex credit -- analyst
are you seeing the timing to work through those issues decline?
mike king -- chief executive officer
i would say, we're seeing -- and as soon as i say this, i'll regret it, but the severity of some of these things has gotten better. the ability of our supply chain, frankly, to address them, yes, is improving, albeit there's new and interesting ways that continue to pop up to have a force majeure.

we have one more question from james finnerty with citigroup. please go ahead.
james finnerty -- citi -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. i hopped on late. i apologize if this has been answered already. just on the leverage side, what is the leverage goals over the longer term? and what debt should we expect you to be paying down as you look to delever the balance sheet?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
i think we -- nothing has really changed in terms of where we want to be. around three to four times would be a good target. and then in terms of what debt, we have a 2025 maturity. we have term loans.
whatever makes sense at the time is really the answer i can give in terms of what we'll pay down.
james finnerty -- citi -- analyst
great. and then on the reiterated ebitda guidance for the full year, just given post first quarter, would you say you're more confident in that number today than you were as when you reported fourth quarter results?
mike ragen -- chief operating officer and chief financial officer
i think we -- and i think we were confident in the number before, and we're confident in it now. when we talked last quarter, we discussed that we want to absolutely put a number out there that we can hit, and that's what we're aiming to do. so we're confident -- and we were confident then and are confident now.

good morning, and welcome to the pactiv evergreen second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded today. i would now like to turn the conference over to dhaval patel. please go ahead.
dhaval patel -- senior vice president of investor relations and strategy
thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. thank you for your interest in pactiv evergreen, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. with me on the call today we have michael king, chief executive officer; and jon bakhst, chief financial officer. please visit the events section on the company's investor relations website at www.pactivevergreen.com and access the company's supplemental earnings presentation.
management's remarks today should be heard in tandem with reviewing this presentation. before we begin our formal remarks, i would like to remind everyone that our discussions today will include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our guidance for 2022. these forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements. therefore, you should not put undue reliance on those statements.
these statements are also subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. we refer all of you to our recent sec filings, including our most recent annual report on form 10-k and our upcoming quarterly report on form 10-q, for more detailed discussion on those risks. the forward-looking statements we make on this call are based on information available to us as of today's date, and we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. lastly, during today's call, we will discuss certain gaap and non-gaap financial measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating our performance.
our non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the results prepared in accordance with gaap, and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures is available in our earnings release and in the appendix to today's presentation. unless otherwise stated, all figures discussed during today's call are for our continuing operations only. with that, let me turn the call over to pactiv evergreen's ceo, michael king. mike? 
michael king -- chief executive officer
thanks, dhaval. good morning, everyone, and welcome. yesterday after the market closed, pactiv evergreen released its second quarter 2022 results. i'm pleased to report that we had yet another strong quarter as the team continues to focus on and deliver improving business results.
revenues continue to benefit from pricing due to lag raw material cost pass-throughs, while adjusted ebitda benefited from the pricing net of higher costs, as well as the benefit from the fabri-kal acquisition. we continue to make steady progress across the organization over the past few quarters. while covid is still something we track, it's not impacting our business as significantly as it has in the past. the labor gap that we had highlighted last year and previously this year has narrowed considerably, thanks to the strong efforts across the organization.
finally, our profitability is improving versus last year's depressed levels. all of this is possible because throughout the organization, we continue to drive and embrace a culture of excellence and continued improvement. we also saw better cube efficiencies, improved productivity, and an increase in automation across our warehouses. in general, we are seeing more stable operations across all three segments.
at the same time, we are seeing higher raw materials and inflation cost, and we intend to take pricing actions where needed to return profitability to normalized levels. we've also delivered on our broader strategic initiatives as the integration of fabri-kal is proceeding ahead of plan. and earlier this week, we also announced the close of the sale of our asia-based business. the sale of the asian business allows us to focus on our strong north american business while also enhancing our balance sheet.
finally, i'd like to take a moment to welcome jon baksht, our new chief financial officer, to the team. jon, brings with him extensive financial expertise with prior experience as an investment banker, as well as a cfo, dealing with the public markets. we look forward to working with him and for all of you to get to know jon. let me now turn it over to jon to walk us through a more detailed review of our financials in the second quarter.
jon?
jon baksht -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. before i begin my discussion of our financial results, i'd like to take a moment and thank mike and the broader pactiv evergreen team for such a warm welcome to the company. it's exciting to be a part of an organization with a strong values and purpose-driven culture. in my short time at the company, i'm impressed with the strong fundamentals of the business, while at the same time having opportunities to continue to build on the company's recent success.
for those of you i haven't had the opportunity to meet yet, i'd like to give you a sense of what drew me to pactiv evergreen. as a company recently taken public, i find the investment case for pactiv evergreen to be compelling and potentially overlooked by the broader market. as most of you on the call today know and bears reinforcing, we are one of the largest producers of fresh food and beverage packaging in north america with scale and a nationwide footprint to provide a compelling value proposition for our customers, which includes leading market share in several product categories. while we, like everyone, have experienced inflation and supply chain-driven headwinds, the underlying business remains resilient as evidenced by our results this quarter.
our extensive manufacturing, warehousing and distribution footprint positions us for further growth. we are committed to a more sustainable future with 64% of our revenues in 2021 coming from products made with recycled, recyclable, or renewable materials. financially, we remain committed to our dividend policy, which currently provides a yield around 4%. i'm sure my enthusiasm is evident and i look forward to our continuing dialogue.
i'll now move into our financial results. moving to slide 6 and touching on our q2 2022 highlights. as mike stated, we continue to make steady progress and delivered another strong quarter. net revenue was $1.64 billion, up 21% versus prior year.
net income was $74 million with diluted eps of $0.40. adjusted ebitda was $249 million, up 92% versus the prior-year quarter, and our free cash flow for the quarter was negative $18 million. moving to slide 7. looking at our year-to-date 2022 financial performance.
net revenue was $3.135 billion versus $2.516 billion in the same period last year, an increase of 25%. the increase was primarily due to pricing pass-throughs and the fabri-kal acquisition, which offset volumes down 8%, primarily due to strong sales in the prior period as businesses and restaurants reopened post covid-19 lockdowns, labor shortages and the exit of coated groundwood. adjusted ebitda was $431 million versus $207 million in the same period last year. the improvement in ebitda was driven by favorable pricing, net of material cost pass-through, improved and more stable operations that mike referenced earlier, as well as the acquisition of fabri-kal.
the increase in adjusted ebitda also includes the benefit related to prior-year period costs of $50 million from winter storm uri. free cash flow was $52 million. moving to slide 9 and a deeper discussion of our q2 2022 performance. net revenue was $1.64 billion versus $1.352 billion in the same period last year, an increase of 21%.
the increase primarily related to higher price mix due to material cost pass-through to customers and pricing actions plus the acquisition of fabri-kal. volume was down 10%, primarily due to tough comps versus strong sales volume last year, labor challenges and our exit of the coated groundwood paper business. adjusted ebitda was $249 million versus $130 million in the same period last year, an increase of 92%. the increase is primarily due to favorable pricing, net of material cost pass-through and the impact of the fabri-kal acquisition, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, lower sales volume, and higher employee-related and logistics costs.
i'd also note that net income benefited from a one-time positive litigation settlement of approximately $15 million in the quarter. this amount is reported in our other income line, but is not included in the calculation of adjusted ebitda. free cash flow, defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capex, was negative $18 million versus $42 million in the same period last year. the negative cash outflow was largely due to a planned build in inventory of $154 million as a needed replenishment following shortages we experienced last year.
our inventories are now at more normalized levels, which allows us to provide improved customer service levels. we do not expect significant inventory builds on a volume basis for the remainder of the year. moving to slide 10. this slide helps to bridge q2 year-on-year revenue and adjusted ebitda.
looking at revenue when compared to q2 last year, the key drivers of our revenue growth were price/mix of $309 million and $121 million from the acquisition of fabri-kal, offset by lower volume and fx. for adjusted ebitda, price/mix favorability and a $34 million benefit from the fabri-kal acquisition more than offset higher costs and some volume deterioration. moving to slide 11 and our results by segment for q2. our foodservice segment saw net revenues up 39%, driven by higher pricing to recover cogs increases, as well as the impact from the acquisition of fabri-kal, which offset volumes down 9% versus strong prior-year sales volume.
adjusted ebitda for the segment was up $103 million versus the same period last year, primarily due to favorable pricing, net of material cost pass-through and the impact from the acquisition of fabri-kal, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, lower sales volume, and higher employee-related costs. our food merchandising segment saw net revenues up 14%, driven by favorable pricing, primarily due to higher material cost pass-through to customers and pricing actions, partially offset by lower sales volume, primarily due to labor shortages. adjusted ebitda for the segment was up 32% versus the same period last year due primarily to favorable pricing, net of material cost pass-through, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and lower sales volume. our beverage merchandising segment saw net revenues up 9%, driven by favorable pricing, primarily due to pricing actions, higher material cost pass-through to customers and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower sales volume, primarily due to our exit from our coated groundwood business.
adjusted ebitda for the segment was $29 million versus $15 million in 2021. the key drivers were higher pricing partially offset by higher material, manufacturing, employee and logistic costs, as well as an $11 million cost due to scheduled annual pulp mill outage. moving to slide 12. we ended q2 with $246 million in cash and $4.2 billion in total outstanding debt.
as indicated in our press release earlier in the week, we have closed the sale of the beverage merchandising agent business, which will further strengthen our balance sheet. we expect proceeds of approximately $300 million, net of estimated working capital adjustments and estimated taxes. our net debt at the end of q2 was around $4 billion and around $3.7 billion pro forma for the asia business sale proceeds. we ended q2 with a net debt to ltm adjusted ebitda ratio of 5.3, well below the 7.6 at the end of 2021.
we expect our net leverage to be below five when we report our third quarter and fourth quarter results. additionally, we are evaluating other alternatives to further deleverage the balance sheet. i'll now pass it back to mike for further comments.
michael king -- chief executive officer
thanks, jon. if i can turn your attention to slide 14. i'll provide a brief update on our esg progress before my closing remarks. this year, we've put a lot of effort and resource on tracking and improving our performance in the es&g fields.
we've implemented a new operational sustainability data management system. this allows us to analyze, report on and audit our energy, our emissions, our water and our waste data across the entire enterprise. as we finalize our environmental disclosures for 2021, we are proud to report an 18% scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction between 2015 and 2021. at pactiv evergreen, we promote responsible forestry, and we are committed to increasing the use of certified wood and promoting forest certifications.
we recently published an updated sustainable forestry policy, as well as new goals related to sustainable forestry. as much as we value a sustainable supply chain, we're also committed to support our customers' efforts on their path to a sustainable future. in june, we published our zero waste implementation guide to provide foodservice operators, like recreational venues, stadiums, or colleges, a resource to begin their journey to zero waste. by closing the loop, operators can cut greenhouse gases; manage risk, litter, and pollution; reinvest in resources, all while creating value for their operation.
under our people pillar, we are spending a significant amount of time strengthening our support for our team members' career development, introducing a new tuition assistance program and updated performance management system, both of these programs are bringing our celebrate people core value to life in ways that are relevant and meaningful for our people. finally, i couldn't be prouder to celebrate pactiv evergreen's first female board chair, leanne baker. lean has been a director since our ipo and we're looking forward to benefiting from her leadership and experience in helping to build more gender equality in boardrooms. to learn more, we invite shareholders to view our latest disclosures and other reports found at investors.pactivevergreen.com in the esg section.
now if i could turn your attention to slide 15. as our results indicate, we are making steady progress on returning our profitability to more normalized levels. as a result of the strong start to the year, we are now expecting our 2022 adjusted ebitda to be in the $750 million to $770 million range. additionally, we expect to be free cash flow positive for the remainder of the year following the inventory build in the first half of the year.
we continue to see improvements in the labor markets. we are now focused on employee training and retention while still finishing filling the opening -- the open positions we have. as my opening comments stated, we continue to see improvement across all operations. we are, however, still dealing with broader inflationary pressures, as well as volatility linked to the raw material markets.
in addition, we now have the added uncertainty around volume recovery due to the fears of a recession. we believe our portfolio is fairly resilient in recessionary times, but it is prudent to remain cautious in the current environment. given the timing lag for inflationary cost pass-through, we anticipate this quarter will represent our peak ebitda for the year and would expect more normalized results the next two quarters, particularly given the lower seasonal demand we typically experience in q4. at this time, i would like to thank all of the pactiv evergreen workforce for their continued commitment and hard work.
we remain focused on continuing to improve our production capabilities and service to our customers. with that, let us take your questions. operator?
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question will come from arun viswanathan with rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. congratulations on the progress here and the turnaround. so i guess first question is just on the price/cost situation.
so as you noted, you are still experiencing some raw material inflation and some inflation across other categories. yet you are -- kind of have implemented some pretty sizable price increases over the last couple of quarters. so as we kind of lap those, what kind of pricing should we expect going forward? and have you seen any kind of potential elasticity response from your customers, i.e., pivoting away or trading down? or what would you kind of describe the environment as? thanks.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, arun. so our pricing has two key elements. it's our raw materials, as you know, and then what we're calling our cost of living or other nonmaterial-related costs.
i would tell you, we've made a great deal of progress as it relates to getting customer support, both contractually, as well as transactionally on our non-raw material recovery. and so you see that. i expect that that continues throughout the future of this business. our target is 100% recovery in that regard.
and as you can see, we've demonstrated for the first two qs of this year that we've been able to get that kind of support. i'd expect that to continue. on the raw side those are more contractually an index-based recoveries. and those will also -- while we work to try to tighten loose things up, those things are going to be more what you're used to seeing.
each one of our segments has a different lag. and those lags will dictate how the material falls out. we will see the same kind of pricing strength, i think, to a lesser degree given what materials are doing -- the raw materials are doing. but on the cost-of-living side, i expect the strength to continue.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
and just as a follow-up then. so you noted some volume softness, but that was mainly tough comps. is that how we should read it? and have you seen potentially any areas of softness? or is it, again, just a comp issue? and do you expect maybe some volume acceleration next year on those easy comps? how should we think about volumes as well? thanks.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah, good question. yeah, so we are seeing a moderation in some of our foodservice business in terms of volumes as we kind of get into q3 here. and we -- in late q2, even we saw a little bit. i would tell you, in our bev merch business, we can sell every ton we can produce.
the demand is still very strong for fiber products, both our paper and our board products are sold out. so that demand does not seem to be softening. and on the food merch side, we've largely constrained our own demand with labor challenges. so it's difficult to say if anything is moderating there.
i will tell you that our assumptions for the back half is we do see some moderation. but most of our products, if not almost all of our segments, are in nondiscretionary products. our products are the products people need and use every day. so i don't expect a huge falloff in terms of our demand.
there will be some moderation in segment shift. we see that in recessionary periods in the past as mobility shifts, but we're well-positioned to handle that.
arun viswanathan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks.
operator
our next question will come from adam samuelson of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning, everyone.
michael king -- chief executive officer
good morning.
jon baksht -- chief financial officer
good morning.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
so i guess the first question maybe on the -- continuing on the demand side, and you alluded to some production constraints, and this goes back not just this quarter but going into the year. what would your -- what could your volumes have been in the second quarter if you didn't have those production constraints? i'm just trying to get a sense of, especially the down 9% in foodservice, what that could have looked like if we then think about underlying demand slowing in the back half as we think about the external environment versus some of your internal constraints?
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. that's difficult. i mean, we made some conscious decisions to exit areas. i mean, you look at the coated groundwood volume, we setting that aside rough numbers, was it 1% or 2% of volume that we missed as an opportunity maybe? but i think the real decision and one of the things that really constrained our demand and try to position us well for the back half and future qs was the rebuild of our inventory.
and we did that so we weren't constraining the demand. the other thing is it's hard to also give you an answer on that without understanding all our customer inventory levels. and we know that those things remain fragile. our customers have not fully rebuilt most of their inventories yet either.
so it's hard to say. i'm sorry i don't have a real good answer for that, but i'd be guessing if i tried to say it was more than 1% or 2% maybe.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. so -- and maybe then you talked about kind of foodservice demand slowing, i guess, through july and presumably in june and later in the second quarter, any way to dimensionalize kind of the magnitude there? and any specific color by product line or customer type of vertical, whether that's qsr, casual dining, institutional as who, do you have any visibility to that? that would be helpful.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. we're seeing some mobility shift. people are still going to the restaurant, sitting down, and eating, taking food out. in fact, we're seeing that kind of trend up a tad.
qsr mobility, no secret there. i don't think anybody is missing the plot there that it is slowing. although for us, it's just been moderate. and i think that that's probably the likely slightly trend.
but outside of that, there's really not been a large-scale shift for us. and i think some of that's masked by the fact that we're able to now service customers at a higher level given our inventories. so anything that we were missing, we're kind of getting back through better service.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. and if i could just ask a quick clarifying question. so the total company ebitda bridge for acquisitions, i presume that contribution is all fabri-kal. so i just want to confirm that.
and in just the business did -- it would seem 28% ebitda margins in the quarter, if that's the case. and just is that just price cost being as favorable in that business as it was in your base business, and so that would moderate because it would look like the nine months since you've owned it, you've already well exceeded kind of the preceding ltm from when you announced the acquisition last september.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think if i understand your question, we are pricing across -- we have pricing responsibility and fabri-kal, that business is no different for us. it's representing exactly the same kind of performance that the broader impact of the business has. and then, yes, i'd say that the strength is we're well ahead of schedule in terms of the synergies we expected in that business.
it's largely integrated. we're already on the same erp systems, all the footprint and asset synergies and the other tertiary things that we planned have largely been executed. and so that's flowing through and is a big piece of the strength. but i would tell you, price generally across the broader business tick and then absolutely, that acquisition has been a good thing for us.
adam samuelson -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. i appreciate all that color. i'll pass it on. thanks.

our next question will come from kieran de brun with mizuho. please go ahead.
kieran de brun -- mizuho securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. i was just wondering if you could touch a little bit more, and you spoke to it a bit, but on the labor availability and some of those higher manufacturing costs and what you've seen on that front. it seems like you've made a lot of progress, but there's still a little bit of an overhang. how are you thinking about that in the back half of the year potentially easing? thank you.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks. good question. thanks, kieran.
yes. so we have made a lot of progress in labor. and i would tell you that largely, our focus is retention and making sure that the investments we're making in our labor force, both to train and retain folks, pays off and that that labor gap doesn't widen. so that's priority one.
hiring the right kind of folks, the folks that want a long-term path to a better future, all the things that we've done to put in place a stable work environment that people want to walk through the doors every day. we're at a point now where we're actually trying to be a bit more selective. and we expect that while we made big strides to close that labor gap in q1 and q2 largely, that we're really focused on getting the right kind of technical talent in our factories, and that won't be as fast paced as it was in q1 and q2. and largely, where we've constrained only one of our business units, which is our food merch business in terms of labor, we've really focused on fixing that from the headcount.
but as far as the foot traffic, people are applying for jobs, that's not a problem. it's really for a skilled labor and making sure we do the right thing for the business.
kieran de brun -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. that's great color. and then just a really quick one on a follow-up. for the sale of the carton packaging and machinery business in asia, how should we think about, i guess, the magnitude of that impact on sales and profits in the second half or as it rolls off the business? and i think you alluded to it quickly, the $300 million from the profits of the sale, we should think about that kind of going toward debt pay down.
is that the right way to be thinking about it? thank you.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think, generally, that's -- we've been pretty clear that lowering our gearing, upping our leverage is the priority certainly as some presented itself. there are other uses that make better sense that would also be deleveraging or improve our ebitda. we look at that.
but right now, our priority is balance sheet health and paying down the debt.
kieran de brun -- mizuho securities -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question will come from ghansham panjabi with baird. please go ahead.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. mike, just going back to your earlier comments on foodservice and some of the variability there and there's a lot of noise from last year and so on through covid. what are we in that segment relative to the pre-covid baseline from a volume standpoint? and then do you think the weakness that you're seeing is just a comparability issue because last year, things opened up and there was inventory builds and so on? or is that incremental weakness? maybe you can just share what customers are sharing with you at this point.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a bit of a mixed bag and a good question, ghansham. i don't -- comps are certainly -- we did open up strong last year and there was a -- we are feeling a bit of that. but i would tell you, the consumer shift makes it difficult to say for a pre-19.
i think there's a bit of a new normal we're starting to see. and if i look at it on a like-for-like basis to kind of pre-covid, i think we're now flat. and as a whole, i'd say even across the broader business, we're pretty flat, not just in foodservice, but foodservice i'm pretty confident we're flat. there has been a mix shift segment to segment.
but yes, the comps -- the comps like last year weren't representative of a new normal.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
got it. and maybe a question for jon on free cash flow. jon, can you maybe just update us on some of the cash flow items capex, cash tax, cash interest? just trying to get a sense as to what the cash position looks like coming out of this year.
jon baksht -- chief financial officer
sure, happy to. so if you take our ebitda guidance and then just walk it down. so capex, we're seeing in the range, probably in the $260 to $270 million area for the year. interest, as you know, we do have a fair amount of variable-rate debt.
but just looking at the curve and estimate, it's probably around $200 million for the year, somewhere in that area. taxes, you can have a bit more variability to it. but if you take the first half and just normalize it and annualize it, you're looking in the $160 million area for that. so that gets you to a free cash flow for the year, somewhere in the $150 million area.
and again that's not so much. and then that's not necessarily guiding to working capital in that area. but what i would say is just really focusing on the inventory. what i did say in the prepared remarks, we're not anticipating any further inventory builds.
and so from that perspective, i would take it as that number reflects more of a flat working capital.
ghansham panjabi -- baird -- analyst
perfect. thanks so much.
jon baksht -- chief financial officer
sure.

our next question will come from kyle white with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning. welcome, jon, and looking forward to working more closely with you. congrats on a really strong quarter, guys.
jon baksht -- chief financial officer
thanks, kyle.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
i wanted to focus in on the guidance raise. i appreciate the raise. i guess i'm trying to understand, is the outlook increase purely driven by the first-half performance being better than you expected? and then you kind of kept the second half relatively unchanged from your initial expectations coming into the year? or just how should we think about that?
jon baksht -- chief financial officer
that's exactly how you should think about it.
michael king -- chief executive officer
that's fair.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
i guess if i follow up on that, then why shouldn't we expect this kind of price cost that you've been realizing over the first half to continue into the second half, given that from our vantage point it seems like a lot of the input costs have been relatively stable. i mean, obviously energy markets have been a little bit volatile. i can't imagine that pricing is slowing down at all for you. so you talked about this quarter being peak ebitda for the year.
is that just a function of normal seasonality? or is it because of what you see on the pricing as it relates to demand or inflation on the business?
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. so for us, what you see in raws now largely won't impact. it will be a q1 dynamic, so we're actually digesting what raws have done in the first half of the year. so with the lags on the material side specifically, you've got falling material costs, for instance on polypropylene.
with that falling, we'd have to pass some of that raw material date back to our customers. so there's a piece of that that's not indicative of current state. the other side of that is you're right, we will continue to price through inflation and cost of living adjustments. and so that will remain like i mentioned earlier.
that also said, we do -- as i mentioned, we do have nondiscretionary products. these are products people are going to use every day. we do expect some continued moderation there. and so i think we're just bringing a balanced look at the forecast.
you're right, pricing, we do expect to take the same approach. but that seasonality in the back half of this year and kind of the uncertainty around what's going on economically, we just feel like we've taken the right look at volumes, and we know we've got some pricing givebacks coming on material.
kyle white -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. sounds good. i'll turn it over.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question will come from anthony pettinari with citi. please go ahead.
bryan burgmeier -- citi -- analyst
hi. this is actually bryan burgmeier sitting in for anthony. if you back out the mill outage, beverage merchandising ebitda would have been pretty close to 2019 levels. do you think that the segment can get back to that $45 million, $50 million ebitda per quarter range maybe in the second half of '22 or in the front half of '23? or is that a little bit too aggressive right now?
michael king -- chief executive officer
i think definitely for '22, that would be too aggressive. just given what we have planned for back half and the fact that we do have an outage in the back half of the year. i would tell you that i don't think you're off base for that being a future run rate for the business. i'm reluctant to give you kind of a time line on that.
but certainly, we're looking at quarters away, not a year away to get there.
bryan burgmeier -- citi -- analyst
got it. understandable. thanks. and the --
michael king -- chief executive officer
i would underscore -- yes, go ahead.
bryan burgmeier -- citi -- analyst
no, no, no. go ahead.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. i just would say i'd underscore the fact that we are -- with the mill outage, i do believe that we would -- if we set the mill outage aside, which was a benefit for the mills. the mills have -- both of our mills have done very well in terms of making progress. so we are stabilized -- we stabilized there.
so that's why i'm confident to tell you that those are the kind of run rates we are targeting to stabilize the business.
bryan burgmeier -- citi -- analyst
got it. ok. thanks for that. and then last one for me.
in the prepared remarks, you mentioned some possible further deleveraging portfolio moves are being considered. can you provide any detail on maybe the size or scope of those? or is it a little bit too early? i'm just trying to think going to be closer in size to the recent asia pac sale or something significantly larger or smaller than that? or maybe it's just too early to tell?
michael king -- chief executive officer
it's just too early to tell.
bryan burgmeier -- citi -- analyst
ok. got it. that's it for me. i'll turn it over.
operator
our next question will come from andy scheffer with onex credit partners. please go ahead.
andy scheffer -- onex credit partners -- analyst
hi, good morning. can you describe for us the labor fulfillment levels in each of the three business segments, sort of where you've come from, where you are now and how fully staff you typically run?
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, at the height of the pandemic, which was a peak gap in our labor market was north of 20% hourly. on top of that, i would just -- trying to work backwards and give you both pro-post. i would tell you that normalized pre-pandemic levels, we would kind of range in our vacant, what we call our vacancy rate for hourly workers between 5% and 10%.
and today, we sit here between 9% and 10% vacant. and i would tell you, segment-based wise, our largest exposure is our food merch space. and then after that, we're pretty healthy in both of the other two segments.
andy scheffer -- onex credit partners -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. and then in terms of the volume, i thought what i heard you say was that your restocking of inventory aid into the volume that you could deliver. so you were purposely dialing it back, but i'm not sure how much that was.
and then was there also some sort of customer optimization anywhere that you were doing in terms of deciding that business didn't make sense and we'd rather just put it into inventory or just move on with various customers. was that any part of that volume decline?
michael king -- chief executive officer
so for us, we constrained our own demand largely due to not having the right products. and so we did not constrain demand to the extent we wanted to rebuild inventory. we rebuilt the inventory, so we're not constraining demand. so we established a healthy inventories in the right products, is a better way to look at that.
so if a customer needed product, then it was there, they got it. we did make a decision not to ship, our customers based on products that were sitting there. secondly, i don't see inventory levels and customer rationalizations as a -- it wasn't a strategy we implemented to try to rebuild inventory levels. it was normal course decision-making for us that whether we rationalize skus or customers, it was all done in the normal course type decision making, not to reestablish inventories or improve certain strategic customers over others.
and we've largely kept that as a strategy as we want to be there for all of our customers.
andy scheffer -- onex credit partners -- analyst
and was any of that because of lack of material inputs in terms of what products you did not have? or was it just the world shifted as i think you were alluding to and maybe a new normal, and that's what caused the mismatch of what you had versus demand?
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. there's bits and bobs that continue to pop up, but they didn't constrain our ability to get product. we switch modes. we did things, all heavy lift to get our materials there.
i would tell you on the aluminum side, that's one area where our aluminum products are suffering due to material availability. and that's a widely known dynamic and on a global basis, a pretty good, constrained commodity.
andy scheffer -- onex credit partners -- analyst
thank you.

our next question will come from george staphos with bank of america. please go ahead.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, guys. how are you? thanks for the detail, and congratulations on the performance. mike, i just want to make sure, just a point of clarification. i apologize, maybe i'm the only person who missed it.
so in the last quarter, did you or did you not constrain your shipments to some customers as you sought to rebuild inventory? or was your volume, what your volume would have been and you were still able to rebuild your inventories? how should i read that?
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. george, you're absolutely right. we did constrain demand to many of our customers in the first quarter and coming out of q4, because we couldn't have the right dates of supply and right dates of great products, frankly, on the shelf.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. so there was a negative effect, even if you don't want to necessarily quantify there was some negative effect on your volume that you otherwise would have reported and the results you would have put up because of that strategy. would that be fair?
michael king -- chief executive officer
yes.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. appreciate that. if i could, my follow-on question to piggyback a little bit on what kyle was getting at. so as you look back over 2q, what was the one or two biggest factors that drove performance better than your original expectations? because i think coming out of 1q, the guard rails were sort of on, hey, performance, probably wasn't going to be that dissimilar from 1q.
again, you did very well and much better than we would have modeled. what were the key factors there that were better than your expectations in 2q? and as we look out to the second half, sure, perhaps we're in a recession, sure there's inflation, but your pricing givebacks as polypropylene is now getting lower and other [inaudible] are getting lower, usually have a lag, too. so you're going to have positive spreads for several quarters. so if you factor all of that together, all the headwinds that you're seeing, where would your run rate sort of ebitda be? what would the range be for 3q? why wouldn't it be very comparable to what we saw in 2q? thank you, and good luck in the quarter.
michael king -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, george. so i would tell you the biggest thing is our contractual pass-throughs are working. and so our ability to get price and support from our customers on inflationary and raw, as you highlighted very correctly.
it's one big area where we saw q2 strength. the second is our labor recovery is ahead of plan. we expect it to drag well into q3 and potentially into q4 before we were able to reestablish inventories. so we are getting the benefits, and we started getting the benefits of some of that constrained demand being unconstrained through mid to late q2.
so we won on that front. despite what the volume story says on a moderation segment by segment, you set coated groundwood aside, which is a large chunk of the volume. many of our subcategories and mix are favorable for us. and so that's q2 kind of in a nutshell as price and labor recovery, we established inventories to take care of a better mix and demand.
on the back half, with what -- so you highlighted polypropylene, and we can use that polypropylene has been falling, and we are passing those savings back to the customers. now polypropylene flattens out in the back half, which is the assumption, and we kind of don't see that continued strength. it starts to go the other way. and we are largely in the mode of passing back versus enjoying the lag, so to speak.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. so how big of a step down right now from what you can see? do we see 3q versus 2q, considering the volume you sell, perhaps a narrowing of spreads, even though, again, i think there's a lag on when you pass through. is there any way to put a range on that? thanks, and good luck in the quarter.
jon baksht -- chief financial officer
i'll just -- this is jon. i'll just jump in. yes, you can put a range of -- you can take a look at our guidance and just back into what the ebitda is for the back half of the year, if you're looking for a guidance for that. the only other thing i'd note is that we're expecting q4 just to be seasonally weak as you look at the remainder of the year forecast for ebitda.
so q3 should be a bit better than q4.
george staphos -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks. i'll turn it over.
