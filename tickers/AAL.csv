[operator instructions] please standby while we compile the q&a roster. and our first question comes from the line of david vernon from bernstein. you may begin.
david vernon -- sanford. c.bernstein
hey, good morning, guys. i'm wondering if you could help us frame what the cost actions you guys have taken and the efficiency that you guys put forth through this crisis. frame how that -- how we should be thinking about ebitda margins in a -- in a -- in a -- out year perspective from a '23 or maybe '24 level. if you think about the $1.3 billion of -- of nonoperating cost takeout plus the efficiencies in the fleet, if we get to revenue levels that we saw in 2019, where should we be thinking the ebitda margins will shake out at that point?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey -- hey, david. really hard, of course, to project what 2023 margins are going to be without knowing what demand is going to be. so i guess this is what i think for most [inaudible] tell you, the $1.3 billion is -- as -- as we describe is real sustainable. i -- i -- what we -- what [inaudible] in that is if we -- if we were starting 2019 right now with this fleet, with this lay of organization, this management, this management team, our earnings in 2019 would have been $1.3 billion back.
but you care about that cause -- and -- and other things have happened with that. that would be better. we've got a contract out with our -- so -- but you want to make those adjustments. but it's real and it's -- it's -- it's a fundamental difference in the airline right now.
so you can use that to make your own 2023 projections.
david vernon -- sanford. c.bernstein
yeah, i -- i -- i know -- i realize it's difficult and nobody knows what demand is. i guess in our conversations with investors, it feels like people are framing your -- your -- your earnings power off of the 2019 base when it sounds like with the fleet changes you're making and with the cost reduction that's you're taking, that -- that -- that's -- that's too low of a starting point. and i guess i'm just trying to -- to -- to -- to understand if that is the right way to think about it or if you think that the earnings power of the businesses is -- is going to be materially higher or -- or higher than it was. again, assuming the revenue environment stays [inaudible]
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, david, and i appreciate the question. it's -- it's really hard to figure out the margins because it so dependent on revenues. but to answer your question, to the extent that people are modeling 2023 with whatever revenue assumptions they want to, if you -- if you weren't -- if you didn't know that american airlines is going to be $1.3 billion more efficient, you should build it in your models. if -- if you already suspected that, you don't have an adjustment to make.
that's -- that's where we are. it's -- it's -- those are real differences in the way this company is now structured versus where it was in 2019.
david vernon -- sanford. c.bernstein
all right. thanks for your time.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, david.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of savi syth from raymond james. you may begin.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. just i -- if i might on -- on the cost side of things. can you provide any color on like 1q '21, what you're expecting on the opex side, including what might be temporary because of psp2? and just a follow-up on -- on, doug, your comments, response to david. i -- i think -- are you're basically saying that the 2019 -- 2019 capacity, you should see $1.3 billion less and kind of not -- nonfeel opex out of the system? is that -- is that fair way to look at it?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yes. and -- and savi to the -- to the answer. i mean the -- the one number that we do know is the -- the number added back to salaries is about $300 million, which is the amount of money that -- that we want higher salaries due to psp2 coming back. the other is volume.
and then fuel price is definitely up. fuel price -- and we -- and we gave you a 45% capacity. so i think if you take calculate where the price of fuel is now and that capacity increase, that fuel should be up right around $300 million where the curve is today. and then we have a little bit higher regional expenses because we're growing the regional a little bit by about $100 million.
so those are the key -- the three key things. the rest is just depending on volume of -- of growth that we have over the fourth quarter.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
that -- that's helpful. all right. thank you.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, savi.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mike linenberg from deutsche bank. you may be -- you may begin.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. hey. two here. i guess robert and doug.
robert, you sort of alluded to the fact that the new testing requirements that went into effect i guess earlier this week, it was obviously having some impact on maybe bookings to from latin america, caribbean, etc. what's -- what's thoughts on -- i know that the administration this week floated the possibility of domestic testing, and i just -- logistically, i just -- i can't get my arms around that and i'm not even sure if the airports would be -- would be able to facilitate it. maybe it's an at-home type product and it sounds like maybe you are gearing up for that given what you're doing sort of behind the scenes. can you just talk about that and whether or not that would even be feasible?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, mike, it's doug. yeah, we certainly haven't been informed of that, so i think it's imminent. we -- we --what we know is what robert said about international testing. we're doing that work with the fed.
and robert said it's had an impact on demand, certainly on short-haul international flight. but we're -- we're supportive of that. anyway. domes -- domestic testing is reasons you stated seems like something that would both be difficult and would have us testing americans on airplanes that we all know are safe to be on.
so we'll -- we'll obviously work with the administration of what they think makes sense to our best to make sure that we're all doing everything we can to make sure that people are safe and also that we get through this pandemic as quickly as possible, which is our best interest, but also let them know what kind of impact that would have on -- on travel. but again, the bigger point is we have -- what -- what you say has been floated -- not even floated to us and so we -- we haven't heard anything directly from regulators or others about that possibility.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok, great. very good. and then just a quick one to -- to derek. you gave us the gross or you gave us the pension contribution for the year.
i think you said $695 million. how does that compare the -- what you anticipate expensing on the p&l? thanks. thanks for taking my questions.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
the expensing on the p&l is actually a credit of i think it's a -- let me get you back on that number, make sure we've got it right.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
not a problem. thanks, everyone.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mike.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of catherine o'brien from goldman sachs. you may begin.
catheine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. thanks for the time. hey. so my first one is on -- on the -- the 1.3 of the cost cut.
i guess could you just walk us through what some of the larger buckets are there? sounds like fleet simplification, management team are decent -- management cuts are decent, percentage of that, i know you gave the $500 million for the management headcount reduction. and -- and then you touched on this a bit in your prepared remarks, but can you help us think about what proportion of that was event it pulling forward, initiatives already laid out versus maybe potentially some -- some new opportunities that came from turning over additional stones as a result of covid?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yeah, i -- i would say -- i mean the -- the two big buckets as i talked about are the 500 in management and then the 700 in other labor. and that goes through all -- all groups. so it goes let's say as you -- as you get the summary, it's through every group: pilots, flight attendants, maintenance, fleet service. so -- so as we -- as we looked at every group, we -- we looked and see how can we be as efficient as we can in each one of these as we brought the people back.
so there's no -- that the biggest item definitely is management and that's the $500 million and the 700 of those and other things. we have a bunch of other items that are in that -- these facilities con -- consolidations, fuel efficiencies, benefits, a lot of other items that we have gone through to make sure that we're as efficient as possible. we do have other savings that are out there that due to volume will be down. but we'll have to see if those are permanent overtime and -- and whether they come back.
so i would say we did take advantage of this to do some of this earlier. all of it was on our plans over the next probably three years, but we've brought all of that forward. and as -- as we went through the process of unfortunately having to furlough people and as we bring people back, how do we -- how do we be as efficient as possible, and that's what we've done. dynamic manning at the airport, single-agent boarding at airports, all of that stuff has been accelerated through this process and will be put in place as we -- as we grow back.
catheine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. understood. and -- and actually maybe one more for you, derek. can you just walk us through the -- through the calculus in determining how much cash you want to get on your balance sheet for the coming months just given the uncertainty? is there a new minimum you want to have until demand gets back to a certain point and you just kind of factor in your expectations on cash burn to help decide on -- on potential incremental raises? or is it really just more opportunistic to either use that lead to pay down debt in the future or keeping a pulse on the market, see if there are opportunities to rid of the most expensive debt? would -- would --
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yeah.
catheine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, thanks.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think -- i think -- i mean we don't -- we don't have any requirements other than the 750 in 2022. and then we do have some payments, some term loans, and some to come up in 2023. so right now, the -- we've gotten ourselves at the end of this quarter, we -- we'll be at $15 billion, a significant amount above the $7 billion we had in the past. so i think the liquidity is there.
but we -- we have to keep our pulse out and we have to keep watch that, see where the recovery is. but we -- we are going to be opportunistic. our -- our biggest -- we talked about the government loan, which we have, $7.5 billion against the -- the frequent-flyer program for that government loan which we would have to pull by may of 28. the determination of what do we do there is -- is one of our -- one of the biggest things we're going to do in the next few months.
but we're happy with the liquidity level where we're at. we're -- we're in a really strong position. we don't have a lot of capex coming forward in the next two years at all. as i -- i talked about, our actual net capex is positive this year, which will bring in cash flow for us.
so our biggest -- our biggest thing to look at right now is -- is the government loan. how do we refinance that? actually, we haven't pulled it yet. so how do we -- what do we do for using that collateral and how much liquidity do we raise in that transaction? but we're really comfortable where we're at and we don't have a lot of commitments going forward from an aircraft standpoint or capex standpoint or debt standpoint in the next two years.
catheine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
understood. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of hunter keay from wolfe research. you may begin.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, hunter.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey. a couple for you, derek, probably. what's the latest on the -- the 787 delivery schedule for this year? and -- and just -- can you just give us a rundown on what you're planning for aircraft deliveries this year next and -- and how many of them you're already financing in place for?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah. so we have -- right now, we haven't changed the delivery schedule on 788 yet. we have 19 deliveries coming this year, all fully financed.
and -- and as of right now, they're coming, but we are -- we are talking with our partners on -- on those aircraft. the max, we have eight more coming. seven will come this quarter, all fully financed. and we have 16 neos coming, all of those fully financed.
so our -- our actual net aircraft capex, when we just talk about capex, is -- it's actually a positive. so those aircraft coming in will be positive cash flow. we -- next year, we have 26 air -- airbus 3 -- 321s coming in, no financing. we have backstop financing on those, but no permanent financing yet.
so we're working on 2022. we won't take any aircraft that don't have financing going forward. so we're fully financed on all 2021 with sig -- with really good financing. and we still are -- are looking at 2022 right now.
and -- and -- and we -- we will look -- as we look at the airbus planes next year and the 78s, we'll continue to look at those aircraft as -- as we talk to manufacturers.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
super helpful. thanks, derek. and then just two -- two sort of quick clean up. one is interest expense.
can you help me out with that this year and next would be great, even '23 if you want to take a stab at it? and then when does your blackout period end? thanks.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
i'll get you the number. to blackout period ends today or tomorrow.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
and i'll be back down in interest expense numbers.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok, great. i'll wait.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of dan mckenzie from seaport global. you may begin.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, guys. question on corporate demand. the broad view is that it's -- it's permanently impaired.
and i just wondering if you can elaborate on the latest conversations with your corporate travel managers, what that path to recovery might look like? i'm pretty sure there's no airline planning for 50% permanent decline in the span and i'm thinking americans got some share shift here. but i'm just wondering if you could just help us connect the dots on that -- on this part of the recovery story?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
yeah. hey, dan, this is vasu. i'll -- i'll start into that. look, the reality is -- is corporate travel demand is down.
it is 5% to 10% of -- of what its historical levels were. and though we're very optimistic that it'll return as vaccines are distributed, the timing, the speed, the -- the -- the rate of that is unfair at best. but also, as -- as important as that is, the -- the thing that really never forget, i -- i mentioned this a lot, i'll do it again here, is the power of the network business, right? that -- that for us, as the primary value we create -- as we create more origin and destination markets for customers, that creates more value for them and that results in them, they're paying us more for that product. and indeed, what we see right now is that 50% of the revenue that we're drawing are from origin and destination markets where really american airlines has the best network or, in some cases, the only travel option.
and indeed, the yields in those markets are 50% higher than in markets where our product is the most monetized and a ton of different carriers can provide the o&d. so that's a huge degree of -- of leverage in the business because, of course, the -- the big way of going versus if we can move our capacity around. and so in a world where -- where corporate travel is slow to come back, and we expect that it is, we -- what we've really tried to do is make the airline as limber as possible so that we can go and create as much connectivity where there is travel demand. and that -- some -- in some cases that we are taking leisure or are taking it, in some cases, where -- where our origin and destination network is -- is uniquely advantaged versus other airlines, and the yields that we see in those o&ds are materially higher than -- than what we can generate even from what business travel is there and really commodities all these.
alison taylor -- chief customer officer
yeah, thanks, vasu. and thanks, dan. we're paying really close to our corporate travel managers and their risk management team to give them all the information they need to feel comfortable to get their travelers back on the road and have to spend most of their days doing that and building confidence in travel through information and communication. we also think very close to gbta and the other large association to provide great communication to these travel managers.
a little early to say, but as you saw, some of the surveys coming out from gbta. they did indicate the back end of '21 to start corporate travel. thank you.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global -- analyst
yeah. thanks for the -- the perspective. i guess just following up on that. i wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on -- on travel passport initiatives? what countries are you focusing on initially for -- for adoption? and i appreciate that it's early, but is there a read on what it's going to take for these -- for countries to get a little more comfortable with this -- this idea? maybe covid metrics or what -- what type they want to see?
alison taylor -- chief customer officer
luckily, we have great partners. we don't do this alone. so working with tourism bodies, our hotel partners. we've been able to stand up very quickly in 19 soft market testing, and of course, we have our verifly health wallet that provides all the documentation.
just if you're ready to travel. you've got a ticket, you can go on. and actually, as an example, dan, on tuesday, we have thousand plus travelers coming back from cancun to the u.s. everyone checked in and boarded successfully and had their negative test.
so we've been able to facilitate this through communication with our customers and being very proactive with our notification, and calling customers directly, and working on the ground across every station led by [inaudible] group, who's done a great job of making sure that on the ground, we're ready to help our customers.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global -- analyst
i see. thank you. appreciate it.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dan. thanks, alison.
operator
our next question will come from the line of jamie baker from j.p. morgan. you may begin.
jamie baker -- j.p morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. very thorough call. most of my question has been answered. but, derek, you disclosed you are able to achieve 2019 capacity on 10% fewer aircraft.
would you be able to express the capacity base that would be required to get you back to 2019 ex-fuel casm? apologies if i missed that in your prepared remarks.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
capacity base meaning area number of aircraft?
jamie baker -- j.p morgan -- analyst
no, asms. and -- and if 2019 is even the correct base to be using, that's just sort of become the -- the -- the industry standard at the moment. how much capacity do you have to operate to get back to 2019?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
all -- all we're trying to do is -- i mean, obviously, we're not back to those levels yet and we don't know when we're going to be back to those levels. all we're trying to do is acquaint to the fact that if we did get back to 2019 levels, we could do it with a significant amount fewer aircraft because we got -- which -- we don't have to add a bunch of aircraft to get to those levels. our -- our spares are down. our maintenance allocations are down.
the max has come back, which we're down in 2019. so we have a significant amount of utilization increase and gauge increase in our -- in our fleet so that we would not have -- in order for us to get to 2019 levels, the point is that we would not need anywhere near as many aircraft to get to those levels because of those things. whether -- whether that's the -- whether that's the right point, it's a -- it's a level that we know and that we were at back at that point in time. hopefully, some -- someday in the future, we'll be ahead of those levels.
jamie baker -- j.p morgan -- analyst
sure. would you have a corresponding ex-fuel casm number that would then equate to the 2019 capacity?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
no, we do not have.
jamie baker -- j.p morgan -- analyst
ok.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
we don't have that right now. yup.
jamie baker -- j.p morgan -- analyst
and -- and second, i came into the call, mark and i are also curious on with the net proceeds of psp were going to be in. and -- and i think you answered this in response to savi's question, so is -- is the $300 million in -- in incremental labor the only thing we net out or were there any other additional operating costs?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
that's what you would net out.
jamie baker -- j.p morgan -- analyst
ok. all right. thank you very much. take care.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie.
jamie baker -- j.p morgan -- analyst
thanks, doug.
operator
our next question comes from the line of helane becker from cowen. you may begin.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. hi, everybody. thanks for the time. doug, you've been very close to [inaudible] and you've done a lot to get this psp in place.
ha -- has there been any discussion and maybe it's -- it's too early in the new administration about changes going forward once we get post-pandemic to capital controls or anything else that would ensure the industry remains solvent in the event there is another crisis?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. i'm not -- no, we certainly haven't asked for that. nothing like that, helane.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. that's -- that's very helpful. and then that was -- that was my main question. and then the other thing is when you look at the fleet with -- i think you said eliminating five types and down to where you are now, and having 11.5 years.
how does that compare from an esg perspective? like what -- what will your -- what -- if -- if your carbon goals were to be half by 2050, what would the new goals be now? like where would you be in say 2030 or 2035? thank you.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, i'll -- i'll try, helane. the -- the goals we already have in place are -- are -- are re -- required in things like this improvement. so you're right. this is -- this is helpful to -- younger fleet is help for the environment.
in -- in terms of -- and american have done a lot in that regard already. we already have the youngest -- slightly younger even though -- even though years go on through this. so we're proud of that. but that's -- that's a big part of our -- of our commitment to getting to carbon neutral is continuing to have -- have a modern fleet, we've done with these -- these retirements.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. thank you.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, helane.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of joseph denardi from stifel. you may begin.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks. good morning. maybe a question for doug or derek following up on -- on hires. do -- do you feel comfortable from a -- a legal standpoint selling stock into this market and how quickly can you increase your i guess your -- your authorization?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, joe, kind of falls on the stuff that's referenced come in on. what -- what -- again, what has derek has comments, we still have $118 million left on our previously announced at-the-market equity authorization. and if -- if -- if we choose to do anything more than that, we obviously need to inform our investors. but right now, that's -- that's what we have to tell you.
there's a $118 million on the atm equity authorization. and whether or not we choose to do that or feel comfortable doing it, we can't talk about it.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and then, vasu, can you just quantify maybe what -- what -- what gauge looks like on the other side of this relative to pre-covid? and then if you could just walk through the -- the four geographic entities and speak to maybe the -- the structural impact to capacity based on the -- the fleet actions if -- if that makes sense? thank you.
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
yeah. the -- we -- indeed, we will be getting a material about our updating as you probably figured from -- from derek's comments. by the time we get to december, we have the ability to produce 2019's level of capacity on about 110 fewer airplanes. the -- and the -- and that'll be a gauge increase of about 4%.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of andrew didora from bank of america. you may begin.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. my questions have -- have already been answered. but just -- just one for -- one for derek. i know you're talking about net cash flow in from -- from capex.
can you give us the gross aircraft capex number? how much financing you're assuming there? i'm just trying to understand the bridge to that -- to that inflow number. thanks.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yeah. gross -- gross aircraft capex is about with $1.1 billion and the aircraft capex for the max as in the neos. the 787s are fully financed and direct leased to us. and -- and then net on the -- that aircraft is approximately about $200 million.
so positive. so we will over finance those aircraft that are coming in. and then we have -- as -- as part of this settlement, we have some difference in our pdp's schedule that goes forward. so that's the -- the difference between the 1.2 and the 200.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
but that's perfect. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of sheila kahyaoglu from jefferies. you may begin.
scott forbes -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, it's actually scott forbes on for sheila. but i was wondering if you can maybe elaborate a little bit more on the fleet. i mean you removed 150 aircraft from the fleet. you're going to come out of this with the youngest fleet among the network carriers.
i mean can you talk about maybe how that plays into your planning for the recovery with route structure and how you're thinking about the competitive environment post-covid?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
yeah, this is vasu. indeed, as -- as we've gathered from my remarks, we would be able to produce a similar level of capacity much more efficiently than what we could before. it doesn't necessarily mean that we'll do so. that's all going to be a function of -- of demand.
but a lot of what you see is -- is -- is really the -- the schedules that are out there flying right now. the strongest parts of our network, all of our core connecting hubs in charlotte, chicago, dallas, phoenix, miami, philly will continue to be that way. and indeed, with larger gauge airplanes, we can operate there much more efficiently, right? we can -- we can sca -- scale their expenses on more seats, but also by having fewer departures in there. it's more efficient and reliable product.
we would be shutting fewer and fewer departures to the airspace. the -- the biggest parts of our network is, as -- as robert mentioned in his opening remarks, that -- that have we struggle in are really shored up through our partnerships with alaska in the west and jetblue with the northeast. and through those, we anticipate the combination of those partnerships plus larger gauge airplanes and a more efficient fleet will enable us to go in and do things like take 50-seat regional jets out of those -- those markets, which are uniquely high cost but also really challenge the airspace. and so at -- at large, we can go in and provide more connectivity into the system, provide a better higher quality network for our customers, and do it in a much more efficient way than -- than what we would have done in 2019.
rob isom -- president
hey, vasu, i'll just add that every time we move one of those 50-seaters out, we're bringing in a two-class product. obviously, with the -- a first-class section that has wi-fi and in-seat power as well. so it's -- it's a much more compelling offer to our -- to our customers, and we're really looking forward to.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks. thanks, scott.
operator
thank you. and at this time, we'd like to give the media a moment for questions. [operator instructions] and our first question will come from the line of mary schlangenstein from bloomberg news. you may begin.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, mary. mary?
operator
mary, your line is open.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg -- airlines reporter
sorry, i was on mute. thank you. hey, doug, i know you're a little hesitant to talk about demand further out into the summer. but i'm wondering if you could talk about what you guys are seeing now in terms of spring break demand? do you expect that that's just going to be a nonevent or do you see travel demand picking up a little bit maybe around that period?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
we'll let vasu will give you that, mary. thanks.
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
yeah. hey, mary, good to hear from you. i'm vasu. and -- and look at -- what -- what makes demand forecasting so uniquely challenging in these times is that 75% of our booking curve happened inside 45 days.
so really, so much of spring break is -- is kind of a question mark right now and there's -- there's different tailwinds and headwinds for -- for what might happen with -- with demand there right now. what we have seen, as -- as --as robert mentioned his comments, is that since there have been more restrictions on international travel, our international bookings have -- have roughly -- roughly halved in the last seven days versus the first call it two weeks of january. it remains to be seen how much that trend holds. certainly, a lot of the -- of -- of travel partners out there are working hard to go bring testing online.
and so we'll see how -- how that goes for us. the biggest thing is to remain as limber as possible on how we plan the airline, and we'll continue to do that through the first quarter and beyond.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg -- airlines reporter
great. thank you very much. and i had a quick follow-up. i noticed that you guys mentioned that doj and the attorney general of new york looking into the jetblue northeast u.s.
alliance. i'm wondering, there -- there have been some others filing objections to that, and -- and i'm wondering if your expectation is that you may have to -- to gear up for some kind of a second round of review by the dot or having to go to greater efforts to -- to get that thing finally in place?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, thanks, mary. we'll give you steve johnson.
steve johnson -- executive vice president, corporate affairs
hi, mary, how are you doing today? let me start by saying that both the alaskan, the jetblue alliances that we've announced are profoundly pro-competitive and -- and kind of create enormous benefit for consumers. and -- and -- and that's why we like them, that's why we did it, and that's why we're so excited, and -- and our partners are so excited about implementing those. but as you know, the department of justice has over the last i guess 12 or 13 years looked really hard at all of the agreements between airlines, including all the mergers, taking a really good look at those. and that's what they're doing in connection with our jetblue alliance.
that investigation is going to continue. my suspicion is that they're going to allow it to be implemented and see and -- and -- and take a look and determine whether the benefits that we've promised actually do materialize. and if they do, i think we'll be fine.
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
hey, mary. the -- the only thing i'd add to that is that we're working very ardently both aa and all of our partners to deliver on exactly that. we anticipate in the first quarter, we'll be rolling out some pretty comprehensive frequent-flyer and -- and productivity co-chair with customer. and in second quarter, we anticipate being able to start ramping in that new markets such as tel aviv and athens, and certainly with jetblue start the process of -- of deeper schedule integration.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg -- airlines reporter
great. thanks very much.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, mary.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of alison sider from wall street journal. you may begin.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- air travel reporter
hi. yeah, i was wondering -- hi. i was wondering if -- if there's been any discussion yet about what will happen after march 31 with the employees that have been recalled? if you're able to say yet whether they'll be able to stay on or if there's discussion at this point about another round of government aid?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, ali. we -- we need -- your -- anyway. to state the obvious, april 1 is approaching and demand hasn't gotten much better by then.
so we -- we're definitely going to need to address this. and once demand starts to pick up, we -- we're -- we're already talking to our unions about things we might be able to do. but -- anyway, nothing really to report yet other than what we had hoped, which is that demand would be -- would have -- would have picked up. maybe not so much by april, but into the summers that we would be ramping up for the summer, hasn't happened yet.
so we find ourselves with -- with april 1 approaching being concerned about this, and our unions being concerned about it. i'll work with them. i know -- i know our unions are already talking to -- to the administration and congress about -- about this -- the -- anyway, with the current proposal to -- for stimulus to be included in there. we would -- we would obviously be supportive of that.
so anyway, that's what i know right now. not -- not enough to tell you in definitive. but just tell you what we know, which is it's -- it's something we're going to need to address here before too long.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- air travel reporter
thanks. and on the management side, i know you mentioned the -- just the cost savings of -- of all the reductions, the staff on the management side. but i guess do you worry at all at some point about brain drain? is it hard to recruit new people into the airline just given the state of the industry right now?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, but we're -- we're starting on -- starting on working on brain drain. we got an amazing team here. and -- and frankly, those that -- those that are here are engaged and doing an amazing work. and if anything, we find ourselves working more efficiently and better together just because there's not enough -- there's not -- not enough people to be doing inefficient things.
so i -- i feel really good about where the team is right now. we certainly have issues like all companies do in these times to make sure we're doing the right things to keep people engaged and retain -- and retain. but so far -- so far, so good. we really have an amazing human places working better together than i think we ever have.
and we're here, we can make that continue.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- air travel reporter
thanks.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ali.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of dawn gilbertson from usa today. you may begin.
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- consumer travel reporter
hi, good morning, everyone. hey. two questions. the first one is for you doug.
why -- i know this proposal was just floated, but i'm unclear and you're not the only one who has said this. why you support international testing on flights but not domestic? and my second unrelated question, i'm not sure who it's for, is can anybody give any color on what you're seeing at international airports, especially in mexico and the caribbean in the first few days of the international testing requirements? any problems that have cropped up? anything you've had to do differently? thank you very much.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, i'll take the first one and give rob the second one. i -- again, we -- we support international testing because that -- that's about getting more people to -- to be comfortable flying across borders. and we have worked with regularity on the administration to make that happen on very short. so -- and indeed, hopefully in doing so, that -- that allows the administration to get comfortable with allowing or to be more open and allowing people from new york, for example, to begin traveling to the united states at some point.
so -- anyway, that's -- we -- we work together and are supportive of that. i -- i didn't actually say that we weren't supportive of -- of doing something more expansive than that. what i said is we haven't heard it. we haven't been asked to do that.
and if we did, we -- we certainly would want to make sure it was something that wouldn't -- wouldn't restrict demand. we have seen drops in demand of course. i'm sure [inaudible] and -- anyway, so which -- we work with the administration to see what, and if indeed, there is -- there are any -- any thoughts about doing something for having americans fly within america. it certainly seems like it -- we'll wait and see what -- where they -- what -- if indeed there is anything there.
you have also just said it's been floated. no one has talked to us officially about doing that. if they do, we'll do our best to work with them, make sure we -- we stressed how safe it is to fly and which i know they know and they have proven that, and work to make sure that our customers feel comfortable flying. robert.
rob isom -- president
yeah, and, dawn, thanks -- thanks for the question. hey, the -- the biggest challenge is -- is getting word out to people that the new testing requirement has to be complied with. and to that end, we've done a terrific job of -- of getting word out through every imaginable channel. and what we found, as alison mentioned a little bit earlier, our largest international destination these days, cancun.
we've had on the first out of the box, no -- no no issues whatsoever. all passengers were basically boarded. so we've also done tremendous work at -- in all international locations and making sure that testing resources are available. and so yeah, we've seen some -- some customers show up with -- without the -- the necessary proof.
and we're reaccommodating them as -- as -- as required. but word getting out. and fortunately, with all the work that we've done to put the tools in place like verifly, the -- the digital health passport, we're doing a pretty good job and -- and we're going to be able to handle this.
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- consumer travel reporter
thank you very much.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dawn.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of leslie josephs from cnbc. you may begin.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
hi, good morning, everyone.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, leslie.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
what are your pilot needs and pilot training needs for summer of 2020. so delta calling back 400 pilots. do you expect them all, including the -- the 1,200 plus that were furloughed to be active by summer? and then just another question on capacity going forward with these partnerships. do you expect american to continue to or do you know the percentage of how much american will sort of outsource some of this capacity thanks to these new partnerships?
rob isom -- president
so i'll try to -- to take both. so just in terms of -- of pilot. the question is how much you're flying? and so to that end, it's -- it's a -- it's a question mark out there. if demand comes back, we -- we know that over the long run, we'll have a home for -- for all -- all of our pilots.
those -- certainly those that have been furloughed in the past. and hopefully that we'll -- we'll be able to keep everybody on -- on board. and that's just because of the -- that the pilot -- pilots and -- and retirement age, we anticipate that -- that we will be hiring pi -- pilots in the not too distant future. now, second question was in terms of -- of that -- in terms of --
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
and having that not -- not flying your own metal versus.
rob isom -- president
yeah, in -- in terms of -- thanks -- thanks -- thanks for that as well. the -- the relationships are not about outsourcing in any -- any way, shape or -- shape or form. it's all about better utilizing those assets we have and finding -- finding ways in the long run for -- for growth for us. and these -- these partnerships are -- are really creative in -- in that sense in that they're going to be able -- able to allow american airlines to -- to do what it -- it does -- it does best, both domestically and internationally.
so prospects in -- in terms of the work that we do for the -- for the long run is --- is -- is very, very bright.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, and, leslie, and these are really pro -- pro-consumer. and what that means is they're going to -- they're going to generate more demand just because we can connect with each other. so we think it adds actually more -- more flying for american airlines, lar -- more -- big airplane sets smaller airplanes, for example, in new york. because we're -- because we're able to -- to compete better against other airlines who have larger networks in those areas than we do.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
ok. and just one follow-up, do you have any expectation of how long american will be so domestic-focused versus its pre-pandemic global network?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
hey, this vasu. and right now, a lot of what -- what you see in our -- in our asset footprint is more just we're operating where indeed there is demand. and if you go look out there in -- in nonbar schedules, so in february and march schedule, you'll see that the -- the latin american network that we're operating is indeed in many cases larger than -- than what was there before the pandemic because that is the place where we see demand and heard alison and roberts comments, a place where we see a lot of testing get -- getting stood up pretty quickly itself. for those international, will -- will really be a function of coming back.
and then international bring back will be really a product of where demand is and how fast testing can get ramped up.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of tracy rucinski from reuters. you may begin.
tracy rucinski -- reuters -- analyst
hi, good morning. hi. so given the strong rise in shares this morning, are you planning an equity offering or anything to delever the balance sheet?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, tracy. we -- we said at the start of this call, we can't comment on the recent stock price movements. but we -- what we did say is that we have $118 million of authority on a previously announced after market equity authorization. so -- and -- as -- as well we might do in the future risk, we can't talk about.
tracy rucinski -- reuters -- analyst
i apologize. i'm -- i'm not setup --
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
and that's ok.
tracy rucinski -- reuters -- analyst
ok, thanks.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
there's a lot going on. thanks, tracy.
tracy rucinski -- reuters -- analyst
thanks.
operator
our next question will come from the line of david koenig from the associated press. you may begin.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
hey, good morning, everybody. at -- at the risk of may -- maybe rephrasing something that you are kind of getting at in -- in what in mary and dawn's questions. i wonder if you can talk about how much travel restrictions, including what we saw from the u.s. this week? how -- how the travel restrictions are changing your view about the pace of recovery this summer? and -- and then secondly, what -- what impact would you see if -- if there is a testing requirement for domestic flights?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
all right, david, i'll try again. so first off, travel restrictions. again, on international, has resulted in a reduction in demand for international travel. but as -- as we've said a couple of times now, we expect that to improve as -- as -- as it becomes easier to for people to get those tests, which is happening already.
so it certainly had an impact on demand and customers need to present a -- need to present a positive test to travel. and we've seen that particularly in the short-haul international travel, things like mexico and the caribbean, now in the u.s.-caribbean destination. and then it relates to any other travel restrictions and things like mask mandates. we've been do -- we've been doing mask mandates well before it was mandated by the government.
we intend to con -- continue doing that. those are great things. we will continue to do so. if anything, we just want to make sure that the government doesn't put in place exemptions other than ones we have, which is children who are two years old.
so we're huge proponents of mask mandates. huge proponents of what the administration is trying to accomplish and -- and that's what we've been asked to do so far. if we're asked to do more, we'll do everything to impress our desire to -- to letter write to know we have a shared objective, which is to get the pandemic behind us as fast as we can, allow our country to keep moving. in the meantime, people are -- people are driving from state to state, they're flying from state to state.
they're doing so safely. and we just want to make sure that we continue that to happen with the goal of making sure we end the pandemic as soon as possible. i know the administration shares that goal and i suspect anything we come up with will be consistent with that.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
ok, thanks. i think that's more concise and -- and you -- you -- you must have an opinion though about what impact you'd see if there is a domestic flight testing requirement?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's -- well, i have to stay on this one, david.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
ok. all right. thank you.
operator
thank you. and that ends the media q&a. i'll turn back the call to doug parker for any closing remarks.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
all right. thank you all. thanks very much for your interest. we really again just couldn't be prouder of our team and what they're doing.
it gives us great confidence as we forward. l know everyone's interested in how fast things will rebound. we don't know the answer to that. we know it will.
and when it does, we're going to be there ready to take care of people when they want to travel. and we're ready -- we're ready to withstand how hard it take. everyone will be safe because of the great job derek and the team have done and get our company's [inaudible] position. thanks for your time.

operator
good morning and welcome to the american airlines group fourth-quarter 2020 earnings call. today's conference call is being recorded. [operator instructions] following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and now, i would like to turn the conference to your moderator, managing director of investor relations, mr.
dan cravens.
dan cravens -- managing director of investor relations
thanks, victor, and good morning, everyone. and welcome to the american airlines group fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. joining us on the call this morning, we have doug parker, our chairman and ceo; robert isom, president; and derek kerr, our chief financial officer. also on the call for the q&a session are several -- several of our senior executives, including maya leibman, steve johnson, vasu raja, alison taylor, and david seymour.
like we normally do, doug will start the call with an overview of our quarter and a -- and the actions we've taken during this pandemic. robert will then fall -- follow with some remarks about our commercial and other strategic initiatives. after robert's remarks, derek will follow up -- follow with the details on the quarter and our operating plans going forward. after derek's comments, we'll open the call for analysts' questions, and lastly, questions from the media.
before we be -- begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, cost, forecast of capacity, fleet plans, and liquidity. these statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. information about some of these risks uncer -- and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release [inaudible] this morning, as well as our form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2020. in addition, we'll be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures this morning, which ex -- exclude the impact of unusual items.
a reconciliation of those numbers to the gaap results is included in the earnings press release and that can be found on the investor relations section of our website. a webcast of this call will also be archive -- archived on our website. the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. so thanks again for joining us.
and at this point, i'll hand the call over to our chairman and ceo, doug parker. 
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, dan. thanks, everyone, for being with us. so look, before i begin my prepared remarks, i want to pre-emptively state that we will not be commenting nor answering questions on the recent activity in our stock price. as a rule, we don't speculate on the day-to-day movements in our share price and we'll stick to that rule today.
so well, we do have a lot to talk about. so i'll just start it, and then robert and derek will add some more, and we'll take questions after that as -- as we always do. so look, 2020 -- 2020 was obviously an incredibly difficult year. but we couldn't be prouder of what the american airlines team accomplished in the face of extraordinary challenge.
our team got the country and economy moving, and they did so safely and with great care. american airlines flew more customers last year than any other -- any other airline. and our team did so while running a solid operation, ensuring our aircraft and airport facilities were clean and safe for every customer who needs us. the year ended on a high note with the extension of the payroll support program.
this positive outcome is the result of the company and union leadership working arm and arm, bring psp2 over the finish line. it's clear that great things go about when we raise our voices together for the greater good. of course, we're also grateful to our elected officials who recognize that the airline industry plays a vital role in the recovery from the pandemic. we talked a lot about the best days here in americans.
we use that term to describe moments that make american truly unique and why our team believes it's the best airline in the world. december 24 was that best day for me. we welcomed back all of our furloughed team members and reinstated their pay and benefits. thanks to our tremendous support teams working around the clock, we were able to deliver thousands of colleagues their first paycheck in months.
it's easy to forget that a lot happened in 2020 on top of navigating a pandemic. yes, we took aggressive steps to permanently lower our costs, increase our liquidity, and care for customers in ways we've never seen before through the covid-19. but we also accomplished significant milestones like entering into groundbreaking new partnerships and reach -- and reaching a new joint collective bargaining agreement covering our fleet and maintenance colleagues. and just last month, we seamlessly returned the boeing 737 max to commercial service.
we'll talk more about the other accomplishments shortly. as we sit here today, i can unequivocally state that despite every challenge thrown our way, i've never been prouder of a co -- of a company in my entire career. the american airlines team and our industry is incredibly resilient, and this past year has proven that. as we turn our attention to the year ahead, 2021 will be a year of recovery.
there's still a lot of unknowns, of course, when or how quickly demand will return. but make no mistake, it will return. the good news is there are vaccines. and while it will take some time for them to be widely distributed, progress is being made every day and that's encouraging.
we don't know exactly when we may return to prior levels of demand. what we do know is that we're prepared to withstand the ongoing crises irrespective of how long the recovery takes. we ended the year with over $14 billion of total available liquidity. and more importantly, we've used this opportunity to make american much stronger.
when the recovery does occur, we'll be prepared and even better positioned than we were prior to the pandemic. and we'll do so. i think of our team, our customers, and our company. on the team front, we're proud of the progress we've made especially in 2020.
this crisis has brought the american team together, strengthened the relationship between management and our unit -- and our union partners in incredible ways. since the onset of the pandemic, we've been meeting with our unions every two weeks to discuss the company's response to the crisis and our path forward. and we stood side by side as we work to advocate for psp -- psp2. and while we made the difficult decision to furlough 19,000 team members last fall, we prepared for that reality in a way that was cooperative and collaborate with our union partners.
our hope is to expand what we've accomplished in the past year, knowing that together we can be the best in the industry and advocating and caring for our team. for our customers, we're doubling down on operational excellence. once we're back at full speed, we're positioned to run the best airline american airlines has ever run through its operating reliability. we've reset our network to focus even more on our strongest and best-performing hubs, and migrated to a much simpler, more modern fleet.
we've talked before about efficient growth in dallas fort worth, charlotte, and that work is now done. we continue to modernize our -- our facilities at washington reagan and improve the connectivity of chicago o'hare, phoenix, philadelphia, and miami. and we're building a much stronger network than we had before. in addition to the inherent strength of our hubs, in 2020, we establish new and innovative partnerships with alaska and jetblue that will make us stronger on the west coast and in the northeast.
we also [inaudible] over the past year to make american a much more efficient airline. we have -- we had a truly unique opportunity to shut down the largest airline in the world and rebuild around our strengths. this enabled us to bring forward and accelerate a number of efficiencies in 2020 that were originally planned for the longer term, and we are passionately pursuing those efficiencies as we recover through 2021. derek will elaborate on this in his remarks, but two of the best examples are the permanent retirement of more than 150 aircraft and five different aircraft types, and the 30% reduction in our management staff.
we believe the efficiencies we've built in the business will drive more than $1.3 billion of permanent nonvolume-related, nonfuel-related savings in 2021, and of course, beyond. so in summary, we could not be more proud of the work the american airlines team has accomplished over the past year. we're very well-positioned and feel great about where american is going to be as demand returns. with that, i'll turn it over to rob.
rob isom -- president
thanks, doug, and good morning, everyone. i'd like to also thank the entire team for their tremendous efforts in navigating an exceptionally challenging year. supporting our team members and customers was paramount in 2020, and it continues to be a priority as we move into 2021. we continue to expand our pre-flight covid-19 testing to make travel easier, including pre-flight testing for certain international destinations and at-home testing for travel to all u.s.
cities requiring negative tests. in the fourth quarter, we began the rollout of a digital health passport, verifly. so customers can easily confirm testing and covid-19 travel requirements, and streamlined airport check-in. this tool is now available for travel to many international locations and for travel in the united states.
starting today, customers also will have the ab -- ability to use verifly for travel to the u.s., to the u.k., and canada as we will continue expanding our use of verifly this year to o -- open up new -- to open up international travel in key markets. with cleanliness and safety top of mind, last month, we were pleased to achieve star certification in the global biorisk advisory council for our entire fleet of aircraft and for our admirals club lounges. this is a testament to the effective cleaning, disinfection, and infectious disease protocols we put in place over the past year. that caused us to return to the skies.
we've taken a number of steps to give them flexibility and competence when they book with american. we've eliminated the change fees on most domestic and international itineraries and fees for mi -- mileage reinstatement on canceled work bookings, domestics sa -- same-day travel standby -- standby travel, and reservations booked by phone. we also made it easier for top-tier customers to earn aadvantage elite status, paused mileage expiration through june 30, 2021, extended 2020 status into 2022 for all members. each of these efforts is predicated on our philosophy that american airlines should be the easiest airline to do business with, and we'll continue delivering on that commitment as more people return to flight.
on fourth-quarter revenue -- our fourth-quarter revenue was down considerably versus 2019, 64% year over year. but we saw improvements compared to the third quarter when revenue was down 73% year over year. the momentum we saw heading into the fourth quarter was tempered by the su -- the surge in covid-19 cases and has -- and the increased travel restrictions in many parts of the country. as we have done throughout the pandemic, we responded by making closing adjustments to our schedule while maximizing the connectivity of our network.
and in a testament to our team, that our fourth-quarter passenger unit revenues were by far the best in the industry. we will continue to be flexible and match our future capacity with observed booking trends while playing to the strengths of our hubs and the parts of the country where travel demand is great. our year-over-two-year basis, we currently expect our first quarter system capacity -- capacity to be down 45%. the recent cdc order to require a negative covid test for entry into the u.s.
has had an impact on our international bookings. so many countries and hospitality providers are planning to make testing available to travelers, the timing and scale of these efforts remains -- remain unclear. given this continued demand volatility, we will remain as flexible as possible and match capacity to demand. our ongoing engagement with leisure operators will pay dividends as we head toward a recovery.
i want to acknowledge our sales team and entire customer organization for their work. this team was recently named airline partner of the year by the american society of travel advisors and the best overall airline for students and youth by studentuniverse, which are both important -- important accolades for such a challenging year. cargo remains a bright spot for our business. our cargo revenue in the fourth quarter was up 32% year over year despite flying in significantly reduced schedule.
in 2020, american operated more than 5,200 cargo-only flights, transporting 167 million pounds of critical goods and supplies around the world during the pandemic. cargo will continue to be an area of focus in 2021. we remain optimistic about the recovery because of the changes that we've made to our network. we will offer customers the largest and most compelling global airline network thanks to the actions taken in 2020.
we will have a -- a -- the full run-rate benefit of our advocates in dallas fort worth and charlotte, our best-performing hubs. and we'll have a fantastic new facility at reagan national that will enable us to upgrade to the hub. by the third quarter of 2021, all of our dca flights will have a first-class product and we will eliminate the 50-seat regional jet operations there. update simplification, continued upgrading, and improved connectivity will also scale the cost of our other connecting hubs and improve their weather -- revenue-generating cap -- capabilities as well.
by partnerships with alaska and jetblue will also create the best and largest network for our customers on the west coast and in the northeast. customers will have access to a seamless network that allows us to focus our assets on what we do best. in new york, we will remove the 50-seat regional jets, upgrade our service, and offer a much more competitive network for customers. as a result, we will launch new long-haul international flights from new york this summer and we start service to tel aviv and athens.
similarly, we are working with alaska on the west coast. and this year, when demand returns, we will begin service from seattle to london, shanghai, and bangalore. we have also announced a new integrated frequent-flyer offering and have signed new corporate contracts. this partnership is already creating value for customers throughout the west coast, including our hub in los angeles.
lastly, while we anticipate international demand will be slower to recover, we will use our strength in latin america and our partnerships to create a leading international network. our latin american network has long been uniquely valued by our customers, and its performance during the pandemic is on stand out. despite near-term demand volatility, we expect -- expect latin america to recover sooner than the rest of our international network and we will continue to offer customers the largest and most comprehensive network in the region. we rationalize many parts of our transatlantic and transpacific networks during the pandemic and integrating more deeply with our partners.
as an example, through our partnership with qatar airways, we've been able to leverage doha as a global connecting hub, which has opened up many new markets for our customers. as demand recovers, we anticipate leveraging these partnerships to start flights and increase global -- and increased global connectivity even more. we believe the structural changes we made in 2020 will enable us to produce industry-leading -- leading revenues and lower expenses through our focused customer proposition for other network in a smaller fleet. we will continue to adapt our business to customers' needs and we'll keep working hard to make sure that they have peace of mind when they travel.
and with that, i'll turn it over to derek.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
thanks, robert, and good morning, everyone. before i begin my remarks, i would also like to thank our entire team for their tenacity and resilience throughout the pandemic. while 2020 was certainly a financially difficult year for the airline, the collaboration, teamwork, and sheer grit our team demonstrated was impressive. this morning, we reported a fourth-quarter gaap net loss of $2.18 billion or $3.81 per share.
excluding $32 million of net special nonoperating items, we reported a net loss of $2.21 billion or $3.86 per share. for the full-year 2020, we reported a gaap net loss of $8.9 billion. and excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $9.5 billion. robert talked about what we're seeing with the revenues, so i'll focus my remarks on the cost side of the p&l.
through aggressive actions, we have reduced our fourth-quarter total operating expense, including net special items, by 37% versus 2019. we remained focused on aligning our costs with capacity while preserving the maximum amount of flexibility to respond to customer demand. we have accelerated several of our long-term efficiency plans, and as doug mentioned, we're on track to permanently remove at least $1.3 billion from our cost structure in 2021 and beyond. at the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $14.3 billion of total available liquidity.
costs were flat from the third quarter to the fourth, and we continue to see a positive trend in our daily cash burn rate -- rate, which improved from approximately $44 million per day in the third quarter to approximately $30 million per day in the fourth quarter. the reduction was due to revenue improvements on higher capacity. as a reminder, our definition of cash burn includes $8 million per day of regular debt principal and cash severance payments. during the quarter, our treasury team did a phenomenal job of continuing to strengthen our liquidity through a series of capital market transactions.
we raised approximately $1.5 billion of incremental cash through two equity transactions to strengthen our balance sheet composition, and we still have $118 million left on our previously announced at-the-market equity authorization. i would like to take this opportunity to specifically thank our recently retired treasurer, tom weir. tom has been an invaluable member of our team -- our team for more than 20 years. his expertise will be missed, but i am confident our new treasurer, meghan montana, and her team -- and her team will pick up right where tom left off.
during the quarter, we took delivery of 10 max, 737 max aircraft, and we expect to take another seven this quarter. these aircraft were built while the max was grounded and were efficiently financed through sale-leaseback transactions. also, as a reminder, we reached an agreement with boeing to secure deferral rights on eight of our 2021 max deliveries and all 10 of our max deliveries in 2022. we have deferred five of these aircraft to date.
and as i mentioned last quarter, to avoid exercising additional deferral rights, we would need to see substantial improvement in the demand environment. as doug discussed in his opening remarks, as we look ahead to a recovery in 2021, we are passionately pursuing the initiatives we have put in place to make the airline more efficient when we are back to a normalized demand and capacity environment. like all airlines, our plan -- our planning begins with our fleet. as we have mentioned on previous earnings calls, we have worked hard to rebuild our fleet into one that is simpler and much more efficient to operate while offering our customers a consistent and improved product and experience.
as part of that process, we have retired more than 150 older noncore aircraft, including five total fleet types, lowering our average fleet age to 11.2 years, the lowest of the u.s. net -- network carriers. not surprisingly, the aircraft that we exited were the least cost-efficient aircraft in our fleet. with only four mainline aircraft types remaining, we will see improved aircraft utilization and operational efficiencies in the back half of 2021 through the increasing gauge, reduction in inactive aircraft, including spares and maintenance allocations.
additionally, we have further accelerated our seat harmonization project and now expect the entire project to be complete by the end of 2021. when this work is done, we will have a more consistent product with more premium seats, larger overhead bins, and in-seat power. these projects will provide significant opportunities to not only improve revenue production but also lower our unit costs now and well into the future. as a result, when demand conditions improve, we could eventually reach 2019 levels of capacity with approximately 10% fewer aircraft.
we will also have a more efficient workforce on the other side of the pandemic. we reduced our management size by a third, resulting in an estimated $500 million of permanent cost reductions. for reference, that would drive more than an entire pre-tax margin point on our total revenue base for 2019. beyond that, we have implemented $700 million in additional labor efficiencies that have been incorporated into our plans going forward.
these include but not limited to optimize staffing plans and the u -- utilization of technology to be more efficient across our operation. from many of our workgroups, these initiatives will allow us to achieve the best productivity levels that we have seen in years. many of these projects would have come to fruition over time. but due to the extraordinary circumstances in 2020, we took the opportunity to accelerate and implement these efficiencies as part of our future foundation.
as we looked at the first quarter, there continues to be a tremendous amount of uncertainty with bookings. stubbornly high covid-19 cases and more stringent travel restrictions continue to constrain demand. and as a result, we expect the first-quarter demand environment to be very much like the fourth. as robert noted, we expect capacity to be down 45%.
we also expect total revenue to be down approximately 60% to 65% versus the first quarter of 2019, similar to our fourth-quarter results. when this flat revenue performance is combined with known cost pressures from higher fuel, restoring pay to our furloughed workers, and volume-driven expenses, we expect our first-quarter pre-tax earnings, excluding special items, to be lower than the fourth quarter. we presently expect to end the quarter with approximately $15 billion in total available liquidity. this results in an average -- first-quarter average daily cash burn rate of approximately $30 million per day flat with the fourth quarter.
the first quarter in -- also includes approximately $9 million per day of debt principal and cash severance payments, which includes a $360 million wtc amortization, including the maturity of our 2011-1 wtc, which unencumbers 30 aircraft. also included in our daily cash burn for the quarter is a $240 million contribution to our pension and $225 million in nonaircraft capex. in terms of our balance sheet, we feel good about the flexibility and ef -- and efficiency we have. approximately 40% of our outstanding debt is prepayable without penalty, and we still do not have any large nonaircraft debt maturities until our $750 million unsecured bond matures in june 2022.
after all the covid-related financings we completed in 2020, our average cost of debt is just over 4%. for guidance for the full year of 2021, our debt payments will be $2.9 billion and our pension payment is $695 million. full-year capex will be $900 million of nonaircraft capex. and due to our negotiated settlements with boeing discussed earlier and attractive aircraft financing, our net aircraft capex, including pdps, will be an inflow of $1.2 billion.
as we have previously stated, when demand recovers, we expect to use all excess cash to further de-lever our balance sheet. earlier this month, we received the first installment of approximately $3.1 billion of psp2 funds from the treasury department, and negotiated an extension on the final draw date of the cares act loan facility from march 26 to may 28, 2021. this extension gives us more time to decide our liquidity needs for the year based on the pace of the recovery, as well as to evaluate alternatives to drawing the cares act loan. our industry still has a long path re -- to recovery ahead.
but the actions we have taken in american to conserve cash, bolster liquidity, and drive permanent efficiencies across the business give us confidence that we are well-positioned for the year ahead and the long term. and with that, i'll open it up to questions from the analyst.
",2020-Q4,AAL
1.0,1.0,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of joseph denardi with stifel.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
doug, two questions for you on the loyalty program. i wanted to ask you a question i asked a few years ago at your investor day. given how valuable the loyalty program has become and how lucrative the business of selling miles has become, do you need to reconsider what american airlines is? are you an airline or are you a marketing company?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we're an airline, joe, and always will be. the managed program is a big part of that, which helps us to market the airline.
joseph denardi -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
so doug, in 2019, your loyalty program generated roughly the same amount of ebitda as marriott did. my question is, did you know that? does that surprise you? and lastly, why don't you allocate 40% of the time on these calls to the loyalty program since that's how much ebitda it represents for you all?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, joe. yes, look, i don't think it's possible to separate the ebitda -- the aadvantage program from the ebitda airline. they're inextricably linked, and you can't have one without the other. so anyway, that's what i believe.
so the -- and therefore, we talk about running the airline, which what we do every day. and again, the aadvantage program does indeed -- is an incredibly important part of that. our -- because we do such a good job of running an airline, people want to have miles in our loyalty program. people want to have credit cards that allow them to earn miles as they spend to earn miles so they can fly more on our airline.
those are all good things. but you can't have one without the other, and i don't think it's right to try and separate one p&l from the other.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mike linenberg with deutsche bank.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
good morning, everybody. i guess just maybe robert or doug. robert, you talked about international lagging. you talked about calling out transatlantic, and yet we are seeing headlines over the last week or so about the potential opening of at least the u.s./u.k.
corridor maybe as soon as the month of may, maybe june. can you just give us an update on what you're hearing and whether or not we're going to see maybe unfettered access between the u.s. and u.k.?
robert isom -- president
so we're -- mike, we're certainly hopeful, and we encourage our government to engage with the u.k. but look, this is a matter -- a bilateral matter, and it's one that first have to be predicated on confidence and safety of travel. so we're encouraged and we're certainly ready when the opportunity allows it. and we know, as i said, that there's tremendous demand, both from a corporate and from a leisure perspective, to take advantage, but we're going to have to make sure that we're coordinated with all parties, governments and government agencies to make sure that we're doing it in an appropriate manner.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. and then, just my second call, just to vasu on jetblue, american. i mean, i know it's early. any sort of quick wins with respect to flow traffic between the two of you in jfk and boston? and then the story -- i mean, certainly a lot of criticism in -- at least it seems in the press and from other entities out there, and yet it feels like the story that's not being told is just the number of new service.
and i just think about the phase that was just launched in the last day or two, the number of markets that maybe didn't exist before that now exist like a jfk cali, jfk boise and then the number of city pairs where you're going from one to two, or two to three, or three to four. for whatever reason, that story doesn't seem to be out there because i sort of view that as being enhancing competition, not taking away from it. so any sort of update that you can give on -- with respect to that alliance?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
yes. mike, thanks for the question. it's a great question. and look, it'll be a start to the story about that because you're absolutely right.
aa and jetblue together, the fastest-growing airlines in the whole northeast corridor. not just adding new services that certainly aa would have never thought possible to jfk daily, but arguably in which jetblue wouldn't have thought possible, such as boston and cincinnati. and there's a lot of things, but really -- so the first part of your question, it's all been enabled, really the customers are the true voice of this because if they like it, they'll fly on it. and we've seen that so far.
so march was our first month in which we turned on the codeshare. we only had about three weeks' worth of bookings. and at least for jetblue on aa, that was only about 25 to 30 markets. but jetblue has already become our largest global codeshare partner.
that's a little bit weird because so many of our international partners are flying 5 to 10% of their schedule, but what we do draw some encouragement from is that our codeshare scope is vastly smaller with jetblue than just about any of our major partners. and as we look at these things, we look at not just the total revenue production on us, but how much of that revenue is really incremental that is coming in higher fares than what we -- what aa is organically booking or coming in periods where the flights were light. and we're finding that somewhere between 30 and 40% of that is incremental with similar rates in alaska, and that compares extremely favorably to our historical global alliances. so that, for us, as much as anything, is an indication of exactly what you said, the customer is voting.
and the customer really likes the new services, likes the service expansion that's there. and as long as that's the case, it's going to be attractive for us financially. and so, we'll continue to grow and innovate and try things that would not have been possible without a partnership such as this.
operator
our next question comes from the line of duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, thanks. i appreciate it, can you just bridge us from the current international demand commentary of kind of 20% of normal or maybe that was a march comment, 20% of normal and then getting to 80% from a capacity perspective this summer?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
yes. this is vasu. i can help with that. a big part, when we quote international, we're quoting both our long-haul business and our short-haul international business.
of note, the way we get to 80% is that we are envisioning a long-haul business, which will be, come our peak summer schedule in july, 40% of its 2019 size. but a short haul of international business, which will be north of that, something like 20% larger than what it was in 2019, with our long-haul latin american network being something like 80% of 2019, right? but maybe even the more colorful way to say is that, for us, long-haul is going to be a very small part of our system this summer. our total long-haul network, transatlantic, transpacific and long-haul latin america will roughly -- will be about 3 to 5% of the seat capacity of the airline from the peak july schedule. so a lot of what you see is, in our international numbers, is more capacity going into the short-haul network, which, for us, has proven to be the most resilient part of the whole system ever since the pandemic started.
no matter what the headlines have been, no matter how the market turns, we've always defined bookings rebounding fastest soonest and greatest in those markets. and you see that in our rasm results, replying the biggest schedule in short haul, international and producing the greatest comparative rasms out there too.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
and then just a follow-up for derek. on the net aircraft capex inflow of 1 billion, can you just tell us how much of that is sale leaseback proceeds? and how much of that is sort of pdp refunds?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yes. our net aircraft capex is about 145, so direct sale leaseback of aircraft is about 2.7. so we have about 2.7 -- 2.6 of aircraft capex, and that's all financed by direct lease and sale leasebacks. and then, the pdps is about 850.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. sorry, just a small point of follow-up there. can you give us a sense for where aircraft rent might be kind of exiting this year?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yes. aircraft rent, we'll exit -- we have about 350 in the first quarter, exit around 400 in the fourth quarter.
operator
your next question comes from the line of helane becker with cowen.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. hi, guys. thanks for the time. so i have two questions.
one is, you guys said that you flew more passengers than any other airline, and i know your cargo revenue was fairly strong as well. but i was looking at your revenue compared to the -- just your absolute revenue, not your unit revenue, and it was lower than that of like delta, and i'm kind of wondering what you think accounts for the difference. and then, my follow-up question is related to -- are you talking to the biden administration about reopening borders, obviously, safely, but reopening borders this summer to gain at least some summer international traffic?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll take the second.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yes. i can just -- i can try to take the first. look, i can -- i don't know the detail on delta's number. i can tell you this, that it's not passenger revenue and it's not cargo revenues.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
so what is it? [inaudible] anyway, now that we know exactly what it is in there. they do have business we don't have. on the biden administration, absolutely, helane. i mean, as mike had asked about u.k./u.s.
corridor, we're heavily involved in that, given our relationship, given our -- how large we are to the u.k. and our relationship with ba, of course. and we're in regular contact. look, what we support is a risk-based data-driven approach to restoring international travel.
what we've seen is pre-departure testing for international rail has been in place early this year. cc recently eased the guidance for domestic travel report. vaccinated persons, following a lengthy study of that issue, so all these factors were taking into consideration. as formal guidance for travel is being developed, i think -- i know the administration understands that.
i know they understand the importance of international travel and restoring international travel to the economy. and we all need to go look at this in a risk-based way. no one wants to rush for certain, and no one's pushing that either. so anyway, i think it's going to happen gradually.
we're going to do it in a way that works with our governments and works with other governments to ensure that it's done in a way where it's safe. no doubt, there's enormous pent-up demand for it. and we see that as some other countries have relaxed their restrictions on things like coordinates. so we'll keep working on it.
everyone who's involved are working productively. there's no sort of -- there's certainly sort of pushback on our size. we all want to do this in a way that makes sense.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yes. and helane, the biggest difference on the revenue side is the refinery, just so you know.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
got you. that's very helpful. all right. thanks, you guys.
have a nice day.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, helane.
operator
your next question comes from the line of hunter keay with wolfe research.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thank you. good morning, everybody. so business travel, it's always been, obviously, a little bit more cyclical and riskier, but higher reward. leisure travel tends to sort of endure and recover better.
so you knew that. but as you drive out, whatever, $2 billion in cost, you densify your aircraft, is there a thought maybe that you don't want as much of that corporate share on the other side of this? and then maybe, obviously, i know business travel is important to you. i understand that. but maybe like an 80-20 leisure business mix makes more sense for american longer term, given your network footprint and the cost savings and the seat densification and all the other factors just around the periphery.
does that make sense?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, we don't think so. and again, we think -- actually, we're building a network that will serve business better than their network, and we're excited about that. so as soon as travel returns, we're building the airline to be there for them. and i think we'll be able to do that as well or better than anybody else.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and then, derek, can you help me think about the swb line in '22, '23 as we contemplate juniority of the pilots and some of the headcount cuts on management, if we assume the capacity is at or maybe slightly above 2019 levels?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
from a salary perspective?
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
yes, like an absolute swb, not necessarily unit basis, but on just an absolute salaries basis relative to where you were pre-covid with juniority and all that other stuff?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yes. i think we're going to have a significant amount of retirements as people went out. so when we talk about casm in 2022 from a cost perspective on all of the groups, we should be down year over year from that perspective. so as we go out throughout the year, we're increasing just because from a salaries perspective, we have brought everybody back.
so it will increase as we go through the second quarter, but then we should be pretty flat as we go into the third and fourth quarter as we have already brought everybody back for the flying that is for the rest of the year. so it should be -- we should be in pretty good shape as we go forward with that. we all have contracts that are up, so it depends on when those negotiations happen. but on a steady-state basis, we'll be pretty flat throughout the rest of the year from a second all the way through the fourth quarter.
operator
your next question comes from the line of jamie baker with jpmorgan.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning everybody. first one for robert. so a question i frequently get is how quickly american can ramp up capacity in the event that an incremental market opens up. and in more stable times, it kind of felt like it was about three months between something happening, such as a spike in fuel and flown capacity actually reflecting that change.
where are we today? for example, if the eu announced today that vaccinated passengers are welcome, and i'm not suggesting this is going to happen, what months would we see that additional capacity?
robert isom -- president
so jamie, i can start and others can chime in. first off, just in terms of market openings, just realize as well, we're dealing with booking curves, right? much different than the domestic, where so much of the bookings occur within 30, 60 days. for some of these long-haul markets, even for business-related travel, the booking curve is much more extended. so even if markets were to reopen, so much of the actual window for purchasing for the summer has actually passed us by.
so we're going to be smart about how we ramp capacity up so that we make sure that we can match a full demand profile with the aircraft. and that actually matches pretty well with the kind of timing that's required to get aircraft in position, pilots in position and cities that have actually been mothballed in so many parts of the world, back up and operating as well. so for us, to be able to actually be able to serve these markets, we're dealing with timelines that are in kind of the three- to six-month range. vasu, you want to add anything to that?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
the only thing i'll say is the very specific part of your question, look, in 45 days, we can go and out in the market and sell it and operate it in a way that we couldn't have done before the pandemic. but to robert's very good point, that doesn't mean that we should or that we would because so much of it is -- especially as markets reopen, is what's the best marginal use of the capacity that's out there? and just to add the dose of quality it is that even if so much of europe opens up right now, the reality is we're, let's call it, 60 to 65% of the way through a historical booking curve for europe, and a lot of the customers that would have gone there have already booked trips to hawaii or florida anyway. so the marginal value of that capacity may be a lot less than what might meet the eye, at least in the americans.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
excellent. all good points. and then, second question, and this is related to the second-quarter guide. it feels somewhat reminiscent of last summer's strategy.
and we talked back then about the low marginal cost capacity given psp and where fuel prices were and why it made sense to fly more than your competitors, right? this year feels like a more calculated decision, less of a sort of grow or die decision to, i think, somewhat paraphrase what vasu has said in the past. but the question i'm getting from investors is whether this summer's plan is markedly different than when you basically tried something very similar last year. any thoughts on that?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i'll start, and robert can chime in. yes, it's dramatically different. and that -- well, first off, last summer, what we saw was what looked to be a real drop in the pandemic rates.
and as we saw that we started to add back when we got the second spike, demand fell off, and we adjusted accordingly. so all that was the right decision, it was based on that and nothing else. in this case, we have vaccines and the rates absolutely are falling. and as a result, you see not just us doing this, but virtually every other everyone.
so anyway, it feels -- again, i don't exactly -- i wouldn't concur exactly with what happened last july. last july, we saw rates falling. it shows that capacity when they spiked back up, we pulled it back. now we're seeing vaccinations resolved, something which feels much more permanent, should that not be the case, you'll see us pull back.
we can be very flexible, and we will be. i don't think that will be the case. nothing about this feels anything close to that, but that's the distinction.
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
and jamie, i would just add one thing to that. building off of robert's comments in the section, that what you see out there in our schedule is actually really indicative of where the airline is going. 85% of our capacity this summer will be deployed in domestic, almost 95% of it is between domestic and short-haul international. and as you look at it for the last three quarters of the pandemic, though we flow relatively more capacity, we've also produced more in nominal prasm than certainly what any of our network competitors have.
but critically, when you look out there this summer, where the capacity is going is really important. but what we call the big four, dallas, fort worth, charlotte, phoenix, miami, are roughly 65 to 70% of our system capacity. and i'll put a little more color on it. in the first quarter, while our system produced prasm that was maybe 16 -- 15 to 20% larger than what our network competitors were, charlotte and dfw produced prasms that were 30 and 35% larger, with phoenix and miami pretty close to the 15 to 20% range too.
so a lot of what you see out there is actually -- there's some opportunism in there about flying saturday-only trips or leisure-heavy trips or things like that. a lot of it is -- or as robert said in his opening remarks, or getting the capacity of this network to market where we can produce outsized value to customers and therefore, outside rasms to the airline.
operator
your next question comes from the line of dan mckenzie with seaport global.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
a couple of questions here. regarding the plan to prepay 8 to $10 billion in debt through natural amortization, does that include or exclude the plan to use surplus free cash flow to prepay debt? and the reason i'm asking is it just seems like american could pay down substantially more than 10 billion over the coming five years. and if that's correct, i'm just wondering if you'd be willing to provide sort of a bigger picture number of what that could ultimately look like.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yes. it does not include anything extra. that's just what we have in amortization going forward. we're not ready to say, but i agree with your premise, that our liquidity is sitting at $19.5 billion at the end of the quarter.
we're going to go through the process of figuring out where we need our liquidity in the short-term and where we need it in the long term. and it's not -- it doesn't need to be at $19.5 billion. but as we said, until we see sustainable cash production, we're going to hold the cash where we're at and keep our cash levels higher than we need. we will then use that to go do that.
so as i said, we have a lot of prepayable debt. so once we're ready, we will go down that process and be able to delever more than the 8 to 10 billion. but i just wanted to make sure that that 8 to 10 billion number, everybody knows, it's going to happen. it has to happen as we go forward and pay off the debt that's due, aircraft debt, unsecured, things that are going to come due over the next few years.
but you're right, dan. it's -- it can be a bigger number, it's just we want to wait till we get through everything, and we're comfortable to move forward.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
understood. ok. vasu, a fleet that is 10% smaller, so call it 10% less flying. i'm wondering if you can provide some insight on the overhang to margins, say, in 2019, with that portion of the fleet.
and the reason i'm asking this question is just based on what american has done on the cost side, based on what you're doing on the revenue side, it just seems like normalized earnings in this next cycle are going to be higher than they were in the last cycle. and i'm just wondering if you guys would agree with that or what do we need to keep in mind?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
yes, some others can speak to what our earnings profile might look like, but you are on to something that we have made this airline materially more efficient through the pandemic here. this summer, we'll be almost 150 airplanes down. but in the schedule, we'll only be about 80 or 85 airplanes down. so all of that delta is efficiency.
it's inefficient airplane that went away, its superior gauge economics, superior utilization, wherever we have it. so if you went to back half 2019, we could fly roughly that same airline with materially fewer jets, and the network would be oriented a lot more to places where we could produce an outsized rasm. so that is very much the conscious design. i mean the whole point to the earlier remarks about the green flag plan is to deliver an airline that can outperform in the future, and we think we've done that, but the proof will be when we do.
operator
your next question comes from the line of savi syth with raymond james.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning everybody. i wonder if you could talk about how you're thinking about the cadence of capacity as you kind of move away from the summer and kind of -- i know there's a lot of uncertainty. but right now, a lot of the demand is being driven by leisure. but should we expect that this level of capacity or better as we move into the fourth quarter?
robert isom -- president
savi, i'll just -- look, we're going to be incredibly flexible as we go forward. i mean we've given a lot of detail as to what we intend to fly this summer. if things progress as we hope with vaccinations increasing and then hopefully, international markets opening up. and based on what we're hearing from our corporate customers in coming back to work, back into the office and setting meetings and events, we're optimistic.
but it really is dependent on the continued containment of covid and people getting back to business.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
to jamie's question, we have enormous flexibility in this regard. the schedule we have built is designed for the current amount of -- for the current leisure-based travel, that's why we have a 777s flying in the united states. they're not made to do that, it's not going to be happening a year from now. so as international markets open up, that's where those aircraft can be deployed.
and -- but again, we're going to wait for the demand to come back before we deploy the aircraft there. but right now, i think the team is doing a really nice job deploying airplanes where the existing demand is.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and then, if i may just follow-up on -- partly your response to hunter's question, just how much of kind of the 2q costs are related to kind of getting capacity back online versus actually the capacity can be produced in the quarter? i was just wondering, as that kind of -- how much is in the number today that might wind down as you kind of increase capacity going ahead?
robert isom -- president
there's really not -- i mean, we don't have a lot of costs built into the second quarter for -- to get the capacity back up. most of the aircraft have been ready to go. we will have higher costs, but the higher costs in the second quarter really due to volume-driven costs. so our maintenance costs will be up because our power by hour costs will be up and things like that.
but there's no built-in cost to retrain. there's no big built-in cost to get the fleet back up because the fleet is ready to go. our team has done an incredible job of maintaining those aircraft over the last year and having them ready. we didn't malfunction any aircraft.
we didn't put them in a desert. we don't have to bring them back and spend a lot of money on engine costs and anything like that. so there's not a lot, i would say, in the second quarter to build the airline back up other than volume.

your next question comes from the line of david vernon with bernstein.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. robert and vasu, maybe could you help us understand the cadence of sort of leisure fares? what i'm trying to get at is where we are today in sort of 1q on a sort of like-for-like distance neutral basis, the per fares versus kind of a precrisis level. and then, how the fare environment is changing as we move into the summer months? obviously, we're adding a bunch of capacity, a bunch of demand is coming in. i'm just trying to get a sense for how the revenue management systems are working in terms of setting fares that would be expecting to see in sort of 2q, 3q.
robert isom -- president
ok, vasu can help me with the real specifics. i'll just say this, though, to kick it off, which is being able to leverage yields is dependent on having base bookings. and from that perspective, as i said in my remarks, firstly, we're seeing not only bookings, but real load factors that actually allow for some optimism about where pricing is going. so vasu?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
yes, that's right, david. we have seen an inflection point with yield, which is, for us, any -- the thing that we most draw in terms of encouragement. to put some context to it, when we came into the first quarter of this year, our selling spares were roughly half of what they were a year ago. for half of last year's price, you could gain access to the american airline system.
as we go out into the summer, there's something like 90% of where they were a year ago. and indeed, in our leisure markets, and by leisure to be really specific here, we count that as short-haul international and also all the obvious domestic markets, vegas, orlando, florida, things like that. our seat capacity there is up about 25%. but there, our yields are about 95 to 100% -- bookings are 95 to 100% of what we were taking a year ago.
and so, that, for us, as much as anything, is really key because we are in a place now, if you'll notice the commentary, we're not spending a lot of time talking about bookings because in our system, engineering bookings is not the issue anymore. so much of it is about getting yields back and getting rasms back, especially in our domestic system. as big as we are historically in our network and the way we're shaping it the summer, domestic rasm is key to our success. and given what's happening with traffic, yield is super important.
so we are doing all we can to go and yield up wherever we see it.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
so just to clarify, were you referring to 95% of 2020 levels or 2019 levels?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
2019 levels, sorry. all years in my comments is actually 2019. i apologize.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
yes, that was slightly frightening. just as maybe a follow-up, derek. you mentioned before managing the airlines to a little bit lower level of leverage. how do you think about talking to your board about the financial liability risk when you've got all these unencumbered assets? i think one of the things that maybe surprised a lot of us is that there were a lot of assets that you could tap into for debt and credit.
how do you think about managing or measuring that or maybe communicating that to the market going forward so that we maybe have some visibility into additional liquidity that you could tap outside of like the traditional kind of debt-to-ebitda metric just given the fungibility of the assets that are in the network, particularly if you buy down more aircraft with cash?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yes. i think, number one, we're not looking for more liquidity. so that's like -- the good news now is i come in every day and not have to go look for liquidity. but we will keep everybody up-to-date on the unencumbered assets.
and as we look forward and if we have excess cash, we're going to manage it properly to figure out what is the best thing to pay down as we move forward. so we are going to have conversations with the board on liability management that we're going to discuss, what are we going to do over the next year or two years. that if we have excess cash, what do we pay off and what's the best things to unencumber as we move forward. in today's environment, our unencumbered assets are 3.7 billion.
they grow every time we pay off aircraft and aadcs. we have the first lien capacity of about 7 billion. so we have the ability to do more, but the good news is we're not looking to do more right now as we go forward. so i think the key is, as we move forward, what is the liquidity levels we need to be at, what are the ratios we want to be at as we move forward and how do we best do that over the time period with any excess cash that we have above the amount that we need.
and so, we'll be having those discussions over the next -- every board meeting, and we'll be discussing that with our board for a period of time as we move forward through this recovery.
operator
your next question comes from the line of myles walton with ubs.
myles walton -- ubs -- analyst
i was just wondering, to clarify on the no longer looking to raise liquidity, would you also be comfortable saying that you have no interest, at this point, accelerating the deleverage with additional equity? and then maybe if you can just give us a bit of color on the walk from 17 3 to 19 5, and the psp contribution in there. and if that's as simple as sort of $1 billion underlying cash burn offsetting the psp?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll take the first one. and i think i can do the second one also, but derek can do better. so we -- anyway, on the first point, yes, when we say we're not looking to raise liquidity, we're not look at the raise financing and that includes equity. and as derek said, we believe -- we know that we have just through our normal amortization schedule 8 to $10 billion of debt going down over the next five years.
and as was noted by dan mckenzie, we have the ability to do a little bit more than that so long as the recovery continues on the path that it appears to because we'll end up with more cash than we need. so that's how we would choose to delever over time. and then, again, i'll try to be quick because i'm already talking, but derek can probably do it better. if you -- i think what you're asking is, if you have the psp payments and you look at our cash, you actually see that it's not as much as the psp.
the reason for that is seasonality of -- first off, the seasonality of sales is not as strong in the second quarter as the first. and we also -- and the debt payments are larger in the second than the first. but even if you excluding debt payments, we're still cash positive in the second quarter, excluding debt payments on that forecast.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
debt and interest.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
debt and interest. thanks, derek. so that's what is seasonality. i will use this to go on a little so for because -- this is why, by the way, we -- there are gaap principles.
it's because cash flow has a lot of seasonality. so we're going to be -- there was a real reason at some point when we were talking about cash burn, cash burn, cash burn because the market had real interest in where people's cash flows were and how much cash they were burning. we're all well past that. and if we keep talking about cash burn, we're going to keep commuting people because there's huge seasonality in cash in airlines.
there's huge seasonality in debt payments. and when we were -- when all of us were making large profits, we still had quarters where we had decline in cash. so that's why you go back to gaap principles, and include things like accruals and smoothing and matching principles so that you can keep yourself actually know what's going on in the airline. so anyway, that's what some of the facts.
i'm glad we're going to stop talking about cash burn and get back to talking about earnings. but anyway, that's the reason, but thanks for asking.

your next question comes from the line of stephen trent with citi.
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
good morning everybody and thanks very much for taking my question. i was just curious what you guys are seeing, if you could give a little more color. i think you mentioned that you're going to hire some pilots later this year. any color with respect to what this could mean from a headcount perspective? and is american planning to apply any esg-type filters on the hiring as some of your competitors have telegraphed that you want to diversify their base?
robert isom -- president
so yes, look, it's great news that we're looking at hiring pilots later this year. and it's due to a number of factors, most notably that we've had significant retirements over the past few years. so this is going to put us in a position to fly and be flexible wherever we need to be. from bringing pilots on though, we're incredibly excited about the work that we've been doing, both at the mainline airline and within our regional airlines as well.
we also have been marching down the path to ensure that those that are coming into our regional airlines are wholly owned and also our mainline really represent the face of the country. most notably, ensuring that we have more women and people of color that are taking the ranks of -- the pilot ranks. and so, you'll see that we have a cadet program that now has over 350 people in it. that's just going to grow in the future.
and as we look forward, we anticipate getting a substantial number of our total pilots brought in through that program. so very excited about where we're headed.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
and that program is diverse.
robert isom -- president
and that program is, by and large, designed to bring in, again, people of color and females into the pilot ranks.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
females and people of color.
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
very helpful. appreciate the color. thank you.

this completes our analyst portion of the q&a. we will now move to media questions. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of alison sider with wall street journal.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- air travel reporter
yes. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the latest issue with the 737 max and whether that creates any challenges for you all in kind of rebuilding confidence in the plane that something else has come off after all the vetting that happened sales to find the latest problem?
robert isom -- president
aly, it's robert. look, i am really pleased with boeing and the industry. we coalesce around safety. and so, with the max and -- with any aircraft, it's critically important that we take the right steps when there's any potential concerns.
and in the case of the 737 max. and these, at least for us, these 18 aircraft, we have a pretty good idea of exactly what the issue is and the remedies that need to be attended to. so the work that we're doing is with both boeing and the faa. we're waiting on a service portal to be developed, worthiness directors to be dropped and then getting the work done in those aircraft back up in the air.
we hope that that's just in a matter of weeks and not longer. in terms of the impact on our schedule, look, we've been flying the max now for four months back and incredibly successfully. passenger reaction has been really that they like the product. they like the aircraft.
and as we take a look going forward, even with 18 aircraft out of service right now, there is virtually no impact to our schedule. we've been able to use other aircraft to fund the needs for the airlines. so overall, i think we've -- as an industry with boeing and certainly with the fa, we've made all the right moves, and i have great confidence that this aircraft is going to be in the skies and the safest and most reliable for years to come.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- air travel reporter
ok. i mean have you seen any increase in book away on the maxs that are still flying? like is there any sign that customers have any elevated concerns?
robert isom -- president
not at all.
alison sider -- wall street journal -- air travel reporter
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of leslie josephs with cnbc.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
you've mentioned that bookings were ticking up. of course, looks like a much stronger summer than last year. what are your projections for after summer vacation season starts to wane? do you expect a lot of that leisure demand to go away? and do you think there's going to be enough business demand to replace it?
robert isom -- president
leslie, this is vasu. thanks for the question. look, it remains to be seen. throughout the pandemic, it's always difficult to forecast or prognosticate that far out.
those things are recovering, that difficulty remains. so it remains to be seen, as robert and doug mentioned earlier. though, for us, the real lever is our capacity. and if things change, we can change with it.
over the last year, we have any number of tools and techniques to go and make the airline pretty nimble and responding to it. so first things first is to manage the summer and then we'll treat fall as it gets closer.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
ok. and then, the bookings that you have so far, are you seeing that they drop off after august or july? or is there any one point where you see kind of a slowdown?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
we're seeing pretty consistent bookings growth throughout periods. indeed, where bookings are falling is a conscious decision on the part of the airline so that we don't do things like, for example, sell-out thanksgiving week too soon. but we see continued strong bookings as we go out there. we just want to make sure they're coming in at their --
operator
your next question comes from the line of mary schlangenstein with bloomberg news.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg news -- airlines reporter
hey, how are you? i want to ask first real quick, if i can go back to alison's question on the max, i wanted to see if you have any information or can you comment on if there's the frustration level on the fact that you haven't yet gotten a service bulletin on that repair, which originally, the talk was that those repairs would be fairly simple and straightforward. but now it's been weeks and you don't have anything yet from boeing?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
not at all. that's the fa's job, and they do it well, and we work really well with them. and as robert said, we all coalesce around safety, that's part of the process, but at least they're trusted.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg news -- airlines reporter
ok. thank you. and if i can also ask, vasu, if you could talk a little bit about the wide-bodies domestically and what plane you're flying where domestically?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
yes. mary, i can talk a little bit about it. but really, the biggest story on the wide-body is just how -- frankly, how dynamic the airline has gotten in managing capacity around the system, which is frankly easy to do in the world of scheduling. it's a lot harder to actually deliver it for our customers and do so reliably in a way that they like.
and so, through the pandemic because international demand is falling, sometimes even as opposed to 45 or 60 days from departure, we've been taking out international flights. but as we've seen strong bookings in, say, miami or what have you, we've been putting those wide-bodies in there. so a big part of it is very dynamic, and it changes a lot. what we're most encouraged about is wherever we've seen them, indeed, we've been able to deliver it on short notice and for our earlier comments in a way our customers like.
our customer satisfaction scores have indeed never been higher. the only real method beyond that to where the wide-bodies go this summer if they are concentrated disproportionately and what we call hub-to-hub markets, those are markets like miami, dfw and also our big sun belt market, especially in miami. so we're now in a place where miami to new york is all on wide-bodies, miami to los angeles on wide-bodies, miami to boston largely on wide-bodies, too. so we don't anticipate very many material changes versus what you see on the schedule.
but if things change in international, that's a real lever for us. the marginal capacity of that is probably better spent in domestic right now than what it is in most of long-haul.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg news -- airlines reporter
great. thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of david koenig with the associated press.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
thank you. good morning, folks. i guess, this is for vasu. i wanted to follow-up on what you were saying to david vernon on fares.
the 90% -- as you approach this summer, the 90% of 2019 levels, is that due in any part to more business travel? or is it pretty much just that you can get higher fares from leisure travelers? and then to follow up on that, is that pretty much leisure fares across your system, domestic and short-haul international?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
thanks for the question. and look, to be clear, that 90% of the book yields we're taking right now, there could be any number of factors that impact that they actually come in at once the summer is all said and done. but yes, it is primarily driven by lease demand growth. we are seeing signs of business growth, but it's coming off of a small base, and it's still a pretty small part of our system total.
so most of the yield growth we're seeing is from the leisure travel segment. and frankly, a lot of what yield growth is there is just because we're seeing a lot of cases where, especially on peak holidays and things like that, where, frankly, the demand for seats is greater than supply of seats, and so that's what produces higher yield.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
and that's pretty much systemwide?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
no, it's not. our system is really uneven. it's much more heavily concentrated among our domestic leisure and short-haul international markets.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
ok. thanks.

your next question comes from the line of dawn gilbertson with usa today.
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- consumer travel reporter
hey, good morning. i wanted to ask a question for you, vasu. the state department earlier this week raised the travel alerts to their highest level for most countries. i'm wondering if you have seen or expect to see any impact on bookings? and if not, why not?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
hey, dawn. good to hear from you. i'll start and others can add. but if you look at the range to be seen in the last, whatever, it's been 48 hours, maybe 96 hours since it's happened, it's been too early to tell what's going on and what its impact to bookings might be.
if indeed, there is one, we have ample tools to be able to adjust the airline should it come to pass. but then also the last thing i'll add to it is, from my earlier comments, the way we've configured the airline this summer is very much to make it resilient to just these kinds of changes where 85% of our capacity is in the domestic system, in large part because we realize that the recovery is not just going to be choppy from a demand perspective, but choppy from a market opening perspective as well. and so, by building the plan like that is something that we could deliver upon for our team and our customers and create a lot more resilience as the world recovers.

kyle arnold -- dallas morning news -- aviation writer
ok, guys. i appreciate it. i know you have some plans and you announced the plans to start hiring some pilots. do you guys have any -- will there be any need going to the year for other employee groups, flight attendants or ground workers or gate agents?
robert isom -- president
the answer to that is, yes. and you'll see that throughout our network, and it's especially from a passenger service, a team member or those folks that work on the fleet side of things, we're going to have needs throughout the network, but it's really just based on location needs more than anything else. and too soon to say anything about where we stand with our flight attendants, but i can tell you that i anticipate that there will be a need there as well.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. the part is kind of -- we have so many of our -- took this opportunity to take leads that what we're doing rather than hiring new flight attendants is bringing flight attendants back from leave earlier than their leave would have extended. so having them come back off of leaves than they would have otherwise. once we get through that, we'll need to hire, but we're not there yet.

your next question comes from the line of edward russell with skift.
edward russell -- skift -- journalist
thank you for taking my questions. robert, could you tell me a bit more about how many aircraft american needs to reactivate to fly all of its fleet this summer? and what types are still needing to be reactivated?
robert isom -- president
no. we have aircraft that are ready to go. of course, we had -- as derek mentioned in his comments, we're accelerating our reconfiguration program, our harmonization programs on the 737 and a321. so we'll have some aircraft that are caught up in that.
but the way to look at our fleet is that they're all out there and maybe not utilized as much as they will be, but we feel great about the work that our maintenance team has done to keep everything ready to file when necessary.
edward russell -- skift -- journalist
so just a follow-up, you don't have any aircraft temporarily stored anymore at this point? is that the way to characterize it?

operator
good morning, and welcome to the american airlines group first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. today's conference call is being recorded. [operator instructions] and i would now like to turn the conference over to your moderator, managing director of investor relations, mr. dan cravens.
dan cravens -- moderator, managing director of investor relations
thanks, crystal. and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the american airlines group first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. joining us on the call this morning, we have doug parker, chairman and ceo; robert isom, president; and derek kerr, chief financial officer. also on the call for our question-and-answer session are several of our senior executives, including maya leibman, steve johnson, vasu raja, alison taylor and devon may.
like we normally do, doug will start the call with an overview of our quarter and the actions we've taken during this pandemic. robert will then follow with some remarks about our commercial and other strategic initiatives. after robert's remarks, derek will follow with the details on the quarter and our operating plans going forward. after derek's comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions, and lastly, questions from the media.
[operator instructions]. before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast, capacity, fleet plans and liquidity. these statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our form 10-q for the quarter ended march 31, 2021.
in addition, we will be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. a reconciliation to those numbers to the gaap financials is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on the investor relations section of our website. a webcast of this call will also be archived on our website, and the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. so thanks again for joining us.
at this point, i'd like to turn the call over to our chairman and ceo, doug parker. 
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dan, and good morning, everybody. this morning, we reported a first-quarter pre-tax loss, excluding net special items of $3.5 billion. the loss was driven, of course, by the extreme drop in demand for air travel due to the global pandemic. our revenues in the quarter were down 62% from the same period in 2019.
in the midst of this difficult environment, the american airlines team produced remarkable results. we flew more customers than any other u.s. airline. we did so reliably and safe.
we produce the highest passenger unit revenue of any global u.s. carrier while having more available seats for sale. we completed the largest financing in airline history, a $10 billion transaction, secured by the most valuable loyalty program in the world, the aadvantage frequent flyer program. and excluding that principle, we were cash positive in the month of march, our first such month since the beginning of the pandemic.
these results and more were made possible by our incredible team. without their resiliency, creativity and compassion, we'd be facing a very difficult future. instead, thanks to their hard work and determination, we're starting to see light at the end of this very long tunnel -- this very dark tunnel, and we're on a path that has us well positioned as demand for air travel returns. that path forward is guided by what we're calling our green flag plan.
for our industry, this pandemic has been much like a yellow flag during an auto race, where everyone slows down, takes a pit stop and get their cars ready for when the race resumes at full speed. we've used this period to improve and prepare, so that when the green flag does drop, it appears to be on the horizon. american will be ready. that plan is centered on four initiatives.
i'll take a minute to walk through those at a high level, and then robert and derek will expand on what we've achieved to date and what we see on the horizon. first, we're doubling down on our commitment to operational excellence. we had a great operation in the first quarter, carrying more than 24 million passengers on nearly 340,000 flights. during our business day of the quarter, we had more than 430,000 customers flying on our aircraft.
that's the highest we've had since march 2020. our goal is to run the most reliable operation at american airlines history once everyone is back to a full schedule. and the steps we put in place, including more reliable, profitable scheduling, new tools and technology to assist our team and customers during irregular operations and our claim commitment, will ensure we achieve that goal. second, we're taking this opportunity to reconnect with our customers.
robert will talk more about what we're doing. as customers return to the skies, they will see an even better american airlines. one with the broadest and best global network has now been enhanced by new partnerships. and one with innovative technologies and procedures that make travel more convenient for our customers and ensures they feel safe and comfortable as they return to fly.
third, we're planning to build on the positive momentum we've established with our team. this past year has tested our team in ways we could have imagined, but it also brought us much closer. we worked hand-in-hand with our union leaders to ensure that team members felt cared for, even as we experienced by far the most difficult financial circumstances in our industry's history. we're committed to building on that progress and continue to work together to ensure our team feels cared for every day.
on that note, we are very happy to tell 13,000 team members they could tear up their warn notices, following the passage of the covid-19 relief act that included an extension of the payroll support program. we will continue to welcome team members back to the operations as we increase our schedule. in fact, earlier this week, we announced we will begin hiring pilots later this year to prepare for 2022 and beyond. finally and importantly, we are committed to passionately driving efficiencies across the organization.
derek will elaborate on this. but we are really proud of the aggressive and innovative ways the team has worked to position us to be more efficient on the other side of this pandemic. the efficiencies we've built into the business over the past year will drive more than $1.3 billion of permanent non-volume-related savings in 2021 and beyond. so before i turn it over to robert, i'll close with this.
we are a long way from where we need to be. this crisis is far from over, and we have to continue fighting to give our customers, shareholders and team the company they deserve. but there is no doubt, the pace of the recovery is accelerating. and thanks to our team, in a thoughtful and proactive plan as the green flag drops, american airlines is ready.
robert isom -- president
thanks, doug, and good morning, everyone. i also want to thank our entire team for everything that they've done for our airline throughout the pandemic. this phenomenal group continues to rise to the occasion and deliver for our customers every day, and we're incredibly grateful. our first-quarter revenue of $4 billion was effectively flat on a sequential basis versus the fourth quarter of 2020.
however, our demand and revenue trends accelerated significantly as the quarter progressed. in january, our total revenue was 34% of what it was in 2019. and by march, it was 46% in 2019. this trend was driven by strong leisure demand in the u.s., mexico, the caribbean and latin america.
this momentum has continued as our seven-day rolling average of system daily net bookings has reached 2019 levels this week. and this is in spite of business and long-haul international demand remaining weak, with net bookings of roughly 20% of their level -- of their 2019 levels. that said, there are early signs of recovery for business. small business demand, which was roughly 17% of our system revenue has been improving steadily as vaccination rates have increased and as markets reopen.
an increasing number of our largest corporate accounts are coming back to the office and indicating that they'll be traveling in the third quarter and confirming in-person board meetings, conferences and events for this year. importantly, we're focused on turning improved bookings and load factors into a leading unit revenue performance. we have continued to shape our network and our customer experience as nimbly and thoughtfully as possible, and we're seeing the results. the first quarter of 2021 was the third consecutive quarter in which our passenger unit revenue materially outperformed each of our network competitors.
thanks to our team, our likelihood to recommend scores have improved for the last three quarters as well. based on our results in the first quarter, we're on track to have our best ltr year since the merger. we have used the pandemic to reset our airlines that it consistently outperforms for our customers, our team and investors. the first sign of this is in our summer schedule and second-quarter capacity plan.
we expect to fly approximately 80% of our 2019 system seat capacity in the second quarter, and this increases to 90% this summer. we'll continue to do on a larger share of our assets to market where we can create unique value for our customers, and therefore, generate passenger unit revenue premium relative to our competition. when compared to 2019, we expect to find 90% of our domestic seat capacity during the summer peak and 100% in dfw and charlotte. our domestic network will constitute 85% of our system seat capacity in the summer peak.
we expect to operate 80% of our international seat capacity compared to 2019 in our peak. our organic network in the americas creates more unique choices for customers and more profitability for the airline. as such, in our summer peak, our latin american network is expected to be the same size as it was in 2019. our short long-haul latin america network will constitute approximately 12% of our system seat capacity in the summer peak.
by contrast, our operation has been much more challenged in the atlantic and pacific as those markets have yet to fully reopen. and as a result, in our peak schedule, seat capacity in those parts of our network will only be 40% of what it was during the same period in 2019. our atlantic and pacific networks will constitute just 3% of our system seat capacity in the summer peak. we expect to bring these markets back slowly and only when demand conditions warrant.
it's important to note there is significant pent-up demand for international travel, and we're seeing it most in markets like tel aviv and athens where market reopenings are leading to steady increases in demand. as borders continue to open throughout the world, we'll be ready because of the changes that we made to our fleet and network and the strength of our partnerships around the world. overall, we will deliver any increase in capacity in a more efficient and reliable fashion than we did in 2019. we've accelerated the retirement of over 150 older aircraft in our fleet, leaving american with by far the youngest fleet of our global u.s.
competitors. we intend to have all of our remaining aircraft active this summer and no longer sitting along tarmacs around the country. as derek will share in a few minutes, we'll soon complete the harmonization of our boeing 737 and airbus a321 fleet, driving superior cost efficiency, a simpler operation and a better customer experience. just as we is the past year to adapt our fleet network, we have also developed partnerships to offer our customers a seamless network in markets where we have structurally underperformed.
this has been most true on the west coast and in the northeast. we have been unable to grow these markets organically due to infrastructure constraints. however, through our recently announced partnerships with alaska and jetblue, we can now offer customers the largest network in these two regions and bring a level of competition and choice that has long been lacking. of course, to make these partnerships work, the experience must be seamless for our customers.
as we like to say, an elite customer anywhere should be treated as an elite customer everywhere. we have several initiatives under way to make that a reality, including our announcement just yesterday to deliver on the next phase of our partnership with jetblue. as we look toward the recovery, reconnecting with our customers will be centered on being the easiest airline to do business with. our goal has always been to remove as many friction points as possible, and in the first quarter, we took a number of steps to help simplify the travel experience for customers as they return to flying.
we've enhanced our travel planning tool to help customers make informed decisions on where they travel and what to expect when they get there, add a new pre-flight covid-19 testing options, expanded acceptance of verifly, the mobile health wallet that simplifies and verify travel requirements. verifly is now accepted for all of our international flights in the u.s. to the u.s. and our flights from the u.s.
to 11 countries. our partners, aer lingus, british airways, iberia, japan airlines, now also accept verifly. building a curb to get contactless journey will be an ongoing effort as we reimagine safe and convenient travel in a post-covid era. at dfw, we have expanded our touch technology trial to allow customers to use biometric scanners to check their bag's prior to departure, and we'll utilize that same technology to allow customers to gain entrance to an admirals club lounge later this year.
and today, as we celebrate earth day, i want to highlight some important strides we've made to run a more sustainable airline. the most important thing any airline can do is retire older aircraft and replace them with new, more fuel-efficient aircraft. and we've done that at american, with $24 billion of investment over the past seven years and a retirement of more than 650 older aircraft. but we need to do more to reach our goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and we have our eye on sustainable aviation fuel.
saf is the most promising advancement available to us in the near to mid-term. we've been taking delivery of saf for almost a year, and in the first quarter, we reached innovative offsetting agreements with two of our customers, deloitte and kuehne+nagel. we appreciate that the biden administration and many in congress have engaged with our industry on climate issues or encouraged by the fact that we have common goals, especially when it comes to saf. so in summary, over the past year, we've greatly simplified and modernized our fleet, rationalized our network and made many changes to our business and operations to ensure customers have flexibility and peace of mind when they return to travel.
we're encouraged by the trends in demand for air travel across all sectors and believe american is well-positioned for the recovery in the months and years ahead. and with that, i'll turn it over to derek.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
thanks, robert, and good morning, everyone. before i begin my remarks, i too want to take the opportunity to thank our team. their leadership and hard work truly embodies what american airlines team members are known for. this morning, we reported a first-quarter gaap net loss of 1.3 billion or $1.97 per share.
excluding net special credits, we reported a net loss of 2.7 billion or $4.32 per share. robert talked about many of the commercial activities we're working on and the trends we're seeing in the demand environment, so i'll focus my remarks on the cost side of our p&l and our balance sheet as we look to the future. throughout the entire pandemic, we have remained focused on keeping our capacity aligned with demand while preserving the maximum amount of flexibility to respond as demand returns. we took aggressive actions to reduce our cost structure, and we have reduced our first-quarter total operating expense, excluding net special items, by 26% versus 2020 on a 39% reduction in total capacity.
nonfuel operating expenses, excluding net special credits, were up 6% sequentially from the fourth quarter as we gradually added back capacity. we ended the first quarter with 17.3 billion in total available liquidity, including approximately 3.1 billion of psp2 funds we received from the treasury department during the quarter. we were recently notified that this amount will be increased by approximately $463 million to be received in the second quarter. in addition, we expect to receive 3.3 billion of psp3 funds by the end of the second quarter.
we saw positive trends in our daily cash burn rate throughout the quarter. our average daily cash burn was approximately 27 million per day, which came in better than our guidance of 30 million per day. this happened despite the drop-off in demand we saw in january and february and a significant increase in fuel prices at the beginning of the quarter. as a reminder, our definition of cash burn includes approximately 9 million per day of regular debt principal and cash severance payments.
for the month of march, our estimated average daily cash burn rate was approximately 4 million per day. and excluding approximately 8 million per day of regular debt principal and cash severance payments made in march. as doug noted, the company's cash burn rate turned positive for the month. during the quarter, our treasury team did a phenomenal job of continuing to strengthen our liquidity through a series of capital market transactions.
notably, we completed our 10 billion financing transaction that was backed by the aadvantage program at a blended rate of 5.6%, less than half of what we would have been able to do last summer, and use those proceeds to repay in full the 550 million secured loan we had with the treasury department. we also had 530 million of aircraft amortization payments, including the maturity of our 2011-1wtc, which, together with mortgage maturities, resulted in 35 mainline aircraft and nine regional aircraft becoming unencumbered. during the quarter, we also repaid in full our 2.8 billion of revolving credit facilities. this was a liquidity-neutral transaction that reduced the company's outstanding debt by 2.8 billion.
importantly, we still retain the flexibility to either draw upon these revolving commitments again as needed or leave them undrawn until october 2024. during the quarter, we took delivery of seven boeing 737 max aircraft, and we expect to take one more delivery later this year. as a reminder, these aircraft were built while the max was grounded and were efficiently financed through leasing transactions. in addition, we recently exercised our remaining deferral rights on 18 boeing 737 max aircraft that were previously scheduled to be delivered in 2021 and 2022.
these deliveries are now expected to occur in 2023 and 2024. lastly, we reached an agreement with boeing related to our remaining 787-8 deliveries. under the revised terms of the agreement, we have elected to defer and convert five 787-8 aircraft to 787-9 aircraft. these deliveries are now expected to occur in 2023.
the remaining 14 deliveries of 787-8 aircraft have been rescheduled to occur by the end of the first quarter of 2022, and all of these aircraft will retain their existing financings. in january, the company made 241 million in contributions to its pension plans and marks the new covid-19 relief bill, included, among other things, funding relief for single employer pension plans. these new funding rules reduced the company's remaining required cash contribution for 2021 to zero, while lowering our projected required contributions over the next five years by over 2 billion. under these new provisions for funding purposes, the combined plans are expected to be funded in excess of 90% for plan year 2021.
as doug and robert mentioned, we are starting to see signs of what appears to be a strong economic recovery. this fantastic news makes our 1.3 billion of efficiency measures even more important as we repair our business for the return to a more normal environment. on the fleet side, we have talked a lot about our fleet simplification efforts and the elimination of smaller sub-fleets, which resulted in the removal of more than 150 older and inefficient aircraft. many of these aircraft -- retired aircraft have already been sold.
and by may, we will have completed disposal of all of our 730 -- 767 aircraft and embraer 190 aircraft, generating more than 300 million in proceeds. our fleet changes are expected to drive significant operational and cost savings in 2021 and beyond. with only four mainline aircraft types remaining, we will see improved aircraft utilization and operational efficiencies in the back half of 2021 through the increase in gauge and reduction in inactive aircraft, including spares and maintenance allocations. additionally, our fleet harmonization project is picking up steam, and we expect to have our entire 737 fleet completed in the second quarter of this year.
these aircraft have 172 seats and come with larger overhead bins and in-seat power. we expect to have the a321 fleet completed by the end of this year. aside from a better customer experience, these projects will provide significant opportunities to improve revenue production and lower our unit cost now and well into the future. so when demand returns to more normalized levels, we'll be able to fly -- efficiently fly 2019 levels of capacity with approximately 10% fewer aircraft.
in terms of our balance sheet following our transactions in the first quarter, 32% of our outstanding debt is prepayable without penalty. after all the covid-related financings we have completed to date, our average cost of debt is approximately 4.5%. as we have said in the past, we will naturally reduce our debt from where we are today by 8 to 10 billion over the next five years through regularly scheduled debt amortization. we know going forward that since we are now starting at a higher debt level on account of pandemic-related debt, we will need to delever even more.
in the near term, we plan to maintain higher liquidity levels until we are generating sustained positive cash flow. once this occurs, when combined with our efficiency measures and a lower capex profile, we plan to use any excess cash flow to more strategically delever our balance sheet by proactively retiring prepayable debt and concurrently increasing our unencumbered assets. as part of our plan, we also anticipate resetting our target minimum liquidity level. overall, we expect second-quarter total capacity to be down approximately 20 to 25% versus second quarter of 2019.
with these capacity and demand assumptions, we expect to see a significant increase in our revenue versus the first quarter with our total revenue to be down approximately 40% versus the second quarter of 2019. these inputs lead to an estimated second-quarter pre-tax margin, excluding net special items of between negative 27 and 30%. we presently expect to end the second quarter with approximately 19.5 billion in total available liquidity, which includes the additional psp2 and psp3 funds i mentioned earlier. that would be the highest liquidity position in company history and our fifth consecutive quarter of increased liquidity despite the demand-driven operating losses we have incurred over that period.
given these projected liquidity levels and the positive cash and demand trends, we are no longer looking to raise liquidity at american for the first time since the pandemic struck. for the full-year 2021, our debt principal payments will be 2.8 billion, excluding the prepayment of our revolving credit facilities. in the second quarter, we expect to pay down 595 million of aircraft and engine debt in addition to the 250 million pdp facility we paid off earlier this month. our full-year capex is still expected to remain minimal.
non-aircraft capex will be 900 million. and due to our negotiated settlements with boeing attractive aircraft financing and our already modernized fleet, our net aircraft capex, including pdps, will be an inflow of 1 billion. while we feel great about how much we have accomplished, we recognize that we still have a long way to go to get our business back to normal. our team has done an amazing job of bolstering our liquidity, conserving cash and driving efficiencies throughout the organization, and we are very well positioned for the future.
and with that, i'll open up the line for analyst questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of jamie baker with j.p. morgan. your line is now open.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody. so doug, i think it was like three or four years ago, you had a slide at our conference, it was entitled ""there they go again."" it was a list of airline behaviors that you were wanting investors to keep an eye out for. it was a cool slide actually. so two bullets on that stood out: expanding service to markets that don't touch a hub and establishing new hubs.
could you help frame the seattle expansion against that slide? it's not like the slide was written in stone, and you carried it down from mount sinai or anything. i'm just having trouble reconciling it in the current environment.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. i'll do it at a high level and then vasu can chime in with more details if you'd like, jamie. so yes, look, that's not a new hub is the answer. there's already a hub there.
it's alaska's, near our partner. and we are simply making that hub stronger by adding -- by having alliance with alaska, whereby we can do things they can't do or they wouldn't be able to do without an investment that wouldn't make sense by buying international because we have international aircraft. and they can do things that we can't do, which is feed those flights with their already existing seattle hub. so it's not a new hub.
if it were yet, if you see that be concerned. happy to note that hasn't happened since we put that there. so anyway, that's the distinction.
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer -- analyst
yes. jamie, this is vasu. i'll add to that. actually, we see seattle as being really intellectually consistent with that.
and for us, it's pretty simple, that we go create value for customers by being relevant and being relevant to the biggest markets. and in order to go create a legitimate, valuable and profitable international network, we need to be able to launch flights for international markets. and for us, historically, on the west coast, we've had a very, very small presence, most mainly in the pacific northwest, where we've had almost no presence. with this, which is a very creative deal, what we're doing is we're flying things like seattle to heathrow or seattle to bangalore, all of which feed off of that huge local market that alaska has cultivated.
it draws from the connectivity of the seattle hub. and we've been really encouraged with the results, not just across the west coast, but really across the system. alaska airlines is increasingly emerging as one of if not our largest codeshare partner, and we are seeing a huge customer benefit all up and down the west coast. actually, as we look at it, we are creating close to 300,000 -- about 300,000 customers are now able to experience aa in alaska, where before, they had no competitive option or they had one or two competitive options in the marketplace.
and the market is responding. we've set records for aadvantage enrollments, but the two markets where our enrollments are growing the most are all the markets in the west coast partnership, everything from san diego, north to seattle, and the other ones are new york and boston. so we see it actually being really consistent and a really effective and wise way to go and develop a level of network comprehensiveness that would be too impossible to do on own.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok, that's really helpful. and then, a follow-up, this one, a quick one on fuel, maybe for robert or derek. a question i repeatedly receive is why haven't management adjusted capacity to account for $2.50 jet kero. and i know you can't speak for the industry.
but for american, is there a certain period of time that you need to be convinced that higher fuel is gonna be sustained? is there just too much uncertainty around 2022 revenue to be making capacity decisions today? just looking for some color on how you would answer the question that i'm getting every day and i imagine my competitors are as well. thanks in advance.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
jamie, i'll go first level because you and i have been doing this a long time. look, when oil prices move this quickly, it's really hard to have responses that what's happened here. it's run up very quickly. and we're already selling all the capacity that's out there.
so what i know is, what i believe is, and it's been the history in our business, if this is a new normal, you will see adjustments. you'll see adjustments in capacity, which will result in changes in pricing. it just don't happen that quickly. and it also takes a while for everyone to come to the conclusion that this is real.
but on a 2014 was a pretty good year in the airline business and brent averaged $100 a barrel. so this is -- we know this is -- we'll adapt if this is the new normal. but right now, in the very near term, it's hard to adapt. robert?
robert isom -- president
doug, this will come into balance. and fuel prices run up very, very quickly. as we take a look at things, there must be an impact on capacity and pricing in the long run.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. thank you, all three of you. take care.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie.

our next question comes from the line of conor cunningham with mkm partners. your line is now open.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for the time.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, conor. hi.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
when listening to delta and united's call, a huge portion of their script is about premium products and how they think the structural change happening. i don't think you guys mentioned much about that. i was wondering if you could just speak to how your different products are performing right now. and do you actually agree that there is a structural change happening, where leisure travelers are trying to book up more toward premium seats?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer -- analyst
conor, this is vasu. i can start that one, and others may chime in, too. look, we certainly, as most, definitely see a change where there's customers who are much more willing to buy premium than before. indeed, our premium revenue across our domestic system for much of the quarter was actually higher than what it was in 2019, which is pretty promising.
but we spent a lot of time looking at this. and there's a component of it which certainly seems very promising, but it still seems early to say whether this thing is structural or not. at least in our own system, we took a lot of widebodies out of international fly, and we deployed them into domestic. we were really encouraged by what we saw where there are a lot of customers with a lot more disposable income who would travel on leisure trip, and they would not only pay for the lie-flat product, they would pay a premium versus other non-lie-flat products in the marketplace.
and so that's certainly been an encouraging thing. but what we don't know is so much of that trip behavior also, it was people leaving on a thursday, coming back on a monday. so we do think that with more disposable income, there will be some interest in the consumer to have more experiences, to pay more for those experiences. what we don't know is how to size the magnitude of it because there's a lot of things that certainly as been for american airlines that we did that was very unique for the last several months.
and we don't yet know how much of a structural change that is. but to the earlier point, the beauty of the airline, and we -- this pandemic has proved over and over again is that we can change the -- where the airplanes go very, very quickly. and with that, we can also change the product design pretty quickly, too. so this is something that we are looking at.
it is a similar trend that we're seeing. time will tell how structural it is though.
robert isom -- president
thanks, vasu. i'll just add, we're -- hey, look, we're ready for it. we've been preparing for a long time not just in selling the product, which vasu has talked about, but the hard product as well. so the fleet is ready from a cabin configuration perspective, whether that's business class cabins or premium economy that we've put in to all of our widebodies.
and then, just as we look at travel recovery and ways to service, you're going to see that we are adding back amenities that will allow us to sell and bundle in different ways. so everything from our five-star service that's come back, to the opening of our flagship lounges, which are best in the industry, we have a way to sell and to service every customer at every end of the spectrum in terms of demand. so we feel really good about how we're set up to whatever environment that we find ourselves in.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok, appreciate it. and then, just on the cost structure, i mean, investors are trying to get comfortable with the stories on the cost side for the airlines in general. so i mean, clearly, inflationary pressures. but curious if you can talk to any of the tailwinds that you might be having that happened in 2022 outside of just bringing back capacity to 2019 levels.
the reason why i asked is i would have thought, given some of the structural changes you've had within fleet simplification and so on, that 4q would have had a little bit more leverage to it. so any details would be helpful. 
robert isom -- president
yes, i think, conor, in the fourth quarter, i mean, the story and i touched a little bit about here is we built the airline to fly more in the fourth quarter without a doubt. two of the issues, one is the boeing 787-8s, which are not here, we had assumed they were gonna be in the schedule. so we have 787 pilots. we have crews ready to fly those aircraft.
but we unfortunately had to pull them out of the schedule in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. the other thing from a capacity perspective that we're all dealing with right now is -- on the regional side is pilot supportability on the regional side, which will resolve itself over time. but as the mainline is hiring up, a lot of places they go to get pilots is on the regional. so we're probably not flying as much regional as we would have flown.
so i think from a casm perspective, that's what drove it a little bit higher in the fourth quarter without a doubt versus where we had planned. so we are not flying exactly what we would have flown and where we got, and the cost structure is there. as we go forward, the tailwinds are really that -- i mean, the $1.3 billion worth of cost reductions is permanent. it's gonna be in there.
as we look into next year, we haven't done the plan yet so that's why it's really hard for me to give any kind of guide on a casm for next year. we do see these inflationary hits to -- mostly from a salary perspective, a vendor perspective, those kind of things, and fuel, as i talked about, that we'll have to overcome as we look at the plan for next year, and we'll do that as we dig through the process. but we'll have the tailwinds of the costs coming out that we did from an efficiency standpoint and also the -- number one, getting out of the aircraft types and modifying the aircraft to be the same all across from the oasis project will benefit us a lot as we go into 2022.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, and conor, just because we haven't talked -- we didn't spend a lot of time talking about it, the $1.3 billion, yes, we talked about a lot, but just for others who may not have been following us closely. those are real. they're in the airline. we -- the way we look at this is we go back fly the 2019 schedule today, produce the same rasms and save that amount.
it's a combination. it's a lot of things, but the largest ones are $500 million or so in management payroll. and as derek said, all the efficiencies you get from eliminating so many sub fleets, training and otherwise. so those are in there the tailwinds to offset the inflationary pressures you are talking about.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok, appreciate it.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, conor.

our next question comes from the line of sheila kahyaoglu with jefferies. your line is now open.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning, and thank you for the time, guys. maybe if we could talk about the transatlantic market. it's begun to open up a little bit more and maybe heading into 2022. but your passenger revenues are still down about 75%.
how do you think about the cadence of that recovery?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer -- analyst
hey, this is vasu. i can take that one. look, we're -- we've been really encouraged by what we've seen over the last, let's call it, three or four weeks at international at large, but especially at transatlantic. certainly, after the regulatory restrictions changed, we saw a big spike in bookings in the two or three days after it, but at -- which is it's not that surprising.
what has been more encouraging to us is that it's really sustained itself. but what we are seeing out there is what -- you see from us right now is a little bit of cautious optimism. in november and december, we are absolutely seeing bookings coming in at a greater rate than what we saw in 2019. a lot of that has a pent-up demand effect.
as we get into next year, with every passing week, we see our bookings step up more and more across transatlantic. and so we're really encouraged by that. but the big variable will be when corporates start returning back to office and start traveling again for business, which we anticipate being more in the q1 time frame than in the q4 time frame. but more so for us, we -- our transatlantic network is really concentrated around london.
so we don't anticipate as much of a business recovery in q4, but we are seeing a really, really meaningful leisure recovery. and all the more so as british airways builds back its connecting schedule at heathrow, we anticipate taking an increasing amount of demand as q4 goes along. so though you see that number in aggregate, we see that something as changing a lot from where we are in october, to november, to january and beyond.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you.

our next question comes from the line of david vernon with bernstein. your line is now open.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
thanks, operator, and thanks, guys, for taking the question. so doug and robert, we sat down a little bit before the pandemic. and you had sort of laid out a picture where american had been lagging on some of the customer-facing information technology stuff that was kind of constraining the operation in ways like not letting you book up to a higher load factor because of the denied boarding practice, the ability to kind of pay for upgrades, dynamic pricing on frequent flyer tickets, all that stuff. a lot of it sounded like it-driven initiatives.
and i was wondering, kind of coming out of the crisis, as we start to look out over the next couple of years, is there still catch-up work you need to do to bring yourself at parity with peers in terms of the way they're monetizing capacity? or have you kind of closed that gap through this crisis?
maya leibman -- chief information officer
david, this is maya. and i'm proud to say that over the last several years, we really have closed the gap on a number of our technology initiatives, including some of the ones that you rattled off, like dynamic pricing and allowing [inaudible] higher load factors and a lot of standby on day of departure activity. so we've really used the pandemic as an opportunity to really identify those gaps and to close them and really focus on a lot of the other things that we've been talking about that will be tailwinds for next year like our seamless partnerships and making that a better customer experience for our customers with our west coast and northeast alliances.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
and is there a way to frame kind of what that uplift might be in terms of load factor or sort of ancillary revenue growth? it looks like the other revenue line is performing pretty well. but is there a way to kind of put a number around some of these things?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer -- analyst
hey, this is vasu. we're in the early stages of doing that as we build next year's plan. but probably, our top-line initiative is making sure that all of these partnerships are really integrated and seamless for the customer, that a lot of the long-standing issues that have existed in co-sharing relationships really get alleviated pretty quickly. and look, we are pretty pleased with that.
we've made a lot of progress with alaska and jetblue, and what we're seeing is very encouraging. to my earlier comments, we're seeing a lot of customers come in. had a meaningful amount of revenue production that's there, too, that -- and as we looked at it in q3, it was a massive benefit to customers. we estimate its benefit in about 0.5% to a percentage point of system revenue, but something which is a lot more meaningful to a new york and boston and west coast network, which was operating at 50% of historical levels.
so we do think there's a lot of uplift to the whole thing without a lot of investment further.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
all right. thanks a lot, guys.
operator
our next question comes from the line of dan mckenzie with seaport global. your line is now open.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, guys. the first question here is just a housecleaning question from a prior question. the oasis project, is that included in the $1.3 billion of structural cost savings? or is that above and beyond? and then, just related to that, if that had been fully implemented in 2019, how much would that have contributed to pre-tax income? 
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yes, it is included. it's just it added more seats in some of the aircraft. and from an operational benefit, it will help out a lot because, as we swap the aircraft, they will both be in that. so it is in that because we reduced the aircraft types, but it's included in that number.
what it's going to do is benefit, number one, from a casm perspective because we'll have more seats and from a revenue perspective because we'll be able to sell more seats. 
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yeah, understood. ok, second question here, what is the aggregate wallet spend, say, a fortune 1000 accounts in the northeast that american can now access for the first time as a result of the northeast alliance? so accounts that really where you had no shot at winning pre the relationship with jetblue versus now. you walk in. you sit down with the corporate travel managers.
you can actually put together a competitive network solution. and then, just related to that, potential aggregate spend, what would american's fair share -- american and jetblue's fair share be of that? 
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer -- analyst
hey, dan, this is vasu. thanks for the question. and i appreciate what you're trying to get at, which is effectively, how much more market can we access than what american could access on its own? and while -- i don't have specific numbers in some cases. we've got to be a little bit careful in what we share about it.
for us, as we see it, in new york, historically, we might have been a 25% player. but we were competing for something which was actually like 10% to 15% of the available business travel market at large, not just the corporate market. and so -- in large part because, though we had a really great product in heathrow or in the transcon market, if we couldn't get you very effectively to toronto, at some point, customers, especially larger accounts or power travelers, business to our customers, just stop flying us. and now as we see it, we have the best network between aa and jetblue.
we've gone from a world where we have four trips a day, jfk, san francisco, to one where we'll have a 12, 13, 14 trips a day where all of our transcon product is full flat. we've taken the 50-seat rj out of new york all together. so when you think about new york, it's a business travel market which is not two of three times larger than the next biggest market, but several orders of magnitude more than that. and that's all in our market that we get to compete for.
and when we get to compete for it, we see in new york whose rasms instead of underperforming the system by 10% to 15% can perform in line with the system.
robert isom -- president
hey, dan, i just wanna go back and just add one more point. regarding the fleet harmonization project, which we're almost done with, we only have, i think, 60 of the 321s that are remaining. it will be complete by the first quarter. derek mentioned that, in the $1.3 billion, so much of the savings in terms of actual commonality and what we can take out in terms of reduction of fleet sizes and being able to operate the airline more efficient, that's included in the $1.3 billion.
what's that though is, look, we are adding seats, so -- at very, very low marginal costs. so going from 160 seats on the 73s up to 172, and then on average, adding a few seats to the 321s as well, that's a benefit that we'll be seeing in run rates going forward, from a revenue perspective.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yeah, the incremental revenue that you gain. that was actually my question. that's what i was trying to get at. but thanks for the time you guys.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dan.

our next question comes from the line of stephen trent with citi. your line is now open.
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen, and thanks for taking my question. i just had a quick one, looking at your investment. so you guys committed to invest in jetsmart and gol in south america. you, of course, have this tie-up with jetblue in the united states.
when you think about other international corridors, do you see any opportunities for similar kinds of tie-ups, for example, outside of the oneworld alliance? 
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer -- analyst
hey, this is vasu, stephen. i can start on that one. look, we -- ultimately, what we want to do is create the most comprehensive network for our customers. and whether it is a code share, an investment, a joint venture, whatever it is, we don't see them as end in themselves.
those are just simply means through which we can create something really comprehensive for our customers. and in many parts of the world, we would love to be able to do it all just organically with american airlines mettle. that's not always possible from regulatory or other reasons. and so based on that, we made -- employ different mechanics, whether it is an investment, a code share, a loyalty partnership.
and so it will change out there. but for us, the true north is creating the most comprehensive global network. and we see that whether it's -- we've seen the benefits for consumers in the northeast and the west coast. as we look at south america, really has less to do with investments and more that -- the one thing we can't do for the south american customer is carry them within south america.
and so we're always on the lookout for partners that can help us do that and create more value for the customer and how we go and partnerships together as a sort of second order issue. 
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
i appreciate that, vasu. and just one very quick follow-up. how are you guys thinking longer term about your pipeline of pilots and when you think about retirement in the next five to seven years and what have you?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
so stephen, i'll take that one. look, pilot profession, it's never been a better time to get into it. and what i'll tell you is, we will attract people to the profession given the kind of starting salaries that we are offering right now and ultimately what pilots top out at. so i do see this is ultimately an economic issue that will be solved.
you've seen us do some things recently with regional pilots to make sure that they stay in position and progress on to american airlines. and we'll continue to monitor that. over time, just as we saw a few years back, this will be brought into balance just simply based on economics. people will wanna come into the profession. 
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
ok, i appreciate that. thank you for the time.

next question comes from the line of chris stathoulopoulos with susquehanna. your line is now open.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
thank you, and thanks for taking my question. good morning. so on headcount, how should we think about ftes in 2022 and if possible 2023? just could you run your network at or above 2019 capacity on fewer ftes relative to 2019?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think -- i mean, we have taken out a significant amount of headcount out of the company. that's part -- that mostly what the $1.3 billion of cost reductions -- permanent cost reductions are. as doug alluded to, yes, half -- $500 million of that is management headcount, $600 million of it is productivity at the other areas with throughout the company. so yes, we will run.
i don't have a number for the 2022 plan because we haven't put that together yet. but that is the significant portion of what that's $1.3 billion worth of permanent cost reductions are. it's mostly in the headcount and the personnel side of things at american airlines.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
ok. and the second question, on the corporate side. so you mentioned a full recovery by year-end 2022. just curious what the mix of users is here.
i know you mentioned industrials, healthcare and i think one other group. but are your surveys showing a mix similar to pre-pandemic travel? or has it shifted? and is your outlook contemplating the same type of travel, meaning both in user type and frequency? thanks.
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer -- analyst
this is vasu. and i can help with that. look, our -- as we see, you're exactly right, certain industries and verticals are traveling more than others. we do anticipate there being a rebound across all of them, because at this point, all industry verticals are improving.
they are just a different point in the improvement curve. and more critically and more importantly to your question, what we see is that even in sectors where travel is less bad, that's the rate of progress we're seeing is mirroring those sectors where travel is more -- relatively more returns. so we do think we have some real confidence that, indeed, corporate travel is likely to come back. as doug and robert mentioned earlier in their remarks, there is an immense amount of pent-up demand.
and we find that once people start to travel, they continue to do so. very importantly though, for us and our system, we have a lot of -- a lot of our business style demand is small- and medium-sized business, really across the southeast and the southwest. and already -- i mean, we're seeing -- like on a traffic basis, that is very well recovered. on a revenue basis, that will start to recover as people come back and pay us more and fly more, frankly.
robert isom -- president
hi, vasu, i'll add to this. alison taylor just held our corporate customer advisory board meeting down in miami. i was able to attend as well for a part of it. and that brings together our top 50 corporate customers and those that are responsible for procurement of travel at those companies.
i was really pleased to hear just over and over again about, look, we have to get back to the office. and once we get back to the office, travel is going to come. so it's not surprising that the industrials and healthcare and pharmaceuticals are leading us right now. they're back in the office.
they've got to take care of us and put food on the table. so that's happening. what's going to come next is some of the other banking and financial services, entertainment, as those get back into the office in the start of the new year, they're going to come back to just as we are seeing in some of these other sectors.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, chris, it's doug, just data around just to support some what robert just told you, i talked about how, in july, we were up to 64% of our 2019 levels in terms of business revenue. there's a big difference between large companies, those that we have on corporate discount programs, and our small and medium business. in that 64%, the large corporates are 35% on a year over two-year basis. and the small and medium business is 83%.
so -- what it says to me is what robert just said. people are back and traveling. when the large corporates get back to work, they'll travel. it's less about sectors, more about people just getting comfortable bringing people back into the office.
those companies that don't have large headquarters and large hr departments are out flying because they need to across all sectors. those companies that are larger organizations and need to worry about those things more aren't yet back. they were starting to come back, but they'll get up into the same ranges. that's where business wants to be.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of helane becker with cowen. your line is now open.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi, everybody. i hope you are all doing well.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
we are, helane. how are you?
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
i'm ok. i guess, i'll see you tomorrow night. and by the way, congratulations.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
oh, thank you.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
so here's my question really for derek. interest expense, i think, in the third quarter was $476 million, i want to say. can you just talk about debt paydown and the cadence of that and how it's going to look over the next couple of years in the context of you going from $15 billion -- i think you said in the press release $15 billion of debt pay down by 2025?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yeah. well, i can give you what our scheduled debt paydowns are over the next few years. so we said we're going to pay down $4.4 billion this year. next year is $2.5 billion.
the year after that, i would just say it's around $3 billion to $3.5 billion each year as we go forward. so -- but we will -- but we do plan -- just as i talked about on the call, we do plan on financing aircraft in this environment going forward. so the net debt will be a little bit different than that. so the $10 billion will come off, let's just call it, $2 billion a year over the next five years, that will reduce that.
what we do on the other five, we had talked about $1 billion already went at -- in 2021. so we did the paydown of the spare parts loan. we -- also, because of the recovery, it slowed a little bit. we are going to hold on to cash and hold on to cash where we're at today.
once we feel we are comfortable with that, i think we will quickly use the excess cash to pay off most of the remaining $4 billion. it just depends on where our cash balance is. it depends on how it will grow over time. but i would expect it to be sooner than later as long as the recovery happens, business comes back and the earnings are there to do that.
so the prepayment would be upfront. the debt paydown, over time, the $10 billion will be over ratably over time. i don't think we have any big, huge debt payments. there's a $750 million one in 2022 that we have.
nothing huge going forward. so i would look at it that way. it's pretty ratably, the $10 billion over the next four years. and then, we would try to attack the other $4 billion as soon as we feel comfortable and have excess cash that we can take it down to that $10 billion to $12 billion.
we're at 18 today. so we would most likely do it early. or as i said in the comments, we could use cash to pay for aircraft and just not add the debt instead of paying off any prepayable debt. so that's the plan that we have today.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok, that's very helpful. thank you. and then, on the 787s, i think those were gonna be leased in aircraft from boc aviation. are you -- does the delays change any of the financing arrangements for those aircraft? 
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
no, it does not change the financing of the aircraft. still leased in.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi. your line is now open.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, good morning. a question for doug. i thought it was interesting in the prepared comments that more capacity versus peers and more revenue versus peers was called out. is that the main goal of the company at this point, more revenue? or do relative margins matter? and to what extent is profitability a priority for the board at all? or does it not even come up in conversations given how high liquidity is? what is the board trying to solve for?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
for relative margins, duane, and we feel really good about that. the reason i talked so much about the absolute growth at this point in time is because we're all working to add back capacity and to get to where we can meet the demand that we know is coming. so we are really proud of what the team has done to get back more capacity than others, to take care of more customers than others, and to do so, obviously, safely and efficiently and to do so in a way that has us run in a great operation right now. but of course, that's not the goal of the company.
it's just a larger -- the goal of the company is to maximize shareholder value for the long term. and the way we'll do that is producing returns. and what we feel very good about is our ability as we come out of this to improve our relative margins certainly versus atlantic. i think probably as everybody as you compare them back to 2019 or other years.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
and just a quick housekeeping, and i appreciate you taking the questions. just looking into the fourth quarter, do you expect the operating cash burn to be larger than the $1.7 billion burn in 3q? and i'm not sure if you have the calc, but can you speak to the daily cash burn estimate? are we going to head back to there? thanks for taking the questions.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
we -- go ahead.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. please.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
no. i would say, we're not hitting back there. the fourth quarter is a -- seasonally, you do burn cash in the fourth quarter.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
i hear you. but i go back through every fourth quarter since you guys merged, and there's no negative operating cash burn. understand revenue is depressed, fuel is a little bit higher, but operating cash flow is typically positive in the fourth quarter. 
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, duane, we don't -- operating cash flow, but the seasonality does -- in profitable years, as revenue -- as cash declining, and we exceptionally comfortable with where the cash is. that operational cash flow will track with the earnings estimate that derek gave.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you for taking the questions.

our next question comes from the line of andrew didora with bank of america. your line is now open.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, good morning, everyone. so as american keeps ramping up capacity maybe a little bit quicker than your network peers and with your vaccine mandate upcoming, just curious, are you planning your network or staffing any differently into peak holiday season? and how do you think about the operational risks around that?
robert isom -- president
hey, andrew, it's robert. we're getting ready for the holiday season. we expect a lot of passengers, tremendous pent-up demand, especially as vaccinations take hold and infection rates decline, and we're gonna be ready. look, we have to get ready for the holidays always.
and this year, we're doing our best to make sure that we have the right people in the right places at the right times. and that's the effort. and we are taking the appropriate precautions where necessary. but we'll find a full schedule as we go into the holidays and looking forward to it.
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer -- analyst
hey, andrew, this is vasu. one important thing to note, just clarifying your question also is, the absolute asm production of american airlines in any month in the q -- in the fourth quarter is actually less than the absolute asm that we are producing in july, right? so first, very much -- for where we have been, being able to go and get the big pools of demand that have been out there in geographies that are really favorable to us has really worked out. but as things shape up, we are very much managing to is the relative profitability of the airline. so just to clarify, so that gets lost in the year over year or the versus 2019 comparisons. 
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's a fair point. then just second, maybe to ask the fuel question a little bit differently. i think i know the answer to this. but over the past one year, one-year-plus, did you ever consider introducing a hedging policy? and do you think that this is an option you could rethink going forward? thanks.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, andrew, you never see. we've been quite happy being unhedged now for however many years tends to go. i'm sorry, what?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
2008.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
2008 derek tells me that we stopped hedging, so -- and that feels right to us. what we find is -- what i said is over time, the industry adjusts. and what generally happens is we end up paying a premium for the hedge without much benefit at all. so anyway, like i said, i don't want to say we won't ever do it, but it's not something we've begun to look at in this run, i can tell you that.
so we prefer actually -- we think we have a reasonable economic hedge in terms of what happens with fuel prices and the economy as well. so all those things come together and have us -- tell you, but not right now.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of mike linenberg with deutsche bank. your line is now open.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
good morning, everyone. derek, you talked about the delayed 787s as providing or creating a bit of a casm headwind in the fourth quarter. can you just remind us how many airplanes -- how many incremental 78s were you supposed to have in the 4q? and how many percentage points of headwind is that, just roughly?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
well, it depends on when we were thinking. but earlier, we were supposed to have all 13 in 2021. that schedule has changed weekly. we had -- if you go back to last quarter, we probably had six of them built into the schedule, six asms.
it's probably a point of asms that we had to take out of the schedule. but that's really what's driving a lot of this. and then, as i said, the regional -- we have had a pull down in asms from a regional perspective, just the -- so pilot supportability, which we will -- which we're getting all under control right now. but both of those have caused a reduction in the asms that we would have flown in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the 788s.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. and then, just my second question, and this is either doug or robert. can you be willing to share with us where you stand on vaccinations across your employee work group? and then, just any thoughts on the testing, which -- it seems like every carrier is going to have exemption issues and they're going to have to test. and we're hearing that the costs are high, they're not, you don't have guidance from the government.
is it a meaningful cost headwind that we have to worry about? or anything that you can share on that topic would be great. thanks.
robert isom -- president
hey, i'll start. it's robert. look, the vast majority of our team members are vaccinated. and we're working through the process.
we set a november 24 deadline for vaccination or a combination of request to be provided. we don't expect anybody to leave american airlines. and certainly, they're gonna be out there helping us during the holidays. so no issues there.
we don't know what exactly an accommodation would look like for, the minimal number of people that actually apply for that. but it's likely to be some combination of masking, self-declaration and testing. in that testing, we don't know the details of. so we are working through that.
and the -- as time goes on, we'll be able to fill you in.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, thanks, robert. and mike, look, i certainly wouldn't be adding any cost in your forecast for this. so to the extent there will be testing going on, it would be for those who have chosen, still have to be vaccinated. if they have religious or medical exemption, in that we are accommodating while they're still work.
i don't suspect that will be an extremely high percentage of the employees. and i don't -- and i can't even imagine that that's a material cost to test those individuals. maybe osha standard is once a week. so i don't know where we end up.
we're working through the accommodation process with our unions. but yes, that's -- i don't know -- first i heard this cost issue, i would do everything i could to try and you don't have to worry about that piece. as to the -- again, just to follow -- just to reinforce what robert said, and i think it was part of a little bit of andrew's question, that certainly, when this was first announced, i think there were concerns about what it was going to mean for airlines in tsa and others. that we got extremely comfortable with that.
i was happy to see yesterday the comments from the white house from jeff zients about airlines. these, which, of course, includes the tsa and about how the goal, this is to get [inaudible] so they didn't have to punish anyone. and they're going to have people -- if people have religious or medical exemptions, they will be accommodated and they'll be able to work. so that's the same that you're going to hear from all the airlines as -- again, we're all well prepared to meet all federal mandates and meet all the customers that are coming to the holidays.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
very good. thanks, guys.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer

operator
thank you. we will now take questions from the media. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of alison sider with wall street journal. your line is now open.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, ali.
ali sider -- the wall street journal -- air travel reporter
hi. i have a vaccine question. i'm just curious. i know you've talked a lot about the exemptions.
but i'm just curious what sort of planning or strategizing you guys might be doing if there does end up being some portion of the workforce that just doesn't get vaccinated or have to be terminated or something like that? is there a kind of a plan b or a backup plan for how you'd handle that?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, again, well, first off, let's start with what we know, we know, which is, again, the vast majority of employees already vaccinated. and we're seeing that rise every day as the management put in place. so we are highly confident by the time we get to november 24. certainly, by december 8, when demand that comes in place, we're gonna be down to a very small number of people, if any, that are either not vaccinated or don't have a valid medical or religious exemption.
so i understand your question is, what if that's not true? but first off, i don't think that's gonna be the case, and we know that based on the data we're seeing. but however, again -- so that's where i think the answer is. but even the case that that happens, we'll continue to work with those employees that have chosen. we got to that point, again, i think it's gonna be a really small number.
but whatever that number is, we'll continue to work to accommodate those employees and make sure that they continue -- they're working together again, as jeff zients suggests that they'd be doing with government employees, well, we're doing the same with ours. so we have that flexibility, but i don't think we are going to need that.
robert isom -- president
ok, ali, i'd add that, of course, we're working with the team and we're working with our labor unions as well to get everybody vaccinated right now. so you see us that we continue to provide an incentive for team members to get vaccinated, turn in record of their cards. and we're working with the entire team to collect that information as we speak. and fortunately, every day, we see good signs that we're just getting out and people are turning in vaccination status or accommodation requests.
and we -- as doug said, we are really confident that we'll be in great shape as we come into the holidays.
ali sider -- the wall street journal -- air travel reporter
got it. and i mean, your pilots have been saying that sort of the whole debate and controversy is becoming a distraction and leading to some potential safety issues. are you seeing that in your data at all?
robert isom -- president
well, look we have an obligation to make sure that we're focused on flying. and so any type of distraction, whether it's a vaccine or anything else, we want to jump on. and to that end, we're -- again, we're working closely with our labor unions to make sure that we're on top of anything that is potentially a safety concern. but we are -- find the schedule, flying it very well and flying it incredibly safely.
we set very, very high standards, not just for the industry, but especially for american airlines.
operator
our next question comes from the line of leslie josephs with cnbc. your line is now open.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
hi, everyone. so i'm just trying to square this idea that you don't expect any employees to leave american airlines. but this week, you told them again that they could be terminated if they don't comply with the mandate, either getting vaccinated or the exemption. and then, how come the exemption -- or the mandate doesn't apply to your wholly owned subsidiaries as they fly those government contracts?
robert isom -- president
thank you, leslie, i'll just start. so first off, look, we have an executive order. and so there's not a lot of debate or argument. we're trying to find the best ways to comply.
and so our efforts are making sure that our team members get vaccinated. and to that end, as we've said, we're seeing the kind of results that we want. we have no desire to see anybody leave american. and through getting vaccinated, which we're making very available and easy for folks to get done, or those that -- the small number that apply for accommodations, we will continue to work with people to encourage them to make sure that they take care of themselves.
and we are working cooperatively with our labor unions as well. and we have different agreements that we have to follow in accordance with our collective bargaining agreements to make sure that we're doing everything possible to make sure that people stay with american. and we're looking through that, and we're committed to take care of our team.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
and again, leslie -- again, just a distinction, i think, leslie, between where early on in this process, there was concern about not having enough people and where you're seeing everyone getting now is, there was -- i think there was a view that those -- at least some airlines or tsa or other places, those who could not get vaccinated or chose not to get vaccinated would be on unpaid leave or something like that. that's not where we are going. so that's what gives us the comfort. we do know there will be some people at american airlines who have reasons they can't get vaccinated.
they will have exemptions. and -- but when they have exemptions, we're going to work to accommodate them so that they also can do their jobs. and that -- if anything, between a few weeks ago to now, where you're hearing extreme comfort around our ability to do it versus where we might have been when we first heard this, that's the distinction. and the exact same distinction, by the way, as i said, that we heard yesterday from the administration about tsa and other agencies.
so that's what gives us the comfort. that's why we think we're not going to see anyone leaving american. i don't think anyone is going to want to leave american because they can't get -- because either they just -- they choose not to get vaccinated, they don't have a religious or medical exemption. on the -- on our subsidiaries, just like every other airline, the regional carriers are not subject to the mandate that we know it.
that they have to work through that themselves to see whether or not they deem themselves federal contractors. but to the extent they're not, they're not subject to the mandate. they will be subject to the osha requirement when it's effective for airline -- for companies that have 100 or more employees. so at that point, they will need to respond accordingly.
but there isn't -- i don't -- i certainly don't think between american, delta, united, none of the regional carriers that any of us use are working toward a vaccine mandate at this point because they've concluded they don't have -- they're not covered by the mandate. 
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
ok. and then, for the exemptions, do you expect to approve all of them?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, of course, not. not. but again, what i believe is -- what i really believe is where you get -- whatever exemption is gonna be a small percentage of the workforce. and most -- everyone will get vaccinated.
so -- but certainly, there are always medical exemptions. and to the extent people have valid religious or medical exemptions, we're not going to put them on unpaid leave. we're going to make accommodations for them, as we should. so they can continue to work.
robert isom -- president
and for those that don't receive approval for those exceptions, we fully expect them to get vaccinated.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
right.

david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
hi. good morning, doug. i have two follow-up questions, but i'll try and be quick. first, sticking with the vaccination theme.
united and delta put numbers out there. and why can't you tell us how many or what percentage of your employees are vaccinated? and secondly, and this goes back to something that came up a couple of times on the analyst section, about flying a fourth-quarter schedule that's pretty close to 2019 levels and how you're going to do that with your current headcount, why shouldn't passengers expect to see the same kind of disruptions that you had over the summer.
robert isom -- president
look, david, i'll take that. look, we're -- we have done a tremendous job of making sure that we're set with final schedule. as we said in our comments, we flew most reliable september in our company's history. and that's the kind of performance that you can expect from american going forward.
we did a tremendous ramp up to get to where we were during the summer. and, by the way, as vasu mentioned in some of his comments, the kind of schedule we are going to fly around the holidays is actually no larger than what we had flown during the summer. so we -- and all we've done since that time has been able to add more resource to make sure our partners are better positioned and that we're better equipped to handle whatever may come our way. so we feel really confident on that point.
in regard to --
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
and i would add to that, robert. but david -- this is derek. the hiring we're doing now is due for the summer of next year. so we're very confident of having enough resources to run thanksgiving and christmas.
we already have those people onboard.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
he is asking into next year, though. 
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
yeah.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
in the next summer, again, the end point though. we're -- look, the disruption we had at end of june was due to us just not having as many pilots through the training process as we had expected. we've rectified that issue, and we are going to make sure that we have -- as we expand, that we have the right number of employees. so that's not an issue at all.
and by the way, to your first question, yes, i guess, it was two airlines have released their numbers. our number is still moving every day as more and more people are getting vaccinated. in the case of both, one of them put in place on their unilateral mandate for their teams so that they're through with that. other one put in place a requirement that if you're not vaccinated, you're going to pay more for your medical benefits, and it's already in place.
so -- but i don't think any other airlines have talked about exactly where they are and probably for the same reason we had, which we had a voluntary program in place. and now we have a mandate in place, and that number continues to grow. and what we know is, by the time we get to november 24, we're gonna be where the others are, which is virtually everyone vaccinated. those that aren't will have valid medical or religious exemptions and will be flying our airline, taking care of our customers.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of dawn gilbertson with usa today. your line is now open.
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- consumer travel reporter
hi, good morning. of course, another vaccine mandate, holiday travel question. specifically, scott kirby, which you're no doubt aware of, yesterday had some pretty strong comments predicting a holiday travel meltdown for everyone, of course, but united. but i wondered, you saying even if -- so you do have to go to testing for some of these people that he said, if there's a weather melt -- if you think a weather meltdown is something where do you see as these people test positive last minute and a flurry of last minute flight cancellation.
so in short, what he's predicting a buyer beware for people. how do you specifically respond to that? and my second question is, who is approving these exemptions? is that just the company? or is -- does the government play a role in that, too? thank you very much for any color.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, dawn. look, again, i didn't see scott's comments, but anyway, if that's what he says that is not right, of course. all the reason we just said, but -- we're well prepared for all the reasons already said, i don't need to restate them. highly confident that we're going to have everybody we need to fly the schedule.
and whatever the accommodation process, as i expect, again, for it not to be a large percentage of the airline, and it certainly won't be a process that will be cumbersome on the operation. so again, we are still working what the accommodation process will be with our unions. and there will be some combination of testing and masks and social distancing and things like that, as it should be, to make sure we're safe. but we do need to accommodate those who have valid medical or religious exemptions.
and again, i go back to at least the osha requirement is weekly testing. so i'm not saying it's where we'll end up. but i don't -- it's not going to -- certainly not gonna be something like hourly testing. so we don't anticipate any sort of operational impact.
we anticipate having all the people we need. we may have started some of this by being concerned, like i said, when it first came out because we didn't have this kind of direction. we're not remotely concerned now. on -- as to who approves the exemptions, i think that's the employer's duty to approve the exemptions.
robert isom -- president
and we already have a process in place and it did have to deal with accommodation requests already.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
and we always have, and all companies do because of disability. i'm sorry, robert. go ahead. 
robert isom -- president
no, that's it. 
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, so anyway, it's the same process. it's just bigger now.
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- consumer travel reporter
thank you very much.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
please go on.

our next question comes from the line of justin bachman with bloomberg. your line is now open.
justin bachman -- bloomberg -- deputy news director
thanks for the time today. i wanted to ask about the doj lawsuit regarding your relationship with jetblue in the northeast. are there any discussions going on with the government about that lawsuit in terms of any type of concessions or changes to that agreement? or is this a case where it's kind of all or nothing in your view?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, absolutely not. absolutely not. they've sued us and we're going to go win the lawsuit. they're wrong.
this is highly beneficial to consumers. and we're perplexed as to why they filed this lawsuit. this is our prerogative and we'll see them in court.
justin bachman -- bloomberg -- deputy news director
ok. did you -- doug, did you say that the discussions were ongoing at the time and they still are or they're not going on?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
i said they're not going on. i think [inaudible] lawyers are talking to lawyers, but i can tell you for certain, the company is not interested in any sort of talks about settling this. we feel extremely good about our case. i think it's better every day as we continue to expand and provide more service to customers.
justin bachman -- bloomberg -- deputy news director
great. thank you.
operator
our final question comes from the line of kyle arnold with dallas morning news. your line is now open.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, kyle.
kyle arnold -- dallas morning news -- aviation writer
hey. how are you adjusting your staffing levels at the same levels that you've done in previous years when you look forward to the holiday season? i know some other airlines have said that they essentially have to put more workers on the line and have more workers out there as they come out of this pandemic. how are you approaching staffing over the next couple of months?
robert isom -- president
yeah, i'll take that. we're getting ready for the holidays just as we always do. look, we've done a remarkable job. i wanna give a shout out to our team.
american airlines, in terms of real reliability, arriving on time and completion factor, we're not at the top of the industry, but i'll tell you what, we are beating our other network competitors and doing a real nice job of managing through the pandemic. so really pleased with that. and that same kind of attitude goes into how we look forward to the holidays. and we'll be ready for them and make sure that we have staffing in place and make sure that customers have a very nice experience. 
kyle arnold -- dallas morning news -- aviation writer
but you're not adding extra staff or adjusting staffing levels upward?
robert isom -- president
so just specifically, we always do. you have to get ready for things like deicing, wayfinding in the airports, managing security -- tsa security lines. load factors will be higher. so we always have a provision to make sure that we have staffing at the gates to accommodate.
and as derek mentioned as well, we're doing hiring throughout the business, and that includes places like our reservations offices as well. so all of that is being bolstered from where we are today. and again, those kind of things that we would have done in the past, we'll be ready for, and looking forward to holidays.
kyle arnold -- dallas morning news -- aviation writer
thanks, robert.

this concludes today's question-and-answer session. i will now turn the call back to mr. doug parker for closing remarks.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the american airlines group third-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded. [operator instructions] and now i would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, head of investor relations, mr. dan cravens.
dan cravens -- moderator, head of investor relations
thanks, sarah, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the american airlines group third-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. on the call this morning, we have doug parker, chairman and ceo; robert isom, president; and derek kerr, chief financial officer. also on the call and on the line as well for our q&a session are several of our senior execs, including maya leibman, chief information officer; steve johnson, our evp of corporate affairs; elise eberwein, our evp of people and global engagement; and vasu raja, our chief revenue officer. like we normally do, doug will start the call with an overview of our quarter and will update to the actions we've taken during the pandemic.
robert will then follow some remarks about our operations, commercial and other strategic initiatives. after robert's remarks, derek will follow with the details on the quarter and our operating plans going forward. after derek's comments, we will open the call for analyst questions, and lastly, questions from the media. to get in as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.
before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecasts of capacity and fleet plan. these statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but there are numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected. information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2021. in addition, we will be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items.
a reconciliation of those gaap numbers to the gaap financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found in the investor relations section of our website. a webcast of this call will also be available on the website. the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the material subsequently. thanks, again, for joining us.
at this point, i'll turn the call over to our chairman and ceo, doug parker. 
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, dan, and thank you, everyone, for being with us. good morning. so our third quarter started out very strong. our domestic business revenue, which has climbed from 27% of our 2019 levels in march to 52% in june, jumped even more in july.
it actually jumped to 64%, as companies began to return to work and their employees began to return to the skies. and as a result, we at american produced a profit in the month of july. but in the spur of delta variant led to a rebound in pandemic fears, of course. companies deferred return to work plans.
and that domestic revenue -- the domestic business revenues go back to 57% of 2019 in august and 47% in september. now i know some people find that trend discouraging, but we actually think it's encouraging. the spike in business revenue in the month of july shows that business travel does want to return. there is enormous pent-up demand.
and once this pandemic is behind us, it should resume its prior rapid trajectory to recovery. and as to highlight all it gets reflected in the financial results that profit in july, followed by larger losses in august and september, added up to a cumulative loss. on a gaap basis, we actually reported a net profit of $169 million. but when we exclude net special items, we recorded a net loss of $641 million.
and while we, obviously, don't like reporting losses, this is our smallest quarterly loss since the pandemic began in early 2020. what we're really proud of is how well the american airlines team is performing. no one is managing through this pandemic and into the recovery better than the people at american, and it shows in the results. at a time when airlines are struggling to build back service in response to demand, no one has built back further and faster than american.
we flew greater than 80% of our 2019 capacity in the third quarter, while our large competitors have restored only 70%. as a result, we flew 13% more seat miles in the quarter than our next closest competitor. and our team safely transported more than 48 million passengers in the quarter. and our team did this while doing an excellent job of taking care of our customers.
and we struggled with growth ourselves as we entered the quarter, but we responded quickly and aggressively. we ended the quarter flying by far the largest airline of the world with the best september operational performance in american's history. that great performance by our team has led to strong customer acceptance, as evidenced by our industry-leading passenger counts and our revenue trends. for the quarter, revenues were significantly improved over 2020 and were down 25% in the third quarter versus the same period in 2019, whereas they were down 37.5% in the second quarter on the same year over two-year basis.
and notably, our passenger unit revenues in the quarter were down 10% versus 2019 versus 12% declines of the other large international u.s. carriers despite our higher capacity production. on the costs front, we've reshaped our network, simplified our fleet and built operational and cost efficiencies into the business that will serve us well for years to come. we accelerated the retirement of more than 150 older aircraft.
american continues to operate the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleet of the u.s. network carriers. and importantly, we've actioned more than $1.3 billion of permanent annual cost reductions into the business through our green flag initiatives. and as we've navigated through the crisis, we've been careful to think and look long term.
we've announced a series of strategic relationships with other airlines around the world that strengthened the american network, adding additional utility to our customers and long-term value for our shareholders. the most notable of these are our northeast alliance with jetblue and our west coast international alliance with alaska, which we continue to implement and grow in the third quarter. looking forward, we feel great about where american is positioned. given the deferred business demand and the recent rise in fuel prices, the fourth quarter will be challenging, but that's a near-term issue finding a longer-term bullish trend.
we're encouraged by the upside that exists in demand for business and international travel. and our confidence is reinforced by the incredible work the american airlines team has done throughout this pandemic and continues to do today. and we're particularly excited about the future that lies ahead for american and our team. with that, i'll turn it over to robert.
robert isom -- president
thanks, doug, and good morning, everyone. i want to start by thanking the entire american airlines team for their efforts in the third quarter and throughout the pandemic. our airline continues to succeed, thanks to the hard work of our team. as doug mentioned, this summer represented the largest operational ramp-up in the history of american.
as we build back the operations, much like other businesses, we have managed through supply chain constraints, vendor and staffing challenges, constantly changing travel restrictions and a lot more. through it all, we operated more flights and carried more customers than any other u.s. airline, more than tripling our daily departures from may 2020, which was the low point of our schedule. and we're pleased with where we are.
american recorded our most reliable september since the merger based on completion factor, on-time departures and on-time arrivals. we'll continue to focus on delivering a safe and reliable operations and continuing the momentum as we further scale our operation and welcome back even more customers. now i want to acknowledge the efforts of the american team in the third quarter in support of the u.s. civil reserve air fleet program.
it was a tremendous honor for american to aid in the effort to bringing more than 5,000 evacuees from afghanistan to the u.s., as well as hundreds of members of the u.s. military. that work included working with the customs and border protection to open our philadelphia facilities as a welcoming center for four nationals. we're grateful to our team members throughout the airline and from all over the world who came together to support american's craft activation.
as we reported this morning, our third-quarter total revenue was approximately $9 billion, up $1.5 billion from the second quarter. this improvement was driven by our passenger revenue recovery, which increased by more than 20% sequentially from the second quarter on a 12% increase in available seat miles. overall passenger revenue in the third quarter was 72% of what was in the third quarter of 2019, which is up 13 points sequentially in the second quarter. domestic leisure revenue has now returned to pre-pandemic levels at 98% of 2019 levels in the third quarter.
as doug described, business revenue growth stalled in the quarter and finished flat in the second quarter at around 50% of 2019 levels. given the recent booking trends, with the delta variant subsiding and everything we're seeing and hearing from our customers, we're planning for a robust peak travel period in the fourth quarter, and we're excited about the prospects for 2022. and here's why. we expect that domestic leisure revenues will surpass 2019 levels in the fourth quarter and continue that trend throughout 2022.
short haul international revenues should follow that same pattern. and recent trends show that corporate bookings month to date have improved significantly and are accelerating like they were earlier in the year before the delta variant and associated restrictions were imposed. our largest corporate customers tell us they'll be returning more fully to the office and travel as we move out of 2021. and because of that, we continue to expect a full rebound of business revenue to 2019 levels on a monthly basis by the end of 2022.
and speaking regularly with our top corporate customers, almost all have resumed domestic u.s. business travel, to some extent. as companies return to the office and lift travel restrictions, we see continued growth in corporate travel. industrials, healthcare and professional services continue to lead that recovery.
long-haul international travel, particularly long-haul business travel, while the slowest to return, is starting to come back. right now, almost two-thirds of our corporate customers are traveling internationally for at least essential business. and we expect international travel to improve significantly with easing of cross-border requirements. and we're encouraged by the recent news about the u.s.
government easing international travel and entry restrictions starting in november. following the white house announcement, we saw an immediate increase in bookings in several of our key international markets. overnight, we saw a 66% increase in bookings to the u.k., a 40% increase to core europe and a 74% increase to brazil. clearly, there's significant pent-up demand for travel to and from the u.s.
and many customers are eager to return to travel when it's permitted. now just focusing on the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue will recover to approximately 80% of 2019 levels, up approximately 5 points sequentially versus the third quarter, with the strongest performance in domestic and short-haul international markets. we continue to make significant strides in building the large global network in the industry and reconnecting with our customers. our partnership with jetblue and alaska are delivering tremendous benefits for customers and enabling new flying that otherwise wouldn't be possible.
more than 715,000 customers were able to travel across our networks during the quarter, thanks to these innovative partnerships. together, american and jetblue will operate more than 700 daily flights from new york to boston -- new york and boston this winter, including nearly 50 international destinations out of jfk. we also continued to create a seamless experience for our customers, including rolling out reciprocal lead benefits for aadvantage and true blue mosaic members. and we expect to launch miles redemption on jetblue very soon.
our loyalty program continues to demonstrate its attractiveness to our customers and partners. new member acquisitions in the third quarter exceeded 2019 levels despite the airline flying a significantly smaller schedule. as our customers continue to engage with aadvantage, our co-brand cash payments were essentially fully recovered at 96% in the third quarter versus the same period in 2019. this is up from just 78% in the second quarter on the same basis.
we expect this trend to continue as the network returns to a more normalized level. on the esg front, during the quarter, american became the first north american airline to commit to developing a science-based target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. we also agreed to turn to purchase more carbon-neutral sustainable aviation fuel. american also became an anchor partner to breakthrough energy catalyst.
and we've committed to invest $100 million in a groundbreaking collaborative effort to accelerate the clean energy technologies necessary for achieving a net-zero economy by 2050. we're excited about this work and what it will mean for the future of aviation and the acceleration and adoption of critical next-generation clean technologies across all industries. so in summary, while the delta variant has shifted the time line to the recovery, we remain very bullish on the return of demand, and we feel great about how we're positioned, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the american airlines team. and with that, i'll turn it over to derek.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
thanks, robert, and good morning, everyone. before i begin my remarks, i would also like to thank the american airlines team for their hard work during the quarter. their continued resilience in the face of uncertainty due to the delta variant is commendable. this morning, we reported a third-quarter gaap net profit of $169 million or $0.25 per diluted share.
excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $641 million or a loss of $0.99 per share. as doug mentioned in his remarks, this was our strongest quarter since the pandemic began. as we have discussed in the past, as we always expected, the recovery would be unpredictable, and our third-quarter results reflect this. despite the delta variant-related volatility in demand and revenue trends that robert discussed, our financial performance improved from the second quarter, but fell short of our initial expectations that we outlined in our last earnings call.
while the slowdown in demand was clearly disappointing, it is important to note that the trajectory of our results continues to be positive. in fact, even with the drop-off in bookings from the delta variant and rising oil prices, our third-quarter pre-tax earnings, excluding net special items, improved by nearly $600 million sequentially versus the second quarter. this makes it even clearer to us that the steps we are taking over the past 18 months are working. as we have navigated the pandemic, we've built back our network in a way that would keep our capacity aligned with demand while giving us the ability to be flexible as conditions change.
we've also worked to keep our controllable costs down and have actioned $1.3 billion in permanent annual cost initiatives this year alone. based on our results, it's clear these actions are paying off, as our third-quarter casm, including fuel and net special items, was up just 10.5% versus the same period in 2019 despite flying approximately 20% less capacity. on the fleet side, we moved swiftly to retire older aircraft and accelerate our fleet harmonization project. our 737 retrofit program was completed in may.
and we continue to expect our a321 aircraft to be complete by early next year, a full year ahead of our original schedule. in addition to the customer benefits of larger overhead bins, in-seat power and streaming in-flight entertainment, these aircraft will generate more revenue and allow us to connect to more customers over our network. they will also provide a unit cost tailwind as we build back our network. with respect to our wide-body aircraft, we continue to work with boeing to finalize the timing of our delayed 787-8 deliveries that were expected to arrive in 2021.
in the meantime, due to the continued uncertainty in the delivery schedule, we have proactively removed these aircraft from our winter schedule to minimize potential passenger disruption. and i'd also like to note that these delays have had an impact on our fourth-quarter casm since we built the cost structure to fly these aircraft during the fourth quarter. we ended the quarter with approximately $18 billion of total available liquidity, which reflects the $950 million prepayment of our spare parts term loan made in july and approximately 440 -- $649 million of scheduled debt payments made during the quarter. the scheduled debt paydown unencumbered 20 boeing 777 aircraft further bolstering our unencumbered asset base to $3.8 billion and our first lien capacity to more than $8.4 billion.
as we look ahead, we feel confident with -- we have enough liquidity to allow american to navigate the choppiness of the recovery. because of this choppiness, we will continue to keep liquidity at elevated levels in the near to medium term, with a plan to step down our target liquidity to approximately $10 billion to $12 billion at some point next year when we are confident the recovery has taken hold and we have returned to sustained profitability. the deleveraging of american's balance sheet remains a priority, and we are committed to significant, steady and continuous debt reduction in the years ahead. even with the slower-than-expected recovery observed during the third quarter, we remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025.
$10 billion of this will be achieved through amortization of debt and is net of new financing. importantly, these debt reduction targets are based on a plan that assumes future deliveries are financed. should we elect to use cash in lieu of financing aircraft, that decision would contribute to deleveraging and further accelerate the time line to achieve these targets. of the incremental $5 billion, nearly $1 billion has already been actioned with the prepayment of the spare parts term loan we announced on the last call.
as we look ahead, we will continue to focus our efforts on prepayable debt, which currently represents approximately 30% of our total debt obligations. in addition to deleveraging our balance sheet, this plan will allow us to smooth our near-term maturity towers and free up high-quality collateral. assuming this level of debt reduction and continued margin improvement, our plan is targeted to result in the best credit metrics in the history of post-merger american by the end of the four-year period. looking into the fourth quarter, the delay in the return of corporate travel and rising fuel prices will put pressure on our margins relative to the third quarter.
we expect our capacity to be down approximately 11% to 13% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. based on current demand assumptions and capacity plans, we continue to expect a slight sequential increase in our revenues and expect total revenues to be down approximately 20% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. in total, we expect the pre-tax margin, excluding net special items, of between negative 16% and negative 18%. for the full year, we -- for the full year, our projected debt principal payments are expected to be $4.4 billion.
this includes the $750 million payment of spare parts term loan and the $550 million prepayment of the term loan with the u.s. treasury that was completed earlier this year. we have $612 million in scheduled debt principal payments in the fourth quarter. with respect to capital expenditures, we expect full-year 2021 capex to remain minimal, with non-aircraft capex at approximately $900 million and net aircraft capex, including predelivery payments, remaining an inflow of $900 million.
we are still in the early stages of building our operating plans for 2022. and we'll have more to say on what our capacity and cost outlook will look like on our next earnings call. but at a high level, based on the demand trends we see today along with the feedback from our corporate customers, we expect to slowly increase our capacity throughout the year and to have full-year capacity very near 2019 levels. this, of course, is subject to the future demand environment and we will always retain the ability to adapt if demand conditions warrant.
lastly, i know a lot of investors are concerned about inflationary pressure in 2022 and beyond. we'll know more once we finalized our 2022 budget, but we do see pressures in fuel prices, hiring and training for both new hires and existing crews as we ramp up our operation, including on the regional side, where we recently announced the pilot retention program. we are also seeing increased starting wages for certain regional groups, including vendors. even with these pressures, our fleet simplification strategy enables higher aircraft utilization and higher average gauge, both of which will help offset some of these unit cost pressures.
as i said earlier, we will share more specific details on these impacts to our cost structure as our 2022 plan on our next earnings call in january. so in conclusion, our team continues to do an amazing job of managing through the uncertainty, maintaining a strong liquidity position and driving efficiencies throughout the organization. and we are well-positioned for the future. so with that, i will open up the line for analyst questions.
",2021-Q3,AAL

[operator instructions] our first question comes from jamie baker with j.p. morgan.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, good morning. just quickly, doug, i love your prepared remarks. i know the point wasn't to make me feel old, but paul, candace, sam, i mean, what a throwback. but it really has been a privilege to speak to you on these calls, all these conferences, all these years.
i did want to just add my own thanks and congratulations. and obviously, same goes to my friend, dan cravens. first question, on the traffic liability, derek. so sequentially, from the third quarter to the fourth, it declined by about $360 million, granted this is less than the customary seasonal decline, but delta and united both experienced flat sequential trends.
and i'm just trying to understand what the nuances, the puts and takes are, whether it's a network issue, differences in forward bookings. any additional color on the atl sequential change?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
 no. there's not really any difference, any color. i think, from a stored value basis, though that stayed pretty much the same. future travel dropped from -- i think we were at 6.4 in total atl balance, future travel was 3.6, went down to 3.2, which is a normal seasonality for us.
we did see a pickup at the end of the month or at the end of the month from normal buying. so i think it's just normal seasonality for us. and what we didn't see as much as the stored value being used and some additions because, as you know, some of the issues with the cancellations and things that were out there, we added a little bit to that. but i would have expected it to drop even more, but it held up just because of the fact that from an operations standpoint, there were -- we added a little bit in the fourth quarter from issues with the operation.
but other than that, i think it's just seasonality or what we normally see. i'm not sure why others were flat or up other than what they did. 
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
all right. that's perfect. and just a quick follow-up, and i don't want to get bogged down in comparing your guides to that of united and delta. but you all expect to arrive at a pretty similar first quarter revenue outcome, down 20-plus points from '19.
but you have to fly considerably more capacity to arrive at that output. can you just remind us what some of the seasonal and network factors that drive this? i understand there's more seasonality for you in the first quarter, but i'm just trying to figure out what causes that drag.
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
jamie, this is vasu. the reality of where we still are in the first quarter is that there's still probably a pretty large variability in first quarter forecast. and so much like derek, i won't comment on what our competitors are looking at. but we have taken a pretty conservative view of what revenue production will be in q1.
we've been encouraged by recent trends as case growth spikes. we're already seeing bookings come in stronger so we'll see. but what we see to realize through the pandemic is that we have a lot of levers to go play in the airline really flexibly, and we can shift things up and down and indeed move capacity from one market to another, but more nimbly than we had in times past. and after so many crises, we thought we were nimble before and we got even faster.
so there's still a lot yet to do in the first quarter, and we'll see how things come together as demand start hitting back up. 
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst

our next question comes from mike linenberg with deutsche bank.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. yes, really to echo a lot of what jamie said. doug, it's been a privilege, really. and i've learned a lot going all the way back to the early 2000s, and dan as well.
dan, you've been a great friend and you've been a great supporter. and so scott, you've got some pretty big shoes to fill there.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
just quickly on to questions. i'm sure you're going to get some along these lines. i just want to hit on sort of this g5-ish -- or excuse me, g5, 5g issue. the fa was out, i think, yesterday or two days ago saying something like 62% of the u.s.
fleet is -- should be fine. where do you guys stack up? and the way we should think about this, is this going to be -- is this going to blow over the next few weeks? or is this going to sort of reappear five, six months down the road, when maybe some of these exemption zones or buffer zones around airports, maybe there's changes there. like what should we be concerned about? what should we anticipate as this 5g rolls out over time? thank you.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
ok. they're asking me to take this one, even though [inaudible] going start very much, mike, the 5g. this has been like my last assignment. anyway -- this is look -- and we've all been -- every airline, all ceos that involve this over the holidays, it wasn't -- anyway, it wasn't our finest hour, i think, as a country to get us to that point.
but the good news is we now have what should have been going on for quite some time, which is the manufacturers, the telecoms, the government agencies all sharing information that they need to make sure that this can be rolled out in a way that all americans get 5g and all americans know that their flights aren't going to be impacted by that 5g. so where we sit right now is the way that we're all able to upgrade our fleet is because the telecoms have agreed not to fully deploy some of their towers near airports. so with that agreement, everything is fine. again, i -- well, i'll turn to david [inaudible].
as far as you'll ever see, everything is totally fine. you see, we don't expect really any material disruption whatsoever as long as that's in place. as against stay in place, we need to get to where they can actually -- and we want to get to where they actually can deploy all the towers they have in place and that we can still do that. but no one's going to make -- no one's going to go do that until we all agree that it can be done without disruption.
so a long way of me saying, it's taken a while to get to the right spot, but i feel like we're in the right spot and the right people to derive information. i don't think you're going to see any material disruption going forward because of this.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. that's what i wanted to hear. and just, derek, a quick one on the non-op expense, $360 million for the quarter. because of where your pension is and maybe the potential gains that you're anticipating and how you book it into 2022, is there going to be a pension tailwind not only in the march quarter, but for the year and any sort of rough estimate on what we should use from a modeling perspective? thank you.
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yes. i think there is a pension tailwind into the year. so if we ended up the quarter $380 million for this quarter. we're projecting it to be in the $350 million range for non-op and slowly declining as we pay off some debt throughout the quarter.
so i would -- first quarter should be more in the $350 million, $360 million range and declining to about the $340 million range in the fourth quarter.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
that's great. thank you.

our next question comes from helane becker with cowen.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thank you very much, operator. and yes, doug, it's been really nice knowing you, but hopefully, we'll continue to stay in touch. and dan, i mean you've been a really good supporter. actually, your whole team has been a really good support of our conferences over the years.
so thank you very much and best wishes to both of you. and i refused to tell you how many of those conference calls.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think i know, but thanks, helane.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
no worries. so actually, i guess, i don't know, maybe to robert. can you just address two things? there -- you guys have said you're going to hire, i guess, a gross number of 18,000 people this year. and some of those are going to be pilots.
we're seeing united and american -- or delta, rather, cut regional jet capacity because they don't have enough pilots. are you going down that similar path? or are you in a better position from a training perspective?
robert isom -- president
 kkso helane, thanks. it's robert. thanks for that question. so we are going to be doing a lot of hiring this year.
we did a lot of hiring as well last year. so from a ton of perspective, we had a couple of years of the pandemic in which, quite frankly, there weren't a lot of people being trained. and given the demand, we -- the capacity in the industry fell by quite a bit. so as we all rebound, of course, there is a constraint that we're all dealing with.
there's not enough production. i do -- of pilot. i do believe that over time that that supply and demand in palace will be remedied. it's an incredibly attractive profession when you think about the starting wages and the ultimate compensation for the industry.
so we're doing everything that we can, and i know other companies are as well, to encourage those that are looking for a great profession to come into the business. but in the short run, from a mainline perspective, look, we have -- american is a very, very attractive brand. we're going to have plenty of pilots. the biggest issue that we're dealing with is the throughput of pilots and getting them through training.
we've invested an incredible amount of resources and having training assets ready to go. those are all coming online. and again, from a mainline perspective, we'll be able to supply all that we need. the imbalance is really going to be played out in the regional carriers.
and on that front, like other carriers, we're going to have issues as well. we have them right now. we're working very hard on that. it's impacting us to a certain degree, but we're going to do everything that we can to make sure that it's not a material impact over time.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. thank you. and then just my follow-up question.
i don't know who wants to answer this one. but when you talk about small- and medium-sized businesses and those folks who are traveling, because they really have to, for their livelihood, can you talk about also whether they've got the credit card? and if you're seeing increased credit card acquisition in that category?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
helane, this is vasu, and i'm happy to answer your question. indeed, this is one of our increasingly fair topics to talk about. you are correct. we see small and mid-market business growth.
but look, the diversity of who that customer is really can't be overstated. everybody from somebody starting a business to sometimes relatively large companies who are seeing growth through the pandemic and get on the road to drive sales or visit factories or whatever the case might be. and for us, we do very -- we haven't seen growing acquisitions on our co-branded credit cards. indeed, in q4, it's not just that our spend level were eclipsed in 2019.
but our acquisitions, even net of attrition, was equal to and very often, for some months and some weeks, greater than what it was in 2019, which means that where people are coming to the card. that said, we see a real opportunity within the space of small business, mid-market business because the reality is we don't actually have a true card product or an entire consumer offering for that segment. a lot of things that we have are either tailored for really large corporate accounts or individual travelers. so we see a lot of opportunity as we come out of this and a lot of ways to go and drive a lot more value to that customer and captured in our p&l.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much, vasu. thanks, everybody.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer

our next question comes from duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. i wanted to ask you both the same question i asked gary and bob at their investor day.
you have worked together for a long time as a team. but from a change perspective, is there any daylight between the two of you strategically? and do you have any examples of issues where you really constructively disagreed over the last decade?
robert isom -- president
hey, duane. thanks. i'll start. look, doug and i are different leaders, and we definitely go about how we lead the company in different ways.
but i'll tell you that in terms of the strategic direction of american, i've not only worked with doug, but i've been part of every major decision in this company over the last -- since the merger. and so from that perspective, we're doing the right thing. i'm excited about the positioning of american. the assets that we've put in place, whether it's fleet, airport, alliances, our network, we're ready to go.
as demand recovers and we can put our assets to full utilization, we're poised to outperform. so from that perspective, i don't expect to hear a lot of difference in terms of the way that doug does these things. but right now, i am solely focused on making sure that we deliver a great product for our customers, and that's running a reliable airline, and getting back to profitability.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks for that thoughts and appreciate it. it's a tricky question. maybe one for vasu. how different would march quarter capacity have been if we never had omicron? maybe this is an unfair observation, but it feels like americans' plans relative to the industry are very static in what is obviously a very dynamic world.
appreciate you taking the questions.
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
yeah, absolutely, and i appreciate the question. look, it's sort of hard to do what hypotheticals would be. but what i would say is this. the part of the reason why maybe there's probably less volatility in our schedules is where our airline's sort of naturally positioned.
we -- not only do we operate a lot more of our capacity in domestic, we generate a lot more of value for customers and rasm results from flying in domestic. so for most of the pandemic, certainly the last several months, we've oriented about 85-ish percent of our asm capacity in the domestic and short-haul operations. as we go in the first quarter, it will be about 80-ish percent in those, with another 5% or so constituting major international markets like one at heathrow, for example. so for us, so much of our network is there, indeed.
so 65% of our network is in our -- what we call sunbelt hubs, phoenix, dfw, charlotte, d.c., miami, that have been extremely robust through the pandemic. and any one of those hubs produce unit revenues, which are well in excess of what our competitors do. so a little bit of what you see as a network composition difference, quite frankly. as we go out in the first quarter, quite briefly, we are flying the things where we can most directly create value for the customer and outperform.
and we're not doing the things that don't. so our long-haul schedules are 70% of what they have historically been. our short-haul schedules are a lot closer to what flat is. so what it would be like when demand is that remains to be seen.
but for us, the real opportunity when we said it all through the pandemic is less about driving volume. and the capacity base, the cost base of the airline changes only very marginally, whether we fly at 95% or 92% of the airline. the really big thing for us is domestic yield performance. and as we look out, i mean, if indeed demand comes back where we see it is less about how we go and manipulate capacity around the system and more about how we capture it in yield growth. 
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
appreciate the thoughts.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer

our next question comes from hunter keay with wolfe research.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning. robert, as you think about taking over the ceo role, what are some of the things that you want to accomplish in your first 100 days, maybe when your ability to put your stamp on things is at its highest.
robert isom -- president
hunter, i'm going to just be really clear and focused on that. our goal right now is to get back to profitability as soon as possible to deliver a reliable product, plain and simple. as i take a look forward, we've got a great opportunity ahead of us. and everything come together is the right time.
i do think that we're in a position where demand is poised to react. everything that we see suggests that there is a pent-up desire for people to get out on the road, whether it's for leisure or business demand. and for that, i think i've got a special opportunity, one that brings together everything that we've been bringing -- working so hard to do throughout the pandemic and bringing that to fruition. so as i take look out to the middle of the year, i do think that we're going to get back to profitability.
i do think that american is going to continue to [inaudible] a very reliable airline, and i think we're going to be very, very competitive in all the markets that we serve.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and i always -- we talked about capacity being driven by demand and fuel cost occasionally. but what if you're not able to hire people? and what if you're not able to hire the right people that fit the culture that you want to build at american? is there a decision where you would decide to be smaller as opposed to hiring people that might not be great cultural fits?
robert isom -- president
 so hunter, thanks for that question because, look, this is something that i'm really proud of. last year, as we built back, the entire economy, all industries had struggled with finding the right people, getting them in the right positions. but you know what, american, as we grew back, we really quickly remedied any issues that we had. and what we found is american is a very, very attractive place to work.
american airlines sells itself in terms of attracting people to it. so whether it's the new flight attendant classes that are now graduating, whether it's the thousands of people that we're bringing on to work in our reservations and agent ranks, and those pilots and mechanics that we're bringing in. we, at american, get a chance to really choose those that get to be part of the team. and that's a great position to be in.
over time, i think that we're going to have to do a lot of work to make sure that the supply of pilots into our regional carriers as strong as we need it to be. but you'll see us on the forefront of that as well.
hunter keay -- wolfe research -- analyst

our next question comes from david vernon with bernstein.
david vernon -- bernstein -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody, and congratulations on to everybody on their next chapters here. derek, first question for you on cash flow. if we're looking out at the full-year guidance you've laid out, capex of $2.6 billion, should we be expecting cash from operations to cover that? i'm just trying to get a sense for how secure we should be looking at the balance sheet and the liquidity you have on there. are we going to be dipping into that from an operating standpoint or are we going to be able cover that based on what you see today?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
we'll definitely be able to cover that.
david vernon -- bernstein -- analyst
excellent. short and sweet. i like it. second question maybe for robert or derek, as you look at the capacity and the casm-x guidance you've given for 2022 down five, up five, how do we think about -- in broad brushes, '22-'23, if we're up a little relative to '19 and is that just going to be kind of a one-for-one thing or is there more abated to that? like how should we be thinking about the operating leverage coming back into the business as demand gets restored?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
hey, good morning everybody and yeah. i think exactly what you're saying. i think we are underutilizing our fleet without a doubt at this point in time. i think as we add back our assets, robert talked about pilot's reportability and making sure the throughput happens and get the throughput through.
so if we had -- and the 7-8, so you have two opportunities to grow this airline at a very cheap cost. i think the cost headwind, there's probably 3 or 4 points of cost headwind we have in place right now with underutilizing our assets and making sure that when those aircraft get back and we can use them as much as we can, we do not need to add costs. we do not need to add aircraft. so we could -- in today's world, we could fly the airline probably 5% more with the cost structure we have today.
so it's pretty close to 1:1. it might be a little bit sticky in there a little bit, but it's pretty darn close to 1:1. the first 5% that we could add back.
david vernon -- bernstein -- analyst
all right. thanks, guys.

our next question comes from dan mckenzie with seaport global.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hey, good morning. congrats to both doug and dan on what an amazing run it's been. it's really been a pleasure. a couple of questions here.
one housecleaning question. just one follow-up on small- and medium-sized businesses. vasu, what's factored into the first quarter revenue outlook with respect to the timing of international returning? are you just sort of straight-lining current trends? or did you factor in some kind of escalation in march potentially?
robert isom -- president
hey, great question. and you're absolutely correct. we are straight-lining current trends with the low exception of our short-haul business. 
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok.
robert isom -- president
it tends to peak in the march, april time period as north america goes on spring breaks and easter vacations.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok. very good. secondly, just following up on helane's question on small- and medium-sized businesses. i'm wondering if you can elaborate on kind of their purchase behavior versus a typical leisure traveler.
do they book further out, closer in? it's presumably higher-margin business. i'm just trying to get a sense of what that means. and i guess i didn't -- in the powerpoint, i guess, or i didn't catch what that revenue from small- and medium-sized business was as a percent of 2019 revenue, and how you're thinking about that trending potentially here in 2022?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
sure. let me answer those in a slightly different order. first, small business. as we ended december, what we call small- and mid-market business was 80% recovered.
large corporate business, people who bought on big managed programs, was 40% recovered, ballpark. interestingly, what that means for us is historically, if 40% of our revenues came from business, about 15 points of that were from large corporates and the balance were from small- and mid-market companies, due to the pandemic that's shifted a lot, where less than 10% comes from managed corporates. as we think about next year, we absolutely anticipate a rebound of business travel, but something where -- something a lot closer to 30 points of the 40 or so is coming from small- to mid-market, and managed corporates come down a little. this is something, which is certainly an opportunity that we look upon very favorably and may, in many ways, be unique to american airlines because so much of that small business growth, to your question about the profile, does actually book in a very similar booking window as large corporate travel.
so it's a much shorter days to departure than what leisure is. but very critically, it's originating in markets that are in the center of the country, think oklahoma city or austin, san antonio, places like that. it engages in trip behavior, which is very different than managed corporates. people are willing to go stay a saturday night and fly on a lower-load factor flight.
but very importantly, it comes in at the same level as yield as our large corporate businesses, but a fraction of the cost of sales. the cost of sales looks a lot more like what leisure is. so we see this as a sign of real opportunity. and indeed, as we look out there, and if you think about things, we see that -- to robert's comments earlier, the nature of this travel is starting to change.
but as we see small businesses traveling, there are more people traveling for blended business leisure purposes. more people willing to go by themselves into a premium fare product when a cheaper one is available. so we see a lot of opportunity as the world changes, and we're going to organize and position ourselves to execute on that.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
that's terrific. thanks, vasu.
operator
our next question comes from catherine o'brien with goldman sachs.
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. i just want to echo my peer congratulations to doug and dan. it's really been a pleasure working with you the last, i guess, almost 12 years now. question maybe just on your 2022 growth outlook for that 5%.
i understand that the uncertainty around the 787 just makes it more difficult. but can you share high level what you're thinking the breakout between domestic and international growth is at least on your current 70 assumption? and what's driving the decision on where to allocate that capacity?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
yes. this is vasu. i can help with that. we are -- look, as we see it -- first, this is your first question.
we anticipate that with the 787, we will be a materially smaller international airline than what we would otherwise like to be operating something, which is probably, let's call it, 75% to 85% of the scale we had in 2019. but our short-haul network, domestic and the narrow-bodies we fly into mexico, caribbean, latin america will probably be a lot closer to what 2019 is. but there's a couple of other important things to note there. of course, first, we have a very conservative view of what happens with the 787s and did a pretty conservative view about how international demand, even recovers through the course of the year.
so a big mix of our international flying, and you don't already see it in published schedules, is oriented around markets where we can go drive a lot of the connectivity through -- whether it's heathrow or other partner hubs, doha, things like that that we might not have in times past. the other thing that's out there, too, is to an earlier comment i made. we have a lot more flexibility with the airline. and indeed, through the pandemic, we've come to realize it's much easier -- within a few points, we have a lot of flexibility in how we go and plan the airline.
and so we are consciously trying to build the airlines so that we could be really efficient in how we utilize our assets and make moves around the system. so that we can go fly the markets that customers demand most, even if it's relatively late in the booking curve. so while those are broad strokes of where capacity is, still, things may change. and realistically, they will change as demand comes back. 
catherine o'brien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. and then maybe one more for you again, vasu. just to dig into your short-term revenue outlook a bit more, i understand there's a lot of moving pieces, but your rasm performance versus '19 improved each quarter through 2021. but it looks like it's going to get worse in the first quarter per your guidance.
of course, you called out impact of omicron. but can you just help us think through the drivers of that a bit more? and anything we should know about cargo or other revenue trends? or is that really just your conservative view, as you noted on loads and pricing on the passenger side? thanks for the time.
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
 look, it's very much the conservative view. and look, having gone through multiple waves of the pandemic, one of the things that we've come to more reliably build forecast on is that the amount of time it takes from the cases peaking to demand recovery. and that's shortened through every wave. in the delta wave, it was about a seven-week spread between case peaking to demand bottoming out and growing again.
so a lot of our outlook is based on a slightly shortened version of that occurring. but indeed, what we've been seeing as cases a peak, wherever they peaked in the world, israel, u.k., more recently in domestic, it's not a seven-week span. it's not a four-week span. it's something a lot more like a seven-day span, so it's still early to tell.
as i mentioned earlier, 85% of our capacity is in domestic. and if you presume, last week was the peak of cases across the country. we've been encouraged by the last few days of bookings, but a lot of our first quarter forecast is based on the conservatism that we've had for having seen prior waves before. and indeed, we anticipate that january and february will remain challenged because historically, they are seasonally some of the weakest month in our business.
so we'll see, but we remain encouraged for how strong demand comes back, and we are certainly reserving every seat because there's a customer that wants to travel and want to do soon.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
let's go and move on to the next question.
operator
our next question comes from andrew didora with bank of america.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. doug, i just want to extend my congratulations as well, and that the same goes to dan. it's been a pleasure working with both of you over the years.
just first question around costs, i guess, derek, does the 5% casm guide include anything from current labor negotiations? and then just secondly on costs. when you factor in kind of new labor deals, all the kind of the inflation, and the economy that you were discussing earlier, even as capacity comes back, do you think that getting back to prepandemic casm-x is a realistic expectation over the next few years?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. it does not include -- i mean, it includes year-over-year deals that were already done. so any deal that is already done is built in. as robert talked about, we got some real -- we got some deals done in the past few weeks that weren't huge impact on the cost, but really good opportunity to get those deals done and get them done quick with some of our groups.
but it does not include any new contract negotiations that aren't complete today. so that's number one. number two, i do think -- we had expected 2022 to get back to 2019 levels. but with the variant and us pulling down the flying from 78s not being there, and also demand not quite being there, we will not get to the 2019 levels.
as we get to 2023, it's definitely possible. it depends on the growth of the airline and other things that we do. if we don't get there, we'll get very close, put it that way. so i think in 2023, we've kind of -- i've always talked about being pretty flat in 2022.
that's not happening really driven by thoughtfully utilizing our assets. as we fully utilize those assets, and we plan in 2023, i think we can get to that level, we're pretty close. we might not get all the way down to 2019, but we'll get pretty close. 
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then just lastly for me for robert. i guess as you assume the ceo role here, what do you think american needs to do better in, i'll call it, this new world post-pandemic to help drive american's margins back toward pre-pandemic levels? thanks.
robert isom -- president
yes. thanks, andrew. look, we need to put all the pieces together, all the things that we've been working on over the last three years, and then bring them at that and execute very well. running reliably for this airline, i know, pays off in terms of unit revenues or price up in terms of unit cost.
and it definitely pays off in terms of customer satisfaction. again, american has invested in all the right places, when we talk about the aircraft and airports and lounges and whatnot. and that's money that has been spent. it's in place.
and now it's time to bring it back and put it into action. and so we do that. i'm quite confident. as derek has said, i'm quite confident in all aspects american is poised to outperform. 
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, andrew.

that concludes the analysts' q&a. we will now take questions from the media. [operator instructions] our first question comes from alison sider with wall street journal.
alison sider -- the wall street journal -- air travel reporter
hi. i just was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your expectations for 787 deliveries. and kind of how confident you are or anything that you're hearing from boeing about what they might expect in terms of the schedule on that?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yeah. ali, this is derek. we're still on the same schedule. mid-april is what we're talking about for our first delivery.
that has been locked in on those dates for probably the last couple of months, and we're still planning on that happening. so we haven't got any different information in the past couple of months, where i think we're still on target for those and that we would take all 13 throughout the year. but we have been conservatively when we put four in the schedule for the summer. we had originally thought we could get all 13 in the summer, but we pulled that down to four.
and we've had really good discussions with boeing. and i think they're on track as of today to hit that mid-april time frame. and we're hopeful that that's still the case and that nothing else comes up.
alison sider -- the wall street journal -- air travel reporter
got it. and is this something -- is this a situation where you would seek any kind of compensation from boeing for the delays? or if there was a further delay, is that something you would discuss?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
yes. yes, we're in discussions with boeing where we're at. there are delayed penalties that are paid and boeing is paying the delayed penalties, and everything is happening as we speak today. if there are further delays, and it really does impact the summer much more than what we think it is, then -- we've had good discussions with boeing that they will compensate us for the losses that we've had for the delay of those aircraft.

doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, david. we get the sense that they're -- again, the right people are talking to each other, and everyone agrees that it doesn't make sense to deploy any more 5g until we're certain that it's not going to have a disruptive effect on airlines. so again, that's where we stand at this point.
i hope that's where we'll stay. i feel really good about this role will be because, again, the right people are talking to each other. why it took this long to the right people to talk to each other? i don't know. we can do a post audit later.
i'm not quite certain. frankly, we are the end user of this dysfunction. it got -- we're the ones affected. our customers are the ones affected.
and as it was getting ready to be deployed, and we were, therefore, being told what that was going to mean to our operations, we screamed as loud as we could. and fortunately, people listened. so that's where we are today, and what should have happened prior to this is happening now. the technical experts that are working on it tell us it's really not that complicated once they all are able to share information and work on it.
so they seem encouraged that we'll be able to address this in a way that allows for full deployment of 5g, including near airports. i mean, again, with lower levels or whatever is required and also doesn't allow for -- it doesn't require any disruption of air travel. so that's where we are. i don't expect until we get to the point that everyone is really comfortable that that you'll see anything turned on near airports because no one wants to go through this again. 
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
so are the airlines talking directly to the telecoms? or are you going through the regulators?
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
look, it's much more about the manufacturers, our oem talking directly to the telecoms, which is happening. so the boeings, the airbuses, the palaces, honeywell, collin, etc., talking to their counterparts at at&t and verizon, obviously, with faa involvement. but it's -- what needed to happen is now happening is you needed those organizations, those companies able to talk to each other and share information. because when we do that, we can get results because people are willing to work together.
we hadn't have that, instead we had government agencies talking to each other, and that's -- that can be less productive.
david koenig -- the associated press -- business writer
all right. thank you.

our next question comes from mary schlangenstein with bloomberg news.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg news -- airlines reporter
good morning. congratulations, doug and robert, both. i wanted to ask you if you could talk a little bit about how much of a delay you see the omicron flare-up having on the return to more near-normal travel? one of your competitors said it pushes it out 60 days. but i wonder how that ties in with vasu's comments about the shortening time between a peak and a bottoming out and then a recovery in demand?
robert isom -- president
hey, mary. we don't see things a lot different. look, i think that we were recovering nicely after the delta variant as we took a look into the thanksgiving time frame. but then omicron hit, demand dropped off fairly rapidly.
and yes, demand is recovering faster than it had in previous ways. but i think it -- we don't view demand as anything more than delayed. we don't think it's diminished. and if you're taking a look in kind of the one or the two-, three-month time frame of how demand -- the rebound is pushed out, i think that that's the appropriate time frame.
and for us, as vasu has mentioned, i know doug earlier said as well, look, as we take a look out in february, especially as we get to current period, we see a lot of demand and a lot of strength in the bookings that we're seeing already. so i do think that as omicron [inaudible], we're going to come out strong.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg news -- airlines reporter
thank you. and if i could quickly ask, in discussing increased wage levels going forward and as you try to hire more people, is american contemplating, at all, potentially other unilateral pay increase for unionized workers, either any particular groups or maybe on a more broader basis?
robert isom -- president
and mary, as i mentioned earlier in the call, american has a very attractive brand. we have incredibly generous compensation benefits programs. we attract people right now with the positions that -- and the compensation structure that we have. in various pockets throughout the country, various positions like in regional carriers, we take the appropriate action that we have to.
but i feel really confident in where we are today and what we're contemplating in being able to track the right people in the right numbers and getting in front of it, too.
mary schlangenstein -- bloomberg news -- airlines reporter
ok. thank you very much.

our next question comes from leslie josephs with cnbc.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
hi. good morning, everyone. i was just wondering what you guys think the impact is going to be of the multiple labor negotiations you have going on now. you've seen complaints about the issues with quality of life, the schedule changes.
so curious if that changes how you think about scheduling the airline going forward? and what sort of like what mary was saying with pay increases in 2022 and beyond, how do you see that going?
robert isom -- president
leslie, thanks for the question. here's the one thing i know is that everybody at american is joined in the goal and objective of running a really reliable airline, one that returns to profitability as soon as possible. and so i know that our labor leaders, our team members, they want a profitable and successful american airlines as we go forward. so as we take a look into any negotiations, i know that that's a [inaudible] that we're all taking.
it's got -- it has to be a mindset of taking care of our team members certainly, but also making sure we take care of the company and our shareholders. and that's a balance that we've always been able to maintain and will do going forward. so as i think -- i look going forward, as i said before, i know that we can attract team members to american airlines. and there's ways we can get better.
and by better, it means running an airline that is more reliable, too. and i know everybody is joined in, in that goal.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
ok. thanks. and if i could just ask one follow-up on the 787. derek, did you say that boeing is definitely paying compensation now, and they could pay even more if the summer schedule is affected?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
the first answer is yes. i mean, there's delayed penalties that are always in all of these contracts. and boeing is paying the delayed penalties for each one of these contracts, 320s aircraft. and then the rest of it will be in negotiation as we talk to them.
i mean, hopefully, we don't have to do anything. and hopefully, they hit the schedule that they have, and we don't have any disruption as we go forward. but we've been told from the highest level of the boeing team that if there is compensation needed to come to the airline, that they're fully abreast to help us and to overcome the cost that the 787 has caused us over these last -- the delay in those aircraft has cost us over the last few years. and that's a negotiation we'll have with the boeing team.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
in addition to what they're already paying for the existing delay?
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
correct.
leslie josephs -- cnbc -- airline reporter
got it. thank you.

our next question comes from david slotnick with tpg.
david slotnick -- tpg -- senior aviation business reporter
good morning. and congratulations, doug. robert, during your prepared remarks, you mentioned something about a blurring of line between business and leisure travel. i was wondering if you could elaborate on that a bit? does it translate to higher yields, more premium cabin sales, etc.?
robert isom -- president
vasu is going to take this. go ahead.
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
david, greg here from you. but yes, we plan to be a really encouraging trend. we do see a blurring of lines where the trip patterns are changing. thursday, which is still our biggest business day of the week, is also becoming one of our biggest leisure days of the week.
we're having more people who buy business style, fare products, travel as if it's a business trip, but they're going to places, major destinations, fort walton beach, things like that. so that behavior is starting to change. and we can trace the things where people work fridays remotely or can spend a week or two at a time, working from some place that is not where they live. so all that's creating a lot more variation of how we've historically thought about business and leisure, but in that is a lot of opportunity.
but clearly, as we go through the pandemic, customers have a lot more flexibility with their time. there's a lot more savings that are out there, and travel has always been one of the most aspirational things for u.s. consumers. so we see a lot of that, and we benefit a lot -- from a lot of that in our short-haul network the most.
our premium cabin sales have been the most robust in places like the caribbean and leisure destinations in the u.s. more so than they've been and more prototypical business destinations like the transcon markets or london heathrow. so we're really encouraged by that trend. we think that it's going to lead to a lot of things.
that's why we have done a lot of things where we are increasingly rewarding travel, which is not just for how frequently people fly but for simply spending on our credit cards or spending all across the airline. and from my earlier comments, we think there's even more to do, which can be really great for our customers and, of course, really great to the airline, too.
david slotnick -- tpg -- senior aviation business reporter
thanks, vasu. and just as a follow-up. do you see the impact of inflation leading to anything involved in higher ticket fares, higher prices for customers?
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
look, it remains to be seen. i mean, this industry has a long history with inflation where it hasn't always bled so cleanly into fares. so we'll see, and we don't make any future commentary about pricing. but it's early to tell and how -- whether this level of inflation stays or not, it's even early to go and guess at that, too.
david slotnick -- tpg -- senior aviation business reporter
great. thank you very much.

our next question comes from dawn gilbertson with usa today.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, dawn. 
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- consumer travel reporter
hi. i got to say, doug, i'm really jealous. this is your last call, but i'm very happy for you and your family.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, dawn.
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- consumer travel reporter
i have a couple of questions, first, for vasu, following up on mary's question about kind of the lag in bookings because of omicron, spring break and summer. i'm wondering whether you guys are considering extending your -- the expiration date for tickets and for current travel credits? and my second question is probably for robert, but maybe not. your call times, like a lot of airlines still are pretty high, as recently as friday, it was four hours plus. can you give any specifics on what you're doing to address this persistent problem and what's behind it?
robert isom -- president
it's great to hear from you, dawn. i'll start and then others can add in, too. so first of all, we are assessing different options for what we call stored value, what we do with people who have covid-related credits that are out there. we've been really encouraged by what we've seen.
we're the only airline that allows customers to do name changes and reassign them in. because of that, we've seen a lot of consumers go and take advantage of that flexibility. and so that, combined with the fact that we've flown with bigger airline, has led us to, at least, believe that we may be seeing is probably a little bit different than others. but we're assessing what our options are, and we'll have more in the not distant future.
vasu raja -- chief revenue officer
dawn, and maya may want to help me out with this. but hey, with reservations right now, with so many changes that are going on in the environment, whether it's travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, schedule changes. you name it. the level of calls that we're getting right now is really unprecedented, and for good reasons.
and what we're trying to do with -- to make sure is that not only do we have all of the resources from a reservations perspective available. but we're also investing in things like chat and then callback functions as well. and one of the things i'm really proud of is while we have had some extended callback times as of late, i'm really proud of the way we've performed throughout the pandemic. american has consistently performed better than a lot of our competitors.
and as we come out of this huge call volume spike, and i expect us to get back to really reasonable and satisfactory times. maya, do you want to add anything else?
maya leibman -- executive vice president and chief information officer
 yes. just following up on some of the technologies that we've implemented in res around a virtual assistant, which is sort of artificial intelligence that can respond to some of the easier questions without the customer having to interact with an agent. and they can -- that's a win-win because the customer can really do that asynchronously and get their answer in short order, that, then this is on to chat for more difficult questions. our res agents are now trained.
we have hundreds now trained to be able to handle a chat. and again, this allows them to handle more than one interaction at a time, which is better for our customers and more productive for our agents. and then but like robert said, that really helps defray some of the impact to reservations. but at the end of the day, the nature of the questions that we're getting are so complex, where people are really wanting to fully understand what are the covid restrictions in traveling here? what kind of vaccination status do i have to have? how do i use this store value combined with this form of payment? and in those cases, we still need our fabulous res agents to be able to handle those. 
dawn gilbertson -- usa today -- consumer travel reporter
thank you very much.
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, dawn, before you sign off, with everyone listening in, you would have absolutely been in my prepared remarks whereas it's the peers still on the line. but look, of all the -- for those who don't know, dawn has covered airlines here's on our public when we started america west. so [inaudible] when we were at america west, really. of all the articles that i have written to a level that i've chosen to actually hang on to you, dawn, more than we have a dawn gilbertson by the line than anybody else.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the american airlines group fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded. [operator instructions] and now i would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, head of investor relations, mr. dan cravens.
dan cravens -- moderator, managing director of investor relations
thank you, liz, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the american airlines group fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. on the call this morning, we have doug parker, chairman and ceo; robert isom, president and incoming ceo; and derek kerr, chief financial officer. also on the call for our q&a session are some of our senior executives, including maya leibman, steve johnson, vasu raja, david seymour, nate gatten, and devon may. like we normally do, doug will start the call with an overview of our quarter and will update the actions we have taken during the pandemic.
robert will then follow up with some remarks about our operations and initiatives for 2022. after robert's remarks, derek will follow with the details on the quarter and provide guidance for the year. [operator instructions] before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecasts of capacity, and fleet plans. these statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause results to differ from those projected.
information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning, as well as our form 10-q for the quarter ended september 30, 2021. in addition, we will be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. a reconciliation of those numbers to the gaap measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found in the investor relations section of our website. a webcast of this call will also be archived on our website.
and the information that we're giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. so thanks again and joining us -- for joining us this morning. and at this point, i'll turn the call over to our chairman and ceo, doug parker. 
doug parker -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, dan, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for being on the call. we have a lot to cover today, but i'm going to start with the big news since last quarter's call, at least for me, which is that robert isom is going to be the next ceo of american airlines. that change is effective on march 31. i'm going to remain chairman of the american board, but importantly, i will have no executive duties.
robert will be fully in charge. i will stand as chairman for as long as robert and the board find that of value. this is terrific news for our team. robert is going to be the ninth ceo in the nearly 100-year history of american airlines, which we believe is the best job in all of aviation.
and we all are excited for robert and for american. as you all know, robert is someone i've worked alongside for several decades. he's an extraordinary team builder who understands the complexities of operating in an airline like american. he loves the people of american, and he brings a fresh perspective to the future of american.
i know he's going to accomplish great things, and i'm looking forward to watching that happen, along with all of you. now what this transition does mean is this is going to be my last earnings call with you all, which is kind of a big deal for me. i've had a speaking role on every quarterly earnings call since i became cfo of america west airlines in june of 1995. so by my calculations, this makes this my 107th consecutive quarterly call.
so i'm going to try not to speak as much on this one as i have on the first 106 calls, especially as it relates to the company's go-forward plans. rather, i'm going to let those who are leading american into the future to talk about that future. but before i turn over the stage, i do have a couple of quick thank yous. first is to you all, the sell-side analysts and the reporters, who cover our business.
you all have very important jobs covering this crazy industry that we all love, and you do it extremely well. i hope you know i have great respect for what you do and the challenges you face, and i've done my best throughout my career to treat you with the respect you deserve and to give you access in the community you need to do your jobs well. and you've all been extremely fair to me, which i really appreciate. so thank you very much as a blanket thank you to all of you on the line.
it also goes to some of the great people that preceded you, former analysts, like carl carros, candace browning, sam bucket; and former reporters, like terry max and susan carey, and scott mccartney. thank you, all. the second thank you is to the american airlines team which i can't begin to do adequately on this call, but what i can do to somewhat thank them is to tell you all about the phenomenal job they did in 2021. for the year when growing back to meet a huge increase in demand was the most important and challenging objective for all airlines, the american team grew back faster and further than anyone else.
we served about 25% more customers than any other airline in 2020, which is phenomenal in our industry. the last time in the u.s. airline was that much larger than the next best -- next highest competitor was more than 10 years ago, and that was done by merging two existing airlines, not through organic growth. this growth in 2021 led us to hire 16,000 new team members last year.
we expect to hire another 18,000 in 2022, and our team managed that growth while taking great care of our customers. we posted the best operating performance in our company's history in 2021 with the highest on-time performance and completion factor we've ever had. and we were the second highest to the four largest airlines in all of those metrics, despite the fact we grew back so much further and faster than they did. we're particularly proud of how we ended the year certainly relative to our competitors.
our team had far more customers than any other airline over holidays, and we did so with much less disruption than our primary competitors. american was the top-performing airline, among all airlines in december in each of the key operating metrics. and as our teams performed as well, our customers have taken note. our full-year 2021 likelihood to recommend scores were the highest in american history.
that's an incredible testament to our people, who not only show up every day to operate the world's largest airline, but they do so in a way that welcomes back our customers with open arms. and all this translated to our shareholders as well in a year of very difficult stock performance for the industry. american stock increased 19%, far more than any other u.s. airline.
so i want to summarize all this to convey my gratitude to the incredible american airlines team. and i want to thank each of them on behalf of our customers, our shareholders, and everyone who counts on them every day. it's this performance that gives us great confidence and momentum as we head into 2022 and beyond. so with that, thank you all again.
i'm going to now turn it over to our soon-to-be ceo, robert isom, to talk about what lies ahead. robert?
robert isom -- president
 thanks, doug, and good morning, everyone. i want to start by thanking the entire american airlines team for their efforts in the fourth quarter and throughout the entire pandemic. and i'd like to reiterate how honored i am to be taking on the role as ceo. i want to express my appreciation for doug's partnership and friendship over the years.
as you all know, doug leaves behind an incredible legacy, having opened many doors for our airline and our industry. i look forward to continuing to work closely with him over the coming months to ensure a seamless transition. i'm taking on this role at a very important time for american. over the past few years, our airline and our industry have gone through a period of transformative change that american has made good use of that time, especially in regard to renewing our fleet, facilities, and network, and making the company as efficient as possible.
for fleet, we have dramatically simplified. we now operate just four fleet types. that gives us operating flexibility, reliability, and efficiency. american's fleet remains the youngest in the u.s.
network carriers. our aircraft are equipped with industry-leading wi-fi, new interiors, and we've added seats to our 737 and a321 fleets, bringing us more in line with the rest of the industry. for facilities, we have expanded the number of gates we operate at our largest hubs in dallas/fort worth and charlotte. and we have inaugurated a wonderful new regional concourse at reagan national, which is historically our most profitable hub.
we've also invested more than $200 million in lounges over the past five years with new admirals club lounges opening at reagan national and laguardia. new and upgraded airport spaces are underway in new york, chicago, and los angeles as well. and we've also updated maintenance, training, and corporate spaces throughout the system to ensure our team can perform at an even higher level. for network, we're finding more to where our customers want to go.
our dfw and charlotte hubs are prime to operate more than 900 and 700 flights per day, respectively. our partnerships with jetblue in the northeast in alaska and the west coast allow us to create an industry-leading presence in markets that have historically been difficult for american. and our proposed investments in south american carriers strengthened our already industry-leading position in that region. as demand continues to recover and we return to full utilization of our assets, american is poised to outperform.
we have extracted $1.3 billion of efficiencies, and we're operating an economic fleet that will provide casm-x tailwinds as capacity is restored. based on our current assumptions, we expect all of this to result in a return to profitability later this year and continued deleveraging as we pay down $15 billion of debt by the end of 2025. and i'm excited to hit the ground running in april and build on our momentum to deliver results in 2022. so let's get to the business in the quarter.
this morning, american reported a fourth quarter gaap net loss of $931 million and a full year gaap net loss of $2 billion. excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $921 million for the quarter and a net loss of $5.4 billion for the full year. our results for 2021 were significantly improved over 2020, but the impact of the omicron variant has affected the timing of a full revenue recovery. we delivered a strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter, despite the rise in infections.
we reported fourth quarter revenues of $9.4 billion, our highest for any quarter since the start of the pandemic, and a sequential increase of $458 million from the third quarter. our cargo team continues to do a fantastic work and delivered record cargo revenues of $1.3 billion in 2021, 30% higher than our previous record. as we've seen throughout the pandemic, each new variance and corresponding increase in cases is followed by a faster recovery of demand with fewer regulatory restrictions and changes in travel policies. based on what we're seeing, we expect omicron to follow the same pattern.
bookings are recovering quickly after dropping off considerably in early december, though they're still not back to pre-omicron levels. leisure travel, particularly in the u.s., and short-haul international market, remains very strong and is approaching a 100% recovery. we expect this trend to continue. and interestingly, we've seen many of our customers that have historically -- we've historically called leisure travelers are actually flying for reasons beyond just vacations.
they may find a feature of a mountain destination, but they're actually going to work remotely for the week. the lines between leisure and business travel are definitely blurry.. the recovery of international and business travel slowed late in the fourth quarter, given the omicron variant, but we remain very bullish on both. the return of international travel is directly linked to travel restrictions around the globe.
as the restrictions fall off, we expect international travel to pick up considerably. we still expect business travel to come back in full, but it will come back in a different way. and by that, i mean the overall mix of business customers, how they travel and how we serve them. as we have shared previously, small and medium-sized business travel remains the strongest segment.
in the fourth quarter, small and medium business travel was roughly 80% recovered, while large corporate travel was only 40% recovered. in addition, small and medium business revenue had sequential month-over-month improvement in december, in spite of the impact of omicron. we're optimistic that as corporate travel returns in a significant way this year and as companies come back more fully into the office and get back on the road, we're going to be back on track. but as we're developing our plans and forecast for this year, we're working to build an airline that can be profitable, even without the full return of managed corporate travel.
the demand environment has changed a lot through the pandemic. because of this, we have to be nimble and responsive. we have built agile processes that allow us to deliver the network our customers need and want, no matter the environment. the game has changed and our team is ready.
growing back our network the way we did in 2020 is a feat in and of itself, but to do so while running a reliable operation and achieving strong revenue results along the way make it even more impressive. we entered 2022 with tremendous confidence as a result of the way we finished last year and started the new year. as doug noted, american had the best reliability of all u.s. carriers in december and the highest annual likelihood to recommend scores in our history.
we're very pleased that 97% of our team has been vaccinated or submitted a request for an accommodation, with no one losing their job. we put creative agreements in place with our union partners to support the operations throughout the pandemic and just recently reached new contract extensions for some of our team members to start the year, all of this while flying more flights and more passengers than any other u.s. carrier by a wide margin. to ensure this momentum continues, we have two sharply focused priorities for this year: running a reliable airline for our customers and returning to profitability.
returning to profitability is very much tied to the demand and revenue environment. but as i mentioned, the work we have done during the pandemic has positioned us very well. this includes our cost and efficiency actions, which derek will touch on momentarily, as well as the work that we have done to refocus our network around our most profitable clients. enhancing our partnerships around the u.s.
and around the world and driving value through the aadvantage program and co-brand cards has found something that we've done well. and on an absolute basis, new aadvantage member acquisitions in 2021 outpaced 2019, despite lower level of capacity, and our aadvantage revenues in 2021 closed in on 2019 revenues. so in summary, we're grateful for the incredible work of the american airlines team over the past year. we remain optimistic about the return of demand, and we're very pleased with how american is positioned, thanks to the tremendous efforts of our team.
and now with that, i'll turn it over to derek. 
derek kerr -- chief financial officer
thanks, robert, and good morning, everyone. before i review the results, i would also like to thank the american airlines team for their outstanding work during the quarter. this pandemic has been relentless. and despite the uncertainty, our team continued to show it's the best in the business.
this morning, we reported a fourth quarter gaap net loss of $931 million or a loss of $1.44 per share. excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $921 million or a loss of $1.42 per share. for the full year 2021, we reported a gaap net loss of $2 billion. and excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $5.4 billion.
despite the impact of omicron that we saw in this quarter, the trajectory of our revenue recovery continues to be positive, and it even exceeded our initial expectations as we outlined on our last call. our fourth quarter revenue was down 17% compared with the same period of 2019 versus our original guidance of down 20%. this gradual improvement makes it even clearer to us that despite the uncertain demand environment, the steps we have taken over the past 24 months to bolster our network and improve our revenue-generating capabilities are working. on the cost side, we remain focused on keeping our controllable cost down, and we actioned $1.3 billion in permanent annual cost initiatives in 2021, providing a new and more efficient baseline for our 2022 budget.
during the fourth quarter, we made the decision to invest in the operation with a holiday pay program for our employees, as well as reducing our peak holiday capacity. these actions did put pressure on our unit cost performance in the fourth quarter, but they led to a strong operational performance over that period. this included an industry-leading month of operating performance in december when it mattered the most to our customers. on the fleet side, i'm pleased to report that our fleet harmonization project is now nearly complete, with our last a321 going into the shop this quarter.
this is a full year ahead of our original schedule. we're excited to have this project behind us. in addition to a consistent product and better experience for our customers, the operational benefits of having a simplified and streamlined fleet are already being realized. the changes we have made to our a321s and 737s enable us to fly 2% more total capacity than we could have with the old configuration, thus, providing a unit cost tailwind as we continue to build back our network.
in addition to better unit cost, these reconfigured aircraft will also generate more revenue, allowing us to recover from the pandemic even faster. with respect to our widebody aircraft. we continue to have productive conversations with boeing to determine the timing of our delayed 788 deliveries that were expected to arrive last year. due to the continued uncertainty of delivery schedule, these aircraft remains out of our near-term schedule to minimize customer disruption.
we expect to fly four aircraft during our peak summer schedule. we ended the fourth quarter with $15.8 billion of total available liquidity, which is the highest year-end liquidity balance in the company's history. as we have said in the past, the deleveraging of american's balance sheet remains a top priority, and we are committed to significant debt reduction in the years ahead. even with this volatile demand environment, we remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025.
in fact, as of the end of 2021, we have already reduced our overall debt levels by $3.7 billion from our peak levels in the second quarter of 2021. during the quarter, we made $706 million in scheduled debt payments, which resulted in paying off the 2013-1 aatc b-tranche. in the first quarter, we expect to make $337 million of scheduled debt payments, which will include unencumbering 12 aircraft. for our pension, our funded status improved by 9.2 points to 77.9%, resulting in a $2 billion reduction in the underfunded liability on a year-over-year basis.
lastly, during the fourth quarter, we completed approximately $960 million of aatc financing, and we now have financing secured for all our 2022 deliveries through the third quarter. our 2022 budget reflects our priorities to run a reliable airline for our customers and return to profitability. our plan includes ongoing investments that will help build upon the positive momentum we've seen in our operations, while leveraging the cost efficiencies and network enhancements we have talked so much about. we believe these actions will provide a solid baseline for both profitability and free cash flow production when demand has fully recovered.
looking to the first quarter, covid-impacted demand and elevated fuel prices will continue to put pressure on our near-term margins. in this environment, we expect our capacity to be down approximately 8% to 10% versus the first quarter of 2019. based on current demand assumptions and capacity plans, we expect total revenue to be down approximately 20% to 22% versus the first quarter of 2019. we expect our first quarter casm, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 8% and 10%.
while we expect to be unprofitable on a pre-tax basis in january and february, we anticipate a material improvement and a return to profitability in march as demand returns. as for 2022 capacity, much of our plans are subject to the uncertain timings of deliveries of our 788 aircraft. as i mentioned previously, we moved these aircraft from our near-term schedule to protect our customers. this reduction is worth approximately 1 to 2 points of scheduled capacity for 2022.
with this adjustment, we expect to add back our capacity throughout the year and to have full year capacity recovered to approximately 95% of 2019 levels. this, of course, is subject to the future demand environment, and we always have the ability to adapt, if demand conditions warrant. as we look at our costs, like other airlines, we are seeing inflationary pressures in fuel prices, hiring and training for both new hires and existing crews as we build back our operation, including on the regional side. we are also seeing increased starting wages for certain work groups, including vendors.
in addition, we are seeing unit cost pressures from the rolling 788 delays, as well as the impact from our ramp and mechanic contract that was ratified in early 2020. even with these unit cost pressures, our fleet simplification strategy enables higher aircraft utilization and higher average gauge, both of which will help alleviate some of these pressures. as such, we expect our full-year casm, excluding fuel and special items, to be up approximately 5% versus 2019, with the second half of the year much lower than the first half as we fly in more efficient schedule. for the full year, our projected debt maturities are expected to be $2.6 billion.
this includes the cash settlement of our $750 million unsecured notes that mature in june. without any additional prepayment of debt, we project our total debt will be down $5.4 billion at the end of 2022 versus our peak levels in 2021. with respect to capital expenditures, we expect full-year 2022 capex to be approximately $2.6 billion, which is significantly lower than in previous years and versus others as our fleet replacement needs are complete. net aircraft capex, including predelivery deposits, is expected to be $1.8 billion, and non-aircraft capex is expected to be $800 million.
so in conclusion. we are incredibly proud of our team for their continued resilience in a very challenging environment. with the bold actions we've taken and steadfast commitment of our team, we are well-positioned for the future. now before we open up the line to questions, i would like to acknowledge dan cravens for a minute.
today is dan cravens' 62nd call, not quite as many as 107, but 67 is pretty amazing, and final earnings call as part of our american airlines, us airways, and america west team. i'd like to personally thank dan for his two decades of service, his advocacy for both the airline and our investors, and for his friendship. the continuing dan provided -- or the continuity, excuse me, dan provided over 20 years in his role across multiple airlines, multiple crisis and a global academic is unmatched.
we wish him the best of luck in his next adventure. we will be introducing scott long, who will be stepping into dan's role from our financial planning organization later this month. so with that, i'd like to open up the line for analyst questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from jamie baker with j.p. morgan. your line is open.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
oh, hey. good morning. i guess, you're starting in the order of the biggest second quarter miss. so great.
so, listen, we're all familiar --
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
not quite, but close, jamie. not quite, but close.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
all right. whew. so we're familiar with that relationship between airline revenue and gdp. you brought it up.
doug had a good slide on -- in his deck last month. have you looked at the relationship between leisure demand and gdp? and what that relationship might be telling us? i know we could try to back into this with some of the form 41 data, but i don't really trust it. there's a reporting lag. it just doesn't tell me anything.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
so, hey, jamie, thanks. i'm going to let vasu answer that. but hey, don't feel bad. this is a long game.
we know you're going to get it right over the long term. vasu?
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks for the endorsement.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes. jamie, thanks for the question. and it's a very good one, one that we've actually spent a lot of time thinking about. and look what i'll say is you're right.
in aggregate, like historical relationship between airline demand and gdp, let's call it industry demand, at something around just under 1% of gdp, does largely seem to hold. and we're seeing that as things start to recover. we spent a lot of time on this question about what is the actual trip purpose and how does that change? and the reality is it's changing in a meaningful enough way where we no longer think it's spurious and start a trend. for example, historically, only about 20% to 25% of the trips in the airline were something that we call blended, where somebody was traveling for both business and leisure.
now, for about five to six months, about 50% to 55% of the trips in the airline are blended. and as we look forward into the coming months, that continues to be the case. and that's playing out in a lot of different ways for us, which are both opportunities and a little bit unprecedented, right? we are seeing different sales days becoming big sales days, different travel days becoming big travel days. so the nature of what we call leisure demand and business demand is changing.
and the first thing is better understanding exactly how that is. but so far, it's been promising. those blended trips that we have in the system are coming in at yields that are 75% to 85% of what were true business-only trips, but they're coming through lower cost of sales channels and off of negotiated discount. so the net yields of them are very often the best things in the system.
so this is an evolving thing and one that we'll keep coming back to you. but the relationship is indeed changing, as you say, even though in aggregate, a lot of the trends won't.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and just out of curiosity, how do you define or how do you tell that a trip is a blended trip? is it somebody booking with a corporate discount and then bringing a family member on an adjacent pnr? like how do you know that?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes. so over the years of viewing this thing, we actually come out in two ways. one, we have a lot of models that go and actually predict whether the behavior is business or leisure. and we survey customers to go and calibrate the model.
so over time, we are really good. so whatever we -- you hear us talk about business, we are talking about, for example, somebody who travels, one person on the itinerary, no checked bags, things like that, right? it's just a profile and we calibrate it against surveys of what the customer actually tells us. and so, one of the things that we found is that increasingly, those surveys are starting to change because people are saying they're flying both for business and leisure or it's one person in the itinerary, but they're leaving on thursday, coming back on a monday and going to pensacola. so a lot of things are starting to change, and that's actually a pretty promising thing.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes. fascinating. thank you for that. and then, second, and maybe for robert, as we think about the steps that you're taking to protect the operation, heading into the summer peak, is the zero still the metric that american tends to focus on? i think it was in the past.
the sense i got was that it wasn't hugely popular with the entirety of the airport staff. just wondering if with your background, robert, and having ascended to the top seat, is that still the metric that you have prioritized, let's say?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
jamie, i'm going to start with this, which is the outcome in on-time arrival we know is the biggest driver of customer satisfaction, as i've said before, it makes the food taste better. it seems more comfortable, service more friendly, all that. and the best way to ensure an on-time arrival is to make sure you depart on time. so there's no stepping away from it.
but i'll tell you, we have evolved over time. and we really do want to take into account making sure that the things that we do to get an aircraft out on time don't compromise other aspects of the operation. so creating congestion on the ramp, or if we do have inclement weather, at the end of the day, if we have flights that you may be able to get out on time, but you ought to hold for connecting passengers, we do so. and so, we could go into a lot more detail on that.
but the answer to it all is, for the bulk of the airline, get it started right. no aircraft out of service in the morning, on-time departure, a fast turn and stay that way throughout the day.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's great. thank you both. appreciate it. take care.
thank you. our next question comes from david vernon with bernstein. your line is open.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
hey. thanks, guys. we're at the other end of the spectrum, i guess. could you talk a little bit about what you have in the forecast for business travel recovery as we think about the summer months? what are you seeing in the booking trends? i'm just trying to get a sense for kind of what the mix is within the guidance that you're giving us.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
hi, david. this is vasu. i can help with that. robert's commented at the beginning, as we closed the quarter, system business revenues were about 80% recovered versus 2019.
as we look at q2, we anticipate that number will be about 90% recovered versus 2019. we have a level of confidence in it because, indeed, we're seeing many of those bookings start to come in from my comments that jamie just now. but also, the gap between 90 and 100 is really largely due to long-haul international demand and certain pockets of domestic demand, but we are continuing to see demand come in.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
ok. and then, maybe just as a quick follow-up. i remember having a conversation with doug and derek in la, a couple of years ago now, around denied boarding, sort of involuntary denials, that kind of stuff. and you guys have been working on some technology to help you guys reaccommodate customers, work on this issue of not having enough seats on the plane overselling that kind of stuff.
is there any early indication during this period of demand here that those efforts are paying off and the denied boardings are coming in a little bit in line with those expectations you set out a couple of years ago?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
hey, david, we're going to start with maya leibman and talk about some of the things we've done. and if there's some add-on to that, vasu will do it.
maya leibman -- executive vice president, chief information officer
hey, david, this is maya. yes. over the last several years, we've really improved our technology around essentially pre-removing customers. so either before they get to the airport several days before they fly if we know that flight is at the risk of overselling providing them an opportunity to bid or to either take compensation or even just move to a different flight that's probably a little bit better than the flight that they were previously scheduled on.
or if it happens that there's a last-minute schedule change, a last-minute equipment change, so we have to deal with it at the airport, which isn't our goal. we're really trying to deal with it before they get to the airport. we have some pretty neat auction capabilities that allow the customer better opportunities to move around to other flights. and so, all of those things together have really helped improve our denied boarding statistics.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes. i'll only add to that is that throughout the pandemic, one of the hardest things to do -- to predict has been the show rate of the airline. understandably as the pandemic wore on, we would have periods of time where everybody showed for a flight in periods of time where the show rate could be as low as 70% of what was booked. what we're encouraged by in large part because of a lot of the technologies that we've got not just in managing overbooking, but it's typically just forecasting show rate.
we are getting to a place where we are a lot better at going and predicting what the variability is. and with the technologies that we've got proactively moving customers off so that we don't have the same level of denied boarding expense that we had in times past. and indeed, we're able to generate more revenue through the overbooking flights.
david vernon -- sanford c. bernstein -- analyst
excellent. thanks a lot today for the added color, guys.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from savi syth with raymond james. your line is open.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning. i was wondering, maybe, vasu, could you provide a little bit of color on what you're seeing across the -- on the long-haul side across the different entities?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
sure, savi. yeah, thanks for the question. look, we're really encouraged with how long-haul demand has come back, but it is indeed very different across the three long-haul entities of long-haul south america, transatlantic and transpacific. first, we are encouraged because indeed, we've seen bookings from maybe post-omicron low point in january.
so what we're seeing in the last four to six weeks, it's improved by several factors. in south america, that's a factor of two to three times. in transatlantic, it's something materially larger than that. and in transpacific, it's grown quite a lot, too, but still, the bookings are pretty small and insignificant in the totality of all of our bookings.
but what we're really encouraged by is the manner in which demand is returning first in long-haul south america, where we just -- where we have so much capacity. increasingly, we're seeing not just more customers simply sign on for flights, but we're filling premium cabins at a better and better rate. the same is true in transatlantic, where so much of the airline that we brought back there is centered around our partner hubs, in heathrow and madrid. and we're encouraged because those are -- to make those flights go, they are very premium demand consumptive and we are seeing a lot of premium demand, even though we aren't seeing large corporate travel quite come back into international the way we've seen before.
and transpacific, it's understandably challenged because as long as there are entry restrictions, demand remains pretty stubborn to come back. but -- like i said, we're encouraged that once those restrictions are lifted, the demand improves pretty meaningfully.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
that's super helpful. and if i might ask, derek, just a quick question on the fuel. is your kind of fuel contracts based on kind of the forward curve and crack spreads? i think there's -- or like spot prices, i mean? i think there's a little bit of confusion on what we're seeing on spot, and this is not unique to american, but what's being reflected in fuel guidances.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yes. no, that's exactly -- we just pegged it two days ago. so at 100 -- it was 107. and then, we used the crack spread and where that was, and the crack spread had increased a little bit.
so the difference may be crack spread and then the dates that everybody takes the fuel pay, but we're straight off of the fuel curve and then it's dependent on where are you buying your fuel. are you buying your fuel more in the gulf coast, l.a., new york. so there could be differences between each airline just where the brunt of the fuel comes from.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
makes sense. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from helane becker with cowen. your line is open.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. hi, everybody and thank you for the time. just two questions. one is on minimum liquidity.
derek, have you thought about where you want that to go, other than get -- i think you said, what, pay down $15 billion of debt by 2026? and then the other question is, i think, related to the pilot training pipeline. you talk about a shortage of crew members and limits to capacity growth, so how are you thinking about catching up?
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yes. i can do both, and robert can add to some of that. so as far as minimum liquidity, we're still in the same place as we were a couple of calls ago. we're at about $15.5 billion right now.
we are seeing this recovery. we'd like to see it actually be in the actuals. so i think this is a forward guide, which we think is where we're going to get and be profitable for the quarter. if we maintain this level, what we have said is we would take a step down to somewhere in the $10 billion to $12 billion range.
and hopefully, that happens sometime this year, which can accelerate the debt pay down. and any further than that, we just haven't had the discussions through the board and through the committees. we ran the company at $7 billion of not minimum liquidity, which i defined -- that was kind of our targeted cash level. minimum liquidity is actually much lower than that.
but our targeted cash level was at $7 billion. and so, right now, we're holding out of the cash. and when we see the recovery, and it's holding up and the cash is holding up, we will use that cash to pay down debt. and i think we'll take it down to somewhere in the $10 billion to $12 billion range as we look forward.
on the pilot training pipeline, as robert said, we've hired 600 pilots at the mainline. so it really is -- we have the pilots. i think the industry is -- it's about trying to hire 2,000 pilots this year versus the most we've ever hired in the past is 1,000. so we have the simulators coming in.
we have the trainers coming in. so what it is, is trying to get everybody through the pipeline. and i think we will be fully utilized in how all of our aircraft flying by the end of the year. the other side of it is the regional carriers, which we're working on, is that that hiring is going well also.
so we're hiring there. just the attrition is much greater than the hiring at this point in time or getting people through the pipeline. that has slowed, which is good. so as all the mainline carriers have hired from the regional carriers, we all have a backlog to get through training.
so the regional attrition has slowed, which will be good for regional capacity as we go forward. but we believe that by the end of the year or through the summer, we'll be back up and having all the airline -- aircraft flying, which will be great for us from a utilization perspective. it will be great for us from a cost perspective to drive down the unit cost as we bring back all of those aircraft and get the pilot pipeline moving through.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
yeah. well said that. and the only thing other -- helane, the only other point that i would add is that, look, over time, it's supply and demand. and i'm confident that the quality of life and the compensation for pilots is something that's going to attract a lot of people to the industry.
it may take some time to work through, but it will happen.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
right. could you, in the short term, bring back pilots who might have retired at, say, 58 or 60, and just have them work for a couple of years to bridge the gap? or once they retire, that's that?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
helane, i'm going to ask david seymour, our chief operating officer, to weigh in on that.
david seymour -- senior vice president, chief operating officer
yeah. i think the challenge with that is many of them have been retired long enough that they would have to go through a requalification, which would take one of those slots. so given that, as derek talked about, we have the supply coming in and the schoolhouse is really running at full speed here. and we're hitting the objectives that we've set forward to reach the goals that derek talked about for the remainder of the year.
so as much -- i think that would be a great idea. it will just take away a slot for a new hire that's coming in.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
and overall, as well, we have a great relationship with the apa and making sure that we're getting as many pilots onboard and creating as many captain positions as we possibly can. and anything that would alter something like retirement status would have to be something that they champion.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
got. ok, great. thanks very much, guys.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
thanks, helane.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mike linenberg with deutsche bank. your line is open.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
oh, yeah. hey, good morning. just two here. i guess my first to vasu.
vasu, historically, i guess, sort of the rule of thumb is that the run-up in energy prices usually sort of finds its way into the fair structure with like a lag of three to six months. it does feel like that it's getting recaptured far more quickly. and i just wonder if it's any sort of structural changes and/or just by approaching this fuel price cycle with a bit less capacity, which may give you some leverage in your ability to quickly offset that? just your thoughts around that?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes, mike, it's an excellent question. and it looks like jamie is one that we've actually spent a lot of time understandably thinking about. look, it's really hard to tease out the different effects because you're right, there's high fuel prices, there's various limits on capacity as airlines try to size their airlines for the staffing that they can produce. and of course, demand, which just continues to accelerate at a pretty unprecedented rate.
so look, what we look at are actually the fares that we, american airlines, are out and selling. and we're encouraged that indeed, month to month, we are seeing a greater increase in fares than certainly what we saw in 2019. but very importantly, one of the things that we've been looking at is how fair is at large -- or how is the rate of increase actually changing in 2019 to 2022 versus the last time the industry went through so many cataclysmic crisis, which were big fuel, the great recession, changes in the industry to consolidation. and indeed, the rate -- the pace of change that we're seeing is growing much greater than what we saw before.
short way to say it is we are seeing a lot of strength in a fair environment with customers who frankly value quality of product that we have and are willing to pay us at flat. so we're encouraged by that. we see those trends going forward into the summer. and of course, that's inherent to the revenue guide you see before you.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. and then, just my second. with respect to the nea and i guess, the justice's concern about potential consumer harm, have you put out any numbers about what you have done from a consumer benefit perspective since it's now been up and running, i think, for some time, or is that something that we just won't find out about until september? thank you.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
i can start and others can add. well, look, we can't talk about the consumer benefits of the nea enough. and indeed, you can already see it in just what's published out there. in the first quarter, we brought the northeast back faster than any of our competition.
and arguably through bringing it back, has encouraged competition where they frankly wasn't any before. we're doing things like we have full flat beds on all of our transcon markets, which is a thing that american airlines is -- has long dreamed of and now through this partnership with jetblue we're able to make it happen. we brought jetblue into laguardia, i think, which they long to make happen, putting a new level of price competition on the incumbent carrier there. and so, we're encouraged by the structural things that's there, but what we're really encouraged by is the way consumers are responding to it.
so right now, for the first time and as long as we've recorded it, advantage enrollments, our loyalty program enrollments are growing in new york and boston at greater rates than anything in the system as an absolute size, which is greater than anything at the system. new york is -- on a percentage of 2019, we're acquiring more credit card customers there than we did in 2019 and at a greater rate than any other parts of our system. so all of which is to say that the consumer is clearly responding to it. we see those benefits, and we keep rolling things out.
we -- there's a lot that we've kind of worked through as we kind of try to staff up a connecting operation at jfk. we've endeavored to go slow in order to make it happen. i hope for a minute to say that we are all the way to achieving what we want there to be, but we are really encouraged by what it's doing for consumers, the level of competition that it's bringing. and indeed, i mean, we can't talk about it enough, and maybe we need to talk about it more.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
vasu, i'll just add to that. and i know our chief legal officer, priya aiyar, will agree with me. but we welcome scrutiny. we know that this is producing the benefits as we said it would.
and it's doing exactly what we had hoped. and we're confident we're going to prevail no matter what we face going forward. pretty good with that?
priya aiyar -- senior vice president, general counsel
absolutely.
mike linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks, everyone.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dan mckenzie with seaport global. your line is open.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
oh, hey. good morning. thanks, guys. a couple of questions here.
first, a clarification to guide, maybe for vasu. what level of restoration in international flying does the revenue guide embed? so does it include the relaxation of the 24-hour testing requirement in may sometime? and what conversations is the government having with you about the travel restrictions internationally?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
so vasu, you can handle that first part. and then, let's have nate cover the point out of testing.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah, thanks for the question. and look, international at large, we broadly anticipate to be 100% recovered. and indeed, it's not far from that right now. but to the question earlier from savi, international is in a lot of different states of play right now.
never forget that for us, in the second quarter, roughly 90% of our airline is flying in the western hemisphere and heathrow. so a lot of our recovery is due to the fact that our short-haul international network is recovering at rates that are probably greater than what we see in domestic. and those markets, such as london and long-haul south america, are recovering pretty quickly, too. and that's where we have all of our capacity.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
and, actually, just one note there. international revenue, not 100% recovered. and then, go ahead. go ahead from a long-haul perspective.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
correct. yes, correct. so yes, i would say that the long-haul revenue isn't all the way there, but total international is -- and that's --
nate gatten -- senior vice president, corporate affairs and chief government affairs officer
ok. yes. and this is nate. i would just say on the regulatory side, obviously, the testing is something that we continue to engage on with our industry partners.
we believe that the u.s. can safely follow countries that are progressing through the pandemic, including canada, the u.k. and ireland, which have, we think, safely evolved the scope of their entry requirements and moved away from predeparture testing. we've learned by this point in the pandemic, however, not to speculate on what may or may not happen.
so we don't have a specific time frame in mind, it's just something we continue to work on. obviously, the decision is going to be up to the federal authorities and public health experts.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
ok. and for everybody, that's nate gatten our head of corporate and government affairs. so thanks, nate.
dan mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yes. thanks. second question here. looking at slide five, the simple math is it looks like there's roughly $7 billion of revenue that was missing on an annualized basis relative to the first quarter.
but i believe the headcount is already in place. so we're left with variable cost, i think so. but if you could flesh this out, the fixed versus variable costs as you add back some of this higher-margin international flying?
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
dan, this is derek. as we have talked about, we have the airline and costs in place to run a much greater airline. so as we go and as robert said in his comments, our casm will get better and better throughout the year as we head back to flying. an example is our salaries, i think, stayed pretty flat throughout the year, even though we're growing asms throughout the year.
so most everything is in place to fly. the example is the 787s. we thought we had the 787s coming in beginning of this year. so we have the pilots.
we have the crews. we have everything ready to go. we're not going to train them back down to 73s or other aircraft. we're going to leave them there for when they come.
so our expectation as we move forward and we bring back the aircraft and utilize our fleet and get us back to 100% of 2019, that it comes at a significant reduction in the casm calculation as we go forward.
nate gatten -- senior vice president, corporate affairs and chief government affairs officer
thanks for the time, you guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi. your line is open.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning. congrats, robert, on the formal handoff. i wanted to follow-up to mike's question.
just with respect to jetblue's bid for spirit, as it relates to the nea. do you see any relationship between the two initiatives? and what is american's perspective on the proposed acquisition?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
steve, you want to comment here.
steve johnson -- executive vice president and strategic advisor
sure. hi. thanks for the question. this is steve johnson.
first, i think it's important to recognize that jetblue's acquisition of spirit is not a foregone conclusion. jetblue and spirit is near -- as we can tell, they are discussing that now, and we'll ultimately find out which direction that's going to go. but i would say that joanna and robin were very quick to call robert, as soon as the story leaked. and they were steadfast in their view that nea was extraordinarily important in priority to jetblue and that they intended to do everything that they could to maintain it.
and that -- part of their bid for spirit contemplated, keeping and even strengthening the nea.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks for that perspective. with respect to the rasm guidance, vasu, can you just contrast for us maybe how leisure fares are tracking versus 2019 versus closing business fares? and i understand regions, etc., make that more complicated. but maybe if we just look at it on a cut per say, domestic, is the closing zero to three getting better yet relative to '19? thanks for taking the questions.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. hey, thanks for the question. and indeed, one that we look at very closely, because it is kind of interesting. we look at it both and what is out there selling, but importantly, what is netted back to us after we deduct the cost of sale from it.
and so, we are seeing, first and foremost, that -- we look at it really outside of 14 versus inside of 14. outside of 14, indeed, there is a significant level of fare strength across any competitive o&d grouping there might be. inside of 14, we see the same level of fare strength. but as we look at it right now, leisure trips or blended business leisure trips are coming in at yield levels that are anywhere from 75% to 80% in aggregate of what inside 14 corporate negotiated trips are coming in at.
and that's a really meaningful number because that means on a net basis, sometimes these fares which are coming to us oftentimes through our direct channels, through some pretty unprecedented sources on a net basis are actually really, really valuable to us and really valuable park and departure. the fares are high. what we are encouraged by is as we have rolled through march, there's simply more demand inside of 14 and more business and business and leisure demand. so yes, we see a lot of strength in the fare environment, a lot more strength outside of 14, but progressively greater strength and greater demand inside of 14.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. thank you for that. i guess, maybe just to put a finer point on it. do you think zero to three is still an opportunity?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes, it is but not in quite the same way that it was before.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from catherine o'brien with goldman sachs. your line is open.
catherine obrien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. thank you so much for the time. so maybe just one on the 787. when we think about your capex over the next couple of years, as the 787 rules into future years, should we just be thinking about rolling forward that associated capex? are we reaching a point where we should be thinking about maybe some late penalties potentially lowering your overall capex profile as we look across the next couple of years on an aggregated basis? i think you might have mentioned that boeing was already paying penalties to prior years.
just trying to get a sense to the read-through to american free cash flow in future years. thank you.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yes. catherine, i would, just from a capex perspective, i would just roll it without a doubt. any kind of settlement that we have will be separate. the boeing management team have assured us that they will cover us for the damages on the 787s -- the deliveries with the 787s.
how that comes? i don't know, because we haven't talked about it. there's no reason to discuss damages on the 788s until they deliver and we know when those are going to be, so that can be calculated. so in the models today, i would move the capex and just shove out the capex. but i would -- there is upside to the cash flow or something for a settlement with the boeing team.
as they've said, they will cover the damages that we are incurring for those aircraft to be delayed and deferred.
catherine obrien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. got it. and then, maybe one for vasu, just coming a little bigger picture here. can you just update us on the hub strategy you're working through pre-pandemic? the new growth opportunities at dfw, charlotte, d.c., as you add back capacity, are you adding proportionately more flying into those hubs than you had in 2019? or do you need to first restore the pre-pandemic network overall and then you look to those growth opportunities? just trying to get a sense of -- i know those are the really most profitable hubs.
so are we already starting to blend in that higher proportion of more profitable flying? or is that on the comp? thank you so much for the time.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
it's a great question. yes, we are absolutely blending it in now. as we said through the pandemic, we had no intention of wasting the crisis, and we didn't. we massively simplified the fleet, reduced, frankly, a number of long-haul airplanes that were among some of our most unprofitable route.
launched new partnerships where we can create more value for the customer, offer more network in places like the west coast and new york where we're weaker. but very importantly, we've put a lot more capacity into our hubs in two ways. one, we've concentrated more flying there, but we've updated the airline as well. we're 8% more seats per departure than -- as we go forward than what we were at the same time last year.
but for us, like the changes are indeed quite meaningful. right now, if you go look in published schedules, about 65%, 70% of the airlines flying really what we call our sunbelt hubs and short-haul caribbean kind of markets, where the airline has a unique level of strength. and just -- to put that in perspective, i was reading through everyone's print last night, that in q1, our four sunbelt hubs, dfw, charlotte, miami, phoenix, were somewhere between 70% to 80% of our competitors' full network, but we're -- are producing unit revenues between 5% to 10% greater than those networks. so very much that is a major thing, a big part, as we talked about here, of returning to profitability.
and frankly, running a better operation is focusing hard in those markets where we create really unique and disproportionate value and really getting all of our assets working there.
catherine obrien -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from conor cunningham with mkm partners. your line is open.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
hey, everyone. thank you for the time. i know united and delta have talked to generating a profit for -- in 2022, just given where demand is. and i realize you guys have stopped short of saying that today, but the question that we're getting is just around the sustainability of like rasm production.
so do you expect to generate a profit for the remaining three quarters of this year, assuming like no massive change in oil or anything like that?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
hey, conor, i'll start. derek can add into this. look, we're really pleased to be here talking about record revenues and producing a profit in the second quarter. but those are forecast.
and you know what, our job here is to make those forecasts a reality. so we're going to get to that business. and fourth -- to achieve profitability for the year, i can -- i guarantee it, we need to be profitable in the second quarter. and we're going to get started on that, and we'll update you as time goes on.
derek, anything else you want to add?
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
agree.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok. ok. and i know you said you've sized the airlines and the resources you have, but there has been some struggles with operations and demand surge last year. do you assume any incentive pay above and beyond what you've historically contemplated in your 2022 casm outlook? and have you viewed incentive pay any differently than you have in the past, just given some of the staffing issues the industry has faced, in general? thank you.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
conor, thanks for that. but i'll start with this, is that just like the rest of the world, we're all getting back up to speed. firstly, for american, we didn't what -- the government asked us to when they provided us with the payroll support program. we ran the airline, and we ran it to serve people that had to get to the business and leisure activities, and you name it.
as we go forward, the jump that we have to take, to get to the kind of capacity that derek has mentioned in our forecast, it's not that sizable of a jump. we're way ahead of it. we've certainly learned from issues. we're really focused on other parts of what i consider the airline supply chain, and that's our partners.
but we're very well compared. we have 12,000 more team members on, all ready to fly the summer -- the spring and summer schedule, i feel really great about it and i'm very, very confident that we're going to fly a reliable airline as we did, and we proved over the year-end holidays, better than a lot of our competition and as we have in the first three months of this year too.
conor cunningham -- mkm partners -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andrew didora with bank of america. your line is open.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone. first one for derek, just to confirm the updated casm outlook that does not include any new labor deals, excuse me. and then, just kind of a follow-up to that, given the labor market and your operational plans, where do you think kind of casm eventually shakes out relative to 2019 once all is said and done?
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yes. one is -- yes, our casm guidance does not have any new labor deals in it. we're in negotiations with a lot of our unions at this point in time, but we don't -- but we'll put those in our casm guide when they occur and when we know where those are, but that's not in the casm guide for the rest of the year. getting back to 2019 levels depends on growing back and when do we grow back fully from a capacity perspective.
and also, as you alluded to, when do those labor deals go into effect? in 2019, we did the mechanic deal and we completed the mechanic deal during 2019. so that year over year is now into our numbers. so i think as we grow the airline back, getting ourselves back to 2019 casm levels will take us to get our utilization back to where it was before and get all the aircraft back flying to get closer to that 2019 level.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then, vasu, fully appreciate the historical relationship with gdp in response to one of the earlier questions. i guess, we get a lot of investor questions on inflation and the health of the consumer.
do you have any historical perspective on consumer demand at these levels of inflation? and at what points do you begin to anticipate some sort of consumer slowing, if at all, in this type of environment? thanks.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes, it's an excellent question. and look there's a lot that we're seeing today, which is kind of breaking from a lot of historical trends, much like the question earlier about how fuel prices are bleeding into fare. it's just it's -- right now, it's really difficult to tease out what is causing what. but yes, as an industry, there hasn't been a great history of how inflation has turned into changes in demand.
but we're so far encouraged by what we see right now in two ways. first, demand continues to grow and grow at a meaningful pace. how long-lasting it is, remains to be seen. but if we learned anything in the last 20 to 24 months, we can adjust just about anything and do it pretty quickly.
and the other thing which is really encouraging is, frankly, spending on our co-branded credit cards. that is one where the -- throughout the pandemic, even though airline revenues fell, our co-branded revenues never fell nearly to the same degree. and indeed, we're encouraged right now because their -- our acquisitions are higher than before, and our spend on the card is keeping pace with inflation. indeed, on our card with barclays, our spend is growing at a greater rate than inflation.
so we are encouraged by that. there's clearly a level of demand for our product and future anticipation of travel, which is very promising. and we'll see how it plays out.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks, everyone.
operator
thank you. and that's all the time we have for analysts. we open the queue for your media. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from alison sider with wall street journal.
your line is open.
alison sider -- airline reporter
hi. thanks so much. i'm just curious what you're seeing -- any response to covid cases starting to rise again? are you seeing that reflected at all in the consumer demand? or in sort of your staffing, are you seeing higher rates of absences? and is that something you're kind of planning around?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
it's robert. the answer to both is no.
alison sider -- airline reporter
ok. and i guess, if i could, on the masks. i guess, in a couple of days since that policy has changed, have you seen any evidence of any kind of shift in bookings, increased bookings or decreased? is there any evidence yet that there will be any change to demand as a result of the mask mandate being lifted?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
hey, allie, this is vasu. it's still very early to tell and really difficult to draw very much of a conclusion. but so far, there's nothing to indicate that it's materially up or materially down.
alison sider -- airline reporter
ok. so not like when other international travel restrictions get lifted and there's an immediate response?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes. certainly not on that order of magnitude at all.
alison sider -- airline reporter
got it. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from david koenig with associated press. your line is open.  one moment. ok, david, your line is open.
david koenig -- business reporter
yes. hey. robert and derek both addressed this on the pilot. you gave pilot -- figures for pilot hires.
i was looking for a net number. is 600 enough to offset the age 65 retirements and other attrition? what's the net number? and bottom line, are you going to have enough pilots to fly this summer?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
let me start, and david seymour can join in. the answer is yes. as i've said repeatedly, we're sizing the airline for the resources that we have. from a pilot perspective, all of this hiring is meant to match up to a schedule, but also a schedule that we are making sure that we've built in safety factors.
so we have tremendous confidence that we can fly. in addition to that, we're scheduling the airline, employing tools that are different than we had before. and my confidence only grows, as i -- as we make our way in the year. david, do you have anything else to add?
david seymour -- senior vice president, chief operating officer
robert, let me just add to that. i mean, -- i think the numbers derek talked about, the 600, that was this year alone. so last year, we had a target of hiring 350, we hired over 500. so the 600 is just for this year, and that's well ahead of pace where we set our expectations to.
and in the pilot training right now, we're actually hitting our goals and our throughput that we expect and don't foresee any problems going forward of making those numbers so we can hit the goal and fly all of our aircraft by the end of this year.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from mary schlangenstein with bloomberg news. your line is open.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
hi. thanks very much. i had a couple of quick questions. one, robert, you had said this morning, i think, that you're not doing as much regional flying as you would like to be.
and i wanted to see if you could comment in terms of have you got planes parked? have you suspended any routes? and is that all related to the shortage of pilots on the regional level?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
yes. so thanks, mary. as derek noted, we're not finding the full regional schedule we'd like to. we're going to get those aircraft back up over time.
but it's related to how they're being hired from the regional airlines, so an increased level of attrition and the time it takes to actually backfill those pilots. so while the regional carriers are able to source pilots at this time, we just can't get them up to speed, and in the position, fast enough. over the long term, we do need to work on regional pilot supply. and we're out in front of that with our cadet program and trying to incentify people to come into the business.
and i know -- i'm confident that, over the long term, the prospects of quality of life and compensation are something that are going to attract people to the business. so it may take some time to work out. but as derek said, over the course of the next year or so, we anticipate being able to get not only mainline back up to full utilization by the end of the year, the regionals sometime thereafter.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
how much down is you're flying, your regional flying?
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
departures in the second quarter are probably down about 20% versus 2019, where the airline mainline is down about 5%. so maybe 15% different than -- lower than what the mainline is.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
ok.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
and mary, i want to note on that. we're not just -- look, while we have aircraft that we're not flying, there's many other companies like -- we're not changing that. we're simply sizing the airlines for the products we have. and so, our confidence in this summer is rooted in.
we've already taken a look. we've already made sure that we have appropriate confidence levels in what we can do. so no need for any type of concern over the summer.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
ok. and then, the second question i had, if we could go back to the nea for a minute. if the government tells jetblue, it can acquire spirit, but it wants big changes in the nea, what's the prospect for american at that time? is that something that you could have to walk away from with jetblue?
steve johnson -- executive vice president and strategic advisor
hey, mary, thanks, that's a speculation on speculation on speculation on speculation. vasu was -- i think really articulated in his comments about how pro-consumer and pro-competitive the nea is. i mean, we could go on and on about that. and if you assume that jetblue actually figures out a way to acquire spirit.
and we get to that point. the jetblue-spirit combination doesn't change the impact to consumers of the nea. it's not going to change one bit the value that we create for consumers in new york and boston. so i think it's -- there's a lot of water to go under the bridge, obviously, with respect to frontier and spirit and jetblue.
but i think there's -- that kind of speculation is probably premature. and we feel really, i think, excited about the prospects of winning our lawsuit with the doj. and we're looking forward to continue with the nea, just in perpetuity.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
yeah. steve, are there any discussions underway on settling with the doj over the nea? or do you expect that that's going to go to trial in september?
steve johnson -- executive vice president and strategic advisor
i expect it'll go to trial in september.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from dawn gilbertson with usa today. your line is open.
dawn gilbertson -- consumer travel reporter
hi. good morning, two questions on masks. do you foresee -- given the doj appeal, do you foresee any scenario in which the mask mandate on plan is reinstated as swiftly as it was removed? and the second thing is how is american handling traveler request for refund, given the -- how quickly the mask mandate was lifted? are you -- if someone doesn't want to fly they're immunocompromised, are you just giving refunds? what's your policy? thank you.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
nate, go ahead. take the first.
nate gatten -- senior vice president, corporate affairs and chief government affairs officer
yeah. i can take the first part of that question. this is nate. obviously, we're aware that the doj is appealing the florida ruling, although they have not asked for a stay of the district court judge.
beyond that, as i mentioned earlier, we've learned throughout the pandemic not to speculate on what the government may or may not do. i would emphasize though that in keeping with our commitment to create a welcoming environment for everyone who travels with us, customers and team members may, of course, choose to continue to wear masks at their own discretion. and we expect that many will continue to do so. but especially considering the steps that we've taken for the last couple of years regarding cleanliness and airflow, we don't feel that reinstating of the mandate is necessary at this time.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
yes. and dawn, thanks for the question overall. and just right off, we haven't had much interaction with customers that have said they want to do anything different. but like we do in all these events, we're taking a look at our policies.
and we are certainly, with customers, open and asking them to get in touch with our reservations office, and we'll make sure that we accommodate them in an appropriate fashion.
dawn gilbertson -- consumer travel reporter
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from leslie josephs with cnbc. your line is open.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter
hi. good morning, everyone. i was wondering how you guys are thinking about irops during the summer? and if you have enough capacity and clear capacity to handle rebookings? and how you are addressing that? and just kind of how the overall labor landscape looks, not just pilots, but customer service, grounds and other employees?
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yes. i appreciate the question. certainly, one that we spend a lot of time thinking through and working on. what i'd tell you, we've actually implemented a number of tools knowing that loads are going to be high as we go into the summer, and we welcome back a lot more customers.
and those tools we've actually been utilizing and have shown good promise here in terms of ensuring that we're not canceling and working our airline through a delay as this weather does develop, and we work our way through it. and that's really the key for us is making sure that we're canceling as few flights as possible to allow the traffic to continue to move through. but again, we're very focused on that. we know that the weather is going to be out there.
we're certainly not taking anything for granted.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
david, i'll just add. look, we have 12,000 new team members. and so, that's a lot more than the 600 pilots that we have. and actually, that 12,000 is net new.
and we hired, i think, almost 20,000 people. but those people -- team members are working in reservations. they're at our airports. they're throughout the system.
so we've beefed up our capacity to be able to handle. and then, maya, do you want to say about anything more about other technology that we're using?
maya leibman -- executive vice president, chief information officer
yes. i think david hit on it. the goal is to prevent the cancellations in the first place so that we don't have to reaccommodate people given the high loads that we expect this summer. and we've got some pretty cool new technology that really focuses on how we manage to do that.
in addition, really helping with improving our technology around crew recovery and some optimization technology that will really help reduce our taxi times, our turn times at airports and all of those things together are going to be in place for this summer, in order to ensure that we have a better approach to irregular operations.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter
ok. thank you. and then, my second question, just really quick. does it still make sense for american airlines to have an award chart just given where demand is and kind of how hard it is to find seats with awards these days, with miles these days?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes, thanks for the question. actually, what's been really interesting to us, even though we are seeing an improving fare environment is actually our redemptions are up both in march and as we go forward. as far as the award chart goes, that is certainly something which our top-tier loyalty customers very much value and they see a lot of opportunities for it to go and secure traffic, which many of them have been long anticipated through the pandemic. so as it stands, we're still really encouraged by having an award chart.
and encouraged that, frankly, even though we are, in this rising environment, we're creating the right level of availability for redemptions.
leslie josephs -- airline reporter
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from niraj chokshi with new york times. your line is open.
niraj chokshi -- business reporter
so i think most of my questions were answered already. i guess one question i had on masks was, do you anticipate it affecting hiring at all, maybe potential -- people you might hire might be nervous about sort of the shift, the drop of the requirement?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
hey, niraj. the answer is no. and just so everybody is aware, if our customers and team members want to wear masks, we encourage them. we welcome that, and we see that as a practice that's going to go continue forward.
niraj chokshi -- business reporter
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kathryn krupnik with cbs news. your line is open.
kathryn krupnik -- broadcast journalist
hey, guys. thanks so much for doing this today. i hope this is the last time that we have to talk about unruly passengers. but do you have a count on how many of that american has banned? and what are you going to do with those who are banned? are you going to do what your competitors are doing and doing case-by-case basis?
nate gatten -- senior vice president, corporate affairs and chief government affairs officer
yeah. this is nate. we don't give account for how many passengers we banned specifically for mask noncompliance. in most of the cases, the passengers who were added to our internal refuse list, as a result of mask noncompliance, will be permitted to resume travel at some point in time.
in cases where an incident may have started with face mask noncompliance and escalated into anything involving something more serious or certainly an assault on one of our key members or customers, those passengers are going to remain on our permanent internal refuse list and will never be allowed to travel with us again. i would just add in this vein, we're very grateful to our partners and the federal government who have prioritized the safety of our crews, both our ground crews and our crews in the air during this period. and we are really appreciative of the announcement yesterday from the acting faa administrator, billy nolen, who said that the zero-tolerance policy against unruly passengers is here to stay as we anticipate. unfortunately, that these cases will continue, although, as robert noted earlier today, hopefully, with fewer incidents.
operator
thank you. and that's all the time we have for q&a. i'd like to turn the call back to robert isom for closing remarks.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
thank you. i'll just close with this. look, we've worked really hard as a company to get to this point to be able to take advantage of an environment where demand is improving. the airline is structured in a really great fashion.
i want to thank our team members for working so hard to get us through the pandemic and to be in a position to actually realize everything that we want to make about american. and in terms of the transition as well, this is my first earnings call, i want to thank our board of directors, especially doug parker for making things really work smoothly, putting us in a position to be talking about things that are very, very favorable. and so, for our team, you've heard from a lot of players here today. i couldn't be more proud and confident in the team that we have from a senior leadership perspective.
you're going to hear more from them as time goes on. and our job right now is to make the second quarter forecast a reality. that is what we're focused on. so we're going to get out there and make it happen.
and i want to thank everybody for their time today.
operator
thank you. this concludes today's conference call. thank you for participating. you may now disconnect.
everyone, have a great day.

robert will start the call this morning with an overview of the first quarter and our priorities for the year. derek will follow with the details on the quarter and our operating plans and outlook going forward. after derek's comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions, followed by questions from the media. [operator instructions].
now, before we begin today, i must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast of capacity and fleet plans. these statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release that was issued this morning, as well as our form 10-q for the quarter ended march 31, 2022. in addition, we'll be discussing several non-gaap financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items.
a reconciliation of those numbers to the gaap financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found in the investor relations section of our website. a webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. the information we are giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. thank you for your interest and for joining this morning.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to our ceo, robert isom. 
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
thanks, scott, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us today. we're going to keep our comments brief this morning. i'm a strong believer that the results speak louder than words, and i'm confident in the results the american airlines team will produce.
now, let's start by thanking our team. day in and day out, they're on the front line, taking care of our customers, no matter what comes our way. and we've certainly seen a lot come our way over the past two years. the american airlines team has worked hard to position us well for the recovery, by simplifying our fleet, modernizing our facilities, fine-tuning our network, developing new partnerships, rolling out new tools for our customers and team, and hiring thousands of new team members, all that while flying the largest airline in the world.
i'm excited to see their work pay off for all of our constituents, our customers, certainly, the communities we serve, our team, and notably, our shareholders. it's an honor for me to have the trust of our team and to succeed doug parker as ceo and to begin in this position as the industry rebrand and our company returns to profitability. i'm extremely grateful for the opportunity. it's a fantastic time for the industry and for american airlines in particular.
for the year ahead, we are resolute in achieving two key goals above all else, running a reliable operation and returning to profitability. our team is up to the challenge, and we've already seen a lot of great progress. so let's talk about financials first. this morning, america reported a first quarter gaap net loss of $1.6 billion.
excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $1.5 billion for the quarter. despite the quarterly loss in a difficult january and february due to the effects of omicron, march results were markedly different. in march, we saw what's possible, with surging demand brought on by reduced infection rates, relaxed restrictions and tremendous pent-up demand for people to travel. despite a sizable increase in the cost of fuel during march, american achieved our first monthly net profit, excluding special items, since july of 2021.
demand is as strong as we've ever seen it. american produced revenues of $8.9 billion in the first quarter, including industry-leading passenger revenues of $7.8 billion. domestic leisure travel continued to lead the way, far surpassing 2019 levels of traffic and revenue in the month of march. in addition, we saw strong quarter-over-quarter improvement in corporate and government travel with revenue for this segment as a percentage of 2019 increasing 27 percentage points from january to march.
system business demand is now about 80% recovered, with small to medium business revenue approaching a full recovery and corporate revenue now around 50% recovered. corporate bookings are the highest that they've been since the onset of the pandemic, and we expect that to continue as more companies reopen their offices. we anticipate overall business revenue to be around 90% recovered in the second quarter. and finally, demand for international travel also picked up considerably during the quarter as travel restrictions were lifted in certain parts of the world.
long-haul international revenue was around 50% recovered in the first quarter and around 60% recovered in march. so there's still a lot of revenue upside as business and international travel continue to return. the american team has done an incredible job of setting up the airlines to take advantage of the rebound, pointing our network to where our customers want to fly, establishing partnerships in more challenging areas and making sure efficiency is top of mind. as a result, we're very optimistic about the continued recovery and expect to be profitable in the second quarter based on current demand trends and fuel price forecast.
turning to reliability. american ended 2021 with our strongest operating performance in the company's history. we're committed to maintaining that momentum in the first quarter, and we did. despite two difficult winter storms in dallas/fort worth, the team delivered a solid operating performance in the first quarter, leading the industry in on-time departures and finishing a close second at on-time arrivals.
and they did so while flying a considerably larger schedule than our next largest competitor. more importantly, for the month of march, in the mid-peak spring break demand and high load factors, we delivered our best-ever combined march completion factor. our operation in dfw and charlotte, our two largest hubs, met or exceeded our expectations and delivered their best on-time performance and completion factor in years. as a result of our team's hard work, our likelihood to recommend scores continue to track in line with plan and are near the top of our post-merger performance.
running a reliable operation this summer will be critical to the continued recovery, and we have taken numerous steps to ensure we are well prepared to deliver for our customers. our summer planning began last year as demand returned, and we haven't slowed down. american has 12,000 more team members in place to support the operation this summer than in the summer of 2021. we've already welcomed more than 600 new pilots this year, exceeding our goal.
and we will continue to aggressively recruit, hire and train across all departments to develop the best pipeline of talent in the industry. we're ready for the summer, and we have sized the airline for the resources we have available. again, we sized the airline for the resources that we have available. we've also made targeted investments in people, technology and resources that are yielding promising results for our team members and customers.
so before i hand it over to derek, i want to say that i'm really excited about the future of our industry and the future of american airlines. there's still a lot of revenue upside going forward, given industry revenues are still off from their historical relationship to gdp, barriers to demand are falling and business and international trends are promising. there are also certain industry constraints on growth in the near term, notably related to pilot and aircraft supply. and at american, we have completed a $1.3 billion cost reduction program.
and our unit cost performance will improve throughout the year as utilization approaches historic levels. no airline is better positioned to operate in this environment than american airlines because of our fleet, our network and everything our team has accomplished over the past two years. and with that, i'll turn it over to derek.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
thanks, robert, and good morning, everyone. before i review the results, i want to acknowledge doug for his more than 20 years as an airline ceo. doug's leadership revolutionized the industry and laid the foundation for american success going forward. i also want to thank the american airlines team.
their hard work and commitment to our customers and each other is truly extraordinary. this morning, we reported a first quarter gaap net loss of $1.6 billion, or a loss of $2.52 per share. excluding net special items, we reported a net loss of $1.5 billion or a loss of $2.32 per share. revenue in the first quarter outperformed the initial expectations we outlined on our last call, despite flying less capacity than planned due to winter weather events that affected our largest hubs.
our first quarter revenue recovered to 84% compared to the same period in 2019 versus our original guide of 78% to 80% recovery. demand recovery from the omicron variant was swift. and while leisure demand remains very strong, as more companies return to their offices, business demand is growing quickly. on the cost side, in addition to the efficiencies we've spoken about previously, we remain focused on keeping our controllable costs down, ensuring we are a more efficient airline as we return to normalized levels of capacity and utilization.
in fact, in the face of increased fuel prices, we were profitable for the month of march, excluding net special items, due to our strong revenue performance and cost efficiencies. our fleet remains the youngest and most fuel-efficient among the u.s. global network carriers. this month, we completed our narrow-body fleet harmonization project.
it covers more than 500 aircraft and will ensure a consistent product and better experience for customers, along with the improved revenue generation and unit cost production associated with the new seating configurations. in the first quarter, we took delivery of nine airbus 321neos and reactivated seven previously stored boeing 737-800s. we also inducted eight dual-class regional aircraft and parked three 50-seat embraer 145s. as previously disclosed, we made several updates to our fleet order book and the timing of future deliveries, allowing us to better meet the demand strength in domestic and short-haul international markets.
we previously announced our plans to exercise purchase options on 737 max-8s. 15 of these options are scheduled for delivery in 2023 and 15 in 2024. additionally, with the continued uncertainty associated with our 787 deliveries, we are now planning for the delivery of only seven 788s in 2022, all after our summer schedule, with the remaining six 788 aircraft being delivered in 2023. the four 789 aircraft previously planned in late 2023 are now planned to be delivered in 2024.
with these changes, our expected total aircraft capex is $1.8 billion in 2022 and $2.2 billion in 2023. we ended the first quarter with $15.5 billion of total available liquidity, significantly higher than our initial forecast due to atl build of $2.3 billion in the quarter. we generated operating cash flow of $1.3 billion and free cash flow of more than $350 million in the first quarter. deleveraging our balance sheet remains a top priority, and we are committed to significant debt reduction in the years ahead.
even in this volatile environment, we remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025. during the quarter, we made $344 million in scheduled debt payments and completed $317 million in open market repurchases of our $750 million unsecured senior notes maturing in june. to date, we have reduced our overall debt levels by $4.1 billion from our peak levels in the second quarter of 2021. we expect to make $1 billion of scheduled debt payments in the second quarter, which includes the remaining outstanding balance of the unsecured senior notes.
lastly, with cost-efficient financing secured for all aircraft deliveries through the third quarter of this year, we are now beginning to evaluate financing options for the fourth quarter and first half of 2023. as we look at the second quarter, we expect to be profitable despite the expectation of continued elevated fuel prices. pretax margins are expected to be between 3% and 5% for the quarter based on the current demand trends and our fuel price forecast. based on current demand assumptions, we expect total revenue to be 6% to 8% higher versus the second quarter of 2019 on 6% to 8% lower capacity.
that would be the first time we have produced total revenue greater than 2019 since the start of the pandemic. in fact, if we hit the midpoint of this revenue guide, the results would be the highest quarterly revenue in the company's history. on this revenue strength, we expect total revenue per available seat mile to be 14% to 16% higher in the second quarter versus the same period of 2019. we expect our second quarter casm, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 8% and 10%.
our current forecast for the second quarter, which we pegged on tuesday, assumes fuel between $3.59 and $3.64 per gallon, an increase of more than 60% versus the price of fuel in the second quarter of 2019. in the near term, the demand environment is strong, but margins are lower than they otherwise would have been given the recent run-up in fuel. longer term, this industry has proven that it has the ability to recapture increases in the cost of fuel and be profitable at elevated fuel prices. we believe this time is no different.
as for full year 2022 capacity, we now expect to be recovered to 92% to 94% of 2019 levels. the reduction in full year capacity from our prior guide is largely due to 788 delivery delays that i touched on earlier. this capacity guidance is, of course, subject to future demand environment and fuel prices. consequently, with this lower level of capacity, we now expect our full year casm, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 8% and 10% versus 2019.
in conclusion, with the actions we have taken and the commitment of our team, we remain very well positioned. we remain focused on running a reliable operation and returning to profitability, which we expect to happen in the second quarter. with that, we'll open up the line for analyst questions.

operator
thank you [operator instructions] and our first question coming from the line of michael linenberg with deutsche bank. your line is open.
michael linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. good morning, everyone. hey. good job this quarter and good outlook.
i guess, derek, first to you on the $5.2 billion debt reduction that you've been able to do thus far, presumably, you're not including any sort of reduction in the pension obligation. and just given the run-up in interest rates and sort of thinking where the discount rate would go, can you just give us a sense of maybe the potential tailwind on that from a deleveraging perspective, sort of where things stand and how you're thinking about that pension obligation? thanks.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yeah. two things. one is that we look at that at the end of the year, so there was some benefit in the pension. the reduction in '21 -- there was a slight reduction in '21 of the pension obligation.
as we look at where we're at now as of june 30th, the actual pension status or funding ratio has gone up to about 81%. the liabilities have dropped over $3.5 billion due to the interest rate change, and it's a higher interest rate, which has more than offset the asset reduction. so it's actually in a much better spot than it was before, not the way we want to get there, without a doubt, but it is in a better spot from a pension liability standpoint. but we have not yet added that in for anything in 2022.
but if we did, it'd be -- right now, it would be about $1 billion lower from a liability perspective, from a debt perspective than it would be before. so we are managing it the way we would any other time, staying very conservative in our pension and watching it. but the interest rate has actually driven the liability much, much lower than what the reduction in the asset class has been.
michael linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then the second question, and this is probably more for vasu. derek, you said that you're going to get 9 787s this quarter, and i know that everybody's been -- that, that has slipped multiple times.
and assuming that it does slip again, when i look in the fourth quarter, it does look like you have the 787 scheduled in -- it's in your timetable. if, for some reason, that were to slip again, like how many points of capacity do those airplanes account for in the back part of the year? thanks.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yeah. well, two things, mike. i corrected that, i think, in my comments, but it is nine for the year. we will have two coming in, i think, in early august.
the first two will come earlier, and we don't have any of them built into the schedule until november time frame. so if those do slip from august a little bit, we have put in almost a two-month pad in those coming in. but we don't think it will impact the fourth quarter a lot. if they slip a lot further, where the impact is going to be into 2023, not a lot into 2022.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
and mike, presuming that all 9 do deliver, call that roughly about deploying of capacity in a month.
michael linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. great.
operator
one moment for our next question. our next question coming from the line of helane becker with cowen. your line is open.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks so much, operator. morning. thank you. hi.
so just two questions. the first question, robert, i saw you on cnbc this morning, and you talked about the pilot contract. and i know you guys don't like to talk about it, but you did present your pilots with an offer that would increase pay by 17% by 2025, i think. could you just talk about what happens next and the status of that?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
sure. so helane, thanks for the questions. look, it's really important for us to take care of our pilots. you know that throughout the pandemic, we had put an offer on the table that would have made our pilots the most highly paid pilots in the industry.
we never pulled that back, even throughout the pandemic. but united went out and put out a better offer. and we thought it was really important to get to the table and make sure that our pilots know that we were going to take care of them. so we've done that.
and now we are negotiating very closely and actively, and my hope is that we make progress over the coming weeks and months. now how that bakes into financial forecast, we haven't put anything in yet. we don't know exactly where we'll end up. and then the point i'd just make is that with every contract, not only are there changes to compensation and quality of life, but we think that when we get to a contract, we'll have a contract that is -- that operates very efficiently for the company as well.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. great. that's really helpful. thank you.
and then just a follow-up question on london. i know phil asked you about that, too. and i heard scott say last night that london operations will call him up and tell him a day or two in advance they're canceling flights. i don't think you guys have as many flights to london as they do, but are you seeing the same issues? and is that -- and maybe how does that get fixed? or is it more a british air problem and a partner problem?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
no. let me start with this. first off, we have a really sizable operation in london heathrow with our atlantic joint business partner, ba. we offer the largest schedule into london heathrow, so it's very important to us.
one of the things that we've done is we've been able to isolate american's operations into t3, and so that has allowed us with our team to make sure that we're doing everything possible. now all that said, there's so much that you can do with your own team members. there's infrastructure, like bag systems that you're dependent on heathrow. and then, of course, ba is incredibly dependent on heathrow as well.
to that end, we're working as a group with our oneworld carriers to make sure that we match our capacity to the resources that are there. that will take some time to work our way through. and to that end, maybe i'll have nate gatten, our head of government affairs and corporate real estate add to what's going on and the prognosis for that.
nate gatten -- senior vice president, corporate affairs and chief government affairs officer
yes. thanks, robert. helane, what we worked for the last week on extremely short notice to cancel departing flights as a way to help manage airport crowding. and as robert said, we've found that request to be quite disappointing and frustrating on many levels mostly because of the significant burn that would put on our customers under short notice with few options for rebooking given the -- some of those.
what we did then was work with how to limit the capacity on our departing flights by capping loads on certain flights. we've rebooked passengers over other european points departure, did things like limit nonrev travel, etc. and as robert mentioned, we did that in conjunction with our oneworld and jv partners. it's important to understand that these procedures will be in place until the beginning of next week, at which point a new procedure for limiting passengers at heathrow is going to be instituted this time by the slot coordinators.
and we don't have the full details on how that's going to work yet, but the new arrangement would probably continue to impact all the airlines serving heathrow through the second week in september. so i would just say we're very disappointed in the circumstances. we have high load factors this summer. again, we're told by the airport at the very last minute that they can't handle the passengers and that we need to reduce the capacity.
and just final point, fortunately, we don't see these same kinds of caps on the horizon in the united states, but we do expect to face similar issues and challenges that additional international locations through the summer.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
and helane, i'll just close with this. look, we're going to put these measures in place, work with the airport authorities. at the end of the day, we've got to match capacity to the resources that are available, and we're going to push hard to make sure that all of the airports that we work with get the resources they need to serve our operations at the size that it should be. so thanks for the question.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much. have a great day.
operator
thank you. one moment for our next question. our next question coming from the line of jamie baker with j.p. morgan.
your line is open.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. good morning. i guess, since helane brought up london, i flew back on american yesterday, nothing but positive things to say. i'll take that up with scott offline.
first question for vasu. so last quarter, you brought up a phenomenon of corporate travelers combining business with pleasure, extending trips, bringing the spouse, that sort of thing. with another 90 days of corporate recovery under your belt now, i mean, is the trend any different? and to the extent that this is sustainable, is there a way to actually monetize it? or is it just sort of gravy, if it happens, great; if not, no biggie?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
hey, jamie. thanks for the question, and this is a topic which is very frequently on our minds here because, indeed, in the last 90 days and be the nine months or 12 months before that, the trends have not abated. in fact, they've grown even stronger. i mentioned in our last call when you asked the question that it used to be as much as 70%, 75% of our revenues could be both identified and would self-classify itself very binary as traveling only for business or only for leisure, and now that's only 50%.
and that other 50% that's there indeed is still there. it tends to be higher yielding. it comes to us directly through our dot-com and mobile. and it's looking for -- and it does that largely because it's looking for travel experiences and journeys and things like that, which the industries haven't been able to make available through the very antiquated technologies and things like that, that we've been prone to using.
so yes, this really has opened our eyes to creating a lot of value for these kinds of customers, who are a growing number. like all of our advantage enrollments are coming out of that population, they're disproportionately concentrated in places where american has just a lot of natural strength. think of the sunbelt, the midwest, the southeast. so we're really encouraged by what we see.
and indeed, it's proven through the pandemic to be a very durable source of demand that's both high yielding and wants a lot more in the airline product than just a single transaction. so it is very much on our minds, and it's probably going to shape a lot of view in the months and quarters ahead.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. great. thanks for that. and then second question, probably for derek or robert.
but the demand data is obviously super encouraging. you're smaller than you were pre-covid, but you're generating more revenue. i mean that's a great strategy for many businesses, i suppose, but your margins aren't recovered, and you weren't satisfied with your pre-covid margins to begin with. so simple question, what are the drivers of higher margins from here?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
well, jamie, let me start with just from the top, and then derek can go into more detail. look, there's more margin growth at american. we've resourced this airline to fly a larger airline, just plain and simple. we've built in a lot of redundancies.
and even in june, those redundancies weren't enough. but over time, we know that we can utilize our assets a lot harder than we have been able to, to this point. and as you take a look going forward in terms of margins, i know that the third quarter, look, we've pulled out some additional flying, and that's fine that we would rather do. you know that we have regional aircraft that aren't in the air.
and while we may not have the pilots, we have the other resources to actually fly those aircraft. so the key to us is ultimately to be able to use our assets at a higher rate. but derek, go ahead.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
no. i was going to say the exact same things. and jamie, as we look at the second quarter, we talked about 100 regional aircraft being out on the ground, and we had probably about 40 mainline aircraft -- equivalent aircraft on the ground. so you're talking about 150 -- 140, 150 aircraft that aren't being utilized.
so two things have to happen is the resources come, and we put those aircraft back up in the air. we've got to get out of those aircraft. so we really want to fly all those. we want to get back to the utilization that we were at, and that is where the margin comes because, as robert said, we are built from a cost perspective to fly those aircraft.
and today, we're not. so that's where it's at, and that's where we believe as we get ourselves back up to asm levels in the 2019, it comes at a much cheaper cost because the assets are here.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
and jamie, just to add one other point, just from even a second quarter perspective. the month of june was really hard on the airline. 27 out of 30 days, we had severe weather that resulted in ramp closures, ground staff, ground delay programs, aerospace flow programs. and in some, we flew at least a percentage point or more less than we would have otherwise.
june and the second quarter would have been better had we seen a more normal type close to the quarter. so that gives me optimism that there's not only utilization that we can work our way out of, but also more normal operating conditions are going to benefit us as we go forward as well.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thank you. thank you, gentlemen.
take care.
operator
one moment for our next question. our next question coming from the line savi syth with raymond james. your line is open.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning. if i might on -- just a kind of a follow-up to jamie's question there. so if you look at versus 2019, just how much has kind of inflation been built in? i know you have kind of this regional pilot pay that's kind of built in there.
so how much of these kind of increases are structural versus what could we -- like if i take your either 3q or your kind of full year unit cost, like how much is structural versus how much could we see kind of go away as you get back to kind of 2019 level capacity?
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
well, i would say as we look at the cost structure, the cost tradings we talked about is built to fly another 150 aircraft. so we did add cost in. so if you take the third quarter over the second quarter, the increase is really driven by three things, which is mainline salaries due to putting in some of the pilot contract issues. the maintenance is up year over year just because of engine overhauls and things that we're seeing throughout the summer and then the regional pilot pay that's put into place.
so the regional pile-up is put into place to get more aircraft up in the air, so that -- hopefully, that is there. it's there to stay. the higher cost to fly regional and the new contract that we put in place regionally is there. that hopefully drives more aircraft back up in the air.
we'll see where that goes. if it doesn't, then that cost doesn't come. so i think those things are built in. they're going to be there as we move forward.
so it's important for us to get the utilization back up and get the aircraft in the air.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
that makes sense. and if i can ask just a follow-up on that regional pilot pay. the pay was surprising, and i understand that at least part of it is a bonus that supposedly kind of rolls off in 2024. but given how kind of much the gap versus mainline pay has been narrowed or, in some cases, even higher than mainline pay, just -- is that sustainable from an economic standpoint for those markets because you're flying them with small aircraft, fuel is a bigger impact on those smaller markets? is that sustainable long term? or is it the right move right now because -- maybe because capacity is out of those markets and fares are high or you just need to get this capacity back up? i was just kind of curious as the kind of thinking behind that big of a pay increase.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
savi, let me start and then i know some others might want to jump in. the answer to that is yes. look, the regional network to american airlines is incredibly important. and whether it's 50 or 65 or 76-seat aircraft, being able to serve those markets in a way that connects to our hubs and then unleashes the breadth of the rest of our network, that's a really compelling offering that achieves higher yields.
and so even though pilot expense for those regional aircraft will be going up, we're confident that the yields that will be introduced will take that into account. but one thing i want to make clear, though, is as we take a look at regional pilot pay, but it costs quite a bit of money to become a pilot. and the expectations for a pilot coming out and saying taking that first job, right, they have changed over time. so as we look forward, i do think that as an industry, pilot wages are going to increase.
and that's something that the industry as a whole is going to have to digest. and ultimately, that will show up through our cost structure and be a factor in terms of how we try to monetize our product.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes. this is vasu. i'll just add that to what robert said in this, but for our airline in particular, so much of how we create value and drive margins is by creating as many unique o&ds as we can. and you've seen it through many quarters now where we've flown more capacity in the industry that can produce higher, but there are good nominal prasm, at least as good, if not better than what our network competitors are, certainly in domestic and short haul.
and a major part of that is the regional jet. in this last quarter, we flew 20% -- we had 20% more o&ds than what our next largest network competitor did. and in those markets, we are seeing yields that are 25% greater than what happened to the rest of the system. indeed, that's what's really driving the yield growth that's there.
many of those markets are where we see the high-value blended demand that jamie asked about earlier. so indeed, not only is it something sustainable. it's something which is a unique feature of what we do and always will be.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
appreciate that. thank you.
operator
thank you. one moment for our next question. and our next question coming from the line of duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi. your line is open.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey. thanks. good morning. maybe we'll start where savi just left off.
so i guess, anybody could do what you're doing on the pay side, so it's hard to see how that's a unique benefit. so historically, on the regional side, that pay arbitrage was one of the reasons that profitability worked. so why is -- why are pay increases like this the right answer from a profitability perspective? i understand why they might be the right answer from a small market, market share perspective. but why is that a better answer than your peers from a margin perspective?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
duane, let me start. first off, again, the days of being able to go out and attract a pilot for wages that are $40,000 a year, ok, are gone. i don't think that we're going to return to an environment where that is the type of compensation that regional pilots make. it's a different world.
and for pilots coming in, we're still not talking about exorbitant salaries. and i think that, that is something that, no matter the carrier, they're going to face the issues of having to pay higher rates for pilots. that said, there is a uniqueness about american airlines network that allows us to use on our regional network and our regional pilots in a fashion that produces outsized yield. that's what will differentiate us.
it's not that, hey, we're going to go out and be able to have a slight difference in terms of pilot wages, and that's going to make the difference in terms of the margin we make as a company. vasu, do you want to add something?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes. i'll just add to it very simply, duane, in an industry that has struggled for a long time to be able to pass its cost into revenue, at least for us, what we've seen time and time again with the regionals is anytime there has been a cost increase, that is the one part of the business where we can most consistently pass it through to revenues. and we do it because of what it does. it creates a unique product for customers that increasingly nobody else but american airlines can go and do.
and when you look through our system, right, there's many of those markets that you simply couldn't upgauge. and even if you did upgauge it, flying to large cities, birmingham, alabama, wilmington, north carolina, once a day of a 737 doesn't really create a lot of utility for some of those really big metro areas in the u.s. so for us, this is actually a place where by doing it, and frankly, by doing it through our wholly owned regional jets, which themselves are very massive airlines, it creates a lot of unique value for our customers, which turns into revenue for us.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
appreciate that perspective. and then just one thing that's a little confusing to me. can you clear up the difference in characterization on corporate? a couple of your peers call it sort of 80% recovered. perhaps, you carried kind of less of that premium traffic going in.
maybe differences in hub geography explains it. but why do you see it as sort of fully recovered versus the 80%? and if much more of it is coming through your own distribution, how do you know it's corporate?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes. thanks, duane, and i think this is an important clarification because i think that, maybe throughout the industry, people use a lot of different words or the same words to mean different things. let me be really specific about what we do. when we talk about business, we talk about a trip type that is business.
and this is jamie's question. we're able to go and calibrate it on -- we ask customers, did you actually buy for business, and we can actually go and look at it. was it a single person in the itinerary? they didn't check a bag. they did a day trip, likely business, right? and so business revenue is that.
and for us, historically, that business revenue has been 40% to 45%. of that, a component of it, historically, there is a 60-40 split between what we consider unmanaged or small businesses and really managed businesses. these are large corporations that contract travel globally typically, right? they use large travel agencies to help them manage the program. and so for us, what we see is that business revenue is indeed 40% to 45% recovered.
the nature of it has changed materially, though, where that unmanaged business is 125% to 130% recovered. and that managed or contracted corporate business is indeed about 75% to 80% recovered, maybe consistent with other things that you've heard. that, of course -- and that's the thing that we've been seeing for some time. this seems to be a relatively durable trend and one that will continue, which is that there's going to be more and more unmanaged businesses out there.
and indeed, we see even with those accounts that are contracted corporate accounts, as we emerge from the pandemic, fewer and fewer of them are enforcing travel policies, are doing a lot of the things that they contracted to begin with anyway. so that's a trend, which we anticipate will continue. and hopefully, that clarifies the point, too.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
it does. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question coming from the line of david vernon with bernstein. your line is open.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. so, robert and derek, i want to talk a little bit about the rate of recovery in sort of either pre-tax or operating margins. you were down on pre-tax sort of 390 bps closer to '19 in the second quarter.
it looks the same on a september level. and i'm just trying to get a sense for when we should start to expect to see those pre-tax margins kind of recover. and is that all 100% driven by volume recovery? or is there something to do on the revenue side or the cost side to kind of accelerate the rate of change in the profit margin?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
well, i'll just start, david. look, this gets back to the question that's asked earlier. we have a lot of redundancy built into the business. utilization isn't where we need it.
i think that as we take a look to the future, we're depending on a couple of things. one is, fortunately, we're in a really strong revenue environment. and as we're looking to the third quarter, anticipating [audio gap] a good revenue environment. and as we're looking to the third quarter, anticipating 20% to 24% increases in trasm versus 2019.
from a cost perspective, that's where we would like to see unit cost come in lower. and the big driver to that is making sure that we fly a more fulsome schedule and take out the redundancy that we have built in. and it gets back again to how quickly we can get these jets back up, from a regional perspective, get the 787s back in. and my view is that that's the name of the game for us as we go forward.
and as we take a look into the rest of 2022 and 2023, our goal is to make sure that we're utilizing our assets as hard and fast as we can.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
and if i'm going to play devil's advocate and say this isn't necessarily the case that we're thinking about, but in a world where we don't get that capacity recovery, the conversation within the company or the board around maybe restructuring that asset level, that resource level to some new level of lower. not saying that's the base case, but i'm just wondering, as you guys think about managing the organization through the next couple of years here, if we end up in a world where that next 10% of asm, the demand just isn't there. what are the levers that you could pull to maybe get the resource level down?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
hey, david. i mean, you've nailed it. we will size the airline for the demand that's out there. so right now, there's more demand than we'd like to be servicing.
we have the capacity to be able to do it. but as time goes forward, if that demand doesn't materialize, what we will do is we will size the airline appropriately. we have flexibility within our fleet to be able to take out, i believe, everything that we would need to in terms of matching demand going forward. and on top of that, then we would size the resources around it, including all of the people resources.
now on that front, we have great flexibility because we're hiring so many folks just to make sure that we can run the airline as we need to. so whether it's a people perspective, whether it's a fleet perspective, we have the ability to size the airline for the demand that's out there.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yes. and i'll add some numbers there, david. in 2023, we've got 95 lease renewals; 2024, 72 lease renewals. we have unencumbered aircraft of over 200 aircraft.
we have deliveries coming in, in 2023. we have 31. in 2024, 47. so that is exactly right.
what you said is what we would do. we're not there yet because we believe that the demand is there to get more of these aircraft up. but if we see that, then that is what we would do is not renew leases, push deliveries like we have in the past. you saw us last quarter push out some deliveries on the 789s and make sure that we rightsize those.
and then we would take some of the unencumbered assets, and we would move those and sell those and not put them back up in the air. so that's where we would go. you're exactly right.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
all right. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. and our next question coming from the line of daniel mckenzie with seaport co. your line is open.
daniel mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks, guys. going back to the commentary of more margin growth over time, setting aside market expectations for a recession and just putting a finer point on a prior commentary, all else equal, based on what you see today, are the initiatives in place to offset the structurally higher costs in this next cycle? so just putting a finer point on getting back to margins in the last cycle or actually exceeding those because, in the past, the commentary seemed pretty bullish for doing a little bit better than what you've done on your historical margins.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
daniel, thanks for the question, and others might chime in here, too. i'll bring us back a little bit because i think the -- what we're focusing on right now is getting back to sustained profitability. so we've reported within guide this quarter, despite really challenging operating conditions, we're expecting profitability as we go into the third quarter. and our intent is to stay in the black, ok? that's job no.
1. as we go out, it's still a murky environment out there, right? we're recovering from the pandemic, and we're doing so well. we know that demand now is back and back strong. there are so many constraints out there in terms of aircraft deliveries, in terms of just people and pilots that, look, we think that we're going to be in a position where we have the ability to improve revenue performance and get higher utilization out in the assets that we have.
that bodes well for the future, but i'm reluctant to look too far out into 2023, and say that there are certain margins that we will or will not hit. and i'll leave it at that, unless anybody else wants to chime in.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
no. but i would say, yes, that is our goal and that we know where we were in 2019. we know what those pre-tax ebitda margins are. getting the asset utilization back up where the demand environment is would get us back to those levels.
so it is all about moving forward, getting the asset utilization where it needs to be, get the aircraft back up in the air, and we can reach those levels for sure.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
and dan, let me pick up where derek left off, too. in this way, if you think about american airlines prior to the pandemic, we flew more capacity than many of our competitors, but we've produced certainly lower nominal prasm than what many of our -- certainly, what the industry leader at the time was. and through the pandemic, we've done a lot. in fact, this is robert's commentary really.
we didn't just simplify the fleet. we also concentrated the network where 70% to 75% of it is flying in places where we can create really outsized consumer value, sunbelt, nc, l.a., heathrow. and we've really leaned hard into partnerships to create value where we couldn't organically. and now we're in a place where, really for a couple of quarters, we can fly 5% to 15% more capacity than the 2019 prasm leader, but produced prasms that are pretty comparable to that.
so that's when we say getting asset utilization up and running, it's a meaningful thing, but the thing not to be lost is that doesn't mean we're putting back 2019. like there's not a world where we're going to go back into flying money and losing flights for strategic purposes or things like that. there's not a world where we go and complicate it. but there is one where we've really realized the more unique o&ds we create, the more that turns into real revenue production for the airline.
and that's the basis to go build off of and, from that, a lot more as possible and will be.
daniel mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yes. understood. thanks for that. a question on the regional operation.
what does it look like one to three years from now, same size, smaller? and as you look at the percent of the regional network that's competing against mainline aircraft, where is that today? and is -- where would you like to see it? and is that an opportunity for helping to drive margin expansion?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
daniel, it's absolutely been an opportunity to drive margin expansion. first goal is to just get all the aircraft that we have back up and flying. and so our fleet is -- our regional aircraft is roughly 600 aircraft. love to get those backup.
and over time, there will be changes in terms of mix to that fleet, but it will be based on how effective it supports our hubs and the rest of the mainline operation, too. so first goal and one that i think will take the next couple of years for sure is to get to all 600 back up and flying.
daniel mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
thanks for the time, guys.
operator
one moment for our next question. our next question coming from the line of sheila kahyaoglu with jefferies. your line is open.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys, and thank you for the time. i echo jamie's comments. i don't know if you guys were screening for airline analysts going into heathrow, but my experience of american was pretty good.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
all right. that's what i'd like to hear.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
maybe just talking to your other large hubs. if you could talk about unit revenue in jfk and lax, you mentioned in your prepared remarks it's outperforming the total system. can you maybe provide some color on that? is that relative to 2019 or on an absolute unit revenue basis across the system?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
thanks for the question. this is vasu, and the answer is both. to robert's specific point, that is compared to our system in absolute, but let me provide a little bit of context behind the point. for us, historically, in new york, especially new york kennedy, and l.a., american airlines typically produce unit revenues that were, let's call it, 90% of what the industry produce to its domestic system.
and now those are starting to get -- both in new york kennedy and in los angeles, we're starting to produce unit revenues that are much more in line with the domestic system. this is material for us because our largest hubs where our capacity concentration is still great are able to produce unit revenues at a real advantage to what our competitors are able to do. so we were able to go and serve these markets with higher unit revenues as it bleeds through. it's something that we tend to look at really, really closely.
but what we're really most encouraged about in new york and l.a. is this isn't just a function of going in there and cutting a bunch of flights or growing rasm. we've improved the consumer proposition that's there. in new york, certainly, we -- between american airlines and jetblue, our northeast alliance has put back more capacity sooner than anybody else.
we've launched new routes. we've taken the american airlines metal in the market like doha and india that two or three years ago would have been relatively unthinkable, and our consumers are responding. we're seeing originating market share, both in that partnership and also our west coast partnership with alaska. and that's coming directly away from our large network competitors.
so we're encouraged by the whole thing. and really, the context for it is this consumer proposition is starting to bleed its way into the unit revenue results, and that's most encouraging of all.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then maybe just following up on the regional questions. is there any way to think about the current impact of subdued regional operations on the mainline operation and the traffic you're missing out on?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
i'm sorry. could you repeat the question, sheila? we missed a part of it.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
sorry. can you -- just talking about the regional operations, is there any way to quantify how much you're missing out on traffic because of subdued regional operations?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
because of subdued regional operations, got it. it's really difficult to do, and we've actually taken a couple of cuts at it because the reality is that this is such a sort of unprecedented time of the industry where there are so many constraints on the infrastructure, so many issues with aircraft deliveries, resources, things like that, that it's hard to really isolate what affected it . in fact, when we look at it, what we find is through the pandemic, we've been able to sustain a lot more of the connectivity of our system through the regional jets. and those places where we've sustained the connectivity are really what's driving our yield growth.
and it's bringing in new customers that are not in necessarily large coastal metro areas. so it's hard to kind of isolate it just because there are so many variables at play, but from robert and derek's commentary, the regional jet, especially the wholly owned regional jet, is really key to helping our mainline fleet grow and recover its utilization.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. thank you so much.
operator
one moment for our next question. and our next question coming from the line of andrew didora with bank of america. your line is open.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. vasu, just a question on your 3q revenue guide. when i look at other airlines, i think you guys are now the one that's not pointing to a sequential acceleration in total revenue growth 2q to 3q.
why do you think that is? and are you just trying to be a little bit more conservative given what's going on out there in the macro environment right now?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
well, let me start by saying we're actually really encouraged by demand. i mean, the demand for our products has been high in like a historical way. that continues. and indeed, the way demand is coming back is both really encouraging and somewhat different than what was there before from my earlier commentary.
but really, when you see when you go from 2q to 3q it is, first of all, just a change in capacity production. we're taking a more conservative view of just how we size the airlines and the resources we have, per robert's comments, and that impacts a lot of it. and then beyond that, really, there's a wide range that we have in unit revenue production because we're really encouraged by the trends that we see. but if we've learned anything over the last couple of quarters, things could go change a lot.
but right now, our optimism -- we see nothing really materially that would dilute our optimism in any way.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. understood. and then i've just been thinking, given the operational challenges across the entire industry, do you think that all -- that's going to influence the way maybe corporate's willingness to travel come the fall? have you or robert have had any conversations with kind of your big managed corporate clients that have maybe expressed concerns over this operational reliability? just curious your thoughts on that. thanks.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
look, i'll start and then others can pick up, too. part of it -- and this kind of goes to some of my earlier commentary. one of the things that we're seeing is that like large corporate -- large contracted corporations are starting to just use different tools than what they had before. prior to the pandemic, if corporations wanted to go and manage travel behavior, they could create more elaborate travel policies and hire a range of consultants and other firms to help manage that.
but now through the pandemic, video conferencing has become normalized. there's a lot more flexibility in the workplace and things like that. and so what we see actually is, in a lot of cases, corporations, though they may be -- they may not be enforcing travel policies as much as there was before, there is a lot more latitude. and so we'll see customers who will often just fly out of their travel policy, will pay more for a service that might have been there before, but they might be traveling less if they're worried about, for example, issues at london heathrow.
so at large, we're really encouraged by what we see. but the way corporations are probably going to go and manage as a practical matter, it's probably going to be very different than what was there. and we see that in the data, right? there's fewer people who are very unconforming to a travel policy. it's hard to see how that changes.
but that's not necessarily a bad thing because we continue to see demand come in, and we're encouraged about where it may go, even if it goes to -- if it comes back differently.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
and andrew, i'll just add one other point, and it's just this. look, travel is coming back in record numbers, which is fantastic. and we have set really, really high standards for ourselves in terms of operational reliability. we, look, start out every day doing everything we can to get every single passenger, every flight to where it used to go on time.
but if you take a look at really what's going on in the second quarter, ok, we're not that far in terms of overall operating performance from where we have been historically. as a matter of fact, in the second quarter, american did better than it did in 2019. and if you take a look back at prior quarters of history, we're not that far off from other points as well. the fact of the matter is, is that, look, we have operating conditions that we have to be sensitive, too.
i can't nor can anyone else do anything about 27 out of 30 days of really severe weather in a number of our hubs that just ultimately result in flight canceling and that rolling from day to day. and when we talk about weather, please understand this. it's not weather, it's safety, ok? when there are air traffic control programs, when there's weather, when there's -- we're doing -- we're taking access to make sure that we ensure the safety of our folks, of not just our customers, but also the people on the ground. when ramps close, it's due to widening strikes.
and so those kind of things are things that we're always going to take into account. and you know what? there will be seasonal variability to what we do. everybody is working very hard. i know that our government partners are working very hard.
the airlines are working very hard, and i know that the rest of the world will get to where the united states is, which, in the scheme of things, united states is doing very well compared to the rest of the world.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
very clear. thank you very much.
operator
and our next question coming from the line of stephen trent from citi. your line is open.
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
good morning, everybody, and thanks very much for taking my question. i just wanted to go back to something you mentioned earlier about investments that you've been making that have affected your near-term cost. i think people are pretty aware that you guys are making a big effort on the pilot side, and that makes sense. but could you elaborate maybe outside of crew whether you're making digital-type investments or other processes that can improve your throughput? thank you.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
yes. let me ask maya leibman, our chief information officer, to step in here.
maya leibman -- executive vice president, chief information officer
we're super excited about a lot of the digital enhancements that we've been making. i'll separate them, as robert said, into our main goals of operational reliability and profitability. on the reliability side, we've done so much to really shore up how we're responding in irregular operation to bring our crews back together. we've also really enhanced some focus on how we do gating at some of our larger airports, like dallas and charlotte.
and when we get better at that, what happens is we reduce the taxi times. so we save fuel. we dedicate more time to the turn, and we better utilize our assets. we've also done some interesting work in creating algorithms that help us, especially in markets like charlotte, where we get these pop-up thunderstorms, where we can actually slow down the operation a little bit rather than use sort of a blunt force instrument, like canceling an entire bank.
so while flights may get a little bit delayed, at least they arrive as opposed to what we were doing previously. on the profitability side, we've done so much in terms of putting new products in the market like the ability to upsell to a higher cabin, which gives us -- we'd have more flexibility in how we price that product and the channels that can be purchased in. we've done a lot of improvements in overbooking technology. in a world where there's no change fee, there's a lot more volatility when it comes to cancels, closing cancels, and no-shows, and we have to have a better overbooking strategy for that.
you've heard vasu mention how important our partnerships are and how we rely on them for revenue generation, where we need to create a much more seamless experience for our customers when they're traveling on us and for example, jetblue or alaska. and finally, you also heard vasu talk about the loyalty program and how we have used it to really grow. our co-brand spend, our enrollments are up, and engagement with the program is really up. so those are just a few of the things that we're doing.
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
i'll bet. that's very helpful. and let me leave it there and then thanks very much.
operator
thank you. and i will now turn the call back over to mr. isom for any closing remarks.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
well, i'll just -- i'll close with -- pardon me. we're going to go to media next. ok. great.
media next. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] one moment for our next question. first question coming from alison sider. your line is open.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
hi. thanks so much. just curious if you could share anything if you're seeing any delay or disruptions that are tied to not having enough spare parts or engines, if there's any kind of supply chain types of issues you're seeing there.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
thanks, ali. i'll have our chief operating officer, david seymour, take that one.
david seymour -- senior vice president, chief operating officer
yes. ali, appreciate the question there. yes, that's something throughout the pandemic that we've been monitoring very closely working with our large oem partners throughout to stay ahead of that. and so we've been doing a lot to provide forward look at what our requirements are.
so while we know the supply chain systems are tight, we've taken a lot of steps throughout the pandemic to stay ahead of that. and so right now, we're not experiencing those. but again, we know that they're not far away, and we're going to continue to monitor the coast.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
yeah. and ali, i'll just say the biggest supply chain issue has been the aircraft manufacturers themselves. we haven't had the kind of delivery certainty that we'd like. so we know that our friends at boeing and airbus are working hard to get that back on track.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
and then i guess, just on hiring, do you still have a lot of hiring left to do? or has it shifted more toward just training and getting everyone up to speed and sort of up to the level of experience?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
so, ali, i'll start on this. look, at american airlines, i know we have 12,000 more team members in position, but that resulted -- is a result of 20,000 team members that we've had to bring on board and get up to speed. we're behind 2,200 pilots, both this year and next year. we've done a great job, i think, in just about every other rank within our team to get the right people on board.
so from an american airlines perspective, we're doing a good job. of course, we'd like for the regionals to have more supply of new pilots, but we're working hard on that. over the long run, though, coming to american airlines is -- it's not only a great career, great competition, great benefits. the time to get here is now because if you ever want to get in and build seniority or take on a new role and lead, it's a good time to come to america.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
thanks.
operator
thank you. one moment for our next question. our next question coming from the line of mary schlangenstein with bloomberg. your line is open.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
hey. thank you. derek, i wanted to see if you could clarify one thing. you said you have 140 to 150 planes on the ground, but you referred to mainline equivalent aircraft.
so can you be a little more specific? you've got 100 regional jets. and then what makes up the rest of that number?
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yes. the mainline equivalent, our mainline aircraft, but what we've done is, instead of pulling aircraft out of the schedule, we lowered the utilization on those aircraft. so if you normally fly 10 hours a day, we now fly 9 hours a day. and if you take that hour across the entire fleet, it's equivalent to about 44, 45 aircraft.
so we haven't really pulled anything out of the schedule. we've floated. now as we look forward, i think the right answer is we pulled down capacity in the third and fourth quarter, is to probably take some of those aircraft out and utilize them for spares and for maintenance lines and utilize them to make the reliability better in the airline. so i think as we go forward, we'll do it a little bit differently than we have and not -- and we'll raise the utilization on the rest of the fleet, but take some aircraft out to provide relief for david and his operating team to have more aircraft for maintenance and more aircraft for spares.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
ok. great. and how long do you expect that conditions in the industry are going to require american to limit its capacity?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
well, look, mary, if i knew the answer to that one, we're getting really good in position. but look, i think it's dependent on the supply chains, aircraft manufacturers, and, ultimately, pilot supply to get all back in sync. we're doing our part. and as we've talked, we look at, from a mainline perspective, kind of getting everything back fully utilized over the course of this next year or so.
and then from a regional perspective, it's just going to take a little bit longer than that, maybe two or three years, to kind of get the supply chain for pilots back to where we need it to be. so that's the way i look at it. overall, i am confident that everybody is getting back to work, and the variability will hopefully be reduced. and the kind of operating performance will improve from where it was even pre-pandemic.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
right. and when you refer to supply chains, are you actually talking about physical, like assets, like supplies that ali asked about? or are you talking more and predominantly about pilots alone?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
so well, pilots are one piece. but what i'm speaking of is, mary, there's not a day that goes by where we don't have issues with provisioning our aircraft with pillows, blankets, plastic cups, food. at various times, we have issues with fueling. it's just -- the concessionaires at the airport.
it's just a myriad of things that have to -- that all have to come together to put an aircraft in the air. and yes, the supply chain for aircraft parts is one thing that we monitor closely. but it's all these other things that we really are dependent on so many other parts of the system. and then, again, i mentioned our government partners, it's our airport partners, and it's so many others.
we -- aviation touches just a broad swath of the economy. and we need it all to get back to working really well.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
ok. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. one moment for our next question. and our next question coming from the line of kyle arnold with dallas morning news. your line is open.
kyle arnold -- aviation writer
hey. thanks so much. you mentioned the capacity trim in the third and the fourth quarter. considering that july is almost over and the summer travel season, you have about a month left in it, where are you looking at making those costs? are they going to be coming after the peak summer demand is over? and what kind of demand, i guess, are you seeing for the fall? and does that play into these capacity-cut decisions?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes. kyle, thanks. this is vasu. so first, a number of the cuts that we talked about have already been loaded into our published schedules that are there.
and then as we go into fall, effectively, we're going to take capacity in places where it can create the most operational benefit, which means, one, it can go and turn into the best quality -- the best level of reliability for our customers and also where we can reaccommodate people the best. so we've minimized any passenger disruption. and then as we go forward into later september, october and deeper into the winter, we have time yet to go and figure out how that goes. there's still a number of things that we're looking at before we make that determination.
next question.
operator
our next question is coming from the line of holden wilen with dallas business journal. your line is open.
holden wilen -- transportation writer
hi. thanks for taking my question this morning. i just wanted to, i guess, get your thoughts on elasticity and if you have any concerns about that going forward. we're seeing fares continue to go up.
do you have any concerns about as shares go up, what effect that might have on elasticity going forward?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
hey. thanks for the question. this is vasu. and no, we don't spend a lot of time worrying about it just for one simple reason that what we try to do is create the most value for our customers.
and when they like it, they pay us for it. and so a lot of what you see out there is so much demand that's surging back into travel. as people went through the pandemic, the -- you see in tons of data that consumers create experiences, and there's no experience like the experience of travel. and it's bringing a lot of people back.
and a lot of people are coming back and doing things for very different reasons than before. and so that's what's really driving things as much as anything. and concepts such as the elasticity of our demand, while it's probably intellectually satisfying to talk about it, the reality of it is that consumers really like what they're getting, being able to go and travel the world again, and they're taking advantage of it. and that's turning into relatively higher fares.
holden wilen -- transportation writer
thanks. and then just a second -- my other question. you talked earlier about the issues at heathrow. just curious about maybe if you could talk about where you're sort of at overall from a recovery standpoint within international travel.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. i can pick that up, too. so look, this -- the second quarter was very robust. even though we didn't have all of our -- the wide-bodies that we had planned to take, nonetheless, those that we had performed extremely well.
we have -- there's a lot of pent-up demand for people going internationally, wherever that might be, transpacific, transatlantic, and long-haul south america. and we anticipate that that will continue through the year. now in the summer, the international testing requirement was dropped. and while we saw some benefit of that, it was dropped pretty deep into the booking curve.
we anticipate there will be -- that they'll have a much more significant impact on travel demand as we go into the fall. and already, we're seeing indications of it. and last but not least, short-haul international, mexico, central america, the caribbean, has been and remains extremely strong for american airlines, and we anticipate that will be the case going forward.
holden wilen -- transportation writer
thank you very much.
operator
one moment for our next question. our next question coming from the line of lori aratani with washington post. your line is open.
lori aratani -- air travel reporter
hi. thank you for taking the time. i wondered if you could go over the hiring numbers again, how many folks you've brought on, how close that gets you to where you want to be. and as a question on that, how much of the staffing issues are hiring versus training?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
thanks for that question. look, our staffing issues are really making sure that we can cover the variability that's in the operations today. we have more people per flight hour per flight than we have ever had in our company's history on duty. what we're dealing with right now is just a lot of variability in the operating environment.
to get to the point where we are now, we've added 12,000 positions, gone out, and hired 20,000 people to actually fill those and cover for other attrition. the only shortfall that we have right now is really among our regional pilots. of course, we're going to do things to make sure that we run the airline as reliably as possible and also take into account more extreme variability in operating conditions. we're doing that by pulling the schedule down a little bit as we go into the third quarter.
but we hope that all the work that we've done puts us in a position where we can restore service, get back up to speed as quickly as possible.
lori aratani -- air travel reporter
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. and that does conclude the media q&a. i will now turn it back to mr. robert isom for closing remarks.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
thank you so much. and i'll just close with this. i am so proud of our team after fighting through this global pandemic for the last two and a half years, battling every step of the way, persevering, caring for customers and each other every single day. we set a couple of goals.
one is to return to profitability and to run the most reliable airline we could. and i am so pleased to report that we have returned to profitability. we intend to stay that way. and i know that our team is intent on making sure that we produce the kind of products that we're all proud of and that our customers want to fly.
so thanks for listening in, and we'll talk to you next quarter.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the american airlines group second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded. [operator instructions] and now i would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, head of investor relations, mr. scott long.
scott long -- head of investor relations
thank you, olivia. good morning, everyone, and welcome to the american airlines group second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. on the call this morning, we have our ceo, robert isom, and our vice chair and cfo and president of american eagle, derek kerr. also on the call for q&a are david seymour, vasu raja, and a number of other senior executives.
robert will start the call this morning with an overview of the second quarter. derek will follow with details on the quarter and our operating plans and outlook going forward. after derek's comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions, followed by questions from the media. [operator instructions] and before we begin today, we must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast of capacity and fleet plans.
these statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release, which was issued this morning, as well as our form 10-q for the quarter ended june 30th, 2022. in addition, we'll be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. a reconciliation of those numbers to the gaap financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found on the investor relations section of our website.
a webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. the information we're giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. with that, i'll turn the call over to our ceo, robert isom. 
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
thanks, scott, and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. i want to start by thanking the american airlines team, which has done an amazing job of running our airline, especially during very challenging operating conditions in the past few months. they managed significant weather, both thunderstorms, and extreme heat in many parts of the country.
customers continue to come back to travel in record numbers, and our team has adapted to one of the busiest summers that we've ever experienced and then done so with grace, professionalism, and a level of commitment to our customers and each other. it is second to none. every single day, i hear from our customers about something incredible that our team has done. we're so proud of their work and grateful for their support.
i also want to thank and acknowledge our key partners in the u.s. government. secretary mayorkas, secretary buttigieg, and their teams at the faa, tsa, cbp as well as the air traffic controllers at natca. they've been right there with us and have worked through these difficult operating conditions.
the extraordinary surge in demand for air travel has significantly impacted them as well, and we appreciate their consistency and professionalism. all of us have to acknowledge that there are challenges in the national airspace, particularly in high-traffic locations like florida and the northeast, but i'm grateful for the sheer commitment that we have in the public and private sectors and management on the front line to facilitate the efficient return of travel. american served 53 million customers in the quarter, and we couldn't have done that without everyone pulling together. as we have shared previously, we have two primary goals this year: running a reliable operation, and returning to profitability, and that's the entirety of our focus.
we've made a lot of progress on running a reliable airline, but we have still some work to do, and i'll touch up on that more in a moment. the big news is this, we're really pleased to report a quarterly profit for the first time since the start of the pandemic, that's two and a half years, that's driven by the strong demand environment and the hard work of our team. we're also pleased to have hit our pre-tax margin guidance, despite a challenging end of the quarter and a significant run-up in oil prices. american reported second quarter gaap net income of $476 million.
excluding net special items, we reported a second quarter net income of $533 million. american produced revenues of $13.4 billion in the second quarter, and that's an increase of 12.2% versus 2019 and a record for any quarter in the company's history. and let me repeat that, that's a record for any quarter in our company's history. these results were achieved while flying 8.5% less capacity than we did in 2019.
importantly, these results are an indication that our actions are producing the expected results. early in the pandemic, we made a conscious decision to simplify our fleet network, focusing our flying where we could create outsized customer value and using partnerships to augment that service. in the second quarter, some 70% of our flying was in american's areas of strength, our sunbelt hubs, mexico, caribbean, latin america, and london. this flying outperformed the industry as we offer customers more options than any other airline.
our domestic partnerships are also producing for our customers and for us. as a matter of fact, our unit revenue performance in jfk and los angeles outperformed the system in the second quarter. customers are flying in different patterns than they have previously, and that's creating opportunities for us. system business revenue is now fully recovered compared to 2019, with revenue from small and medium businesses and customers exhibiting a blended behaviors that were traditionally associated with both business and leisure continuing to outpace the recovery of our managed corporate revenue.
the majority of this revenue growth has come directly through our website, bypassing traditional channels. further, leisure demand surpassed 2019 levels in the second quarter, and customers continue to see us through increasing appetite for travel. enrollments in our loyalty program continue at record levels, and spend on our co-brand cards is growing at a greater rate than ever before. looking forward, we will limit capacity to the resources we have and the operating conditions we face.
we will continue to orient our flying to create value for our customers. and as always, we will remain nimble to ensure that we are best positioned to capitalize on continued demand strength. now turning back to reliability. after running a solid operation in april and may, headlined by a strong memorial day, we had challenges in june.
june was a difficult month for the entire industry from an operational perspective, with extreme weather impacting every major hub and air traffic control challenges in certain parts of the country. at american, we encountered significant weather on 27 of the 30 days in june. that weather resulted in ramp closures, ground stops, ground delay programs, airspace flow programs, which had a ripple effect throughout our operations. despite the challenging operating environment in june, our d0, that's departures on time, made 14 arrivals within 14 minutes.
and completion factor for the full quarter were better than the second quarter of 2019. our team achieved this while flying a second quarter schedule that was more than 25% larger than our closest competitor on a departure basis. american operated more than 0.5 million flights in the quarter. that's an 8% increase over the second quarter of 2021, with a load factor of 87%, which is 10 points higher than the second quarter of 2021.
while june was challenging, we have seen improvements so far in july, including over the busy independence day weekend. american finished the holiday period with a combined d0 a14 in completion factor, all above goal and in line with our pre-pandemic performance, while operating a july 4th holiday schedule that was 30% larger than our competitors as measured by total departures. our operational performance for the full quarter and the results we have delivered in the first few weeks of july give us confidence moving forward, but we still aren't where we need to be. and we have a lot of flying ahead of us still in the summer, so we are investing in our operation to ensure we meet our reliability goals and deliver for our customers.
we've taken proactive steps to build additional buffer into our schedule for the rest of the year. as i said a minute ago, we're sizing the airline for the resources we have available and the operating conditions we face, and we will make other changes as needed. even with these adjustments, american still offers customers the largest network of any u.s. airline with an average of more than 5,400 daily departures.
so i want to close by reiterating that i'm tremendously excited about what lies ahead for american. we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing across the business, and we've built an airline that can be successful in a number of different demand and economic environments. our second quarter results and strong revenue production, despite challenging conditions, demonstrates that our plan to return to profitability and deliver a good operation for our customers is working. we have the strongest assets in the industry, and the work that our team has accomplished to build and deliver the most comprehensive network in the business is paying off.
and with that, i'll turn it over to derek.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
thanks, robert, and good morning, everyone. before i begin, i want to thank the american airlines team for their continued dedication to our customers during this busy summer travel season. this morning, we reported a second quarter gaap net income of $476 million or earnings of $0.68 per diluted share. excluding net special items, we reported a net income of $533 million or earnings of $0.76 per diluted share.
we talk a lot about our goal of returning the airline to profitability, and our second quarter performance is a result of that focus. profitability in the quarter was driven by record revenue performance. as robert noted, our second quarter revenue was $13.4 billion, was 12.2% higher, despite flying 8.5% less capacity than the same period in 2019. leisure demand continued to lead the way, but the acceleration of business and long-haul international demand contributed to the strength we saw in the quarter.
operating earnings improved sequentially through the quarter, in line with the growth in revenue, despite rising fuel costs. we continue to reap the benefit of the past investments in our fleet and are well positioned for the future. in the second quarter, we took delivery of five a321neos and reactivated nine boeing 737-800s from long-term storage. we continue to work closely with boeing and the timing of our delayed 788s, and we expect to begin taking delivery of those aircraft this quarter.
we now expect to receive 9 788s this quarter and four this year and four in the first part of 2023. lastly, based on our latest guidance from airbus, we are now expecting our a321xlrs to be delivered starting in the first quarter of 2024, instead of the third quarter of 2023. this will shift planned aircraft capacity out of 2023 into future years. our 2023 aircraft capex is now expected to be $1.9 billion.
we ended the second quarter with $15.6 billion of total available liquidity. during the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $1.7 billion and free cash flow of more than $800 million. total debt reduction remains a top priority. we remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025.
in the near term, we will continue to keep up -- keep our liquidity at elevated levels, with a plan to step down to $10 billion to $12 billion when we are confident the recovery has fully taken hold. at that time, any excess liquidity will be prioritized to reduce debt. during the quarter, we made $1 billion in scheduled debt and finance lease payments, including paying off the remaining outstanding balance of our $750 million unsecured senior notes that matured in june. to date, we have reduced overall debt levels by $5.2 billion from peak levels in the second quarter of 2021.
this means that after only 12 months, we have completed more than one-third of our $15 billion total debt reduction target. this progress affords us tremendous flexibility as to when and how we bring down the remaining $10 billion in total debt by the end of 2025. as we have said previously, moving forward, we will continue to balance our total liquidity with the expected demand recovery, debt reduction opportunities, and investment in the business. we expect to make $375 million of scheduled debt payments in the third quarter, which includes the scheduled payoff and unencumbering of eight crj-700 aircraft.
as we look to the remainder of the year, we are making targeted investments to ensure operational reliability. with recent schedule adjustments, we now expect full year 2022 capacity to be recovered to 90.5% of 2019 levels. consequently, we now expect our full year casm, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 10% and 12% versus 2019. the increase in unit cost is driven by lower planned capacity and other investments to support the operation, including wage premiums and regional pilot pay.
these unit cost increases represent near-term investments that will drive long-term value. we are confident that unit costs will improve as we increase asset utilization to historical levels. in the third quarter, we expect to be profitable, despite the continuation of elevated fuel prices. pretax margins are expected to be between 2% and 4% for the quarter based on the current demand trends and our latest fuel price forecast.
we currently expect total revenue to be 10% to 12% higher versus the third quarter of 2019 on 8% to 10% lower capacity. on this revenue strength, we expect total revenue per asm to be 20% to 24% higher in the third quarter versus the same period in 2019. we expect our third quarter casm, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 12% and 14% compared to 2019. lower planned capacity and the investment in the reliability of the operation that i mentioned previously are driving unit costs higher for the quarter.
our current forecast for the third quarter assumes fuel between $3.73 and $3.78 per gallon, an increase of more than 80% versus the price of fuel in the third quarter of 2019. in conclusion, demand is strong, and we remain focused on our key objectives of operational reliability and profitability. while we've made investments in our operation that will impact near-term costs, we are confident that we're very well positioned as we move into 2023 because of our network, our fleet, our team and the actions we have taken. with that, we will open up the line for analyst questions.
",2022-Q2,AAL
0.7038,-0.9959,,,":
operator
thank you [operator instructions] and our first question coming from the line of michael linenberg with deutsche bank. your line is open.
michael linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. good morning, everyone. hey. good job this quarter and good outlook.
i guess, derek, first to you on the $5.2 billion debt reduction that you've been able to do thus far, presumably, you're not including any sort of reduction in the pension obligation. and just given the run-up in interest rates and sort of thinking where the discount rate would go, can you just give us a sense of maybe the potential tailwind on that from a deleveraging perspective, sort of where things stand and how you're thinking about that pension obligation? thanks.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yeah. two things. one is that we look at that at the end of the year, so there was some benefit in the pension. the reduction in '21 -- there was a slight reduction in '21 of the pension obligation.
as we look at where we're at now as of june 30th, the actual pension status or funding ratio has gone up to about 81%. the liabilities have dropped over $3.5 billion due to the interest rate change, and it's a higher interest rate, which has more than offset the asset reduction. so it's actually in a much better spot than it was before, not the way we want to get there, without a doubt, but it is in a better spot from a pension liability standpoint. but we have not yet added that in for anything in 2022.
but if we did, it'd be -- right now, it would be about $1 billion lower from a liability perspective, from a debt perspective than it would be before. so we are managing it the way we would any other time, staying very conservative in our pension and watching it. but the interest rate has actually driven the liability much, much lower than what the reduction in the asset class has been.
michael linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then the second question, and this is probably more for vasu. derek, you said that you're going to get 9 787s this quarter, and i know that everybody's been -- that, that has slipped multiple times.
and assuming that it does slip again, when i look in the fourth quarter, it does look like you have the 787 scheduled in -- it's in your timetable. if, for some reason, that were to slip again, like how many points of capacity do those airplanes account for in the back part of the year? thanks.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yeah. well, two things, mike. i corrected that, i think, in my comments, but it is nine for the year. we will have two coming in, i think, in early august.
the first two will come earlier, and we don't have any of them built into the schedule until november time frame. so if those do slip from august a little bit, we have put in almost a two-month pad in those coming in. but we don't think it will impact the fourth quarter a lot. if they slip a lot further, where the impact is going to be into 2023, not a lot into 2022.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
and mike, presuming that all 9 do deliver, call that roughly about deploying of capacity in a month.
michael linenberg -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok. great.
operator
one moment for our next question. our next question coming from the line of helane becker with cowen. your line is open.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks so much, operator. morning. thank you. hi.
so just two questions. the first question, robert, i saw you on cnbc this morning, and you talked about the pilot contract. and i know you guys don't like to talk about it, but you did present your pilots with an offer that would increase pay by 17% by 2025, i think. could you just talk about what happens next and the status of that?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
sure. so helane, thanks for the questions. look, it's really important for us to take care of our pilots. you know that throughout the pandemic, we had put an offer on the table that would have made our pilots the most highly paid pilots in the industry.
we never pulled that back, even throughout the pandemic. but united went out and put out a better offer. and we thought it was really important to get to the table and make sure that our pilots know that we were going to take care of them. so we've done that.
and now we are negotiating very closely and actively, and my hope is that we make progress over the coming weeks and months. now how that bakes into financial forecast, we haven't put anything in yet. we don't know exactly where we'll end up. and then the point i'd just make is that with every contract, not only are there changes to compensation and quality of life, but we think that when we get to a contract, we'll have a contract that is -- that operates very efficiently for the company as well.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. great. that's really helpful. thank you.
and then just a follow-up question on london. i know phil asked you about that, too. and i heard scott say last night that london operations will call him up and tell him a day or two in advance they're canceling flights. i don't think you guys have as many flights to london as they do, but are you seeing the same issues? and is that -- and maybe how does that get fixed? or is it more a british air problem and a partner problem?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
no. let me start with this. first off, we have a really sizable operation in london heathrow with our atlantic joint business partner, ba. we offer the largest schedule into london heathrow, so it's very important to us.
one of the things that we've done is we've been able to isolate american's operations into t3, and so that has allowed us with our team to make sure that we're doing everything possible. now all that said, there's so much that you can do with your own team members. there's infrastructure, like bag systems that you're dependent on heathrow. and then, of course, ba is incredibly dependent on heathrow as well.
to that end, we're working as a group with our oneworld carriers to make sure that we match our capacity to the resources that are there. that will take some time to work our way through. and to that end, maybe i'll have nate gatten, our head of government affairs and corporate real estate add to what's going on and the prognosis for that.
nate gatten -- senior vice president, corporate affairs and chief government affairs officer
yes. thanks, robert. helane, what we worked for the last week on extremely short notice to cancel departing flights as a way to help manage airport crowding. and as robert said, we've found that request to be quite disappointing and frustrating on many levels mostly because of the significant burn that would put on our customers under short notice with few options for rebooking given the -- some of those.
what we did then was work with how to limit the capacity on our departing flights by capping loads on certain flights. we've rebooked passengers over other european points departure, did things like limit nonrev travel, etc. and as robert mentioned, we did that in conjunction with our oneworld and jv partners. it's important to understand that these procedures will be in place until the beginning of next week, at which point a new procedure for limiting passengers at heathrow is going to be instituted this time by the slot coordinators.
and we don't have the full details on how that's going to work yet, but the new arrangement would probably continue to impact all the airlines serving heathrow through the second week in september. so i would just say we're very disappointed in the circumstances. we have high load factors this summer. again, we're told by the airport at the very last minute that they can't handle the passengers and that we need to reduce the capacity.
and just final point, fortunately, we don't see these same kinds of caps on the horizon in the united states, but we do expect to face similar issues and challenges that additional international locations through the summer.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
and helane, i'll just close with this. look, we're going to put these measures in place, work with the airport authorities. at the end of the day, we've got to match capacity to the resources that are available, and we're going to push hard to make sure that all of the airports that we work with get the resources they need to serve our operations at the size that it should be. so thanks for the question.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much. have a great day.
operator
thank you. one moment for our next question. our next question coming from the line of jamie baker with j.p. morgan.
your line is open.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey. good morning. i guess, since helane brought up london, i flew back on american yesterday, nothing but positive things to say. i'll take that up with scott offline.
first question for vasu. so last quarter, you brought up a phenomenon of corporate travelers combining business with pleasure, extending trips, bringing the spouse, that sort of thing. with another 90 days of corporate recovery under your belt now, i mean, is the trend any different? and to the extent that this is sustainable, is there a way to actually monetize it? or is it just sort of gravy, if it happens, great; if not, no biggie?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
hey, jamie. thanks for the question, and this is a topic which is very frequently on our minds here because, indeed, in the last 90 days and be the nine months or 12 months before that, the trends have not abated. in fact, they've grown even stronger. i mentioned in our last call when you asked the question that it used to be as much as 70%, 75% of our revenues could be both identified and would self-classify itself very binary as traveling only for business or only for leisure, and now that's only 50%.
and that other 50% that's there indeed is still there. it tends to be higher yielding. it comes to us directly through our dot-com and mobile. and it's looking for -- and it does that largely because it's looking for travel experiences and journeys and things like that, which the industries haven't been able to make available through the very antiquated technologies and things like that, that we've been prone to using.
so yes, this really has opened our eyes to creating a lot of value for these kinds of customers, who are a growing number. like all of our advantage enrollments are coming out of that population, they're disproportionately concentrated in places where american has just a lot of natural strength. think of the sunbelt, the midwest, the southeast. so we're really encouraged by what we see.
and indeed, it's proven through the pandemic to be a very durable source of demand that's both high yielding and wants a lot more in the airline product than just a single transaction. so it is very much on our minds, and it's probably going to shape a lot of view in the months and quarters ahead.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. great. thanks for that. and then second question, probably for derek or robert.
but the demand data is obviously super encouraging. you're smaller than you were pre-covid, but you're generating more revenue. i mean that's a great strategy for many businesses, i suppose, but your margins aren't recovered, and you weren't satisfied with your pre-covid margins to begin with. so simple question, what are the drivers of higher margins from here?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
well, jamie, let me start with just from the top, and then derek can go into more detail. look, there's more margin growth at american. we've resourced this airline to fly a larger airline, just plain and simple. we've built in a lot of redundancies.
and even in june, those redundancies weren't enough. but over time, we know that we can utilize our assets a lot harder than we have been able to, to this point. and as you take a look going forward in terms of margins, i know that the third quarter, look, we've pulled out some additional flying, and that's fine that we would rather do. you know that we have regional aircraft that aren't in the air.
and while we may not have the pilots, we have the other resources to actually fly those aircraft. so the key to us is ultimately to be able to use our assets at a higher rate. but derek, go ahead.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
no. i was going to say the exact same things. and jamie, as we look at the second quarter, we talked about 100 regional aircraft being out on the ground, and we had probably about 40 mainline aircraft -- equivalent aircraft on the ground. so you're talking about 150 -- 140, 150 aircraft that aren't being utilized.
so two things have to happen is the resources come, and we put those aircraft back up in the air. we've got to get out of those aircraft. so we really want to fly all those. we want to get back to the utilization that we were at, and that is where the margin comes because, as robert said, we are built from a cost perspective to fly those aircraft.
and today, we're not. so that's where it's at, and that's where we believe as we get ourselves back up to asm levels in the 2019, it comes at a much cheaper cost because the assets are here.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
and jamie, just to add one other point, just from even a second quarter perspective. the month of june was really hard on the airline. 27 out of 30 days, we had severe weather that resulted in ramp closures, ground staff, ground delay programs, aerospace flow programs. and in some, we flew at least a percentage point or more less than we would have otherwise.
june and the second quarter would have been better had we seen a more normal type close to the quarter. so that gives me optimism that there's not only utilization that we can work our way out of, but also more normal operating conditions are going to benefit us as we go forward as well.
jamie baker -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. very helpful. thank you. thank you, gentlemen.
take care.

one moment for our next question. our next question coming from the line savi syth with raymond james. your line is open.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
hey. good morning. if i might on -- just a kind of a follow-up to jamie's question there. so if you look at versus 2019, just how much has kind of inflation been built in? i know you have kind of this regional pilot pay that's kind of built in there.
so how much of these kind of increases are structural versus what could we -- like if i take your either 3q or your kind of full year unit cost, like how much is structural versus how much could we see kind of go away as you get back to kind of 2019 level capacity?
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
well, i would say as we look at the cost structure, the cost tradings we talked about is built to fly another 150 aircraft. so we did add cost in. so if you take the third quarter over the second quarter, the increase is really driven by three things, which is mainline salaries due to putting in some of the pilot contract issues. the maintenance is up year over year just because of engine overhauls and things that we're seeing throughout the summer and then the regional pilot pay that's put into place.
so the regional pile-up is put into place to get more aircraft up in the air, so that -- hopefully, that is there. it's there to stay. the higher cost to fly regional and the new contract that we put in place regionally is there. that hopefully drives more aircraft back up in the air.
we'll see where that goes. if it doesn't, then that cost doesn't come. so i think those things are built in. they're going to be there as we move forward.
so it's important for us to get the utilization back up and get the aircraft in the air.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
that makes sense. and if i can ask just a follow-up on that regional pilot pay. the pay was surprising, and i understand that at least part of it is a bonus that supposedly kind of rolls off in 2024. but given how kind of much the gap versus mainline pay has been narrowed or, in some cases, even higher than mainline pay, just -- is that sustainable from an economic standpoint for those markets because you're flying them with small aircraft, fuel is a bigger impact on those smaller markets? is that sustainable long term? or is it the right move right now because -- maybe because capacity is out of those markets and fares are high or you just need to get this capacity back up? i was just kind of curious as the kind of thinking behind that big of a pay increase.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
savi, let me start and then i know some others might want to jump in. the answer to that is yes. look, the regional network to american airlines is incredibly important. and whether it's 50 or 65 or 76-seat aircraft, being able to serve those markets in a way that connects to our hubs and then unleashes the breadth of the rest of our network, that's a really compelling offering that achieves higher yields.
and so even though pilot expense for those regional aircraft will be going up, we're confident that the yields that will be introduced will take that into account. but one thing i want to make clear, though, is as we take a look at regional pilot pay, but it costs quite a bit of money to become a pilot. and the expectations for a pilot coming out and saying taking that first job, right, they have changed over time. so as we look forward, i do think that as an industry, pilot wages are going to increase.
and that's something that the industry as a whole is going to have to digest. and ultimately, that will show up through our cost structure and be a factor in terms of how we try to monetize our product.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes. this is vasu. i'll just add that to what robert said in this, but for our airline in particular, so much of how we create value and drive margins is by creating as many unique o&ds as we can. and you've seen it through many quarters now where we've flown more capacity in the industry that can produce higher, but there are good nominal prasm, at least as good, if not better than what our network competitors are, certainly in domestic and short haul.
and a major part of that is the regional jet. in this last quarter, we flew 20% -- we had 20% more o&ds than what our next largest network competitor did. and in those markets, we are seeing yields that are 25% greater than what happened to the rest of the system. indeed, that's what's really driving the yield growth that's there.
many of those markets are where we see the high-value blended demand that jamie asked about earlier. so indeed, not only is it something sustainable. it's something which is a unique feature of what we do and always will be.
savi syth -- raymond james -- analyst
appreciate that. thank you.
operator
thank you. one moment for our next question. and our next question coming from the line of duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi. your line is open.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey. thanks. good morning. maybe we'll start where savi just left off.
so i guess, anybody could do what you're doing on the pay side, so it's hard to see how that's a unique benefit. so historically, on the regional side, that pay arbitrage was one of the reasons that profitability worked. so why is -- why are pay increases like this the right answer from a profitability perspective? i understand why they might be the right answer from a small market, market share perspective. but why is that a better answer than your peers from a margin perspective?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
duane, let me start. first off, again, the days of being able to go out and attract a pilot for wages that are $40,000 a year, ok, are gone. i don't think that we're going to return to an environment where that is the type of compensation that regional pilots make. it's a different world.
and for pilots coming in, we're still not talking about exorbitant salaries. and i think that, that is something that, no matter the carrier, they're going to face the issues of having to pay higher rates for pilots. that said, there is a uniqueness about american airlines network that allows us to use on our regional network and our regional pilots in a fashion that produces outsized yield. that's what will differentiate us.
it's not that, hey, we're going to go out and be able to have a slight difference in terms of pilot wages, and that's going to make the difference in terms of the margin we make as a company. vasu, do you want to add something?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes. i'll just add to it very simply, duane, in an industry that has struggled for a long time to be able to pass its cost into revenue, at least for us, what we've seen time and time again with the regionals is anytime there has been a cost increase, that is the one part of the business where we can most consistently pass it through to revenues. and we do it because of what it does. it creates a unique product for customers that increasingly nobody else but american airlines can go and do.
and when you look through our system, right, there's many of those markets that you simply couldn't upgauge. and even if you did upgauge it, flying to large cities, birmingham, alabama, wilmington, north carolina, once a day of a 737 doesn't really create a lot of utility for some of those really big metro areas in the u.s. so for us, this is actually a place where by doing it, and frankly, by doing it through our wholly owned regional jets, which themselves are very massive airlines, it creates a lot of unique value for our customers, which turns into revenue for us.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
appreciate that perspective. and then just one thing that's a little confusing to me. can you clear up the difference in characterization on corporate? a couple of your peers call it sort of 80% recovered. perhaps, you carried kind of less of that premium traffic going in.
maybe differences in hub geography explains it. but why do you see it as sort of fully recovered versus the 80%? and if much more of it is coming through your own distribution, how do you know it's corporate?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes. thanks, duane, and i think this is an important clarification because i think that, maybe throughout the industry, people use a lot of different words or the same words to mean different things. let me be really specific about what we do. when we talk about business, we talk about a trip type that is business.
and this is jamie's question. we're able to go and calibrate it on -- we ask customers, did you actually buy for business, and we can actually go and look at it. was it a single person in the itinerary? they didn't check a bag. they did a day trip, likely business, right? and so business revenue is that.
and for us, historically, that business revenue has been 40% to 45%. of that, a component of it, historically, there is a 60-40 split between what we consider unmanaged or small businesses and really managed businesses. these are large corporations that contract travel globally typically, right? they use large travel agencies to help them manage the program. and so for us, what we see is that business revenue is indeed 40% to 45% recovered.
the nature of it has changed materially, though, where that unmanaged business is 125% to 130% recovered. and that managed or contracted corporate business is indeed about 75% to 80% recovered, maybe consistent with other things that you've heard. that, of course -- and that's the thing that we've been seeing for some time. this seems to be a relatively durable trend and one that will continue, which is that there's going to be more and more unmanaged businesses out there.
and indeed, we see even with those accounts that are contracted corporate accounts, as we emerge from the pandemic, fewer and fewer of them are enforcing travel policies, are doing a lot of the things that they contracted to begin with anyway. so that's a trend, which we anticipate will continue. and hopefully, that clarifies the point, too.
duane pfennigwerth -- evercore isi -- analyst
it does. thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question coming from the line of david vernon with bernstein. your line is open.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. so, robert and derek, i want to talk a little bit about the rate of recovery in sort of either pre-tax or operating margins. you were down on pre-tax sort of 390 bps closer to '19 in the second quarter.
it looks the same on a september level. and i'm just trying to get a sense for when we should start to expect to see those pre-tax margins kind of recover. and is that all 100% driven by volume recovery? or is there something to do on the revenue side or the cost side to kind of accelerate the rate of change in the profit margin?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
well, i'll just start, david. look, this gets back to the question that's asked earlier. we have a lot of redundancy built into the business. utilization isn't where we need it.
i think that as we take a look to the future, we're depending on a couple of things. one is, fortunately, we're in a really strong revenue environment. and as we're looking to the third quarter, anticipating [audio gap] a good revenue environment. and as we're looking to the third quarter, anticipating 20% to 24% increases in trasm versus 2019.
from a cost perspective, that's where we would like to see unit cost come in lower. and the big driver to that is making sure that we fly a more fulsome schedule and take out the redundancy that we have built in. and it gets back again to how quickly we can get these jets back up, from a regional perspective, get the 787s back in. and my view is that that's the name of the game for us as we go forward.
and as we take a look into the rest of 2022 and 2023, our goal is to make sure that we're utilizing our assets as hard and fast as we can.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
and if i'm going to play devil's advocate and say this isn't necessarily the case that we're thinking about, but in a world where we don't get that capacity recovery, the conversation within the company or the board around maybe restructuring that asset level, that resource level to some new level of lower. not saying that's the base case, but i'm just wondering, as you guys think about managing the organization through the next couple of years here, if we end up in a world where that next 10% of asm, the demand just isn't there. what are the levers that you could pull to maybe get the resource level down?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
hey, david. i mean, you've nailed it. we will size the airline for the demand that's out there. so right now, there's more demand than we'd like to be servicing.
we have the capacity to be able to do it. but as time goes forward, if that demand doesn't materialize, what we will do is we will size the airline appropriately. we have flexibility within our fleet to be able to take out, i believe, everything that we would need to in terms of matching demand going forward. and on top of that, then we would size the resources around it, including all of the people resources.
now on that front, we have great flexibility because we're hiring so many folks just to make sure that we can run the airline as we need to. so whether it's a people perspective, whether it's a fleet perspective, we have the ability to size the airline for the demand that's out there.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yes. and i'll add some numbers there, david. in 2023, we've got 95 lease renewals; 2024, 72 lease renewals. we have unencumbered aircraft of over 200 aircraft.
we have deliveries coming in, in 2023. we have 31. in 2024, 47. so that is exactly right.
what you said is what we would do. we're not there yet because we believe that the demand is there to get more of these aircraft up. but if we see that, then that is what we would do is not renew leases, push deliveries like we have in the past. you saw us last quarter push out some deliveries on the 789s and make sure that we rightsize those.
and then we would take some of the unencumbered assets, and we would move those and sell those and not put them back up in the air. so that's where we would go. you're exactly right.
david vernon -- alliancebernstein -- analyst
all right. thank you, guys.
operator
thank you. and our next question coming from the line of daniel mckenzie with seaport co. your line is open.
daniel mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
hey. good morning. thanks, guys. going back to the commentary of more margin growth over time, setting aside market expectations for a recession and just putting a finer point on a prior commentary, all else equal, based on what you see today, are the initiatives in place to offset the structurally higher costs in this next cycle? so just putting a finer point on getting back to margins in the last cycle or actually exceeding those because, in the past, the commentary seemed pretty bullish for doing a little bit better than what you've done on your historical margins.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
daniel, thanks for the question, and others might chime in here, too. i'll bring us back a little bit because i think the -- what we're focusing on right now is getting back to sustained profitability. so we've reported within guide this quarter, despite really challenging operating conditions, we're expecting profitability as we go into the third quarter. and our intent is to stay in the black, ok? that's job no.
1. as we go out, it's still a murky environment out there, right? we're recovering from the pandemic, and we're doing so well. we know that demand now is back and back strong. there are so many constraints out there in terms of aircraft deliveries, in terms of just people and pilots that, look, we think that we're going to be in a position where we have the ability to improve revenue performance and get higher utilization out in the assets that we have.
that bodes well for the future, but i'm reluctant to look too far out into 2023, and say that there are certain margins that we will or will not hit. and i'll leave it at that, unless anybody else wants to chime in.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
no. but i would say, yes, that is our goal and that we know where we were in 2019. we know what those pre-tax ebitda margins are. getting the asset utilization back up where the demand environment is would get us back to those levels.
so it is all about moving forward, getting the asset utilization where it needs to be, get the aircraft back up in the air, and we can reach those levels for sure.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
and dan, let me pick up where derek left off, too. in this way, if you think about american airlines prior to the pandemic, we flew more capacity than many of our competitors, but we've produced certainly lower nominal prasm than what many of our -- certainly, what the industry leader at the time was. and through the pandemic, we've done a lot. in fact, this is robert's commentary really.
we didn't just simplify the fleet. we also concentrated the network where 70% to 75% of it is flying in places where we can create really outsized consumer value, sunbelt, nc, l.a., heathrow. and we've really leaned hard into partnerships to create value where we couldn't organically. and now we're in a place where, really for a couple of quarters, we can fly 5% to 15% more capacity than the 2019 prasm leader, but produced prasms that are pretty comparable to that.
so that's when we say getting asset utilization up and running, it's a meaningful thing, but the thing not to be lost is that doesn't mean we're putting back 2019. like there's not a world where we're going to go back into flying money and losing flights for strategic purposes or things like that. there's not a world where we go and complicate it. but there is one where we've really realized the more unique o&ds we create, the more that turns into real revenue production for the airline.
and that's the basis to go build off of and, from that, a lot more as possible and will be.
daniel mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
yes. understood. thanks for that. a question on the regional operation.
what does it look like one to three years from now, same size, smaller? and as you look at the percent of the regional network that's competing against mainline aircraft, where is that today? and is -- where would you like to see it? and is that an opportunity for helping to drive margin expansion?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
daniel, it's absolutely been an opportunity to drive margin expansion. first goal is to just get all the aircraft that we have back up and flying. and so our fleet is -- our regional aircraft is roughly 600 aircraft. love to get those backup.
and over time, there will be changes in terms of mix to that fleet, but it will be based on how effective it supports our hubs and the rest of the mainline operation, too. so first goal and one that i think will take the next couple of years for sure is to get to all 600 back up and flying.
daniel mckenzie -- seaport global securities -- analyst
thanks for the time, guys.
operator
one moment for our next question. our next question coming from the line of sheila kahyaoglu with jefferies. your line is open.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys, and thank you for the time. i echo jamie's comments. i don't know if you guys were screening for airline analysts going into heathrow, but my experience of american was pretty good.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
all right. that's what i'd like to hear.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
maybe just talking to your other large hubs. if you could talk about unit revenue in jfk and lax, you mentioned in your prepared remarks it's outperforming the total system. can you maybe provide some color on that? is that relative to 2019 or on an absolute unit revenue basis across the system?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
thanks for the question. this is vasu, and the answer is both. to robert's specific point, that is compared to our system in absolute, but let me provide a little bit of context behind the point. for us, historically, in new york, especially new york kennedy, and l.a., american airlines typically produce unit revenues that were, let's call it, 90% of what the industry produce to its domestic system.
and now those are starting to get -- both in new york kennedy and in los angeles, we're starting to produce unit revenues that are much more in line with the domestic system. this is material for us because our largest hubs where our capacity concentration is still great are able to produce unit revenues at a real advantage to what our competitors are able to do. so we were able to go and serve these markets with higher unit revenues as it bleeds through. it's something that we tend to look at really, really closely.
but what we're really most encouraged about in new york and l.a. is this isn't just a function of going in there and cutting a bunch of flights or growing rasm. we've improved the consumer proposition that's there. in new york, certainly, we -- between american airlines and jetblue, our northeast alliance has put back more capacity sooner than anybody else.
we've launched new routes. we've taken the american airlines metal in the market like doha and india that two or three years ago would have been relatively unthinkable, and our consumers are responding. we're seeing originating market share, both in that partnership and also our west coast partnership with alaska. and that's coming directly away from our large network competitors.
so we're encouraged by the whole thing. and really, the context for it is this consumer proposition is starting to bleed its way into the unit revenue results, and that's most encouraging of all.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then maybe just following up on the regional questions. is there any way to think about the current impact of subdued regional operations on the mainline operation and the traffic you're missing out on?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
i'm sorry. could you repeat the question, sheila? we missed a part of it.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
sorry. can you -- just talking about the regional operations, is there any way to quantify how much you're missing out on traffic because of subdued regional operations?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
because of subdued regional operations, got it. it's really difficult to do, and we've actually taken a couple of cuts at it because the reality is that this is such a sort of unprecedented time of the industry where there are so many constraints on the infrastructure, so many issues with aircraft deliveries, resources, things like that, that it's hard to really isolate what affected it . in fact, when we look at it, what we find is through the pandemic, we've been able to sustain a lot more of the connectivity of our system through the regional jets. and those places where we've sustained the connectivity are really what's driving our yield growth.
and it's bringing in new customers that are not in necessarily large coastal metro areas. so it's hard to kind of isolate it just because there are so many variables at play, but from robert and derek's commentary, the regional jet, especially the wholly owned regional jet, is really key to helping our mainline fleet grow and recover its utilization.
sheila kahyaoglu -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. thank you so much.
operator
one moment for our next question. and our next question coming from the line of andrew didora with bank of america. your line is open.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. vasu, just a question on your 3q revenue guide. when i look at other airlines, i think you guys are now the one that's not pointing to a sequential acceleration in total revenue growth 2q to 3q.
why do you think that is? and are you just trying to be a little bit more conservative given what's going on out there in the macro environment right now?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
well, let me start by saying we're actually really encouraged by demand. i mean, the demand for our products has been high in like a historical way. that continues. and indeed, the way demand is coming back is both really encouraging and somewhat different than what was there before from my earlier commentary.
but really, when you see when you go from 2q to 3q it is, first of all, just a change in capacity production. we're taking a more conservative view of just how we size the airlines and the resources we have, per robert's comments, and that impacts a lot of it. and then beyond that, really, there's a wide range that we have in unit revenue production because we're really encouraged by the trends that we see. but if we've learned anything over the last couple of quarters, things could go change a lot.
but right now, our optimism -- we see nothing really materially that would dilute our optimism in any way.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. understood. and then i've just been thinking, given the operational challenges across the entire industry, do you think that all -- that's going to influence the way maybe corporate's willingness to travel come the fall? have you or robert have had any conversations with kind of your big managed corporate clients that have maybe expressed concerns over this operational reliability? just curious your thoughts on that. thanks.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
look, i'll start and then others can pick up, too. part of it -- and this kind of goes to some of my earlier commentary. one of the things that we're seeing is that like large corporate -- large contracted corporations are starting to just use different tools than what they had before. prior to the pandemic, if corporations wanted to go and manage travel behavior, they could create more elaborate travel policies and hire a range of consultants and other firms to help manage that.
but now through the pandemic, video conferencing has become normalized. there's a lot more flexibility in the workplace and things like that. and so what we see actually is, in a lot of cases, corporations, though they may be -- they may not be enforcing travel policies as much as there was before, there is a lot more latitude. and so we'll see customers who will often just fly out of their travel policy, will pay more for a service that might have been there before, but they might be traveling less if they're worried about, for example, issues at london heathrow.
so at large, we're really encouraged by what we see. but the way corporations are probably going to go and manage as a practical matter, it's probably going to be very different than what was there. and we see that in the data, right? there's fewer people who are very unconforming to a travel policy. it's hard to see how that changes.
but that's not necessarily a bad thing because we continue to see demand come in, and we're encouraged about where it may go, even if it goes to -- if it comes back differently.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
and andrew, i'll just add one other point, and it's just this. look, travel is coming back in record numbers, which is fantastic. and we have set really, really high standards for ourselves in terms of operational reliability. we, look, start out every day doing everything we can to get every single passenger, every flight to where it used to go on time.
but if you take a look at really what's going on in the second quarter, ok, we're not that far in terms of overall operating performance from where we have been historically. as a matter of fact, in the second quarter, american did better than it did in 2019. and if you take a look back at prior quarters of history, we're not that far off from other points as well. the fact of the matter is, is that, look, we have operating conditions that we have to be sensitive, too.
i can't nor can anyone else do anything about 27 out of 30 days of really severe weather in a number of our hubs that just ultimately result in flight canceling and that rolling from day to day. and when we talk about weather, please understand this. it's not weather, it's safety, ok? when there are air traffic control programs, when there's weather, when there's -- we're doing -- we're taking access to make sure that we ensure the safety of our folks, of not just our customers, but also the people on the ground. when ramps close, it's due to widening strikes.
and so those kind of things are things that we're always going to take into account. and you know what? there will be seasonal variability to what we do. everybody is working very hard. i know that our government partners are working very hard.
the airlines are working very hard, and i know that the rest of the world will get to where the united states is, which, in the scheme of things, united states is doing very well compared to the rest of the world.
andrew didora -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
very clear. thank you very much.
operator
and our next question coming from the line of stephen trent from citi. your line is open.
stephen trent -- citi -- analyst
good morning, everybody, and thanks very much for taking my question. i just wanted to go back to something you mentioned earlier about investments that you've been making that have affected your near-term cost. i think people are pretty aware that you guys are making a big effort on the pilot side, and that makes sense. but could you elaborate maybe outside of crew whether you're making digital-type investments or other processes that can improve your throughput? thank you.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
yes. let me ask maya leibman, our chief information officer, to step in here.
maya leibman -- executive vice president, chief information officer
we're super excited about a lot of the digital enhancements that we've been making. i'll separate them, as robert said, into our main goals of operational reliability and profitability. on the reliability side, we've done so much to really shore up how we're responding in irregular operation to bring our crews back together. we've also really enhanced some focus on how we do gating at some of our larger airports, like dallas and charlotte.
and when we get better at that, what happens is we reduce the taxi times. so we save fuel. we dedicate more time to the turn, and we better utilize our assets. we've also done some interesting work in creating algorithms that help us, especially in markets like charlotte, where we get these pop-up thunderstorms, where we can actually slow down the operation a little bit rather than use sort of a blunt force instrument, like canceling an entire bank.
so while flights may get a little bit delayed, at least they arrive as opposed to what we were doing previously. on the profitability side, we've done so much in terms of putting new products in the market like the ability to upsell to a higher cabin, which gives us -- we'd have more flexibility in how we price that product and the channels that can be purchased in. we've done a lot of improvements in overbooking technology. in a world where there's no change fee, there's a lot more volatility when it comes to cancels, closing cancels, and no-shows, and we have to have a better overbooking strategy for that.
you've heard vasu mention how important our partnerships are and how we rely on them for revenue generation, where we need to create a much more seamless experience for our customers when they're traveling on us and for example, jetblue or alaska. and finally, you also heard vasu talk about the loyalty program and how we have used it to really grow. our co-brand spend, our enrollments are up, and engagement with the program is really up. so those are just a few of the things that we're doing.

i'll bet. that's very helpful. and let me leave it there and then thanks very much.
operator
thank you. and i will now turn the call back over to mr. isom for any closing remarks.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
well, i'll just -- i'll close with -- pardon me. we're going to go to media next. ok. great.
media next. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] one moment for our next question. first question coming from alison sider. your line is open.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
hi. thanks so much. just curious if you could share anything if you're seeing any delay or disruptions that are tied to not having enough spare parts or engines, if there's any kind of supply chain types of issues you're seeing there.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
thanks, ali. i'll have our chief operating officer, david seymour, take that one.
david seymour -- senior vice president, chief operating officer
yes. ali, appreciate the question there. yes, that's something throughout the pandemic that we've been monitoring very closely working with our large oem partners throughout to stay ahead of that. and so we've been doing a lot to provide forward look at what our requirements are.
so while we know the supply chain systems are tight, we've taken a lot of steps throughout the pandemic to stay ahead of that. and so right now, we're not experiencing those. but again, we know that they're not far away, and we're going to continue to monitor the coast.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
yeah. and ali, i'll just say the biggest supply chain issue has been the aircraft manufacturers themselves. we haven't had the kind of delivery certainty that we'd like. so we know that our friends at boeing and airbus are working hard to get that back on track.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
and then i guess, just on hiring, do you still have a lot of hiring left to do? or has it shifted more toward just training and getting everyone up to speed and sort of up to the level of experience?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
so, ali, i'll start on this. look, at american airlines, i know we have 12,000 more team members in position, but that resulted -- is a result of 20,000 team members that we've had to bring on board and get up to speed. we're behind 2,200 pilots, both this year and next year. we've done a great job, i think, in just about every other rank within our team to get the right people on board.
so from an american airlines perspective, we're doing a good job. of course, we'd like for the regionals to have more supply of new pilots, but we're working hard on that. over the long run, though, coming to american airlines is -- it's not only a great career, great competition, great benefits. the time to get here is now because if you ever want to get in and build seniority or take on a new role and lead, it's a good time to come to america.
alison sider -- air travel reporter
thanks.
operator
thank you. one moment for our next question. our next question coming from the line of mary schlangenstein with bloomberg. your line is open.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
hey. thank you. derek, i wanted to see if you could clarify one thing. you said you have 140 to 150 planes on the ground, but you referred to mainline equivalent aircraft.
so can you be a little more specific? you've got 100 regional jets. and then what makes up the rest of that number?
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
yes. the mainline equivalent, our mainline aircraft, but what we've done is, instead of pulling aircraft out of the schedule, we lowered the utilization on those aircraft. so if you normally fly 10 hours a day, we now fly 9 hours a day. and if you take that hour across the entire fleet, it's equivalent to about 44, 45 aircraft.
so we haven't really pulled anything out of the schedule. we've floated. now as we look forward, i think the right answer is we pulled down capacity in the third and fourth quarter, is to probably take some of those aircraft out and utilize them for spares and for maintenance lines and utilize them to make the reliability better in the airline. so i think as we go forward, we'll do it a little bit differently than we have and not -- and we'll raise the utilization on the rest of the fleet, but take some aircraft out to provide relief for david and his operating team to have more aircraft for maintenance and more aircraft for spares.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
ok. great. and how long do you expect that conditions in the industry are going to require american to limit its capacity?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
well, look, mary, if i knew the answer to that one, we're getting really good in position. but look, i think it's dependent on the supply chains, aircraft manufacturers, and, ultimately, pilot supply to get all back in sync. we're doing our part. and as we've talked, we look at, from a mainline perspective, kind of getting everything back fully utilized over the course of this next year or so.
and then from a regional perspective, it's just going to take a little bit longer than that, maybe two or three years, to kind of get the supply chain for pilots back to where we need it to be. so that's the way i look at it. overall, i am confident that everybody is getting back to work, and the variability will hopefully be reduced. and the kind of operating performance will improve from where it was even pre-pandemic.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
right. and when you refer to supply chains, are you actually talking about physical, like assets, like supplies that ali asked about? or are you talking more and predominantly about pilots alone?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
so well, pilots are one piece. but what i'm speaking of is, mary, there's not a day that goes by where we don't have issues with provisioning our aircraft with pillows, blankets, plastic cups, food. at various times, we have issues with fueling. it's just -- the concessionaires at the airport.
it's just a myriad of things that have to -- that all have to come together to put an aircraft in the air. and yes, the supply chain for aircraft parts is one thing that we monitor closely. but it's all these other things that we really are dependent on so many other parts of the system. and then, again, i mentioned our government partners, it's our airport partners, and it's so many others.
we -- aviation touches just a broad swath of the economy. and we need it all to get back to working really well.
mary schlangenstein -- airline reporter
ok. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. one moment for our next question. and our next question coming from the line of kyle arnold with dallas morning news. your line is open.
kyle arnold -- aviation writer
hey. thanks so much. you mentioned the capacity trim in the third and the fourth quarter. considering that july is almost over and the summer travel season, you have about a month left in it, where are you looking at making those costs? are they going to be coming after the peak summer demand is over? and what kind of demand, i guess, are you seeing for the fall? and does that play into these capacity-cut decisions?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yes. kyle, thanks. this is vasu. so first, a number of the cuts that we talked about have already been loaded into our published schedules that are there.
and then as we go into fall, effectively, we're going to take capacity in places where it can create the most operational benefit, which means, one, it can go and turn into the best quality -- the best level of reliability for our customers and also where we can reaccommodate people the best. so we've minimized any passenger disruption. and then as we go forward into later september, october and deeper into the winter, we have time yet to go and figure out how that goes. there's still a number of things that we're looking at before we make that determination.
next question.
operator
our next question is coming from the line of holden wilen with dallas business journal. your line is open.
holden wilen -- transportation writer
hi. thanks for taking my question this morning. i just wanted to, i guess, get your thoughts on elasticity and if you have any concerns about that going forward. we're seeing fares continue to go up.
do you have any concerns about as shares go up, what effect that might have on elasticity going forward?
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
hey. thanks for the question. this is vasu. and no, we don't spend a lot of time worrying about it just for one simple reason that what we try to do is create the most value for our customers.
and when they like it, they pay us for it. and so a lot of what you see out there is so much demand that's surging back into travel. as people went through the pandemic, the -- you see in tons of data that consumers create experiences, and there's no experience like the experience of travel. and it's bringing a lot of people back.
and a lot of people are coming back and doing things for very different reasons than before. and so that's what's really driving things as much as anything. and concepts such as the elasticity of our demand, while it's probably intellectually satisfying to talk about it, the reality of it is that consumers really like what they're getting, being able to go and travel the world again, and they're taking advantage of it. and that's turning into relatively higher fares.
holden wilen -- transportation writer
thanks. and then just a second -- my other question. you talked earlier about the issues at heathrow. just curious about maybe if you could talk about where you're sort of at overall from a recovery standpoint within international travel.
vasu raja -- senior vice president, chief commercial officer
yeah. i can pick that up, too. so look, this -- the second quarter was very robust. even though we didn't have all of our -- the wide-bodies that we had planned to take, nonetheless, those that we had performed extremely well.
we have -- there's a lot of pent-up demand for people going internationally, wherever that might be, transpacific, transatlantic, and long-haul south america. and we anticipate that that will continue through the year. now in the summer, the international testing requirement was dropped. and while we saw some benefit of that, it was dropped pretty deep into the booking curve.
we anticipate there will be -- that they'll have a much more significant impact on travel demand as we go into the fall. and already, we're seeing indications of it. and last but not least, short-haul international, mexico, central america, the caribbean, has been and remains extremely strong for american airlines, and we anticipate that will be the case going forward.
holden wilen -- transportation writer
thank you very much.
operator
one moment for our next question. our next question coming from the line of lori aratani with washington post. your line is open.
lori aratani -- air travel reporter
hi. thank you for taking the time. i wondered if you could go over the hiring numbers again, how many folks you've brought on, how close that gets you to where you want to be. and as a question on that, how much of the staffing issues are hiring versus training?
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
thanks for that question. look, our staffing issues are really making sure that we can cover the variability that's in the operations today. we have more people per flight hour per flight than we have ever had in our company's history on duty. what we're dealing with right now is just a lot of variability in the operating environment.
to get to the point where we are now, we've added 12,000 positions, gone out, and hired 20,000 people to actually fill those and cover for other attrition. the only shortfall that we have right now is really among our regional pilots. of course, we're going to do things to make sure that we run the airline as reliably as possible and also take into account more extreme variability in operating conditions. we're doing that by pulling the schedule down a little bit as we go into the third quarter.
but we hope that all the work that we've done puts us in a position where we can restore service, get back up to speed as quickly as possible.
lori aratani -- air travel reporter
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. and that does conclude the media q&a. i will now turn it back to mr. robert isom for closing remarks.
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
thank you so much. and i'll just close with this. i am so proud of our team after fighting through this global pandemic for the last two and a half years, battling every step of the way, persevering, caring for customers and each other every single day. we set a couple of goals.
one is to return to profitability and to run the most reliable airline we could. and i am so pleased to report that we have returned to profitability. we intend to stay that way. and i know that our team is intent on making sure that we produce the kind of products that we're all proud of and that our customers want to fly.
so thanks for listening in, and we'll talk to you next quarter.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the american airlines group second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. today's call is being recorded. [operator instructions] and now i would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, head of investor relations, mr. scott long.
scott long -- head of investor relations
thank you, olivia. good morning, everyone, and welcome to the american airlines group second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. on the call this morning, we have our ceo, robert isom, and our vice chair and cfo and president of american eagle, derek kerr. also on the call for q&a are david seymour, vasu raja, and a number of other senior executives.
robert will start the call this morning with an overview of the second quarter. derek will follow with details on the quarter and our operating plans and outlook going forward. after derek's comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions, followed by questions from the media. [operator instructions] and before we begin today, we must state that today's call contains forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues, costs, forecast of capacity and fleet plans.
these statements represent our predictions and expectations of future events, but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release, which was issued this morning, as well as our form 10-q for the quarter ended june 30th, 2022. in addition, we'll be discussing certain non-gaap financial measures this morning, which exclude the impact of unusual items. a reconciliation of those numbers to the gaap financial measures is included in the earnings press release, which can be found on the investor relations section of our website.
a webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. the information we're giving you on the call this morning is as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. thank you for your interest and for joining us this morning. with that, i'll turn the call over to our ceo, robert isom. 
robert isom -- chief executive officer and chief recruitment officer
thanks, scott, and good morning, everyone. thanks for joining us. i want to start by thanking the american airlines team, which has done an amazing job of running our airline, especially during very challenging operating conditions in the past few months. they managed significant weather, both thunderstorms, and extreme heat in many parts of the country.
customers continue to come back to travel in record numbers, and our team has adapted to one of the busiest summers that we've ever experienced and then done so with grace, professionalism, and a level of commitment to our customers and each other. it is second to none. every single day, i hear from our customers about something incredible that our team has done. we're so proud of their work and grateful for their support.
i also want to thank and acknowledge our key partners in the u.s. government. secretary mayorkas, secretary buttigieg, and their teams at the faa, tsa, cbp as well as the air traffic controllers at natca. they've been right there with us and have worked through these difficult operating conditions.
the extraordinary surge in demand for air travel has significantly impacted them as well, and we appreciate their consistency and professionalism. all of us have to acknowledge that there are challenges in the national airspace, particularly in high-traffic locations like florida and the northeast, but i'm grateful for the sheer commitment that we have in the public and private sectors and management on the front line to facilitate the efficient return of travel. american served 53 million customers in the quarter, and we couldn't have done that without everyone pulling together. as we have shared previously, we have two primary goals this year: running a reliable operation, and returning to profitability, and that's the entirety of our focus.
we've made a lot of progress on running a reliable airline, but we have still some work to do, and i'll touch up on that more in a moment. the big news is this, we're really pleased to report a quarterly profit for the first time since the start of the pandemic, that's two and a half years, that's driven by the strong demand environment and the hard work of our team. we're also pleased to have hit our pre-tax margin guidance, despite a challenging end of the quarter and a significant run-up in oil prices. american reported second quarter gaap net income of $476 million.
excluding net special items, we reported a second quarter net income of $533 million. american produced revenues of $13.4 billion in the second quarter, and that's an increase of 12.2% versus 2019 and a record for any quarter in the company's history. and let me repeat that, that's a record for any quarter in our company's history. these results were achieved while flying 8.5% less capacity than we did in 2019.
importantly, these results are an indication that our actions are producing the expected results. early in the pandemic, we made a conscious decision to simplify our fleet network, focusing our flying where we could create outsized customer value and using partnerships to augment that service. in the second quarter, some 70% of our flying was in american's areas of strength, our sunbelt hubs, mexico, caribbean, latin america, and london. this flying outperformed the industry as we offer customers more options than any other airline.
our domestic partnerships are also producing for our customers and for us. as a matter of fact, our unit revenue performance in jfk and los angeles outperformed the system in the second quarter. customers are flying in different patterns than they have previously, and that's creating opportunities for us. system business revenue is now fully recovered compared to 2019, with revenue from small and medium businesses and customers exhibiting a blended behaviors that were traditionally associated with both business and leisure continuing to outpace the recovery of our managed corporate revenue.
the majority of this revenue growth has come directly through our website, bypassing traditional channels. further, leisure demand surpassed 2019 levels in the second quarter, and customers continue to see us through increasing appetite for travel. enrollments in our loyalty program continue at record levels, and spend on our co-brand cards is growing at a greater rate than ever before. looking forward, we will limit capacity to the resources we have and the operating conditions we face.
we will continue to orient our flying to create value for our customers. and as always, we will remain nimble to ensure that we are best positioned to capitalize on continued demand strength. now turning back to reliability. after running a solid operation in april and may, headlined by a strong memorial day, we had challenges in june.
june was a difficult month for the entire industry from an operational perspective, with extreme weather impacting every major hub and air traffic control challenges in certain parts of the country. at american, we encountered significant weather on 27 of the 30 days in june. that weather resulted in ramp closures, ground stops, ground delay programs, airspace flow programs, which had a ripple effect throughout our operations. despite the challenging operating environment in june, our d0, that's departures on time, made 14 arrivals within 14 minutes.
and completion factor for the full quarter were better than the second quarter of 2019. our team achieved this while flying a second quarter schedule that was more than 25% larger than our closest competitor on a departure basis. american operated more than 0.5 million flights in the quarter. that's an 8% increase over the second quarter of 2021, with a load factor of 87%, which is 10 points higher than the second quarter of 2021.
while june was challenging, we have seen improvements so far in july, including over the busy independence day weekend. american finished the holiday period with a combined d0 a14 in completion factor, all above goal and in line with our pre-pandemic performance, while operating a july 4th holiday schedule that was 30% larger than our competitors as measured by total departures. our operational performance for the full quarter and the results we have delivered in the first few weeks of july give us confidence moving forward, but we still aren't where we need to be. and we have a lot of flying ahead of us still in the summer, so we are investing in our operation to ensure we meet our reliability goals and deliver for our customers.
we've taken proactive steps to build additional buffer into our schedule for the rest of the year. as i said a minute ago, we're sizing the airline for the resources we have available and the operating conditions we face, and we will make other changes as needed. even with these adjustments, american still offers customers the largest network of any u.s. airline with an average of more than 5,400 daily departures.
so i want to close by reiterating that i'm tremendously excited about what lies ahead for american. we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing across the business, and we've built an airline that can be successful in a number of different demand and economic environments. our second quarter results and strong revenue production, despite challenging conditions, demonstrates that our plan to return to profitability and deliver a good operation for our customers is working. we have the strongest assets in the industry, and the work that our team has accomplished to build and deliver the most comprehensive network in the business is paying off.
and with that, i'll turn it over to derek.
derek kerr -- vice chairman, chief financial officer
thanks, robert, and good morning, everyone. before i begin, i want to thank the american airlines team for their continued dedication to our customers during this busy summer travel season. this morning, we reported a second quarter gaap net income of $476 million or earnings of $0.68 per diluted share. excluding net special items, we reported a net income of $533 million or earnings of $0.76 per diluted share.
we talk a lot about our goal of returning the airline to profitability, and our second quarter performance is a result of that focus. profitability in the quarter was driven by record revenue performance. as robert noted, our second quarter revenue was $13.4 billion, was 12.2% higher, despite flying 8.5% less capacity than the same period in 2019. leisure demand continued to lead the way, but the acceleration of business and long-haul international demand contributed to the strength we saw in the quarter.
operating earnings improved sequentially through the quarter, in line with the growth in revenue, despite rising fuel costs. we continue to reap the benefit of the past investments in our fleet and are well positioned for the future. in the second quarter, we took delivery of five a321neos and reactivated nine boeing 737-800s from long-term storage. we continue to work closely with boeing and the timing of our delayed 788s, and we expect to begin taking delivery of those aircraft this quarter.
we now expect to receive 9 788s this quarter and four this year and four in the first part of 2023. lastly, based on our latest guidance from airbus, we are now expecting our a321xlrs to be delivered starting in the first quarter of 2024, instead of the third quarter of 2023. this will shift planned aircraft capacity out of 2023 into future years. our 2023 aircraft capex is now expected to be $1.9 billion.
we ended the second quarter with $15.6 billion of total available liquidity. during the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $1.7 billion and free cash flow of more than $800 million. total debt reduction remains a top priority. we remain on track with our target of reducing overall debt levels by $15 billion by the end of 2025.
in the near term, we will continue to keep up -- keep our liquidity at elevated levels, with a plan to step down to $10 billion to $12 billion when we are confident the recovery has fully taken hold. at that time, any excess liquidity will be prioritized to reduce debt. during the quarter, we made $1 billion in scheduled debt and finance lease payments, including paying off the remaining outstanding balance of our $750 million unsecured senior notes that matured in june. to date, we have reduced overall debt levels by $5.2 billion from peak levels in the second quarter of 2021.
this means that after only 12 months, we have completed more than one-third of our $15 billion total debt reduction target. this progress affords us tremendous flexibility as to when and how we bring down the remaining $10 billion in total debt by the end of 2025. as we have said previously, moving forward, we will continue to balance our total liquidity with the expected demand recovery, debt reduction opportunities, and investment in the business. we expect to make $375 million of scheduled debt payments in the third quarter, which includes the scheduled payoff and unencumbering of eight crj-700 aircraft.
as we look to the remainder of the year, we are making targeted investments to ensure operational reliability. with recent schedule adjustments, we now expect full year 2022 capacity to be recovered to 90.5% of 2019 levels. consequently, we now expect our full year casm, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 10% and 12% versus 2019. the increase in unit cost is driven by lower planned capacity and other investments to support the operation, including wage premiums and regional pilot pay.
these unit cost increases represent near-term investments that will drive long-term value. we are confident that unit costs will improve as we increase asset utilization to historical levels. in the third quarter, we expect to be profitable, despite the continuation of elevated fuel prices. pretax margins are expected to be between 2% and 4% for the quarter based on the current demand trends and our latest fuel price forecast.
we currently expect total revenue to be 10% to 12% higher versus the third quarter of 2019 on 8% to 10% lower capacity. on this revenue strength, we expect total revenue per asm to be 20% to 24% higher in the third quarter versus the same period in 2019. we expect our third quarter casm, excluding fuel and net special items, to be up between 12% and 14% compared to 2019. lower planned capacity and the investment in the reliability of the operation that i mentioned previously are driving unit costs higher for the quarter.
our current forecast for the third quarter assumes fuel between $3.73 and $3.78 per gallon, an increase of more than 80% versus the price of fuel in the third quarter of 2019. in conclusion, demand is strong, and we remain focused on our key objectives of operational reliability and profitability. while we've made investments in our operation that will impact near-term costs, we are confident that we're very well positioned as we move into 2023 because of our network, our fleet, our team and the actions we have taken. with that, we will open up the line for analyst questions.
