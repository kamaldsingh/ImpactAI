barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you, marty, and welcome everyone. we are pleased to report a very strong q3, driven by continued rapid acceleration in our cloud business. cloud grew to a record 35% and now represents 50% of our total revenue, which is a major milestone for nice. we also reported 10% sequential growth in the cloud compared to q2 and we already suppressed the more than $800 million cloud revenue run rate that we had expected by the end of the year. this strong cloud performance underscored the solid quarter overall with total revenue increasing 7% to $412 million. operating income was $117 million, which was an increase of 10% compared to q3 2019 and operating margin increased 95 basis points to 28.3% compared to q3 last year. these strong operating results led to an 8% increase in earnings per share to $1.41. additionally, operating cash flow increased 20% to $99 million in q3 compared to the same period last year.
the acceleration in our cloud growth is being driven by several factors, including substantial growth in new customers, rapid adoption by large enterprises, new verticals that are now more than ever embracing remote service and digital transformation that has become front and center for organizations of all sizes. the strong demand for our cloud solutions from new customers can be seen by the large number of new logos we continue to sign each and every quarter. in q3 alone, we saw an increase of over 50% in new logos compared to the same quarter last year. many of these new customers are coming from the continued rapid adoption of our cxone cloud platform. enterprises in all segments of the market around the world recognize cxone as the clear market-leading cloud platform to help them deliver on the cloud and digital transformations. the adoption by new customers is being driven by an acceleration in the market around cloud and digital. it is also being driven by the success we're having with our growing ecosystem of partners that are reselling our cloud solutions as well as further penetration into international markets.
in addition, many new cxone customers were the result of an over 80% conversion rate of cxone at home to a paid subscription. we are the largest ccaas provider in our industry, double the size of our next largest competitor and we are reporting faster growth. much of our performance is the result of our significant competitive advantage in the large enterprise. the large enterprise market, which we define as enterprises with over 750 agents, continues to accelerate and is helping to drive the fast growth of cxone. cxone is the only platform to date that can effectively scale to both the large and mega enterprises. this is because it incorporates the seamless integration of omnichannel routing, workforce optimization and analytics, all on a single platform. furthermore, with over 160 independent software vendors building solutions on our cxone exchange marketplace, we built the largest ecosystem of partners in the industry.
many of our q3 deals for cxone demonstrate our continued ability to capture share in the upper end of the market as we continue to displace the incumbent on-premise providers. we signed a seven-digit acv deal for cxone with one of the largest hospitality operators in the world, replacing the two incumbent on-premise providers. we also signed many expansion deals for cxone as customers continue to come back to add additional seats and solutions. one of those was a very large auto credit company. we signed a seven-digit cloud deal with one of the largest global banks, also an expansion deal with a long-standing customer to add additional seats. we signed a seven-digit expansion deal for analytics with a long-standing financial services customer and two analytics expansion deals with very large existing telco customers. there was also a seven-digit acv cloud deal with a large business process outsourcer, who took on several of our cloud solutions.
our strength in the large enterprise has also received recognition from industry analysts. in fact, we were once again named the leader in the 2020 gartner magic quadrant for contact center as a service report. nice achieved the highest overall position for its ability to execute and has been placed as a leader every year since this magic quadrant's inception. in addition, the recent forrester wave contact center as a service report identified cxone as the leader in the market with cxone receiving the highest possible score in the market presence category and securing top ranking in the current offering and strategy categories.
our leadership in the cloud and the resulting growth is also being driven by new verticals that are embracing remote service. among those verticals, our government and the new breed technology companies, which are growing rapidly and recognizing the increased importance of the need for agility and flexibility in the customer service operations. in the government vertical, we see continued strength in both local and federal augmented by our fedramp authorization for cxone. for example, in q3, we signed a seven-digit acv cxone deal with a very large government health organization. it took only two weeks to sign this deal for thousands of agents as they could not scale with their existing on-premise providers which we replaced. there was also the need for them to turn up quickly and rapidly scale up and down as needed to respond to varying level of demand, which demonstrates the enormous flexibility and agility of the cxone platform.
in technology, we signed a seven-digit cloud deal with a cloud sharing economy provider for portfolio for analytic solutions, including our new enlighten ai platform. enlighten leverages cutting edge ai and machine learning to identify and model many different behavioral patterns to help predict business outcomes. there was also a seven-digit cloud deal with the worldwide streaming music provider. while there is no doubt that we are in the midst of the digital transformation among enterprises of all sizes, we are seeing strong demand for an omni experience in those transformations. in other words, enterprises don't want to make the same mistakes as in the past by stitching together digital solutions that operate in separate silos. it is inefficient, usually unproductive, inflexible and costly; rather they demand a single platform in which all the different digital channels are seamlessly integrated. this is where cxone is clearly differentiated with over 30 seamlessly integrated digital channels. for nice, we are in a prime competitive position to capture the opportunities provided by these changing market dynamics as native digital solutions are in the core of our business.
in fact, just this past quarter, we witnessed a 91% sequential increase in digital volumes for cxone and a 154% increase year-over-year. in q3, 50% of our new cxone deals included digital, including an online consulting service, a commercial water management company and a business process outsourcer. the impact of the digital transformation reaches across all our businesses, including financial crime and compliance and public safety. in financial crime and compliance, the digital capabilities of x-sight and xceed are driving cloud transformations. and in fact, we saw 150% increase in cloud revenue in this segment in q3.
digital banking presents a tremendous growth potential for us as we're starting to see increasing data monetization opportunities. for example, in q3, we landed additional data iq deals as bank feels pressured to materially reduce the time to onboard new customers and therefore need to dramatically improve the processing of data from external sources. moreover, x-sight is becoming an industry hub for banks to advance their digital transformations by leveraging the x-sight marketplace. the x-sight marketplace is the industry's first ecosystem for financial crime and compliance to enable third-party innovations. to-date, we have over 50 marketplace partners. together with these partners, customers can access multiple data sources and applications all in one place.
we're also facilitating cloud and digital transformations in public safety. just recently, we announced the launch of our evidencentral marketplace. it is the first open digital evidence management ecosystem of technology vendors geared toward law enforcement and criminal justice agencies. the marketplace will greatly enhance the value of our evidencentral end-to-end digital transformation platform, which includes the nice investigate and nice inform solutions. through the evidencentral marketplace, law enforcement and criminal justice agencies gain access to a wide variety of best-of-breed technology solutions critical to the investigation process. in all of our markets in which we operate, enterprises and organizations of all sizes are heavily engaged in the cloud and digital transformations. we witnessed this firsthand at our recent user conferences, interactions in september for our customer engagement customers and nice engage in october for financial crime and compliance. both user conferences had record attendance. it was a great opportunity to showcase our market-leading platform that provide extreme agility and flexibility to our customers to help facilitate these transformations.
in closing, as cloud and digital are beginning to become mainstream, we are in a prime competitive position to capture the opportunities ahead. moreover, we are only at the very beginning of this evolution in each of our market segments. the total addressable market for nice is huge and continues to expand. we believe the current market opportunity is about $6.5 billion for nice and we see that expanding -- we see that expanding to over $17 billion over the next five years.
i will now turn the call over to beth.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
thank you, barak, and good day, everyone. i'm pleased to provide the analysis of our financial results and business performance for the third quarter of 2020 as well as our outlook for the full year 2020. total revenue for the third quarter reached $412 million, an increase of 7% from $387 million in the same period of last year. total revenue growth was led once again by a remarkable cloud performance with a record growth of 35%, reaching $204 million and already exceeding the more than $800 million cloud annual revenue run rate that was expected by year-end. the sequential cloud growth between the second and third quarter of 2020 accelerated to 10% compared to 6% last year.
another milestone for nice was cloud revenue reaching 50% of total revenue compared to 39% last year. as a result of the strong cloud growth, recurring revenue continued to increase and accounted for 81% of total revenue compared to 74% last year. product revenues accounted for 9% of total revenue in the third quarter and service revenues accounted for the remaining 41% of total revenue in the third quarter.
moving to our business breakdown, customer engagement revenues for the third quarter were $337 million, a 7% increase over the same quarter in 2019 and represented 82% of our total revenues. financial crime and compliance revenues for the third quarter were $75 million, an increase of 4% and represented 18% of total revenues.
looking at geographies, americas revenues grew 10% to $343 million in the third quarter. revenues in emea were $44 million in the third quarter compared to $47 million last year and apac revenues in the third quarter were $25 million compared to $27 million in the same period last year. we continue to see strong leverage in our operating model as demonstrated by our increased profitability and expanding margins. gross profit in the third quarter reached $293 million compared to $274 million in the third quarter of 2019, and gross margin reached 71% similar to last year. the continued acceleration in our cloud business led to a 370 basis point expansion in the cloud gross margin to 65.6% compared to 61.9% in the same quarter last year.
operating income increased 10% to $117 million and the operating margin grew to 28.3% from 27.3% last year. earnings per share for the third quarter increased 8.5% and reached $1.41 compared to $1.30 in the third quarter of last year. cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $99 million, an increase of 20% compared to $82 million in q3 2019. total cash and investments at the end of the quarter reached $1.543 billion. during the quarter, we issued a zero interest rate convertible note for $460 million. at the end of the quarter, total debt was $891 million net of issuance cost and the equity component associated with our convertible debt.
i will conclude my remarks with guidance. we've experienced strong growth in our cloud business throughout 2020, and as we look on the remainder of this year, we expect the strong cloud growth to continue. and during 2021, we expect to cross another significant milestone in annualized run rate of $1 billion in cloud revenue. we also expect to see the continued trend of cloud representing a greater percentage of the overall mix of our revenue as compared to the prior year. for the full year 2020, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.645 billion to $1.655 billion. we expect the full year 2020 fully diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $5.63 to $5.73.
i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. operator?
",":
operator
thank you very much. yes, everyone, your question-and-answer session will now begin. [operator instructions] we do have some questions on the line at this time and your first question comes from the line of shaul eyal from oppenheimer. you are live in the call. please go ahead.
shaul eyal -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you. hi, everybody. congrats on another solid set of results and then guidance. barak, i actually want to start with the cxone and the way nice is capturing significant wins within larger enterprises. i know you've mentioned some of the drivers. can you also elaborate on some of the verticals, i think, that you mentioned in your prepared remarks? and does it require a longer sales cycle from prior quarters or pretty much are you seeing the same acceleration trends that we had been seeing over the course of the past few quarters, because the numbers definitely suggest that. and then i have a follow-up?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thanks, shaul. yeah. so indeed, we see a great adoption of cxone, an acceleration in the adoption. and as i've mentioned, it's got some variety of reasons and one of them is the increase of adoption in both large enterprises as well as some relatively new verticals. they are not new to customer service, they are new to the adoption. and i would say that the two main reasons for that is, first of all, the large enterprises are getting to the point of simple realization, that the time has come to accelerate their move to the cloud. covid accelerated that realization. it's not related directly to covid, but just the experience they went through.
the second thing they realized is that they really stuck on their innovation as long as they stay on either their on-premise provider or even if some of those on-premise provider migrated them to a semi-hosted solution, it didn't solve their innovation cycle. we're a native cloud solutions provider. cxone has both the scalability and the completeness that is really required by those large enterprises. it's the only platform we believe that have those features and capabilities to cater to this segment of the market. and the other thing that they are experiencing is that even when they start small, if you would like, the move is very, very fast unlike what they've experienced in the past with migrating from one on-premise solution to another on-premise solution. so that is accelerating. at the same time, as i said at the end of my opening remarks, we believe that even with the current adoption, we are just at the beginning. and that is accelerating and there is a long runway over here.
shaul eyal -- oppenheimer -- analyst
got it, got it. thank you for that elaborated answer. barak, also a question on the public safety, pretty much you've discussed that kind of you kind of bringing that all those capabilities back to life, mentioned that in your analyst day. so can you provide us with a little bit of an update, how was recent months, even, again, the recent quarter and in that respect, anything you can share with us, shed more light on that activity?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah. we're very happy with the progress of what we see in the public safety and as a reminder for the rest of the forum on the call. it's a market where nice -- we're operating in this market for actually for 30 years and we offered -- we have a very large customer base, but our solution used to -- or focused on a very a niche solution or one product in this market, and what's happening in this market in the past year plus is that it is going through very similar themes we see in other markets, specifically digital transformation and that opens our eyes with different technologies we brought into this market. that, a, we can significantly broaden our footprint for public safety organizations, but also expand from -- we are mainly in policing, and these days, we are expanding due to the offering of investigate to the wider aspects of the overall criminal justice system, all the way from defense, court, prosecution and of course policing as well. so we're very happy with the progress. we see great traction for the solution, by the way, both in europe and in the u.s. and even to a certain extent in certain places in asia and we think there is something that is relatively mid-sized at the moment, but it can grow to become something very significant.
shaul eyal -- oppenheimer -- analyst
got it. thank you. good job. congrats.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you very much. your next question on the line comes from the line of daniel ives from wedbush. you are live in the call. please go ahead.
daniel ives -- wedbush -- analyst
yeah, thanks. my question is in terms of acquisitions, can you just talk about your appetite there specifically on cloud given the strength you're seeing? thanks.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah. we continue to obviously to be very active on the acquisition front. at this point, we believe that we have all the components that we need in order to execute on our strategy, but at the same time, of course, we will not be shy from augmenting our execution with some relevant acquisition. i believe we have as a company, a good track record, not just about acquiring, but also about integrating, which is the key thing on acquisition and we have done well in the playbook that we have for acquisition. so we remain very active. i can say that the market is different now from where it was a few months ago, but since we have the strategy in front of us and that's what will drive acquisition, we definitely have the capital if we need to go ahead and do something and we'll continue to monitor on that area.
daniel ives -- wedbush -- analyst
great. and then just in terms of conversations with customers, could you maybe compare in terms of the cloud appetite today versus even at the start of the pandemic when we go back to march and april, maybe compare and contrast in terms of different conversations you're having? thanks.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
sure. i think that the conversations have, i would say, similar nature to the beginning of the year before the pandemic, but the sense of urgency changed. so the fact that organizations already took a decision that they want to move to the cloud is not new before and after the beginning of the pandemic. what changed i believe is the sense of urgency and the timeline they are providing and that's on the same reason i mentioned on the previous answer or question on that front. so just higher sense of urgency to that, it's more about how do we do it, what -- how fast we can do it and it's not a question about if we do it.
daniel ives -- wedbush -- analyst
thank you. great quarter.
operator
thank you very much. your next question comes from the line of scott casher from bank of america. you are live in the call. please go ahead, sir.
scott casher -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, congrats on the strong quarter and thank you for taking my question. you've hit on a little bit, but how sustainable is this cloud revenue growth and looking at your pipeline and market activity, do you think there is room for more acceleration here?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
so, first of all, we are of course very pleased with the 35% growth we provided for the quarter and generally, this year we saw an acceleration in our cloud growth. we'll provide our next year guidance only in february when we report our q4 earnings and then we'll provide some insight as to next year. but in general, we feel confident, both for next year, as beth said in her remarks, and also for q4 for sure. but also moving forward, we believe this is the area of growth for us and that's exactly where we see a change in the size of the market, the addressable market. when we talk about the market, that is $6.5 billion today and going to $17 billion. this entire growth is cloud. this is a market that is going through a cloudification, so the opportunity there. of course, it's for us to continue and execute and i believe that if we'll execute as good as we have executed in the past two years, there is an opportunity to further grow that. we need to remember, in our industry in the ccaas business, we are the largest player by far, twice the size of our next competitor and reporting a higher growth rate. so the runway is there and it's all about execution right now.
scott casher -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. and then just one more if i could, it looks like you saw some declines abroad. what are the market dynamics in emea and in apac right now? is this more a macro weakness or do you need to educate the market about ccaas and invest in your channels? thank you.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
hi, scott. this is beth and thanks for the question. as we look on the markets outside of the americas, today, they are still more on-premise and license-based regions. so, we're quite excited about the growth in the expansion we have of our cloud business. in fact, we've seen really a very strong year-over-year growth and cloud revenues coming from those regions, but today, you are seeing more a reflection of the variability, which we see from time-to-time in those regions given the impact of the license-based business. we're excited about all of the partner shifts we've created in the last 12 months to 18 months in those regions and we're driving additional business, but of course, cloud revenue takes longer to really be demonstrated in the revenue. so, the markets remain healthy for us and we're excited about the cloud opportunities ahead for us in those markets.
scott casher -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you very much. your next question on the line comes from the line of tavy rosner from barclays. you are live in the call. please go ahead.
chris reimer -- barclays -- analyst
hi. this is chris reimer on for tavy. thank you for taking my question. actually, what i wanted to ask has already been asked, but i will follow up with -- you mentioned in your opening statement about partnerships, and i was wondering if you could expand on the evolution of the partner channel for the cxone and x-sight platforms?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
okay, thanks for that. yes. a key pillar of our strategy [indecipherable] is forming more and more partnership and that's not new. it's something we have started several years back, and today, the size of the partnership that we have both in terms of the number of partners as well as the volume of business with those partners is very substantial part of our business. and it's also a key success factor as we go and expand into international markets as beth mentioned before when we reported in the past few quarters on some key partnerships that we have signed and we're very happy on the performances of those partnerships.
it is true for both cxone and for x-sight. cxone has more mileage. so, it has more partners, but x-sight is starting to gain also a lot of momentum with partnership as well as xceed, which aim into the mid-market of the financial crime and compliance. and lastly, i will say that we're very happy also with the technological partnership on the different marketplaces that we have on all the different platform that we have, it creates a very strong momentum both technologically for customers, but there is also a lot of go-to-market opportunities with these many dozens of technological partners.
chris reimer -- barclays -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you very much. your next question on the line comes from samad samana from jefferies. you are live in the call. please go ahead.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. and beth, i want to follow up on the really strong cloud performance, it was very impressive. and maybe just want to peel it back just a little bit. so, can you maybe break down how much of the strength was pure cxone versus increase in contribution from x-sight and some of the other cloud offerings on the financial crime and compliance side of the business? and i have a follow-up to that as well.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks for the question. and as you look at our strong cloud performance, we've been highlighting every quarter that more and more of our growth in the cloud is coming from multiple arenas. if you look back a year ago, really, our growth was being driven predominantly by cxone in the americas and while that's still a significant driving force today, of course, as i've mentioned, we're seeing growth rates in double and triple digits across our other business units for actimize for public safety for the regions. of course in terms of absolute dollars, they are not as large as a contribution. so, cxone today is still predominantly driving that growth, but again, as i highlighted, we are seeing very good signs as we start to build out that cloud expansion and our other business units as well as other regions.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then, barak, maybe a question for you. it's exciting to hear about the 80% plus conversion for cxone@home. i'm curious if you could share any characteristics about those customers. are they generally larger than your existing installed base? are they on the smaller side? is it getting you into new geographies or new verticals? just curious how much that's widening the aperture for nice and who they can look at?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thanks for that. i'm trying to think, because it's -- i must say it's across the board. i can't characterize it on a specific territory or a specific vertical, it's across, actually, multiple verticals. we have the success both internationally and domestically, and also different sizes. i think what is common to all of them is that they've experienced the need to move to work from home and they hit a wall on the limitation they had with their on-premises or hosting solutions from other providers and that came exactly on the right time for them. so, they tried it and just in a matter of days, they realized this is the right solution. so, the common thing is just a matter of how outdated their legacy solution is. other than that, it's across -- it's all over the place from vertical, segments and size.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
helpful. and beth, i'm going to break the rules. so, i'm going to squeeze a third question and just given nice has a such broad view across so many verticals. i'm curious if you think about some of the challenged verticals that you serve maybe more in the hospitality, travel, retail, are you starting to see improvements there? are you starting to see customers bring back service agents? just anything you can give us qualitatively or quantitatively that shows what's happened there trend-wise, inside of the installed base, that would be helpful.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
sure. i think we've highlighted in past quarters that -- and barak highlighted today in his discussion around. we are fortunate to really be driving a lot of growth and acceleration from certain verticals, which are in the government sector and really kind of new breed technology companies. so, this is really fueling and further accelerating the growth we're seeing in the cloud. in terms of challenged verticals, i'd say we did see some initial slowdown as expected from the results of covid. we've seen kind of a flattening in terms of those verticals, and certainly, we're optimistic as we hear positive signs in the market and optimism that those are opportunities for fueling further growth as we go into 2021.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
maybe just to add to that, samad, those verticals that you referred to hospitality, travel were not very strong verticals for us before, it's just a matter of size for us, but surprisingly, one of the deals, i think the first deal i mentioned in my opening remark was one of the largest hospitality operators in the world, that was obviously impacted by covid, but decided to take the opportunity at this time and replace their incumbent -- their on-premise providers with cxone. and generally, customer service is front and center for every organization. so, even if they are somewhat challenged with their business, it's an area that they want to continue in excelling.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. really appreciate the color and great to see the strong cloud growth.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you very much. your next question on the line comes from the line of ryan koontz from rosenblatt securities. you're live in the call. please go ahead.
ryan koontz -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
hi, good morning and thanks for the question and congrats on the strong cloud growth there. you've clearly seen success in moving incontact up markets, and as you do that, i wonder if you're seeing any changes in the low end of the enterprise, in the mid-market space. i'm wondering if new entrants there from some of the ucaas players are starting to impact the competitive market or pricing in that segment? thank you.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question. so obviously, as i said, we see success across the board, but we are very excited about the adoption, the increased adoption of large enterprises. this is where we believe the opportunity lies ahead. but at the same time, we are not neglecting the mid-market, the smb. we have a very strong offering, very good go-to-market capabilities, and of course, a very wide network of channel to be successful in this market. so, we are highly segmented in the way we run our go-to-market and with the way we run our services post the deal, and of course, we know how to continue to do that and we don't see any different dynamics in those segments.
ryan koontz -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
got it. helpful. thanks very much.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you very much. your next question on the line comes from sanjit singh from morgan stanley. you're live in the call. please go ahead.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you for taking the questions and congrats to the team on hitting 50% cloud mix, it's really great to see. barak, maybe i want to talk a little bit about the conversion on cxone. it's been 80% for the past couple of quarters. can you give us a sense of how strong a funnel that is in terms of driving either new logo acquisition or even potentially driving some of these larger acv deals that you're signing?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah. so first of all, this quarter regardless of separate from cxone@home, this was one contributor, we're very happy with the number of new logos overall. cxone of course, is one of them, but we grew 50% on new logos acquisition versus q3 of last year. and cxone at home is one of those contributors. the way i look at cxone@home is one of the vehicles that we have as kind of lead generation, and it's very effective lead generation. customer comes over, they can try it very, very fast in a matter of day or two, it's up and running, and at their disposal, live in production and it saves a ton amount of time and effort in the sales process.
so, call it a very effective piloting program or trial program, or however you want to call it, it's just a very effective vehicle. and by the way, in the course of doing that, we're very proud also to help some organization at the time back in may and april, where they really, really needed that support. so, we just continued the program and it created great momentum in our pipeline, but as i said, it's one of the elements out of many.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and if i could just follow up barak on that point, and we think -- i mean, 50% is a pretty outstanding number, and it seems, there's multiple elements at play. i think what's particularly impressive is that, large enterprise customers, your traction and that side of the market is doing great there as well. so, are you guys getting better at sort of online customer acquisition? is the sort of pace of decision making in terms of converting the pipeline increasing? what are the things that are changing today versus last year that's driving that increased velocity in the new customer acquisition side?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
so, i will give it to few factors. first is generally, as i said, race into the cloud by a lot of enterprises that would like to move and move much faster versus a year ago. second is the expansion of our go-to-market. we have more go-to-market resources, more go-to-market capabilities, and as i said, both domestically and internationally, while the revenue internationally you're yet to see that. we actually have strength in those areas as well, which will eventually also become more pronounced in the revenue as well. so, all of those are key contributors.
the beauty about all of those new logos is even if we land such a customer and they are starting, relatively small, even if they are a big enterprise and decide to start small in one department or one area, once you've landed in this -- this customer, and, of course, if we're successful and customer satisfaction is high and that's our intent of course. the opportunity for expansion and growth with that customer is very substantial and i mentioned in my opening remarks a lot of some -- a lot of large deals that will follow on expansion deals from new logos that got acquired the year and two years ago.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent, barak. thank you.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you very much. your next question on the line comes from rishi jaluria from d.a. davidson. you are live in the call. please go ahead.
rishi jaluria -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions and nice to see continued acceleration on the cloud side. i first wanted to go back to the cxone side of the business and ask about sustainability, but not sustainability of growth rates, but thinking just about maybe the sustainability of the tailwinds that you've seen as a result of covid. as we think about post-pandemic, especially with visibility into a potential vaccine, how are you thinking about those tailwinds going forward? is there maybe even a replacement opportunity as those reopenings of offices to replace the legacy on-premise and increase the velocity of those replacements and maybe expanding that question a little bit more, as you are talking to your customers, especially the larger upmarket ones, where you have some nice traction, what is your sense for their post-pandemic playbook? is it a kind of back to business as usual, when it's safe to do so? is it going to be a hybrid environment and contact centers not running at 100% capacity with some remote work options? maybe walk us through that and then i've got a follow-up.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
so, it's kind of, i would say several questions. i'll try to answer. the first one is, as i've mentioned and we mentioned in the past two quarters, ""we benefited from the reaction to covid because it accelerated decisions with many of our customers and prospects"". on the flip side, we don't see the negativity or a negative impact on our business when hopefully there will be a vaccine and we will all be out of this covid situation. on the contrary, we believe that those insight and realization and experience the organization had during the pandemic will further accelerate the cloud even post the pandemic. so, we don't see if i can call it a negative reaction to our business as the pandemic clear out.
with respect to what we hear from customers about their thoughts moving forward, it's an interesting question and we have this dialog with a lot of customers, customers come to us to consult and ask if we know what other are doing and etc. what they really want to know from us these days is they would like to get through our analytical tools, two things. first of all, to understand the real -- the productivity of their people who are now working from home for the past seven months to eight months. they're all working from home, there's a feeling everything is ok but different things like the customer experience, engagement, effectiveness, etc. is something that now increased the consumption of analytical tools and you heard again many of the analytics deals we had in the quarter. that's one thing we hear from customers. and the other side of it is implementing those tools as they understand that work from home either in a hybrid mode or just working from home is here to stay potentially, and they want to make sure that those environments, the working from home environment is as effective or even more effective that they have versus working from the office.
rishi jaluria -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. that's really helpful. and then just a quick follow-up. as we think about the traction that you've had with the ecosystem and marketplace, right, with cxone and then now you're building out this x-sight marketplace, can you speak a little bit about kind of the longer-term vision for the marketplace and maybe the potential monetization vectors there? thanks.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
so, i think there are three layers to the value within the marketplaces, and as i said, we use the same playbook in cxone, in x-sight and in evidencentral, which is the platform for the public safety. and for cxone for sure, and x-sight, we're already at a point where there is a scale to that network and it's part of our go-to-market and it's part of the cadence of customers to navigate through this ecosystem as they are looking to further expand and onboard additional capabilities on top of either cxone, x-sight or evidencentral. so we're very happy with that.
so the first one is value to customers. the second thing is, we do see and we're already starting to execute on some monetization opportunities and the monetization has, i would say a variety of options in there enriching the data in our systems and then monetizing on this and i mentioned a bit on that on the x-sight part, but also certain charge that we can have on advanced integration and also resell opportunities and referral opportunities that we might get from this network that are very eager to leverage our go-to-market.
these are the opportunities that we see on this network and i would say that the third layer, i'm sorry, is actually a great way for us to explore m&a opportunities. we can in real time see who are those players that are very successful, who gets traction beyond slideware, but actually in real life and that allows us to have a better and more better qualification for future acquisitions.
rishi jaluria -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
all right. wonderful. thank you.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you very much. and your next question on the line comes from the line of walter pritchard from citi. you are live in the call. please go ahead.
walter pritchard -- citi -- analyst
thanks. two questions. just one first on the license side, there was, i think a notion last quarter that you might, you've seen some license deals maybe deferred and you might see that come back. i'm wondering, how you're thinking about license especially as we move into next year? and then i had a follow-up.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
thanks for the question, walter. as we look at the license side of the business, i think, what we've seen in both q2 and in q3 was generally as expected. we have had some headwinds coming on the license side of the business. and as we look forward to the fourth quarter, i think we expect a bit more of the same in terms of some of that compression on the license side, and of course, on the flip side of that, the momentum we have seen on the cloud is continuing to be strong and we have ongoing momentum there.
as we look a little bit further into 2021 on the license side of the house, i think that it's a year with new budgets coming into play and obviously some optimism around a potential vaccine and what that means on a broader scale. so, we believe we'll likely see some stabilization on the license side next year. and certainly, as i mentioned, on the cloud front, we expect that to continue to be really the strong growth in the fourth quarter as well as looking into next year.
walter pritchard -- citi -- analyst
great. and then just on a margin question, you've made good progress on gross margins generally in the cloud. i'm wondering how the larger enterprise mix within cloud impacts gross margins. i know sometimes those customers don't bring their own telephony, and they're just larger deals. so, they may have higher gross margin, but how should we think about as you see continued migration of that cloud mix toward larger customers, what the margin impact is at the gross level?
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
i think you hit the nail on the head really, which is that, that's very true that as we go into the larger enterprise. they do often have their own telephony and of course we see them buying more of the suite across our cloud platforms, whether it be cxone, public safety or financial crime and compliance and the x-sight platform. so, it's really a common theme that as you're going into the large enterprise, they're buying more of the software and the analytics, which is really coming at the higher margin profile relative to the telephony piece of the overall deal. so, we are seeing that it has a positive impact and that's one of the factors that is contributing to the nice growth you've seen in the cloud gross margin year-over-year. i mean we've had almost a 400 basis point increase year-over-year. so, we expect to see more of that over time and that ongoing trend to be in place.
walter pritchard -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks for the detail, beth.

barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you, marty, and welcome everyone. over the past several years, we have successfully built nice into a company that is able to quickly transform, and that was no doubt put to the test, as a result of the events that took place last year. we more than just passed the test. we broke barriers, turning 2020 into another groundbreaking year for nice. our strategy in the past few years has been to transform our markets with cloud digital platforms that embed artificial intelligence. it was proven to be successful and catalyze our growth.
2020 was an eye opener for organizations of all sizes, realizing that the only viable choice to keep up is to fully embrace cloud, digital, and artificial intelligence. the result is that cloud, digital, and ai adoption has now leaped several years forward. as we are now, the clear market leader in all these domains, we are extremely well positioned to be the platform of choice.
2020 was a standout year for nice in cloud. we have taken a wide industry lead as we surpassed the mark of nearly 50% of our total revenue coming from the cloud. we exited 2020 with a cloud annual revenue run rate, exceeding $900 million. at the same time, we delivered nearly 400 basis point improvement in cloud gross margin in 2020, compared to 2019, which drove a 90 basis point increase in the operating margin over the same period. our cloud leadership was driven by accelerating cloud revenue growth throughout 2020, and we ended the full-year 2020 with 31% cloud revenue growth compared to 2019. we owe our strength in the cloud to continued product innovation and strong competitive advantages, provided by our cloud platforms, namely cxone in customer engagement, x-sight and xceed in financial crime and compliance, and evidencentral in public safety.
we further penetrated new market segments in the cloud, taking our solutions down market and establishing our leadership in this segment, while at the same time, seeing rapid penetration in large enterprises. with cxone, we have established significant beachheads with a record number of customer wins at the high end of the market, replacing the legacy solutions of our competitors along the way. we witnessed further penetration in the international market with cxone, and so a record number of agents on cxone in 2020 as well.
we also opened brand new cloud opportunities in financial crime and compliance with our new xceed cloud platform, providing a gateway to the lower end of the market encompassing thousands of financial institutions that we may not have had access to in the past. the traction with xceed has been rapid with new customers already signing on to the new platform. as in customer engagement, we now have the entire financial crime and compliance market covered in the cloud with both x-sight for large financial institutions and xceed for the small mid-sized market.
and in public safety, we had a record year. we more than doubled the number of our public safety customers in the cloud, driven by our evidencentral cloud platform, and its anchor solution, nice investigate. with the need for digital evidence management rapidly accelerating, our evidencentral end-to-end digital transformation platform is helping to bring the public safety market into the digital age.
digital transformation became top of mind for customers in 2020. and for us, 2020 was a year of digital breakthrough. we witnessed the accelerated use of digital channels across our markets, and our platforms were a driving force for the new frontiers of digital customer service, digital banking, and digital policing. in 2020, over half of our all contact center opportunities, contained digital elements, and we saw an overwhelming 100% year-over-year increase in our customers' digital interactions volume. we owe this to the breadth of our portfolio and best-in-class digital capabilities natively integrated into cxone. most of our financial income, crime compliance deals were driven by the imperative for digital transformation in banks, and nice investigate is today the fastest-growing digital evidence solution in the financial crime justice market.
2020 was also a year where we witnessed a major transition from nice being the leader -- the leading provider of cutting edge analytics to the pre-eminent provider of breakthrough artificial intelligence, as we are now injecting ai in almost everything we do. in fact, our enlighten platform is now the underpinning for several of new and existing solutions. since the launch of enlighten last year, we have seen substantial growth in the pipeline with several deals from multiple verticals already signed throughout the year, including three of the top 10 new economy companies, a major healthcare provider, a renowned text operation provider, one of the largest global hospitality companies, a prominent telco company, and many others. on top of all of this, in 2020 we continued to significantly expand our ecosystem of partners with a growing number of independent software vendors building their solutions on our open market places for all our platforms, boasting the largest ecosystem in our domains.
2020 was a successful year at nice, and the fourth quarter results brought the year to a strong finish. in q4, cloud revenue grew 33% compared to the same quarter of 2019. cloud gross margin increased 380 basis points, and the operating margin exceeded 30%. in addition, cash flow from operations grew 82% to $167 million in q4, leading to a record annual cash flow from operations of $480 million for 2020.
the strong results in our cloud business are reflected in the continuous signing of significant cloud deals in the large enterprises, and q4 was no exception. we signed many multi-year seven-digit acv cxone deals, including one of the leading multinational automotive brand. this organization is transforming the customer experience by adopting a seamless omnichannel platform with nice that provides scale and agility. we replaced several competitors in the process. other seven-digit acv cxone deals included a multinational financial institution, a large south american-based bank, a pre-eminent security company, a leading brokerage firm, and a large government customer that included approximately 20 different agencies. there was a seven-digit deal with one of the biggest hospitality companies in the world, which was a quick expansion of the deal signed just one quarter prior. other seven-digit deals included a large outsourcers, a renowned transportation leasing company, a very prominent aviation company, and a leading national auto dealer.
the common factor behind these large enterprises cxone deals in q4 was that they took on a multi-solution portfolio approach. this is the trend we are seeing more, as a growing number of large enterprise customers understand a significant benefit of a seamlessly integrated cloud omnichannel platform from a single vendor. moreover, most of those deals were replacements of on-premise legacy vendor solutions.
we closed many significant deals in financial crime and compliance in q4. one such deal was a eight-digit in-the-cloud with a very large financial services firm. this was a new customer as we replaced the homegrown aml solutions with our cloud platform. there was a seven-digit deal with a very large european financial services firm, further expanding our relationship with this customer. and another seven-digit cloud expansion deal with the us-based brokerage firm. our new xceed platform drove a significant number of cloud deals with both new and existing customers in q4. one such existing customer, a us-based regional bank transitioned from our on-premise solutions to our xceed cloud platform in a seven-digit deal.
the number of new logos increased significantly in financial crime and compliance as a result of the strong demand for xceed, with many of the deals centered around digital banking. moreover, we are further driving demand for xceed through partnerships, and one such partnership recently signed was with finastra. finastra, a provider of core banking solutions and payments software will deliver our xceed platform to their customer base. in public safety in q4, we signed several seven-digit deals, including with two major us cities, and an apac-based police operation.
we are proud of the results we achieved in 2020, but 2020 was just a warm up. we will leverage the success we had in 2020 and take that into the new year. 2021 is shaping up to be a year in which the game has changed. we are in a new reality, in which the events of 2020 have created a new normal, and at the same time provided new opportunities.
the first reality in this new normal is the move from old notion of time-to-value to the new reality of immediate value. in 2020, organizations of all sizes were taken by complete surprise by the crisis. they realized, they need to get things done much faster than ever before, and they discovered that the old rules of long projects planning and dependencies on cumbersome bureaucracies are simply not applicable anymore. organizations are now looking for technologies that will allow them to routinely break the execution speed limit of complex, multi-stage projects, while not compromising the quality and outcome of their efforts.
the second reality in this new normal, is the move from sporadic changes to continuous adaptation. when it comes to driving organizational change, implementing changes in sequential serial way, one change at a time, would not work anymore. enterprises need to adopt an approach of continuous adaptation. they must have the ability to drive and manage constant change in an ordered way across the entire organization based on immediate insights, accurate real-time data, and execute on it with maximum precision.
the third reality is the move from cloud aspiration to cloud affirmation. for years, we've been speaking about the journey to the cloud and about cloud transformation. the cloud is no longer a future aspirational intent, but an immediate, urgent, master reality. on-premise solutions are no longer effective, leaving organizations no choice, but to adopt cloud platform foundation.
the final reality is the move from digital 101 to digital fluency. digital is no longer the next big thing. it is happening now. organizations are referring today to the term digital, as the same with anything considered to be the next generation. it is, therefore, no wonder that digital is the preferred language spoken. there is an actual race out there where organizations are rushing to become digitally fluent across everything they do, and that means cultivating an all encompassing digital mindset and culture, injecting a digital approach to drive new businesses, models, offerings, and processes. we are well positioned for this transition to the new normal with our leading digital cloud platforms and cutting-edge ai.
we already saw great success in 2020. now, with these vast opportunities provided by this new normal, combined with a large and growing tam that we see expanding to over $17 billion over the next five years, we are very much looking forward to 2021. with our leadership gap continuing to widen versus our competitors, 2021 and beyond is the time to turn that gap into a chasm.
in 2020 more than ever, we have witnessed the ultimate power of our nice spirit. i would like to take this opportunity and thank our 7,000 nicers around the globe for their relentless innovation and endless dedication during this unprecedented year. i know that this spirit will continue to push us forward, which gives me great confidence to take on 2021 and the years ahead.
i will now turn the call over to beth.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
thank you, brock, and good day, everyone. i'm pleased to provide the analysis of our financial results and business performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020, as well as our outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2021.
total revenue for the fourth quarter reached a record of $438 million, compared to $431 million in the same period of last year. full year revenue was also a record and totaled $1,657 million, an increase of 5% compared to 2019. total revenue growth was again driven by our impressive cloud revenue, which grew 33% in q4, and 31% for the full year. and we exited 2020 with an annual cloud revenue run rate of more than $900 million.
as a result of our ongoing transition to the cloud, we continued to experience an expected shift to an increasing concentration of cloud revenue as a percentage of our total revenue. we expect this trend to continue in 2021. in the fourth quarter, cloud revenue reached 51% of total revenue, compared to 39% last year. as a result, recurring revenue increased to 81% of total revenue, compared to 71% last year. for full-year 2020, cloud revenue reached 47% of total revenue, compared to 38% last year, and recurring revenue was 79% of total revenue, compared to 72% for 2019. product revenue accounted for 9% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, and 11% in 2020. and services revenues, accounted for the remaining 40% of total revenue in the fourth quarter and 42% for full-year 2020.
moving to our business breakdown. customer engagement revenues were $361 million for the fourth quarter, and $1,349 million for 2020, and 8% and 6% increase respectively. financial crime and compliance revenues were $78 million for the fourth quarter, and $308 million for 2020. this compares to $96 million and $309 million for the fourth quarter and full-year 2019, respectively.
looking at geographies, americas revenues grew 11% in the fourth quarter and 10% in 2020 to $364 million, and to $1,361 million respectively. revenues in emea were $48 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $57 million last year. for the full year, revenue from emea was $186 million, compared to $217 million in the same period of last year. apac revenues in the fourth quarter were $26 million, compared to $46 million in the same period last year, and $110 million for the full-year 2020, compared to $123 million in 2019.
we continue to focus on and expand our cloud gross margin. in the fourth quarter, cloud gross margin increased 388 basis points to a record of nearly 68%. for the full-year 2020, cloud gross margin increased 380 basis points to a 65.6%. as our cloud business continues to grow, we expect further expansion in the cloud gross margin.
our gross profit grew to $317 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $314 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. for the full year, gross profit increased 5% to $1,182 million, compared to $1,125 million for the full-year 2019. in the fourth quarter, gross margin was 72.2% compared to 72.8% in the same quarter last year. for the full year, gross margin was 71.3%, similar to last year. gross margin was positively impacted by the cloud gross margin improvement, offset by the decline in product revenue.
in q4 2020, operating income increased to $132 million, compared to $130 million in q4 2019, and operating margin was 30.1%, similar to last year. full year operating income increased 8% to a record of $470 million, compared to $434 million in 2019. operating margin in 2020 expanded 90 basis points to 28.4% compared to 27.5% last year. we expect further expansion over the next several years to a 30% operating margin, as a result of our continued revenue growth, primarily driven by our cloud platforms and the leverage in our financial model.
earnings per share for the fourth quarter reached an all-time high of $1.61 compared to $1.58 in the fourth quarter of last year. full-year 2020 earnings per share was $5.73, representing growth of 8%, also an all-time high.
we experienced an outstanding strong quarter and year of cash generation, which led to an increase of 82% in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter to $167 million, and to a record of $480 million for the full year, which represented an increase of 28%. due to strong cash generation from our operations, both in the quarter and expected for the future, we repaid our $215 million term loan during the fourth quarter. as a result, total debt was $681 million, net of issuance cost and the equity component associated with our convertible debt. total cash and investments at the end of december 2020 was $1,464 million.
i will conclude my remarks with guidance. for the first quarter of 2021, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $445 million to $455 million. we expect the first quarter 2021 fully diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.42 to $1.52. for the full year 2021, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $1,790 million to $1,810 million. we expect the full-year 2021 fully diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $6.12 to $6.32.
i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. and at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
and our first question is from samad samana with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my questions, and nice to see the strong cloud revenue results. beth, maybe one for you on the guidance. so, if i think about 1q revenue is guided to go up sequentially, normally revenue comes down. can you just help us maybe for modeling purposes, think about, how we should think about cloud revenue versus product revenue in the first quarter, just given the atypical seasonality in the revenue guidance? and then, just even stepping back for full year 2021, just any update on what we should expect that cloud revenue run rate to look like exiting '21, given the outperformance in 2020?
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
sure, samad. thank you for the question. so, let me first address the growth that you mentioned, coming out of q4 and looking ahead to q1. i think first of all, it's important to note that actually we've been seeing a trend now as we look on the last few years, which is that both with our revenue as well as our profitability, given the further shift to the cloud, we see more and more of a concentration of recurring revenue. and so, as a result of that, it shifts more of the growth earlier during the course of the year, and that revenue is more evenly distributed. so you're seeing that, both in our 2020 results and we're expecting that dynamic to continue to play out in 2021 as well. i've mentioned in my comments or remarks also that we've seen a significant shift in the mix of cloud. cloud in the last two quarters has been more than 50% of our overall revenue. and we also expect that shift to continue as well, where cloud will continue to be the primary growth driver, and we'll see that becoming a larger, and larger portion of our overall total revenue in 2021.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
samad, maybe just -- it's barak, just to add, the strong guidance for q1 reflect the very strong q4 booking that we had. i talked about many deals that we had in the quarter, and we're entering into the year with a very healthy backlog.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and barak that brings me to a follow-up question. appreciated all the color on the call around new deal activity, but maybe as we think about the pipeline, if you could comment on how the new deal pipeline looks for cxone, especially as we lap 2020, which was a very strong year. are we entering with more deals in the pipeline that are larger, maybe anything you can give, either quantitatively or qualitatively around the forward pipeline for cxone deals, i think would be helpful as well.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah. we continue to see healthy momentum in terms of the pipeline and the activity in the market across the board. it's true for cxone. it's true for all our domains and markets. and it's both on the larger -- the higher end of the market as well as the smaller -- the lower segment of the market. and i think you also heard me on the call, we're starting to see very healthy dynamics on the international market, you will see them in the revenues. but they are going to kick in, obviously, its cloud. but we won a lot of deals on the international one, and the deals are getting just bigger and bigger. and the other thing that we see, i talked in my earlier remarks about multiple beachheads that we have landed full of 2020, but also in q4, and we believe that this is also an opportunity for a lot of expansions moving forward. so, we are stepping into the year with a strong feeling that this momentum will continue.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. i will turn it over to the next analyst. but thanks again, for taking my questions, and on the strong cloud revenue growth.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question is from sanjit singh with morgan stanley. please proceed with your question.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you for taking the questions, and congrats to the team on a 30% growth year in cloud. that's very impressive. i wanted to understand a couple of dimensions in the model around growth going into next year. on the product side, it was down 48% year-over-year in q4, maintenance is down year-over-year. what is sort of the key factors that's going on there? is that a function of more transitioning like the wfo base to cloud? is that an impact of macro? is it just changes in customer buying patterns? if you could sort of parse out the different variables that are going on, on the maintenance side? and then i had a follow-up question.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'll take it and beth, feel free to chime in. so indeed, obviously, our strategy as we shared with you is to transition the business to the cloud. this is where we put our main emphasis both winning a lot of new ground with cloud, as well as transitioning existing customers. most of the cloud growth so far came from brand new business for us, but we do have some transition of existing customers to the cloud. we like those transitions because they provide a significant boost to the revenue, because we see much more revenue from a customer, if they move to the cloud. indeed 2020 was a lighter year on the product. it's the combination of what i said on the cloud, as well as covid did have impact on the -- in the product decline. we believe that moving forward, the growth will come from the cloud, and we'll see fluctuation in the product. q4 specifically, i think was a bit of anomaly in terms of how sharp the product decline was, and we don't expect to see exactly that number moving forward.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's very helpful, barak. and then just a higher level question on what's now -- three or four major platforms, you have rpa, you have xceed, you have x-sight, you have investigate to complement cxone. if i look at the contribution outside of cxone, does that become 10%, 20%, 30% of the business in a couple of years as we -- as you look out over the next two or three years, how big can the non-cxone on cloud portfolio contribute to the overall business?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah, so obviously the -- still the lion's share of our cloud business is cxone. and this is our main platform as we go into the customer engagement market. actually, it's the platform, where we sell into customer engagement. as you said and as i highlighted earlier, we have two more cloud platform that are serving different markets. we have the financial crime and compliance markets, where we cater to this market, actually with two platforms because of the high-end and low-end. this is x-sight and xceed. and we have relatively new platform called evidencentral, which is allowing us to take the public safety market and expand it from center around policing to overall criminal justice. we believe that we can take the same playbook. we have done successfully in the past four years, five years in customer engagement, and use that same playbook in these markets. there are still the adoption, and this market is still at its early stages. actually, we are very happy with the booking and performance, as we've seen in financial crime and compliance. q4 was an outstanding booking quarter for this business, predominantly cloud. it's still small numbers, of course, compared to cxone, but it can start to grow nicely and kick in into revenue. in evidencentral, 2020 was really a breakthrough year for this business, still small numbers, but from a growth percentages, they're starting to look very nicely. so in the long run, we believe that they can start by themselves, become an absolute number -- healthy numbers. but needless to say though, main market today is the customer engagement, and cxone is the platform for us in this market.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
appreciate the thoughts, barak.

and our next question is from daniel ives with wedbush securities. please proceed with your question.
daniel ives -- wedbush securities -- analyst
thanks. so, my question is more, in terms of cloud, obviously, the growth that you're having, is this something that you feel like you can continue to do organically? in other words, do you start to get more aggressive even in talking m&a as we go into '21? could you maybe just talk about that, just in terms of any mindset changes on m&a?
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
so, we continue to be to be active on the m&a front. as you know us from historic -- historically, we have a good track record of acquiring companies and knowing how to get the right value. and the reason we believe that the reasons for that is that m&as are serving our strategy and not the opposite. we don't change our strategy because of an m&a opportunity. and right now, we believe we have many of the -- all of the components that we need to fuel our growth. our markets are very healthy. we have leading platforms. but we remain active on the m&a front. and if we see something that can further accelerate the execution on our strategy or fuel our growth as long as it is aligned with our strategy, we'll continue to do that because the muscle of integrating m&a is a healthy muscle at nice. and of course, we have the capital to go ahead and do that if we find something relevant.
daniel ives -- wedbush securities -- analyst
great. and then just last, with cloud, are you just continuing to see the trend where just conversions and overall sale cycles to cloud customers is continuing to shorten? you continue to see that accelerate from where it was even a year ago?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah. we -- i mentioned kind of the reflect on 2020. one of the thing that is clear is that all the key pillars where we operate in cloud, digital, and ai, what happened in 2020 is they kind of leaped forward. 2020 created the kind of a leap forward in the adoption level of digital solutions. organizations realized as a result of the 2020 events that even if they had plans to adopt cloud, only several years down the road, it is now a much more important, much more critical in order for them to continue and adapt to the changing environment. so we see that, and it's a similar dynamics as we said before. in the smaller enterprises, the adoption is rapid. in the larger enterprises, we see much more kind of lend and expand. our customers would like -- they just -- it's too complex for them to move everything in one day. so they will adopt it for one division or one side of the business, and then expand from that beachhead. that's a trend that we've seen in 2020, and we believe it will continue this year and also moving forward.
daniel ives -- wedbush securities -- analyst
thanks.
operator
and our next question is from walter pritchard with citi. please proceed with your question.
walter pritchard -- citi -- analyst
thanks. question on the fcc side with cloud where it seems like you've seen an uptick this quarter. can you talk about what you think drove that? was it sort of a kind of budget flush dynamic in q4, where those customers were really looking to put money to work into the future? and then, how do you think about that business proceeding from here? what types of financial institutions are you seeing move to cloud and which ones are lagging?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
so great questions. first, the overall dynamic, the -- this market is very healthy. the need to meet the regulations and fight financial crime is same as it was before. as i've mentioned, throughout 2020 and even more so in q4, we had an outstanding booking year that will translate into revenue. but there are certain changing dynamics over there. one of them, as i've mentioned is the shift to the cloud. this was the market that was slow to adopt cloud and we're starting to see now this shift to the cloud. the second thing is that for us, we historically operated mainly in the higher end of the market, with x-sight. and the introduction of xceed earlier this year, got us an opportunity to actually cater to the entire market, including to the smallest financial services out there. and we didn't expect to be adopted to get to that so fast, but we're very happy to see that the adoption of xceed to the smaller customers that used to have kind of homegrown solution or very basic solutions, we now have the opportunity in this market. so that will allow us to transition this business also in the cloud. and i think what we see in the revenue is the classic phenomena of shift to the cloud. it takes time for the revenue to realize, and we'll see that coming in. and we are strong believer in that business in 2021 and also moving forward. the last one is that we see more and more partnerships in this business. we talked a lot about partnerships in this business, and signing finastra in q4 will allow us to further expand our footprint and market reach.
walter pritchard -- citi -- analyst
great. and then just question on the -- if we look at the growth rate in cloud q3 versus q4, q3 obviously higher. is there anything that you can help us understand that was the driver in q3 in cloud overall that did not continue into q4? i mean, obviously, we understand the numbers are getting bigger as well, but just curious sort of the internals of the cloud revenue. and we've been in an environment that's been changing pretty quickly, so i want to see if there is any more detail there.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks for the question, walter. i think in general, like any revenue lines, there would be some slight fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter occasionally that happen. in general, we're quite pleased with the overall growth rate, higher than 30% growth for the full year of 2020. and we remain confident, looking forward in terms of cloud -- our cloud platforms and more particularly, cxone continuing to be the driver of that strong growth going into next year as well.
walter pritchard -- citi -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
and our next question is from rishi jaluria with da davidson. please proceed with your question.
rishi jaluria -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. nice to see a continued strength in the business. i wanted to first start philosophically by thinking about how you're looking at a post-pandemic future, right, and the sustainability on both the top line and so by that the acceleration of digital transformation and accelerating stuff to the cloud. how are you thinking about the sustainability of that post-pandemic? and then, on the cost side, i'm sure you've gotten a lot of cost savings as a result of just not having any effectively zero tv budgets and not having a physical conference. as we have the ability to go back to business travel, let's say optimistically, in the back half of this year, how are you thinking about some of those costs, which are going to be coming back? which are going to be permanent cost savings? and then, i've got a follow-up.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
okay. thanks for the question. i'll start with the first part, and then beth will take the cost element. so, i think we shared in the past and we definitely see that at the end of the day, the pandemic itself accelerated certain trends, starting with the adoption of cloud, the shift to digital, and the adoption of ai. and we don't think it's temporary. we think it's a bit -- the aftermath of the pandemic, those three things as well as others, but those three things will remain with us well, after covid will be out of the headlines. and that's healthy for our business. as i said, organization with all sizes had a trauma, if you would like from the early days of the pandemic and their ability to be agile in their response to different dynamics. and, in this aftermath, they're realizing that they need to shift faster than they thought before in the adoption. so philosophically, or high level, all of those three domains, which are the pillars to everything that we do, cloud, digital, and ai are only going to be stronger and accelerate further. about the cost, i'll hand it over to beth, yeah.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, barak. i think, rishi. on the cost side of the house, clearly, our primary focus is around our topline growth and furthering our overall cloud growth. and in order to do that, we're also very focused in how we spend as an organization. so, our eyes are really focused on continuing to fuel that growth through further innovation and doing that through further investment in our r&d, as well as really our go-to-market machine. and so that focus in terms of how we spend internally will continue in those two areas. and as we look at the overall makeup of our profitability, we have always been keenly focused on running a very well-optimized organization with a lot of leverage. and so, as you look at the ongoing picture, we still remain fully confident in our ability to continue to drive profitability, while fueling the cloud growth as well.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
but just to add to that, rishi -- just add to that on your question about whether it's the savings are one-time or they will continue? we didn't have ton of savings on the pandemic. in our offices, we continue to pay our lease. so there isn't much saving there. the only saving we had is a bit on, not a bit, but on travel. and we -- it will -- it's interesting to see what will happen with travel moving forward. how much of this organization will need. we don't think that will have any material impact on our profitability moving forward. and on the flip side, we think that post-pandemic, the mode of operation, i believe the work-from-home would actually help us to drive some savings on the real estate. and so, we don't think that quote unquote the saving that we've seen this year are going to disappear.
rishi jaluria -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then, beth, i wanted to drill a little bit more into 2021 guidance on top of some earlier questions. but as we look at the numbers, right, you're talking about, at the midpoint, 9% growth in q1 and probably close to 8% through the remaining three quarters, if i look at the midpoint of full year guidance. i guess, why shouldn't growth -- overall growth accelerate post q1 especially because the costs get a lot easier especially in q2 and q4, and you have a more favorable cloud mix that should aid that. maybe help us understand the assumptions baked into that? thanks.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks for the question. i think i'll add my views and then let barak chime in, if he has anything else, he'd add. i think, generally, when we look on the growth and the distribution of that during the course of the year, first barak mentioned, we had really strong q4, we're coming to the year with a nice backlog. i mentioned also a dynamic of the fact that we are bringing more of the growth earlier in the year, given that we're coming in with this strong base of cloud in our overall mix. as we look kind of on the product side of the house, i think you can expect 2021 will likely look more similar to what we had kind of pre-pandemic in terms of we were seeing some declines there. we don't expect to see unlikely that we'd see the same sharp declines that we experienced during the course of 2020. but it is likely that given the acceleration, we see in the markets overall that transformation is going to continue to drive the dynamic in the top line, which is the continued strong growth in the cloud and the continued transformation with product and on-premise becoming less of our business overall.
rishi jaluria -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
wonderful. thank you.
operator
our next question is from dan bergstrom with rbc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
dan bergstrom -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yeah. thanks for taking my question. so maybe to build on rishi's post-covid question a bit, you talked about your working arrangements going forward. but, what are you hearing from large customers as far as a vaccine, potentially returning to work on-premise. i know much of the efforts over the last year were about making work from home just as effective as working from the office. just curious what you're hearing about return to work or continuation of more of a hybrid work-from-home model?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah. we obviously have a lot of those conversations with our customers. it's part of a small talk of every conversation without these days. i think the real answer is that no one really knows. everyone has certain estimate. some organizations are making some preparation, but it's a lot of guesstimation. on one hand, there is understanding that there will be a change. everyone talking about something that will be not temporary, but either change. there are several models out there. some talking about hybrid, some talking about enabling full work from home, and some even talking about work from anywhere which has its challenges, if you would like. but the bottom line is no one really knows, even our customers. and what they want to have is the agility or the flexibility to change quickly to whatever come their way. that's what we hear from them. so when we talk -- when we end a small talk and we talk about projects, what we want -- what they want is the agility of that. and in the tech sector, i think you all -- we all read the same headlines and what we enable to our employees. we're very happy with how we operated this year. it's probably combination of the spirit of nice, but the engagement level at nice remained very, very high, actually higher in working from home or doing a lot of course to maintain that. our productivity increased as we work from home. and we are waiting to see that we'll be able, obviously, the safety of our employees is a top priority for us. and when things clear out, we'll take a decision on how to operate moving forward. it will probably be a combination of everything i said before.
dan bergstrom -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks, makes sense. and then, it sounds like enlighten's had a really good quarter here with a number of deals, growing pipeline across verticals. is it the behavioral modeling and predictive outcomes, that's really driving the traction here? could you drill down into the platform a bit? what's really resonating with customers?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think it's exactly that. we -- we've been selling analytics to our customers for many, many years and many of our customers are using our analytics solutions and adopted them. enlighten, with its ai capabilities, is a direct continuation of our analytics, and the understanding that we also have the data to, if you'd like elevate the analytical capabilities to ai and the ability to put analytics on steroids using enlighten, if i can use this analogy. and we had launched enlighten earlier in 2020, and what we -- the pipeline started to build. we expected few deals in q4, but we didn't expect so many, and from so many fortune 100 and very marquee brands as i provided in my earlier remarks. so, we're very happy with the adoption, and it's exactly that. it's the ability to provide prediction models and take decision in real time, if you'd like, and bring real-time decisioning based on those capabilities.
dan bergstrom -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's great. thanks, barak.
operator
and our next question is from paul coster with jpmorgan. please proceed with your question.
paul coster -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah. thank you for taking my question. i just want to go back to the products and services segments, again for a moment, if you don't mind. i'm not quite sure how to think about this long term. you mentioned kind of looking back to 2019, but when i look back over the last few years, it's sort of been a little bit lumpy. is this a sort of flattish kind of -- are these flattish kind of revenue lines for the foreseeable future, is i guess my question.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks for the question, paul. so just to add some additional color there, i think, first of all, looking back to 2019, the analogy i was making there is from quarter-to-quarter product will vary. and i think we should expect that all quarters in terms of product won't necessarily look alike. and so what we're focused on is, of course, the longer-term trends. when we look at our revenue lines and how that mix will change over time, and the mix overtime, we expect is -- as i had highlighted is to actually increase cloud. and so, by default as cloud increases over time, you're going to see that product gradually declines as well. we are shifting the business, the market is shifting, and accelerating and moving into the cloud. and so that is going to create a dynamic where over time, you will see a decline in product revenue. as i highlighted, again, you may see some variability or lumpiness on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but that's kind of the longer-term trend you should expect. as you look on the services, services had a couple of components. there is the deployment or the professional services we're providing to actually deploy the on-prem solutions. and of course that kind of goes a little bit lockstep or handed in with the change in product. of course, the much larger piece there is our maintenance stream. and on the maintenance stream, this is a legacy of our wfm customer base, and we also believe that over time that is the maintenance that will ultimately also transform into the cloud. but of course, in the large enterprise that's a very long tale. so that's not going to be a near-term transition and that's going to take many years to actually see that shift. we do know based on our customers that have already made that shift that we have a very nice lift, when those customers are moving from our traditional on-prem customers and over to the cloud. so those are kind of some of the expectations around the different segmentation of the revenue line.
paul coster -- jpmorgan -- analyst
beth, that was very helpful. as we sort of look over the long-term as well, do you anticipate gradual diseconomies of scale or dissynergies as those businesses kind of lagged the cloud, or is everything fungible here and resources, just simply get flipped over to the growth segments? this is on the opex side really.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
we -- as beth, i think, said in the opening remarks, we continue to expect to further gradually improve our operating income, and operating margin and we are aiming at least 30%. we had a very nice improvement in the past few years and that actually was very nice improvement also in 2020. and this is driven by the fact that although this -- the business is shifting to the cloud, our gross margin in the cloud is rapidly improving. and actually, it's getting closer to the mix of the business on the perpetual. we're already at 68%, and it's a very close to where we would like to be. and we believe we can take it much, much higher as we scale and go to the enterprise. with respect to resources, as you can imagine, in the past few years and also moving forward, we are shifting a lot of our resources from our on-premise business to the cloud.
paul coster -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. thank you.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you, paul.
operator
and our next question is from pat walravens with jmp group. please proceed with your question.
pat walravens -- jmp group -- analyst
oh, great, thank you and congratulations you guys. and barak, maybe this is for you, but i'm wondering if you can comment on sort of how the competitive environment is evolving? in particular, one question i get is when investors look at the 2020 magic quadrant versus 2019, what they see is that amazon connect shows up as a new player, five9 actually moves backwards from a leader to a challenger, and genesis moves a lot closer to nice in the leader's quadrant. so i'm just wondering is that reflective of what you're actually seeing in the market?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
so first, we're very proud and happy to be the number 1 player on the multiple analyst reports in all the markets we play in. we are the number 1 on the leading analyst on financial crime and compliance, and same goes of course on the customer engagement. gartner is one, but the others like forrester, frost & sullivan, etc., and in all of them, we are the number 1. it's a healthy market. it's a growing market. and when the tam is growing, a lot of players who would like to play both large players that want to get into this space, a lot of small start-ups and also the existing one. we're very confident in our strategy to lead the way. we believe that putting together in the past few years, workforce optimization, analytics, and routing, with the addition of digital and ai was a step that no one else had, and other still don't have, and will have to work hard to get where we were actually several years back. but, we keep monitoring the competitive dynamics. it's hard for me to say whether those small fluctuational changes, one moving up or down is really representing what we see out there. i could tell you from the -- out there in the market, there are ton of opportunities. our participation rate is increasing rapidly, and our win rate is very, very high. that's what i can tell you from the field.
pat walravens -- jmp group -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then if i can add one more. so, i appreciate your comment on no one really knows in terms of the work from home, but i'm wondering what you are planning on doing in terms of your policies at nice? we're struggling with this too. but, do you plan to be sort of a full remote company? do you plan to be work-from-home company? what are you telling your own employees?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
so, i'll tell you what i've told to our employees so far. with your permission, i prefer to tell the employees first, what is the next step before i share it with all. [speech overlap] so i'm not going to -- kind of not to break out -- breaking news here to our employees. but so far, we -- right now, we're working from home. let's start with that. a 100%, 7,000 people at end of the march last year, overnight were moved to work from home. we adjusted to that very quickly. we have zero disruption in the business, and it's working well for us. we need to remember two things as we are doing that. all of those people that used to -- that are working from home today or most of them used to work together in offices, so they know each other. and as there is new people are getting hired, there is a question of how do we keep them engaged, and how do we make sure they adjust to the nice culture, that's number one. and the second thing, there are things like ideations and collaboration, which is still i believe in the -- personally, i believe that in the virtual world are not the same as meeting people in person.
pat walravens -- jmp group -- analyst
yeah.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
so i don't think, in reality, given where we stand with vaccine in different territories, personally, i don't think it's going to change much between now and, let's say, the end of the year or the summer. a few months on the left to the right are not that different. so i think that's for the foreseeable future, for us, that's going to continue to be the mode of operation. with respect to what happens after, and things are safe and we can actually have the flexibility to choose, that's something we're debating internally today, what's the best thing for us and for our employees, and we will announce it to our employees relatively soon and then i'll share it with you.
pat walravens -- jmp group -- analyst
all right, great. thank you.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
okay, thanks.
operator
and our next question is from ryan koontz with rosenblatt securities. please proceed with your question.
ryan koontz -- rosenblatt securities -- analyst
hi, thanks for the question. checking back to your comments on ai, and specifically on the cxone, can you touch on the used cases there? is that more for coaching, or are your digital engagement capabilities fully automated there with ai? and how do you monetize that ai capability? thank you.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
sure. let's think for a second of what we do with cxone. we have hundreds of thousands of people come every morning, or actually they are not coming anymore, they're working from home, but are opening their laptops and working on cxone and this is the main -- if you would like, it's the main operating system for customer service, whether it's digital or not. and that's all being done in the cloud for us. and as a result of that, we have a lot of data going through our platform. in our system, our systems are smart to learn from every interaction that are going through our systems. and as we inject ai to the different corners of cxone, we see more and more use cases starting to shape up, starting from the ability as you said to coach and guide you in real time, the agent or the service providers, as they interactive customers. then goes to engagement in a more sophisticated way on different digital channels with different bots and chatbots and getting them smarter and smarter every day. and few other use cases can be on the compliance area, again still in the customer services space. so the beauty is that as we inject ai to the different corners of cxone, we are learning new use cases, but actually many of our customers are coming with use cases, we never thought about before. operator?
operator
and our next question is from scott casher with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
scott casher -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question. it seems like you have developed a very strong backlog in the quarter. can you maybe talk about the time it takes to go from bookings to revenue for the cloud revenues and cxone specifically? in other words, have we seen the full benefit from the ccas market acceleration yet, or does the recent acceleration take more time to show up in the top line? thank you.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question, and it's hard to give a number here because it really depends on multiple dynamics. we have multiple, with cxone, there are small customers, there are big customers. the beauty and even more so in 2020, we can make customers up and running in 24 hours. and actually we have great example and use cases and case studies from the peak of the pandemic back in march, where we actually had to bring customers up and running at scale in 24 hours and we've managed to do that. in most cases, actually the issue is not the issue of getting up and running is not on our side, it's actually the level of readiness of our customers. and some of them need to do certain integration on their side, and other things and training and so on and so forth. so today, it really depends more on the customer side. so in some cases, it can be immediate, like a matter of few days and in some cases, it can go all the way to several months, like six months or seven months. so, there is a blend over there of multiple things. we didn't see a dramatic change, if you'd like in the time it -- on average from booking to activation. a bit higher, as it goes to the enterprise market, but it's very similar to what we've seen before.
scott casher -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. that's very helpful. and then, i guess one more from me. can you talk a little bit about maybe the benefit you saw in 2020 from usage of the platform and cloud usage? was there a benefit from usage in 2020 that may go away next year and create a headwind? and that's all from me. thank you.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
we don't believe so. obviously we are very proud to take part. we were proud in 2020 to take part of the business related to -- on the government, on the state and local, related to the pandemic. at the beginning, it was more about just being available on q&a or information centers in the early days of march and april, then it's kind of converted into big centers about testing, then it converted to big centers around contact tracing. and these days, it is a lot about big centers around vaccination, which we believe will stay through 2021, at least 2021. so, that's on that segment. on the flip side, on the commercial segment, which of course is our biggest business on cxone, we saw a different ups and downs. but overall, it's the -- nothing that is just one-off or one-time. we actually believe that as things pickup, the travel and tourism industry, we're starting to see it picking up as people are starting to schedule their vacations with a sense of optimism for the summer and for the second half of the year. operator?

barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you, marty and welcome, everyone. as we are nearly halfway through 2021, our world is already changing at an accelerated pace. consumer experiences will change more in the next five years than they have in the previous 15. next gen consumers' demand channel of choice and seamless experience, and to keep up, enterprises need to raise their game in driving customer satisfaction to maintain loyalty among consumers. to accomplish this, organizations are accelerating their adoption of cloud, digital, sophisticated analytics and ai. this is creating immense opportunities in the market in which we operate and for the solution that we develop and deliver.
we are seeing increased adoption in cloud, digital, automation and self-service; solutions and technologies that we have successfully encapsulated into the broadest, deepest, and most complete platforms in both customer engagements and financial crime and compliance. these platforms will enable us to capture significant growth opportunities in what we foresee as a more than a $25 billion total addressable market for nice.
we witnessed strong evidence of these growth opportunities throughout 2020 and it is continuing in 2021 as demonstrated by a very strong first quarter results across the board. total revenue increased 11% to $457 million, which exceeded our guidance range. and cloud revenue grew 33%, both of which were fueled by cxone. the cxone pipeline and bookings reached record levels in q1.
unlike cloud transitions by other companies, our overall revenue growth is accelerating due to a combination of two drivers to our cloud business. first, cloud conversions of our existing on-premise products resulting in higher annual revenue per customer and second, a net new cloud business in ccaas digital and self-service solutions that we did not previously offer in the on-premise model.
in q1 due to our success in the large enterprise market, our cloud gross margin continued to rapidly increase; growing 470 basis points to 67.6% and that drove the overall gross margin, which increased 180 basis points to 72.7%. operating income increased 17% to $129 million and operating margin grew 130 basis points to 28.2%. this led to a 15% increase in earnings per share to $1.54, which also exceeded our guidance range and we generated $164 million in operating cash flow in q1.
the underpinning of the strong financial performance and our ongoing growth are the result of owning the best and broader set of assets we have assembled through both innovations and acquisitions to create cxone. these assets include omnichannel routing, digital, workforce engagement, analytics, ai and automation. we have successfully integrated these best-of-breed technologies into cxone, which is a single unified native cloud platform delivered to all segments of the market; small, mid, and large enterprises. this deliberate and prudent strategy of combining all these assets was recognized by gartner and many other industry analysts as nice is the only company that is a leader in both ccaas and wem in gartner's magic quadrant.
as the demand for channel of choice has become mainstream among consumers, the need for digital has never been greater among enterprises. in q1, we witnessed an increase of 2.5 times in digital interactions. this rapid growth in digital demonstrate the fast growing appetite that enterprises have to digitally transform and cxone has the broadest set of digital assets in the industry. cxone native capabilities allows businesses to reach consumers wherever their digital journey begins. whether a search engine, social network, or mobile application, ai-powered, now digital self-service is ready to handle all interactions either proactive or responsive to all customer needs.
a few weeks ago, we further enhanced our digital offering with the introduction of cxone expert following the acquisition of mindtouch. this expands the capabilities of our platform by embedding knowledge into the digital journey. this is another step in extending the breadth and depth of cxone by natively integrating best-of-breed capabilities.
our extensive investment in the past few years in ai led to the introduction of enlighten. it is the ai brain in the core cxone that is embedded across our entire platform, greatly enhancing every single solution on the platform. we have seen great success with enlighten among large enterprises in telecom, healthcare, hospitality and other sectors. with these assets in place, we also have a go-to-market that is unparalleled in delivering cxone to all market segments; small, mid, and large enterprises, as well as international.
international expansion has been a key strategic initiative for cxone and we are seeing great results. in q1, international bookings grew three times compared to the same quarter last year as we are seeing great momentum in our international partner expansion program. for small and mid-sized enterprises, we are also working with dozens of channel partners in a rapidly expanding partner ecosystem that includes carriers, affiliate partners, collaboration vendors, crm providers, valuable sellers and system integrators. we continue to see strong growth in bookings with our partners and we witnessed 38% growth in new logos in q1 with many of those coming through the channel.
we also have a large ecosystem of devone partners that are building solutions for our fast-growing cxexchange marketplace. there are over 150 solutions in the marketplace, and over 400 apis to extend cxone for crm, web, mobile apps, ai and automation, among many other categories.
our route to large enterprises has been our domain expertise for many years. this domain expertise, together with a large global enterprise sales organization, are reasons why we are clearly differentiated from our competitors in this segment of the market, and why we continue to see growing momentum here. q1 exhibited further evidence of this. in q1, we signed many seven-digit acv cxone deals with new customers. new customer deals included a large hospitality chain where we replaced incumbent on-premise legacy provider. we won this deal following the all-in-one aspect of cxone platform and the ability to easily add digital channels and analytics down the road.
we signed a seven-digit acv deal with a large federal government agency, which required a scalable model for the cloud and fedramp authorization. there was a seven-digit deal with a leading dental insurance company as they will be replacing their on-premise legacy systems from the incumbent. they will be moving forward with more automation, cutting-edge workforce engagement, and digitally transforming their business with nice. we also signed a very large acv deal with a well-known online publishing company.
in addition to new customers, we signed many large expansion deals, which demonstrate the power of our platform, as these customers continue to expand their relationship with nice by adding on solutions easily and seamlessly over time. large expansion deals included a seven-digit acv deal with a leading business process outsourcer and a large healthcare company where we expanded and replaced the incumbents. this healthcare company expanded with cxone to further advance their cloud transformation project in contact center.
other seven-digit expansion deals included one with a major airlines for a portfolio of our solutions, including analytics as they are preparing themselves for a major post-pandemic business resurgence. we also signed a seven-digit expansion deal with a major social media company which will deploy several solutions from our workforce engagement portfolio, as well as analytics.
we're also seeing tremendous momentum for cxone internationally with some very large international deals that were signed in the quarter. there was a seven-digit acv deal with a very large latin american telecom group, which is a new customer. we won this deal due to the flexibility, agility and extensibility of our cloud platform and replaced the incumbent who could only offer a hosted version of the on-premise product.
there was a seven digit deal with a pre-eminent telecom company in the apac region. also in apac, we signed a seven-digit deal with a major telecom company for a portfolio of our solutions. in the u.k., we signed seven-digit deals with a government agency for rpa and a telecom company for analytics.
in financial crime and compliance, we continue to sign large deals, including seven-digit deal with a very large bank for compliance; a major brokerage firm for fraud and robotics automation, an international bank for a portfolio of our fraud and aml solutions, among many others. we also continue to witness increasing success in the mid-tier financial institutions with our exchange platform.
in summary, after a strong start to the year, with the best assets in place and unmatched go-to-market and partner ecosystem, a record pipeline and robust bookings and mostly untapped $25 billion of fast growing tam, we believe we are in the best competitive position to capture many opportunities in 2021 and beyond.
i would like to take this opportunity and invite all of you to our annual investor day in conjunction with our interactions user conference. interactions live is the cx industry's largest virtual event with over 25,000 customers and partners in attendance and a great lineup of key note speakers.
i will now turn the call over to beth.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
thank you, barak, and good day, everyone. i'm pleased to provide the analysis of our financial results and business performance for the first quarter of 2021 and provide our outlook for the second quarter and full year. total revenue for the first quarter accelerated to 11%, reaching a record of $457 million compared to $411 million in the same period of last year. for the first time, total revenue in q1 exceeded total revenue in q4, demonstrating our shift to a predominantly cloud company with about 80% recurring revenue. total revenue growth was again driven by our impressive cloud revenue, which grew 33% year-over-year. as expected, due to our ongoing transition to the cloud, that is growing rapidly, we expect to have a long-term trend of overall higher revenue growth.
cloud revenue represented 50% of our total revenue in the quarter compared to 42% last year, and recurring revenue stood at 78% of total revenue in the quarter compared to 75% last year. our cloud revenue is primarily being driven by cxone in all segments of the market. while we are clearly differentiated and continue to achieve great success in large enterprises, we are also seeing tremendous achievement, both internationally and in the mid market as well.
in the quarter 50% of our revenue was generated from cloud and the other half of our revenue was comprised of our product and services, which accounted for 15% and 35% of total revenue, respectively.
moving to our business unit breakdown. customer engagement revenues, which represented 81% of our total revenue in q1, totaled $369 million for the first quarter, a 13% increase compared to the same quarter last year. in our other business unit, financial crime and compliance, revenues were $88 million for the first quarter, which was an increase of 6% from q1 last year and represented 19% of our total revenue.
breaking down total revenue by geographic region, we saw double-digit growth in the americas and emea regions. americas, which represented 82% of our revenue in q1, totaled $374 million and grew 11%, while emea revenues represented 12% of total revenue and grew 16% to $56 million. apac revenues, which represented 6% of our total revenue in q1, totaled $27 million and grew 6% compared to q1 last year. part of our growth strategy is to expand our cloud reach internationally. this ongoing expansion of cxone across multiple region is one of the key growth drivers for our continued cloud growth.
our gross profit grew 14% to a quarterly record of $332 million in the first quarter compared to $292 million for the first quarter of 2020. the gross margin increased to 72.7% compared to 70.9% in q1 last year. the increase in gross margin is mainly attributed to the growth from cxone. in the first quarter, cloud gross margin was 67.6%, an increase of about 470 basis points, which was largely the result of increased scale in our cloud business. as our cloud business continues to grow, we expect further expansion in our cloud gross margin.
in q1, operating income increased to $129 million compared to $111 million in q1 2020, and operating margin was 28.2% compared to 26.9% last year due to an increase in revenue, coupled with stable operating cost ratios.
earnings per share for the first quarter totaled $1.54, an increase of 15% compared to q1 last year, resulting from the improvement in gross and operating margins. we experienced another strong quarter in operating cash flow, which totaled $164 million in q1, an increase of 6% compared to last year.
total cash and investments at the end of march 2021 totaled $1,561 million. net of debt of $685 million, our net cash totaled $876 million. our strong cash flow generation and healthy balance sheet continue to provide us with the flexibility to capitalize on opportunities consistent with our growth strategy and capital allocation plans.
i will conclude my remarks with guidance. for the second quarter of 2021, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $445 million to $455 million. we expect the second quarter 2021 fully diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.45 to $1.55. for the full year 2021, we are increasing the range of our guidance for total revenue to be in the range of $1,800 million to $1,820 million. we are also increasing the range of our guidance for the full year 2021 fully diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $6.19 to $6.39.
i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question is from samad samana with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. maybe, barak, one for you in terms of the pipeline for cxone deals. it's great to hear what the company did in the quarter, but just maybe help us understand what demand looks like as we lap this time last year where there was a surge in interest and just maybe what the deal pipeline looks for cxone for the next quarter and for the rest of the year?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
hi, samad, thank you for the question. so yes, we see, as you saw in the earlier remarks, a great momentum in cxone and i highlighted that we see it both with new customer, with great growth in new logos versus the last year of 38% in the quarter, as well as expansion and specifically i highlighted two other thing which was tremendous growth that we see in the international market, so we are expanding and leveraging on the presence that we have over there. and of course, digital.
the pipeline, as i mentioned as well, beyond the booking that was record high in q1, looks very, very good in all of those segments, both in new logos expansion and internationally. so we are -- we feel pretty positive about the market dynamics. we see it from a segment perspective, in all segment of the market and we see the enterprise market continue to be very strong as more and more large enterprises are realizing, post the pandemic, as a new result of what they had experienced last year, they need to further accelerate and bring forward their plans of shifting to the cloud, as well as digitally transform. so that's what we see.
on top of that, as i've mentioned, the expansion are not just adding more capacity, we are starting to see the power of cxone with the breadth of solutions that are natively integrated and fully owned by us or customer easily adding those solutions and it adds up to our, both, bookings and billings.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and, beth, maybe one for you. i don't want to steal the thunder from the company's upcoming analyst briefing and maybe i'll address it there, but just adding cloud revenue is on top of everybody's mind and it was another strong performance this quarter. but i appreciate product revenue can be volatile, but how should we think about maybe cloud revenue guidance embedded in that 2q outlook and for the rest of the year as far as cloud revenue growth rates?
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
so as we look on guidance for the rest of the year, starting with q2, we expect our cloud growth to continue to be strong and looking forward for the rest of the year as well. from a longer-term perspective, looking out really over the next three years, we expect our cloud growth to be at 25% or greater, and looking at the given year in 2021 on a full year basis, we expect that our cloud growth will be even greater than that and that's kind of -- it reflected in the full-year guidance.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great, thanks for that additional clarity. i really appreciate it. and then just maybe one housekeeping question. on the services revenue, i know, normally, it goes down sequentially from 4q to 1q, but just anything worth noting there? was that more due to a shift to the cloud in this quarter? or just maybe help us understand that ongoing seasonal trend.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's a good question. and, of course, it really is reflective of the ongoing shift that we are seeing to the cloud. we had 33% growth in the cloud in q1. and as expected, that over time, we expect that the cloud business and the concentration of cloud revenue is going to continue to increase. and on the other side of that, of course, the largest portion of our service revenue is maintenance and in practice what we see is that as our customers are converting from being on-premise customers and shifting over to the cloud, and most of that's coming from cxone, we generally see a very nice uplift anywhere from 2 to 3 times on an apples-to-apples basis, but that uplift, we have seen, in practice, can be all the way up to 9 or 10 times as, generally, what you see is that those customers will actually adopt multiple solutions of cxone platform at the time that they migrate.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great, thanks for my questions and look forward to connecting soon at interactions.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you, samad.
operator
thank you. our next question is from sanjit singh with morgan stanley. please proceed with your question.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you for taking the questions and my congrats on a really strong q1. i wanted to go back to sort of this time last year and some of the initiatives around cxone@home and whether you still think that's a source of potential new lead, whether it's the mid-market or the enterprise. how has that conversion on cxone@home trended going in into 2021.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
so last year, with the outbreak of the pandemic back in march, we immediately launched cxone@home. it has two aspects of it. first of all, we wanted to support customers or prospects of means that did not have the ability to move home, but also a way for them to get a taste of the cloud and kind of make this potential [indecipherable] appeal though it wasn't there and it resulted with, of course, a lot of momentum. i think two things happened as a result. first of all, we realized, as a result of that, that we can get customers on-boarded in a much faster pace. when we started with cxone@home, all of a sudden, customers shifted to cxone in a matter of 24 to 48 hours at scale, which was really phenomenal. and we continue and doing that as we speak. but i believe both this campaign and generally now seeing the market is, as i said before, it's accelerating the overall move in the market into the cloud, and we see enterprises are getting ready to do that in the next few years versus much further down the road, and we are happy to see that and i think it will accelerate the progress of the tam.
needless to say, there are many other positive dynamics that we see in our business, not all of them related directly to those initiatives or to the pandemic. and these are, as i said, both digital transformation and a lot of injections of ai. and i think that our strategy that we put together several years back and both through internal innovation and all of the acquisition we have done, including the recent one with mindtouch, allowing us to be the only one in the market out there that can offer customers a full breadth of solutions in one native cloud platform, even if they don't need all of that in day one. customers are very receptive to the notion that it's a future proof solution and they don't need to continue and be kind of the system integrator of the industry or buying from a cloud vendor that are practically -- are acting almost as resellers instead of a platform.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that makes perfect sense. and thank you for that, barak. the one thing i wanted to follow up on was your comment on international bookings growing 3 times year-over-year. i just wanted to see and get a sense of how that's expressing itself. i noticed that the product revenue growth grew year-over-year for the first time. so when you think about those bookings, how is that coming through in terms of cloud versus on-prem and just broader cxone traction internationally?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
so, thanks. my comment on the international, obviously, product was much healthier this quarter but this particular comment on the 3 times was actually about cxone and cloud. so this is where we see the nice increase. it's part of -- it's a result of both those markets, but also our plan about two years ago to invest both in the technology and the availability, but also, of course, in the go-to-market and further expand our investments, both internally and expanding our partner network in many of those international markets. and we're starting to see. so we're starting to seeing it in the booking, we believe it will become more pronounced in revenue as soon those bookings convert into revenue in the cloud. i think you're seeing already, this quarter, some healthy growth rates in some of our international markets and we expect that to continue.
sanjit singh -- morgan stanley -- analyst
excellent. thank you. congrats.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tim horan with oppenheimer. please proceed with your questions.
timothy horan -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks, guys. can you talk about what else you need to do to expand international? is it product development, go-to-market? and maybe just where are you in that whole process? what stage you're in? thank you.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thanks for that. so we already have a very solid playbook and today we're much more confident in that playbook after seeing these results internationally. we have put ourselves at least two years ago on kind of prioritizing international markets. they're all relevant, but obviously they are different in size and different in their maturity. from a technology perspective, because we are a native cloud solution, the trends over public cloud and a positive environment, it's very easy for us to open or to make availability of the platform in any country or continent out there. and today we have this availability in dozens of different countries. so from a technological perspective, we're there. also since we have built the cxone from the ground up several years back, the ability to localize it both in terms of language, in terms of also specific feature that are needed for specific regulations in different countries is also pretty easy for us.
thirdly, the relationship with local telcos in order to have availability of both voice and some digital services, we have a very clear playbook for that and it's a very easy thing to do. so most of the effort right now is on the go-to-market front and there are two aspects to go-to-market. since nice historically have very strong presence in some territories, we have leadership in place, we have sales people in place, pre-sale, delivery people, and we have offices in many of those countries, it's mainly of expansion and reopening or anything like that. so that's one investment that we continue to do.
and the second investment is to continue to expand the partner ecosystem. i think there is now -- we're seeing a great realization of partners that were kind of sitting on the fence when it comes to cloud in certain international markets, and finally took a decision that this is not an option, but it's mandatory for them to shift into the cloud. it's something we saw domestically probably five or six years ago. now, we're seeing it in international markets and we're very happy to be among the first doing it in international markets and win the heart and the minds of many of those partners. and we saw it very nicely and we continue to sign up a lot of those partners on a monthly and quarterly basis.
timothy horan -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from tyler radke with citi. please proceed with your question.
tyler radke -- citi -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my question. first question, just wanted to double back a little bit on the strength that you saw on product revenue this quarter. just trying to understand if that kind of exceeded your internal expectations, kind of, what was the drivers of that and if you're seeing anything unusual in the pipeline where we could maybe see more product strength throughout the rest of the year.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah. so product is, of course, less of a -- not a recurring business. so we are seeing it might fluctuate from one quarter to the second. needless to say that our strategy that we go cloud first and most of our new customers, if not all of them, are going with cloud and many of our existing customers are expanding or converting to the cloud. but we have a very large customer base in certain markets, they still prefer to continue to buy products in an on-premise fashion till they'll convert to the cloud. sometime it's part of the conversation we have with them and building the roadmap with them. so it's the least predictable part of our business, as you can imagine. but actually the pipeline is pretty healthy for product as well. but again, the main focus of ours is the cloud -- in the cloud revenue and we'll continue to cater, of course, to the product element and we expect it continue to fluctuate from one quarter to another.
tyler radke -- citi -- analyst
thanks, that's helpful. so my follow-up, i know you talked about a large, i believe, of a hotel chain or hospitality group kind of modernizing on cxone this quarter. i'm curious as you look at the pipeline and you think about maybe industries that were the most impacted last year, do you think -- as things reopen, are you starting to see signs that those impacted industries to be tailwinds to the pipeline going forward? just kind of curious what you've observed thus far in some of the harder hit industries from a covid perspective.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah. so when it comes to -- i think what we have learned in our past and it's indicative, i believe, also for the future, that customer service is mission-critical for companies, regardless of the situation of their business. they still have customers, they want to stay in touch with those customers. customer is the most important asset. so i would say that even at the peak of the pandemic, last year, march, april, may, if you think about this particular segment you've mentioned of travel and tourism, all the way through the summer, they still have, although many hotels were closed and airlines had 10% volume versus usual in terms of flights etc., they still have a ton of need to provide customer service. people calling or people interacting with them about cancellation, questions, inquiries, my frequent flyer status or my frequent hotel status and things like that.
what we have seen specifically in travel and tourism and some other industries is that they are already seeing right now, and maybe it's indicative to what we're going to see in the future in the industry and they are seeing already, a lot of volume of people preparing for the summer months and even for the holidays of this year and they are experiencing a lot of positive booking on their business and they are preparing themselves. so they need more capacity and they've learned through the pandemic that there is a better way to do it. so they are taking advantage of this -- of the experience to both shift to the cloud, as well as -- or starting to offer certain digital services.
and lastly, in many of those cases, their employees are either still working from home or they are planning to do it in a hybrid model. and for that they're realizing that they need further advanced capabilities coming from our workforce engagement area.
tyler radke -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our final question comes from tavy rosner with barclays. please proceed with your question.
tavy rosner -- barclays -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking the question. at first, i wanted to get a sense when we look at the cloud growth, how much of that was growth from new customers, that new logo versus converting some of your, i would say, legacy customers?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah, so you characterized it correctly that as a company, and i think i've mentioned it in my opening remarks, our cloud transformation as a company is quite unique. we believe in a positive way, that it's not just a reclass of revenue and shifting it from the product to cloud. you're are not going to end up this transition just reclassing our customer base, shifting it from the product to the cloud. we have great opportunity that we're seeing it happening that we have two sources of growth to our cloud business. first is, what you have mentioned and this is converting our existing workforce engagement and other customers who sits on our on-prem business and converting into the cloud. but the second thing is the result of our strategy five years ago to step into the adjacent market to ccaas, digital and self-service, these are solutions in a market we just did not have presence in, and we were not operating in these segments as an on-premise company. so this is a brand new revenue for us.
today, the majority of that business of the cloud revenue come from the second part, which is brand new ccaas opportunities. we believe that the conversion of wem into cloud will accelerate at a certain point. it is somewhat also attached to the ccaas offering and, as beth mentioned before, when we see such a conversion, it's not one- to-one, it's actually giving us an uplift in a customer that used to be an on-prem customer of ours. we can easily see two times or more revenue from that customer as they shift to the cloud.
tavy rosner -- barclays -- analyst
thanks for that, much appreciated.
operator
thank you, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session. i will now turn the call over to barak eilam for closing remarks.

i would now like to turn the conference over to mr. marty cohen, vp investor relations at nice. please go ahead.
marty cohen -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, operator. with me on the call today are barak eilam, chief executive officer; and beth gaspich, chief financial officer. before we start, i would like to point out that some of the statements made on this call will constitute forward-looking statements. in accordance with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, please be advised that the company's actual results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. additional information regarding the factors that could cause actual results or performance of the company to differ materially is contained in the section entitled risk factors in item three of the company's 2020 annual report on form 20-f as filed with the securities and exchange commission on march 23, 2021.

i'll now turn the call over to barak.

thank you, marty, and welcome, everyone. we are pleased to announce an excellent quarter marked by an acceleration in all our key financial metrics. cloud revenue continues to flourish with 32% growth, while total revenue continued to accelerate well into the teens increasing 60% year-over-year. during this acceleration, driving this acceleration is our story in consistent execution in cloud during the past five years. unlike traditional cloud transitions that are focused on simply switching customers from license to subscription model, our overall revenue growth is accelerating due to a combination of [technical issues] to our cloud business.
first, net new cloud business in ccaas, digital and self-service, solutions that we did not previously offer in the on-premise model. and second, cloud conversions of our existing on-premise products resulting in higher annual revenue per customer. as our cloud revenue continues to experience rapid growth and is becoming a larger share of our total revenue, we expect that the acceleration in the growth of our total revenue will continue over the next few years. while the cloudification of our market continues to speed up, we are experiencing another major opportunity in the cx market as it expand to full digital cx. and just like five years ago, in cloud, nice is well-positioned to take on and grow its leadership position with yet another great market opportunity in digital.
back in 2016, we made a major strategic transformation at nice by making an aggressive move to the cloud with the acquisition of incontact. it was a strategy to capitalize on a rapidly changing market, a market in which enterprises of all sizes were beginning to shift to the cloud. customer service organizations were exploring the cloud for its agility, pace of implementation, elasticity, scalability and overall lower total cost of ownership. at the same time, they expected a customer service solution with a full set of capabilities and applications combined into a single cloud-native suite. with the acquisition of incontact, we embarked on a massive investment to deliver what organizations of all sizes needed and that resulted in cxone, the market-leading native cx cloud platform.
since then, nice became the clear leader of this fast-evolving market. our leadership is achieved for four contributing unique ingredients. the first is our assets, particularly omni-channel routing, workforce engagement management, high-value analytics, ai, digital and self-service, all native to seamlessly integrated into cxone. the second is our unimpeded focus on the cx market. the third is our distinct competitive advantage in large enterprises due to the breadth and depth of our platform, our domain expertise at the high end of the market and our global footprint.
and the fourth is our relentless innovation demonstrated by the hundreds of added features and functionalities in cxone every year, our cutting-edge ai which enlighten and unique enhancements that evolved cxone into a full enabled digital platform. all four of these ingredients are critical factors in delineating our market leadership. in cloud, we identified a rapidly growing market, set a clear strategy and executed well. as a result, we are now a $1 billion revenue run rate company, cloud company. cloud revenue continues to exhibit rapid growth and it now represents more than 50% of our total revenue compared to less than 5% prior to the launch of cxone. and today, digital is similar to what cloud was for us five years ago. and like cloud, the opportunity in digital is enormous.
the expansion of customer service interaction into full digital is in full swing with the growing part of consumer journey taking place at digital touch points. there is a clear realization that gen one cx solutions which have a disjointed interaction management approach and cannot cover and maintain context through the entire customer journey, while preventing organizations from participating in the most critical part of the consumer's experiences that are taking place in digital. this realization creates a major disruption in increasing demand for unified next-gen cx platforms that can manage all interactions across every consumer touch points from digital to voice for any service needs in both a responsive and proactive manner.
with the investments we made in digital cx both organically and through acquisitions over the past 18 months, we have evolved cxone into a complete platform with a unique set of solutions that can now cover all consumer's touch points. the cxone now allows organizations to move from managing interactions just in the contact center to owning the entire customer journey. this was achieved with the recent launch of cxone small touch and cxone expert that expanded cxone into a full proactive engagement platform using advanced conversational ai driven by state of the art knowledge management in more than 35 digital channels.
moreover, what also makes our platform rise well above other solutions in the market and the glue that makes our platform unique is the massive amount of cx data we have processed over the past few decades. these data coupled with ai machine learning is crucial to enable smart conversation and self-service among all the digital channels. this large volume of data, our domain expertise and cxone is the best seamless integrated digital platform in the market today embody a powerful combination of assets. with these assets, we now have a major opportunity in front of us as we put our digital cx platform in the hands of organizations worldwide and take the clear market lead in digital and self-service.
now, to switch gears, and tell to our quarterly results in which we reported a very strong metrics across the board. digital transformation, strong growth in the large enterprise market, analytics and ai and international are the key business pillars that are driving our success. first, the number of deals that included digital increased 41% in q2. cxone digital deal included seven digital acv deals with a very large financial services company, a well-known european based home improvement retailer and one of the largest digital broadband providers in the uk. they also included a large healthcare company, a well-known clothing retailer.
a state government agency, and a cloud-based agile software company among many others. many of these digital deals are being signed by large enterprises and almost all are competitive replacements of the incumbent legacy gen one providers that cannot meet the digital demand of today's consumers. and that brings me to our success in the large enterprise market in q2 where we saw an increase of 60% in seven-digit deals. moreover, we are witnessing an increasing quarterly trend where multiple cxone applications are being sold in each deal.
this is a testament to the seamless integration and the breadth and depth of our cxone systems as well as our strength and leadership in the large enterprise market. this competitive differentiation enables us to gather more revenue per seat and more total overall seats. a few examples of large enterprises deal included seven-digit acv cxone deal with one of the world's largest hotel chains, a digital payments company, and a large well-known health insurance company. we also included the large broadband provider, a business outsourcer, and an online marketplace for health insurance.
analytics and ai are key areas of strength at nice as they are injected into almost everything we do. in q2, for example, we signed multiple seven-digit deals to enlighten our market-leading ai solution. the deals including a leading lodging online market-based company and a provider of vehicle life cycle management software. analytics and ai are also driving accelerated growth in our financial crime and compliance business including three very large eight-digit deals. one deal with a very large insurance provider and two deals with very large financial institutions.
another key area i mentioned is international. we have continued to expand our global go-to-market through our partner ecosystem, as well as going to a local presence. and we're seeing the positive impact in our results as international bookings doubled in the quarter. in addition, the number of deals outside of the u.s. continued to rapidly go in number and size. for example, international deal included a seven-digit deal with an australian energy company and a seven-digit deal with a very large japanese telecom company. we signed seven-digit deals with a large european bank, a large u.k.-based insurance broker and one of the largest banks in germany. in summary, q2 was a very strong quarter on all fronts. we are now beginning to witness the impact of cloud revenue representing more than half of our business which is driving the acceleration of our total revenue growth.
our strong financial performance reflects the increasing leadership gaap between nice and our competitors. this widening gap is being driven by a solid execution in cloud and digital strengths at the high end of the market where we believe we are unmatched in our offering and domain expertise. and cxone, the most complete customer experience platform in the market today. we are excited for the continuing opportunities ahead of us. with only 10% of the market that has converted to cloud and digital, and self-service barely in the first innings of its transformation. as the clear leader in our industry, we believe we are by we believe we are by far in the best competitive position to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. thank you.
and i will now turn the call over to beth.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
thank you, barak and good day everyone. i am pleased to provide the analysis of our financial results and business performance for the second quarter of 2021 and provide our outlook for the third quarter and full year. our second quarter financial results were excellent with 16% year-over-year growth on the top-line, a 32% increase in cloud revenue and further improvement in the cloud gross margin which is a testament to the scalability and efficiency of our cloud business. total revenue for the second quarter reached a record of $459 million compared to $395 million in the same period of last year.
total revenue growth was again driven by impressive cloud revenue in which its relative share of our overall revenue continues to increase and stood at 54% of total revenue in q2 product revenue represented 10% of total revenue and services revenue represented the remaining 36% of total revenue. we exited the quarter with an annual cloud revenue run rate of more than $1 billion. our cloud business is expected to continue to thrive as we further penetrate the market, continue to add new logos and convert existing on-premise customers to the cloud in which the conversion typically results in a significant uplift in annual contract value.
our recurring revenue increased to 82% of total revenue in the quarter compared to 80% last year. our cloud revenue is primarily being driven by cxone in all segments of the market with market momentum shifting to digital and self-service. our new solutions, cxone expert and cxone smartreach, were both significant in winning some of the key large enterprise digital deals in the quarter. the americas region today is still our primary market, which represented 80% of total revenue in q2 and which grew 15% year-over-year. we are continuing to see more growth in the international market as we are driving further traction with our international partners. we reported very strong growth in emea, which represented 14% of our total revenue and grew 43% year-over-year. apac represented 6% of our total revenue in q2.
moving to our business unit breakdown. customer engagement revenues which represented 83% of our total revenue in q2, totaled $381 million for the second quarter, an 18% increase compared to the same quarter last year. in financial crime and compliance, revenues were $78 million for the second quarter, which was an increase of 9% from q2 last year and represented 17% of our total revenue. our gross profit year-over-year growth accelerated to a record 18%, totaling $332 million in the second quarter compared to $281 million for the second quarter of 2020. for the first time, cloud gross profit represented over 50% of our total gross profit.
gross margin increased to 72.2% compared to 71% in q2 last year. the increase in gross margin was mainly attributed to an increase of 200 basis points in the cloud gross margin, which reached a record 67.7% in q2.operating income increased by 16% year-over-year to $130 million compared to $111 in q2 2020. and operating margin was 28.2% like last year. earnings per share for the second quarter totaled $1.57, and increase of 15% compared to q2 last year. we experienced another strong quarter in operating cash flow which totaled $84 million in q2, an increase of 37% compared to last year. total cash and investments at the end of june 30, 2021 totaled $1,408,000. net of debt of $613 million, our net cash totaled $795 million. our strong cash flow generation and healthy balance sheet continue to provide us with the flexibility to capitalize on strategic acquisitions that are consistent with our digital growth strategy and capital allocation plans.
i will conclude my remarks with guidance. for the third quarter of 2021. we expect total revenue to be in the range of $460 million to $470 million. we expect the third quarter 2021 fully diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.51 to $1.61. for the full year 2021 we are increasing the range of our guidance for total revenue to be in the range of $1.835 billion to $1.855 billion. we are also increasing the range of our guidance for the full-year 2021 fully diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $6.26 to $6.46.
i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes from samad samana from jefferies. please go ahead.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my questions. it's great to see the cloud results. barak, maybe we'll kick it off the top and it feels like you've talked a lot more about digital and your efforts there this quarter. and i'm curious-if you think about the up-market success that you're seeing? how do you feel about digital as far as expanding maybe the average deal size as you attach that more and more frequently? and is that making larger enterprises accelerate their shift to the cloud?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yes, thanks for the question. so as i said in my earlier remarks, this shift or expansion actually that we see to digital is both what we view from our customers, as well as what we put as our strategy a couple of years ago. and we've been executing in the last few quarters both organically and through acquisition. first, i would say that we believe that the leadership in ccaas. if you remember, when we stepped into ccaas, we have converged ccaas, wem and analytics and became a leader with cxone with that. and today, we believe that the future is by converging that with digital, that's what we hear from our customers, that's what they want to see. in terms of the potential, it's enormous. if you think of ccaas and the way we think about it, its technology that is supporting and connecting consumers to contact center agents.
the beauty of digital and self-service that if it is done right, it can actually eliminate the need for the agents and a cost of an agent today is about $50,000 a year on average. it can get up to that level. so, in the industry, there are 15 million agents. and by the time -- we'll, when we get to a point that we can start reducing this number by moving into digital and self-service, you can easily calculate the potential of this market. needless to say that in order to do that, you need a full suite of the offering combining ccaas and full digital cx and i talked about the notion of organization wanting to see the next generation of digital cx versus the first-gen solutions. so, if you take all of that, what we see is that in those deals that i spoke about, it increases the volunteer for us quite dramatically and definitely at the high end of the market. and we believe that will continue to see the, trend as both the cloudification of our market together with digital cx are starting to accelerate.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then-just maybe as a follow-up, i have to ask there's obviously huge news in the industry with five9 and zoom announcing that their planned it to merge together. so i'm just curious on maybe what you think the-what the implications are for nice and what you see as an opportunity coming out of that potentially or how you think about nice's positioning in the market as a consequence?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yes, so first, i'll say one thing we can-one insight from this particular transaction is that we say what we said all the time that the potential in the customer engagement market is huge. usually, large players don't step and don't acquire into markets that do not have a big tam. i think that particular transaction-as well, as others represent the potential of the future tam, the current and the future tam of this market. so that's one more proof point to that. the second, if you'd like, lesson learned from that is that anyone that have the desire to organically build and develop into this market, it's too late. it's a highly complicated, feature-rich market that requires a lot of domain expertise. and in order to build and be competitive in this market, the only way for someone to get into this market is to buy into this market.
and there aren't too many players in this market and actually, five nine were not a leader and the gartner mq and them being taken out by a video collaboration or video collaboration player is actually good news for us. the last one, going back to what i said on the call, we believe that in order to win the customer engagement market, the direction and the need from customers is to offer full digital cx offering that includes ccaas, workforce engagement, analytics and ai digital and self-service. that's what we were building in the last 18 months and this is where we see the success today. in this particular transaction i don't think zoom is giving a size in any of those assets. i don't see how it solved their problem. so quite frankly we're happy with the upcoming disruption to them and we believe we have a very solid position both with our offering as well as many other partners that we have. and we do great business together.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great, and then maybe just one for you beth and then i'll turn it over. just the cloud revenue was really impressive, staying well above 30% even as the comps got tougher. can you maybe just-i know get total revenue guidance, can you maybe just help us understand in shorter term how we should think about the linearity of cloud revenue growth. i know the company is given longer term guidance, but just i sure thing about the short-term cloud revenue growth trends?
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
yes, thanks for the question samad. so, as you've seen we've been consistently delivering a really healthy growth in our cloud business. looking on the first half of the year gave us confidence obviously on the visibility in line of sight looking forward. we remain really optimistic in a good place so with respect to cloud revenue looking forward. and as you know we don't give specific guidance with respect to our cloud. but i can reiterate what we've shared already in the past which is that if you look over the next few years we're confident that you know we'll see a 25% growth or higher. and in the current year we're comfortable that we'll be in excessive of the 25% growth.
operator
our next question comes from pat walravens from jmp securities. please go ahead.
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
thank you, and congratulations. hey, barak, back to this sort of the-how the industry is changing question. i think i have sort of a two-part question. part one is how important is it to have the call center software riding directly on top of the global communications infrastructure, so that would be the idea i guess, with five9 and zoom? and then people say that's also part of the appeal of talkdesk riding on top of twilio. so, i'd love to hear your thoughts on that theme and whether that's really important or not and then also your thoughts on talkdesk competitively?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
so, thanks for the question. most of our deals are not driven or combined with a unified communication, and for sure not with video collaboration. we haven't seen any traction with that. it's a different buyer between video collaboration and ccaas. the other thing that we're seeing and i've talked about it a lot in past quarters is that while there is some of that behavior in the lower end of the market.
if you go up market, these are usually decisions that are taken separately. and also, the fact that in the higher-end markets, the needs from customers is much more about the expanding from ccaas to a full digital cx offering with everything that i've mentioned before. it's a very feature-rich offering, very complicated, if you would like, sales cycle in that regard not because the sales cycle is complicated, because the type of transformation customers are looking for is significant. so, we don't seek too much of that and especially not to the higher end of the market. specifically about i think, you asked about talkdesk, right?
pat walravens -- jmp securities -- analyst
right.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
we don't see them a lot. i think they are competing more at the lower end of the market. they are a much more smaller player as far as we know. they are a private company so we don't know for sure. but they are-we don't-they are not a leader in our market and it's one more competitor in the market that we see. the electing of course of all of the things we have done both organically into a position and completeness, if you'd like, of the suite.
operator
our next question comes from tavy rosner from barclays. please go ahead.
tavy rosner -- barclays -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. i just want to speak a little bit about the transition to the cloud. so, i guess the first part of the question would be, if you can get a sense of, you know, what proportion of new revenues coming up from existing customer transitioning to the cloud as opposed to new logos?
and i guess as a full on-i'm assuming that nice sells a proportion kind of your entire customer base and try to convert them from on-prem to cxone and i guess, do you ever get push-back from customers saying, you know listen, we are happy with our on-prem solution, it's working. no need for cxone, at least no need in the near future. i'm just curious-sorry, just curious to get your perspective.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
sure. if you remember at my opening remarks, i talked about what i believe is the quite unique in our cloudification story for the company and we're not just a company that takes it's customer base and converting it to the cloud and basically reclassing the-doing the reclassification of its revenue. our cloud transformation and you've seen it in the last few years and you continue to see it in a more pronounced way in the last few quarters is derived by two separate dynamics. first of all is us stepping into a market, the ccaas market and now the full digital cx market with new cloud solutions with the cxone platform that we did not previously offer in the on-premise. so for us it's a complete upside just new business not converting any existing revenue that we have.
and that tap in to your question, that is the predominant the larger parts and the larger share of both of the revenue as well as the new business. it means that there is still a pretty long runway for us to continue to do that and at the same time to start and accelerating the conversion of the existing customer base that we have that are still on-prem. and by the way, when we do that in most cases we see a major uplift because a, even for like-for-like the annual revenue run rate from such customers will at least double, but if we managed to sell the full cxone suite, which is the case in many situation, the multiple is much more than just doubling.
and to the last part of your question, whether we get a push back from customers. so i will say that today for most customers the question of, you know if they're going to move to the cloud is no longer on the table. it's mainly about the sequence and when and how and we'll find ourself as a leader in the market in many cases, not just as a vendor but as a consultant to our customers and we have a lot of customers at the higher end of the market that see us as a trusted advisor and many of those large customers for a variety of reasons. are doing it in a moderate way.
i think that the last thing i will say that the beauty of that as we are expanding the offering that we have in cxone and a customer can have it all installed in one set of solution or different set of solutions. we see a lot of customers that have some initial concerns as you hinted at the beginning actually starting with some part of cxone. they are starting just with digital or they will start with just with analytics and they gain confident and then they expand from that. so we see in the last few quarters, a lot of those beachheads in multiple accounts which we believe, create for us a very strong expansion opportunities in the future.
operator
our next question comes from rishi jaluria at da davidson. please go ahead.
rishi jaluria -- rbc -- analyst
this is actually rishi jaluria from rbc. thanks for taking my questions. first i wanted to go back to the question on ccaas and ucaas that tavy had brought up. i know you partner with some of the ucaas vendors out there that white label cxone. so are there, i guess, some evidence of having the same buying center for ucaas and ccaas, but maybe can you talk a little bit philosophically, do you not see any convergence of this over time as the partnership, the right strategy or what would need to happen in the market for you to consider having your own ucaas solution? and then i've got a follow-up.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
first of all, we have registered a lot of partnerships in variety parts of our ecosystem. ucaas is one of them and we have one with ringcentral and few others than we are very, very happy with these partnerships. it gives us great expansion to our go-to-market and it's also allowing us to focusing on being leaders in ccaas and someone like ring to be a leader in ucaas and video collaboration and both companies are doing extremely well and will continue of course to do that. at the same time, we think that the right investments for us is not to go in that direction and definitely not into video collaboration, but rather to do what the customers wants from us and this is to expand ccaas to the full offering and expanding into digital.
i spoke about the opportunity before, that's what we've been doing in the last 18 months. i think that players that could not execute in that strategy, had to sell themselves and being taking out from the market and this is the right investments for the long run. that's what our customers need. this is what consumer preferences are in the customer service and customer engagement market. and this is probably the right use for our time both organically and also to the right acquisition strategy for us.
rishi jaluria -- rbc -- analyst
okay. great that's helpful. and then i just wanted to maybe drill down on the fcc side of the cloud business, can you talk a little bit about what sort of momentum or traction you're seeing on the cloud side there both with migration's as well as new customers? thanks.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
sure. so as you've heard both from myself and beth earlier, we're very happy with what we are seeing with the financial crime and compliance business. i spoke specifically by the way about the three very large eight-digit deals for this business. one of them is the largest in the history of the financial crime and compliance division or business, so we're very happy with the momentum that we see there. and what we're starting to see in this business that is historically a very on-premise business, we are starting to see a shift to the cloud.
we have yet to see it in the revenue, but we definitely see it in the booking. and it's divided into two parts of the market. one part of the market is the mid-market following the acquisition of guardian analytics, we now have the platform called xceed is 100% cloud. for us, it's a pure upside because we did not have the right product nor the go-to-market to go after the mid-market, and that's exactly what we are doing these days with xceed. so that's one area of cloud growth for financial crime and compliance. and the rest of the business is just now starting its cloudification process, and we are starting to see that dynamic moving there. it is behind if you would like, versus the customer engagement business, behind meaning in its evolution to the cloud. but i would say it's where customer engagement was four years ago in terms of its cloudification cycle.
but we are starting to see the acceleration and we are ready for that. and more and more customers are asking about it. and it's a great opportunity. and we also see them there in this business it's a great opportunity and we also see them there in this business, the ability to accelerate the business with the similar multiple i talked about in terms of the conversion from on-prem to cloud.

our next question comes from meta marshall from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
dave nwokonko -- morgan stanley -- analyst
this is dave nwokonko on for meta marshall. so two questions from our end and thank you for the questions. first, as larger customers start down the cloud transformation path, what are you seeing as far as what will be the biggest hurdles to getting them to transition, whether that be security, complexity, scope of how to think about digital transformation? and second, as you-do you think you can maintain 25% cloud growth rate targets without larger customers really making a more meaningful move toward cloud? so in other words, can current channel support that growth? thank you.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
sure. so let me-i'll start with the first question the two obviously are connected. so you ask about what is the hurdle of cloud customers to move to shift to the cloud and you also ask about in the context of digital transformation. so my answer to that, i'm being asked this question numerous times in the last few years and it keeps evolving. a few years ago, you're right. it was about concerns about the cloud and the security and latency and ownership and things like that. those disappeared. and we find ourselves less and less facing customers that don't want to move to the cloud or they have other reasons. and needless to say that in order for those customers to move to the cloud they need to gain trust in all the standard security, privacy and so on and so forth. and we support all of that as the market leader.
but all of them i believe, understand all large enterprises that unless you move to a real cloud solution and native cloud solution, you don't gain the real benefit of the cloud, which is actually not even the economics and other thing. it's about the pace of innovation. and we actually see a wave of large enterprises that thought they have moved to the cloud and they basically went to the legacy provider and the legacy provider sold them a hosted ""solution"" which is called the cloud solution. and they didn't gain all of those benefits i've talked about including the pace of innovation, etc. and there is a better realization of these large enterprises that the real cloud solution is only cloud solution that is natively built on a public cloud, full feature rich, very fast cycles of innovation, and of course all the different security features and capabilities.
so i think those hurdles are starting to disappear very, very fast. and the biggest hurdle for them today is mainly about managing the transition, justifying the economics in terms of past depreciations and things like that. and we support customers in that move. and that brings me to the second part of your question, how confident can we sustain and can we meet this at least 25% cloud growth in the next few years without the large enterprises. so i would say that large enterprises needless to say, are part of the equation of how we get to that. we see it happening. we don't believe there is a reason for large enterprises all of a sudden to stop a cloud adoption on the contrary, we think that post-covid, it accelerated the realization of that need. so, we don't have that type of concern.
operator
our next question comes from tim horan from oppenheimer. please go ahead.
tim horan -- oppenheimer -- analyst
thanks a lot, guys. there seems to be a lot of terrible products out there for digital interaction at this point. it seems like a lot of companies have the product. but-however, my experience has not been good anyway. can you talk maybe a little bit about what percentage of the market you think has more of a cloud-based digital interaction? and maybe just a little bit about what you think your flow share is or market share on an incremental basis is in this market. thanks.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yes, it's a good view of the observation team. there is a lot of noise in what is digital, and let me try and help to create some clarity over here. so, if you think about the enterprise market, all enterprises or most enterprises already have some capability or a technology, or a solution to serve customers and consumers through digital channels. whether that will be an email, or chat, or synchronize channels and so on and so forth. but needless to say, we are all consumers. we are not very happy with the experience. i keep saying the type of experience we should get from our providers is the same as we have as we communicate with our friends and family. and from all the reasons, we don't get it today.
the reason for that is that those joint gen one type of digital solutions that were adopted actually many years ago and still being adopted here and there is the dell solution, they look at each channel differently. they don't have the breadth and depth and connectivity among the different channels. they don't connect well to the contact center. and while they might have some functionality of both, it's a very point solution that is address this thing in a very narrow way. what we have done after understanding the need from our customers in the last 18, 24 months, we have expanded cxone by making several technological acquisitions, as well as massive investment in r&d in that area to have the full capabilities on the one native platform, which is a cxone, which allows you to do exactly that to get the same experience you get with your friends and family with your service providers.
and the secret sauce, if you would like over here is not just the capabilities, it's also the data. we have two decades of cx data that we mastered as well as the domain expertise. and this data is actually feeding the self-service, which is kind of the basics of digital. and that's what makes self-service works. there is an enormous amount of data that we have that enable us to train the self-service and to make digital work. that's a big difference. and this is what we see today where we interact with customers with large enterprises when we approach the start we have built, they actually understand, this is exactly what they were looking for, what they are missing in the legacy of the gen one solutions. and an evidence for that is, as we said, 41% of the deals in q1 had all or some of our digital capabilities.
tim horan -- oppenheimer -- analyst
so, it's an pretty incredible accomplishment, these products that you've kind of created. do you think anyone is close to the features and functionality that you have at this point?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
it's a highly fragmented market. and i'm separating here on purpose between capabilities and the data and domain expertise. you might find players there that might have the capabilities, but do not have either the distribution capability or the connectivity to something like cxone or they don't have the data which as i've mentioned it's something that we have. thanks to being actually three decades in the customer engagement business. and it's a very significant differentiation that we believe that will serve as well as we can continue to progress into digital cx.

daniel bartus -- bank of america -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. i wanted to ask first about the financial crime and compliance business just at a high level. what is the benefit of having this along with the customer engagement business? and should you begin to separate these more or are they already pretty separated?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
so we have these two businesses in the company. we're very, very familiar as an executive team with both businesses. and one of the greatest benefits we have mentioned, two among others, is that if you think about what i describe in the last three years and the evolution and the journey and how we transformed the customer engagement business, it's actually very similar to what we're doing, what we have done and what we are going to do in the financial crime and compliance business, it's the cloudification.
this business has a ton of opportunity given digital banking and the digital disruption in financial services, and the whole notion of ai analytics. so, we are sharing a lot of the platform which allows us to accelerate quite nicely. actually, the fundamental of cxone are helping us a lot with x-sight and that's one great thing. the second thing is that while the customer engagement business is not just for financial services.
we are very strong in the financial services vertical within customer engagement. and with many of the large banks, they enjoy very much to have one vendor provide both in terms of relationships and the brand. and lastly, there are multiple use cases where information in the contact center is being used in our platform to improve the detection of a fraud and providing some unique capabilities that many other fraud or anti-fraud, provider do not have.
daniel bartus -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for entertaining that, barak. and then, maybe just a quick clarification for beth, i think the guidance for the full year implies 11.5% growth this year. and i keep hearing the language of you guys expect to accelerate that going forward. so, is it right to assume 12% or more growth for 2022 and 2023, or am i-am i reading into this a little too much? thanks.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
yes, thank you for the question. so, you're correct that we've just recently revised and increased our full-year guidance with 11% growth expected at the midpoint of our guidance for 2021. and of course, given the health that we've seen in our cloud business this year and in prior years as well as well as really the increasing kind of predictability and visibility we have on a go-forward basis.
that combined with the mix that we're seeing changing to become more and more cloud centric with cloud actually reaching a high this quarter of 54% of our total revenue. we expect to see those trends continue. and so in short that means yes. as we look on the annual growth of our total revenue we do expect that to be something we see annually in the future as well that that top line growth for total revenue will continue to accelerate.
operator
our next question comes from tyler radke from citi. please go ahead.
tyler radke -- citi -- analyst
i wanted to start with just a higher level question just as you think about kind of the return to a lot of these call centers getting back in person. do you think that's a catalyst for accelerating investments, obviously-the trends around the hybrid workforce in remote work were strengthened in many ways in looking at the call center solutions? but just kind of curious as things reopen up in years where you've seen that-if you've seen that play out as a catalyst as people kind of go back to full in-person?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yes it's a great question and it's a kind of-it continues to evolve but remind you that march of last year where all of those contact centers virtually overnight had to move, actually move virtual to work from home. we're talking about 15 million people that almost together went to work from home and not from the offices. and that was the first kind of shock for a lot of those contact centers realizing that actually it's very hard for them to enable it. if they don't have the agility and the solution like cloud, etc which accelerated, as we know, the shift of this adoption. so that was the first part. and since then we've been seeing a lot of those organizations, indeed, accelerating understanding that they need to be more flexible in the future because there is a lot of uncertainty whether it will be a full comeback to the offices or kind sort of the hybrid.
so it started with the basic of the ability to work from anywhere. but then if you have your employees work from anywhere and starting to raise other thing that requires our technology, how do you monitor the experience, how do you monitor the cost, how do you allow more agility and flexibility to the work for especially the younger generation. so it allows us to expand quite significantly our offering to many of our customers and support them with that need. from this point on the type of conversation with our customers, it's exactly as you suggested.
it's about supporting full hybrid. and at the same time having more analytical capabilities in order to monitor the level of experience and how this move between back and forth from office to home is working. and needless to say, cloud, so it's accelerating all the above and we believe this is here to stay regardless of how long the coverage will stay with us. hopefully, not for long for covid, but it's basically accelerated things we felt will happen in few years down the road and they're happening now.
tyler radke -- citi -- analyst
and if i could ask a follow-up for beth and apologies if you covered this in detail i've been popping around a few earnings calls this morning, but just wanted to unpack the second half guidance a little bit. it looked like a pretty strong raise across the board, but just trying to see if that raise was mainly coming from cloud and any type of further breakout you should give us, how to think about kind of the moving pieces in revenue that are implied in your outlook?
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
yes, sure thanks for the question. i think i've talked to-about it a little bit but i'm happy just to kind of emphasize again. i think looking on the second half of the year comes on the back of a really strong performance this quarter. and of course, a strong performance in the first half generally, that gives us greater visibility looking forward into the second half of the year as well. we've seen growth rates both on top and bottom line in the teens in both q1 and q2 of this year.
and given kind of the strong level of confidence we have, we're increasing the midpoint of our revenue to by $35 million in terms of the total revenue guidance for the year. and so, we feel really positive and that we've set great healthy targets for the full year that are both in the teens with midpoints around 11%. and of course, the revenue is mostly continuing to come from the confidence and the health we've seen of our cloud business and specifically cxone is a continued driver in that growth.

i will now turn the call over to barak.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you, marty and welcome everyone. we are pleased to report a banner quarter with q3 total revenue just shy of $0.5 billion for the first time in our company's history. the quarter was characterized by continued accelerated growth across the board, underscored by 20% total revenue growth and 29% growth in the cloud. these strong q3 results reflect the uplift we are receiving from being at the center of four key dynamics that are taking place in our industry, cloud, digital, ai and the shift to platforms.
specialized applications natively built in the cloud at scale are now taking a central role in organization's transformations to cloud technology. cxone has become the premier native cloud specialized platform for customer experience. we built cxone with the world's largest and most comprehensive customer engagement set of solutions. we are, for the first time, ever in this industry fulfilling cx needs that for decades could not be achieved with the old paradigm of disjointed on-premise and non-cloud native solutions.
over the past year, we have added a dozen new native cxone solutions to our portfolio with hundreds of new features. we now have over 725,000 agents in 100 countries using cxone making us by far the clear market leader. in our go-to-market, we have added 27 new partners so far this year and have expanded cxone internationally, which i'll talk about later. consumers exponential adoption of digital is far outpacing organization's slow linear digital evolution. this is the root cause of the rapidly growing friction between consumers and service. linear evolution will never catch up to exponential growth. our digital strategy has one goal, to be the next-generation engine allowing organizations to radically shift from slow digital evolution and leapfrog ahead of the digital consumers.
2021 is a seminal year in our execution on this strategy, catapulting cxone to the center of the digital arena. we are already seeing tremendous success and expansion with our digital-first approach with cxone. in q3, digital revenues grew 78%. the number of cross-sell digital deals grew 34% and the number of first-time digital-only deals grew sevenfold. even after decades of investment in productivity, process optimization and automation tools, 87% of spend in the cx market is still attributed to labor. artificial intelligence fused with high-quality cx data is finally starting to [indecipherable] the axiom that only investment in incremental manpower can deliver a great customer service.
cxone with its massive cx data repository is taking giant steps toward becoming the ultimate cx ai hub as organizations shift to automated smart cx with unprecedented return on investments. data and ai served that the catalyst to cxone rapid win rate and expansion in q3. this is reflected in the very strong momentum we continue to see with enlighten, which is the ai brand and the core of cxone that is embedded across our entire platform. in q3, ai drove further demand for enlighten as the number of enlighten deals tripled in the quarter compared to last year.
platforms are the only viable way to master complexity at scale. they are the ultimate glue between technology and processes for organizations. our goal with cxone as a platform is to master the extreme complexity at scale for the cx market. there are no shortcuts in reaching this goal. the only way to achieve it is with a complete fully unified and open suites. cxone to date has more than 4,000 development many years [phonetic] and decades of domain expertise invested toward this goal. we are the only player in the cx market that possesses all the assets natively built into one platform. in fact, seven out of 10 organization adopting cxone today are retiring three or more separate software solutions. these forward dynamics, cloud, digital, ai and platform, provides tremendous long-term growth opportunities, and we continue to strategically double down on them.
let me now turn to q3, where we continue to outperform our 2021 plan by expanding upmarket to the enterprise, expanding to international markets, expanding our reach through partnerships and expanding our leadership in digital. our decade long expertise and go-to-market experience of large enterprises, which we define as organizations with at least 750 agents, is reflected in the great success we are having in the high end of the market with cxone. overall, cxone new bookings in q3 grew 100% year-over-year and the number of seven digits and above deals grew at 46% in q3 versus last year. one example was an eight-digit acv deal with one of the largest retail brokerage in the world. this customer, which was with an on-premise incumbent for many years, evaluated the cloud solution of the incumbent in selected cxone for its overall superiority, its seamless integration, and the breadth and depth of the platform.
another large signing for cxone included a seven-digit acv deal with a major interactive gaming company as the incumbent provider was unable to support the needs. taking into account the large seasonality shift in the business, they needed a platform that was highly flexible and elastic. we also signed a seven-digit acv deal with a very large federal government agency.
other large deals for the quarter at the high end of the market included an eight-digit deal with an existing customer, a very large financial services organization that added multiple new solutions. we signed a seven-digit deal with one of the largest airlines in the world. the airline is now able to apply sophisticated analytics to 100% of their interaction volume, up from 10% to effectively understand the interactions with their customers. other seven-digit deals with large enterprises focus on modernizing their cx platforms, including a well-known provider of human capital management solutions and a very large pharmacy company.
another growth vector in our 2021 execution plan is international, where we see tremendous opportunities as many organizations are beginning to adopt cloud and digital at faster pace. in q3, the number of new international cx logos as well as international bookings of cxone grew 48% compared to the same period last year, driven by major expansion with our international channel partners. international deals for cxone included a well-known canadian-based logistics and shipping company, which was a competitive replacement. the company's focus on cloud and digital transformation to help make interactions with their customers seamless and with the support of self-service. other large international cxone deals included a major university located in the apac region allows brazilian-based bank and allows suppliers of industrial products based in australia.
two years of rapid innovation, combined with key strategic acquisitions in digital and ai, has significantly widened the gap in our competitive differentiation in 2021 and significantly increased our win rates in q3. our success in digital and ai has two main drivers. the first is organization who choose to move from legacy omnichannel solution to our next-gen digital cx platform. in these cases, we are experiencing a doubling of the acv with the adoption of digital.
a few of these examples included is a us-based bpo, an international insurance broker, a financial services organization specialized in retirement planning, a well-known vitamin and herb company, a beauty care products company, and several others.
the second driver is a transition to ai-powered self-service as organizations realize that this is the only way to address the need of their digital consumers. some of the q3 deals include a large waste management company, a well-known healthcare company and a large energy infrastructure company. the exact same dynamics i discussed earlier, cloud, digital, ai and the shift to platforms are fueling the accelerated growth in our financial crime and compliance segment as evidenced by the year-over-year 21% revenue growth in q3.
we signed an eight-digit deal with a very large german bank, which selected nice due to the scalability of the solution and breadth of functionality. in a seven-digit deal with a large european bank, they purchased a portfolio of our solutions to modernize their financial crime and compliance platform in a fast-evolving digital environment. other large seven-digit deals included a major bank based in the uk, one of the largest us insurance companies and two of the world's largest banks.
in summary, we have taken a central role and are leading the market in shaping the four dynamics taking place in cx, cloud, digital, ai and the shift to platforms. up until a few quarters ago, nice was a single-digit total revenue growth company executing on its transition to the cloud. 2021 clearly reflects the dramatic change in our financial profile as we have quickly shifted to a company that is now growing its total annual revenue in double-digits, delivering fast growth in the cloud with a run rate of over $1 billion and demonstrating consistent profitability of nearly 30%. with the tremendous opportunities ahead of us and our commitment to continued solid execution, we believe that the shift that we've seen in 2021 is paving the way for continued success and expanded market leadership.
thank you. and i will turn it over to beth.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
thank you, barak. and good day, everyone. i'm pleased to provide the analysis of our financial results and business performance for the third quarter of 2021 and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. our third quarter financial results were excellent, with 20% year-over-year growth in total revenue, which marks the third consecutive quarter that we reported year-over-year accelerated growth.
total revenue for the third quarter reached a record of $494 million compared to $412 million in the same period of last year. our financial performance in the quarter was reflective of the strong execution that we demonstrated across multiple fronts. we delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in both cloud and products, all three regions that we operate in and in both our business segments.
the q3 top line was driven by another strong quarter in the cloud with 29% year-over-year growth, coupled with an outstanding performance in our product revenue, which grew 73% year-over-year. cloud revenue contributed $262 million and represented 53% of our total revenue. services revenue totaled $164 million and contributed 33%, and the remaining $67 million, or 14% was product revenue.
our sequential cloud growth of 7% demonstrates the continued momentum and strength of our cloud business. we are, by far, the largest cloud provider in our industry with an annual cloud revenue run rate of more than $1 billion. our success in the cloud is primarily being driven by our main growth engine, cxone, thanks to the continued effective execution of our expansion plan in international, large enterprises, partnerships and digital, as well as leveraging the breadth and depth of our platform with cross-sell opportunities.
in q3, we recorded impressive revenue growth across all geographies. the americas region, which represented 82% of total revenue, grew 19% year-over-year. our strong international go-to-market presence and expansion with partners is contributing to our strong growth globally. the emea market grew 30% year-over-year and represented 12% of our total revenue. apac grew 14% year-over-year and represented the remaining 6%.
moving to our business unit breakdown, customer engagement revenues, which represented 82% of our total revenue in q3, totaled $403 million, a 20% increase compared to the same quarter last year. our continued top line growth in customer engagement is a result of our ongoing success with cxone. revenues from financial crime and compliance, which represented 18% of our total revenue in q3, totaled $91 million for the third quarter, which was a record increase of 21% year-over-year.
the growth in the quarter was reflective of growing cloud revenue contribution from our cloud platform x-sight and xceed, as well as strong product growth. while focusing on penetrating the market and driving top line growth, we continue to exhibit strong profitability and the generation of very healthy cash flow from our operations. our gross profit accelerated to a record $358 million in the third quarter compared to $293 million for the third quarter of 2020.
gross margin increased to 72.3% compared to 71% in q3 last year. the increase in gross margin was mainly attributed to an increase of 154 basis points in the cloud gross margin. we expect ongoing gradual improvements in our cloud gross margin as our cloud revenues continue to deliver strong growth, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our longer-term goal of a 70% or higher cloud gross margin. our expanding margin is being driven by new cloud revenue streams as we are successfully establishing beachheads with new and existing customers, witnessing increasing software attach rates and driving cross-sell opportunities, while gaining efficiency and scalability on the cost side.
in q3, operating income increased by 20% year-over-year to $140 million compared to $117 million in q3 2020, and operating margin was 28.3%, like last year. earnings per share for the third quarter totaled $1.68, an increase of 19% compared to q3 last year.
we experienced another strong quarter in operating cash flow, which totaled $104 million in q3. total cash and investments at the end of september totaled $1.456 billion. net of debt of $607 million, our net cash totaled $848 million. our strong cash flow generation and healthy balance sheet continue to allow us to capitalize on synergistic strategic acquisitions that are consistent with our digital growth strategy and capital allocation plans.
i will conclude my remarks with guidance. we are raising our full-year 2021 guidance for both total revenue and eps. for the full-year 2021, we now expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.899 billion to $1.909 billion. this implies that q4 2021 total revenue is expected to grow between 11% and 14% year-over-year. for the full-year 2021, we now expect fully diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $6.43 to $6.53.
i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. at this time, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from samad samana with jefferies. please proceed.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
hi. good morning. congrats on strong results. barak, i wanted to clarify i thought i heard you said that cxone bookings were up 100% year-over-year. that's a really big number. so first i just want to make sure i heard correctly and it's true. can you maybe just help us understand what's driving that strong bookings performance even as we move well beyond some of the pandemic tailwinds that the company benefited from last year.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
sure. thanks. thanks, samad. so yes, you've heard correctly. booking of cxone in the quarter -- new bookings of cxone in the quarter grew 100% year-over-year. it was really a phenomenal booking, and this is following also the last few quarters of very strong bookings across the board and also with cxone as we commented on previous calls. the drivers are all the above.
everything i mentioned in my earlier remarks, the adoption and the win rates we're experiencing at the higher end of the market. i mentioned some of those deals, and the list is too long to read on the script. the expansion into international, the fast adoption of digital, which i've mentioned that when we add digital into cxone, it doubles the acv and sometimes even more than that. and overall, additional expansions that we see from existing customers.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. that's very impressive. and then maybe sticking in that theme. the digital revenue, as you mentioned, grew almost double the rate that overall cloud revenue is growing. how should we maybe think about digital revenue going forward? and how durable is that robust growth that you're seeing on the digital side specifically.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
we believe that digital is still is in very early innings from a variety of reasons. digital is not new as a concept, right? most organizations do have some form of digital, but it's solutions and siloed solutions that belong to previous generation. as i mentioned in my earlier remarks, we all see it. we are all consumers, and we are ourselves as consumers adopting digital in an exponential growth that you would like. an organization that are trying to fight it in a linear evolution will never manage to catch up. so, there is no understanding as we meet with a lot of customers that are just trying to patch or to add kind of spot or ad hoc solutions and point solution is not going to apply for them.
what we offer in digital is the combination of data, digital and ai that comes together. and that's a real major difference. the big thing about digital is how do you adopt digital, giving consumers the right experience and without inflating your manpower. and it can only be done with the right digital technology, the massive amount of data that we have in our platform, and of course, the right ai algorithms. so, we believe the sky is the limit for the potential in digital, and it's just the early days. so it's not a specific number, but it's really in early days.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
very helpful. and then, beth, i can't not ask you a question. it wouldn't be a next earnings call without one for me for you. so just as i think about r&d expense, it jumped pretty significantly and i know the company is investing behind that. maybe just how should we think about the shape of expenses and investments going forward, especially as the company ramps the international side? just maybe give some context around that.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks for the question. when you look on our r&d for the quarter and generally, our appetite for investing back, we see this really strong growth in the top line and we're being fueled by predominantly cxone. and of course, we are going to continue to fuel that investment and that's what you've seen in the quarter. at the same time, as a company, we've always maintained our philosophy on having a balanced approach.
we've provided a benchmark of expectation for a 30% operating margin in the future and that doesn't change. so it's a combination of a balanced approach to investing back in, but at the same time, continuing to drive the increasing profitability. and if you look on our current year as an example, you'll see we have growth in the teens, both in our revenue as well as in our operating income.
samad samana -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my questions. congrats on all the success.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
thank you.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
thank you, samad.
operator
our next question comes from rishi jaluria with rbc. please proceed.
rishi jaluria -- rbc -- analyst
wonderful. thanks. and then great to see overall growth accelerate to 20%. i don't think any of us were expecting that. so really great to see. i had two questions. first, on the international traction you're seeing, maybe a housekeeping. can you help us understand conception when you talk about international momentum and especially on the cxone side? is this happening with internationally based customers? is this happening with existing us customers that have big overseas presence? and alongside that, you talked about cxone doing really well internationally. are you starting to see an inflection point in cloud appetite overseas? and then just alongside that, i have another housekeeping. any fx impact on the quarter? and then i have a follow-up.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
sure. so, i'll start on the international. so it's not the first quarter that we see internationally. in the last few quarters, we gave you some color about the momentum we see in international. i think now you also see not just in the leading indicator like the booking, you start to see it happening also in the revenue as reflected in both emea and apac this quarter. and the answer is yes to the question. yes, we see a rapid growth in an accelerated adoption in all the things that we are also seeing in the us market and saw in the us market in the past. it's very similar dynamics.
we invested heavily in the past two years in our international expansion. we had a footprint before. we are not new to international markets, but we have added a lot of capacity, both in terms of the adaptation of the platform, the people, the go-to-market, the support, the services, the language, the localization, if you would like. and now we're seeing this tremendous success and growth. with respect -- so these are not just expansions of existing us-based customers going overseas. this is -- i gave you an example of that, companies that are headquartered internationally, both in apac and emea, latin america. of course, us companies also have multinational presence, but those we count actually under our us numbers. and with respect to the fx numbers, i'll hand it over to beth.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
and with respect to the fx numbers, i'll hand it over to beth.
rishi jaluria -- rbc -- analyst
okay. thanks. and then beth, just drilling into cloud gross margins. it looks like it ticked down about 60 points. sequentially. anything to call out there that led to that? was that mix of software versus network connectivity or something else there? and more importantly, how should we be just thinking about that line going forward thanks.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
yeah. we had nice growth year-over-year with about 154 basis point pickup year-over-year. what you're referring to is the sequential movement between quarters on the cloud gross margin. and of course, you're going to see some variability from quarter-to-quarter. we are expanding internationally and increasing our footprint internationally with -- comes with certain costs.
we're also starting to see the other parts of our business like financial crime and compliance, as well as public safety start to expand more. and of course, they're not at the same scale as the cxone business. so, you'll see that come into play a little bit and see some variability from quarter-to-quarter. but keep in mind, if you look at our cloud gross margin expansion over the last few years, it has been really significant. we've seen some great expansion, and we expect to continue to see that expansion over time. so, we don't focus really on the quarter-to-quarter movements. we're looking at the long-term growth. and on a longer-term growth and profitability perspective, we expect to see that cloud gross margin continue to expand. and it's coming as we go up into the larger enterprise, of course, we have higher attach rates.
so, our customers there have complex organizations, are buying more of the offerings we have on the cxone platform, for example, and that drives and expands the cloud gross margin. so that along with just the continued expansion and scale of our cloud business, we'll continue to grow the cloud gross margin. so, again, don't focus so much on the short-term quarter-to-quarter change. but long term, we still remain confident in the 70% cloud gross margin and higher than we've talked about in the past.
rishi jaluria -- rbc -- analyst
all right. wonderful. thank you so much.
operator
our next question comes from tyler radke with citi. please proceed.
tyler radke -- citigroup -- analyst
hey. good morning, barak. thanks for taking my question. wanted to just go back to the 100% plus bookings growth in cxone. obviously, really impressive and especially considering cxone is the primary driver for the cloud business. so, i just wanted to understand a little bit on that number. was there any type of duration tailwind that kind of elevated that number? and i'm just trying to understand how that growth rate, which clearly is above -- well above the cloud revenue growth rate should kind of impact that revenue growth rate going forward or if there's just anything unusual to call out from a duration perspective?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
needless to say, we are very happy with the performances of the cloud and the booking of cxone. and we also monitor the pipeline and the pipeline moving forward seems to be very robust. it doesn't change our overall outlook. as we stated before, we believe that overall cloud are scale of north of $1 billion for cloud. we expect it to continue and be for the next few years 25% or higher.
as we step into next year, we'll look in the -- on all the backlog that we have on cloud and decide how to specifically modify or change or keep the outlook. but overall, what impact this number is obviously very large enterprises that are tapping into cxone. and if you think about large enterprises, unlike small companies, it takes longer time to convert the actual booking to the full ramp-up of the revenue.
but on the flip side of it, when they are fully on board on cxone, the expectation of retention is much, much longer. it's a very sticky, highly integrated to a lot of information. so, we are building the business correctly for the long run, thinking about it strategically, and that's the way we think about it. we wanted to, of course, provide you with this important anecdote of the booking for the quarter.
tyler radke -- citigroup -- analyst
thanks. and beth, if i could ask a follow-up just on the q4 revenue guidance. looks like that's coming in 4% or 5% above the street and kind of what was implied in the prior guide. how are you just thinking about the relative drivers of cloud versus products in that number? it looks like you do have a pretty easy comp on the product side and obviously, you saw lots of product strength this quarter. so just curious how you are seeing kind of the composition of the deals evolve in the pipeline for q4? thank you.
beth gaspich -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks for the question. and as you said, we are implying a higher growth than where we were last quarter in terms of q4 looking at growth in the teens. if you compare that to quarters past, of course, we were typically in single-digits. so it is implying a strong growth. if you look at q4 in particular, we see that on the product side, again, we had somewhat lower levels of comparison last year. and so that comes into play for q4, but we do expect that is factored in on the product front, along with continued momentum that we are seeing in the cloud. so it's a combination of our confidence in both for the quarter.

our next question comes from tim horan with oppenheimer. please proceed.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
thanks, guys. great quarter. can you talk about what the main bottleneck is for enterprises adopting digital? and is there something that's going to change that bottleneck? like is cloud adoption at a point where we can really see an acceleration at this point? or are there other issues that are preventing adoption?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
yeah. great question. as we have discussions with many of our customers and prospects with respect to digital, everyone are trying something, right? they have, as i said, some legacy digital solutions in place that are very siloed, are not well connected to each other and kind of behind the consumers' expectations. so many of them have tried different point solutions from small and bigger players. and there is generally kind of a feeling of disappointment as they try those. and there is much more understanding today with organizations. what's needed in order to have a true comprehensive next-gen digital solution fully embedded with ai is the data.
the data is the key over here. without the data, it's almost useless, even if you have a fancy digital solution. and that cannot be provided by small best-of-breed or point solution. you need the domain expertise and a huge repository in order to train new digital solutions and your bots and so on and so forth. and that's exactly what they get with cxone. so those conversations, and we're starting to see the maturation or the maturity of organization as they go through those experiences, and that's exactly what pushes them in the direction of cxone. as i said at the beginning, it's still in its early days and we believe there is a ton of potential. even with our digital, our kind of runway as a company was great. and digital in the past year and a half with the strategic investments we've done in this area, r&d, some other places is now starting to serve as a very strong driver by itself.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst
and can you talk about the sales process of cxone in digital? i can't imagine it's just a formal bake-off. i mean, is it more of a consultative sale where you're going in and engaging the customer and basically becoming almost a partner or a consultant to the customer?
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
absolutely. it's much more of a consultative sale. it's a few more stakeholders on the customer side. let's not forget that digital in many places is owned by different parties, multiple parties in the organization, and they do look for someone that come in a much more conservative approach and allow them to build the internal, if you'd like, almost coalition in that regard. and we also have great partners that we have signed up in the last year and half. some of them even in the bigger side that are -- sometimes we bring them or they bring us into those deals. and absolutely, you're correct.
tim horan -- oppenheimer & co. -- analyst

our next question comes from meta marshall with morgan stanley. please proceed.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you. one of the questions that i had is just what is your best kind of channel for some of the enterprise traction that you're seeing? because i guess i'm just wondering about, is that largely your installed bases kind of your best entry point to those enterprise deals? or are you finding that some of the channel relationships that you're building are kind of helping bring you into some larger conversations?
and then maybe just a second question on digital. you've noted, clearly, it's doing very well. just want to get a sense of is that a conversation starter in a lot of deals? or is that tending to be -- it's coming in with existing customers or kind of layering that on to existing customers? just trying to get a sense of when that conversation is starting on the customer journey. thanks.
barak eilam -- chief executive officer
sure. so let me start with the first one. one of the benefits we have as a company is that we entered the broader cx market with sika [phonetic] after many years that we had a lot of expertise and presence and leadership in the higher end of the market with wem solution and wfo solutions, meaning that we have the expertise, we have much of the installed base of the wfo solutions. and that allows us -- it's a great channel into the expansion to a full cx solution, full cxi solutions with cxone. so that's a great channel. to add to that, we have added a lot of other channels and expanding much our ecosystem both internationally and also domestically in the past few years.
so all of those things are really allowing us to expand nicely into the large enterprises. and it's really -- and also the solution itself, our solutions, as i said in my earlier remarks, it's not just about complexity or scale. it's about managing complexity at scale, and that's something that we have been doing as a company and the management team has been doing for the past three years. so that's what brings us, i believe, a lot of competitive edge and advantage when it comes to the enterprise market.
with respect to the second part about digital, so it's both of them. sometimes it's a completely digital-led, digital-first type of approach, not combined with anything else, understanding that customers would like to step into next-gen digital solutions, and we now are a market leader in that space with the recent launch of a variety of solutions as well as some assets we have acquired in this area. and in other cases, yes, it is an add-on where a customer already have, for example, a cxone contact center solution for us, and then we expand it nicely into digital. and in those cases, as i mentioned, what we see is actually doubling the acv from strategic customer.
