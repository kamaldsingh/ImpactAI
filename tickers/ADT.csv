[operator instructions] our first question is from peter christiansen with citi.
peter corwin christiansen -- citigroup -- analyst
good evening, gentlemen. thanks for the question and nice execution on the tough year. jim, it's really good to see you guys in a position to up the offense in '21. it makes a ton of sense, but i want to dig a little bit into the cadence on how you're thinking about the incremental sac throughout the year and introducing new products, particularly the next phase of google. is that something that you kind of save your powder for a little bit and then act a little bit more aggressively once that comes out? and as a quick follow-up, it sounds to me that this joint product could have a much higher value proposition for the customer. so is there any preliminary thoughts on pricing and relative to the current interactive offering that you guys provide on the residential side? thanks again.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thanks, pete. so i'll give a little bit of context to the pivot to growth and then ask jeff to address your question in a little more detailed way. much of the last several years, pete, we've been focused on operational excellence. our retention improved 300 basis points, customer satisfaction improvements. as you're aware, better operating kpis across the board. revenue paybacks come down 2.7 to 2.2 years. and at the same time, as we're getting our operational house in order, we have macro trends and the demand catalyst that we've been talking about and discussing as tailwinds. essentially, our products -- we see our products and services are in demand. and then in addition to getting our operational house in order and the macro tailwinds, we have worked really hard on building strategic relationships. it's a long list. d.r. horton, dish, ackerman, some relationships in the insurance space. and when you combine all those factors, operational excellence, macro trends, new partnerships and now google, we're able to allocate capital to high-return growth and pivot more assertively to capital-efficient growth. jeff, do you want to add something?
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
yes. i'd just add that it's energizing for the whole organization to be in a growth mode. so there's a lot of enthusiasm across the company, a lot of fun. your specific question about the cadence, the comparisons will be odd because last year was odd. so second quarter, of course, was the most depressed quarter so the compares are easy. the ackerman alliance and initial account purchases from that agreement will be helpful in the first quarter. but the way i would think about it is, our pace of adds or our pace of sac spending, setting aside the ackerman purchase in the first quarter, we would expect to be relatively normal with historic patterns, excluding last year. so a bit higher in the summer season when there tends to be more activity, but aside from that, we're modeling as if it returns to a more normal cadence over the course of the year-on-year will be affected by the abnormal cadence in 2020.
peter corwin christiansen -- citigroup -- analyst
great. so not really like a first half, second half story? pretty normal cadence throughout the year?
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
yeah. we're expecting to layer things in as we go through the year, but we exit 2020 with really strong momentum, having grown u.s. rmr at by 15% in the second half of the year. so we're entering the year with momentum. we have additional benefit coming from -- even the recent partnerships we've announced just over the past several days with the easiest comparables in the second quarter of 2021 because of the soft 2020, and then the tougher compares in the second half of the year.
peter corwin christiansen -- citigroup -- analyst
that's great. thanks gentlemen. very helpful.

our next question is from george tong with goldman sachs.
keen fai tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks. good afternoon. i wanted to dive deeper into your plans to deploy $150 million to $250 million of residential sac in 2021. can you elaborate on which customer segments you plan to go after with this incremental spend? and what returns you expect from the investment?
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
yes. george, it's jim. the -- so there is a handful of different opportunities in front of us. most of the incremental sac will be spent in the residential business. [technical issues] we've talked about since the third quarter bringing some pretty significant headwinds or tailwinds for us and some unique opportunities to really allocate capital to that business and grow. the returns are high-teens and above, and we'll also allocate some of that capital to opportunities in the commercial space, but most of the incremental capital will be in residential.
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
and george, one thing i'd add is that if you look at our historical financials and we included a slide in our deck that shows back 2017, the year prior to the ipo, but we're planning to generate these rmr adds still with more free cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow as compared to 2017, which is just a testament -- kind of a quantitative testament to some of the points jim made earlier about all the progress we've made in recent years, becoming more efficient, better attrition, better sac efficiency, improving our capital structure. so we're very excited to be in a position to have the capital structure and the cash-generation capabilities to be able to grow at a higher rate.
keen fai tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and just as a follow-up, do you view the increase in sac as a permanent/structural step-up? or do you expect it to reverse? and then perhaps, related to that question, what kind of payback period do you expect? is it a two-year payback? so in other words, you get back to this $150 million to $250 million two years down the line? how are you thinking about that?
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
i would think about it, and we plan to share more in an investor day in the second half of the year. but i would think of it as we are raising the water level with respect to the quantity of new subscribers and/or new rmr that we add each year. so we would expect to continue to grow. of course, we will seek to become more sac-efficient and improve revenue payback over time. and then in terms of your question on payback, i would describe that in the context of irrs, we target irrs in the teens and higher. and as we've talked about many times in the past, the irrs is a combination of the upfront cost to acquire the customer, the profitability of the customer on an ongoing basis and then how long the customer stays with us. so we're always looking at all -- each of those variables, among others, with an eye on optimizing the return on the capital that we deploy.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
all right. two quick points of elaboration, george. the first is that as a philosophy, we'll continue to pursue our growth in a very disciplined way. we won't retreat from our standards on credit. we'll continue to be disciplined and ensure that this growth is good growth. and then specifically, on your question on payback, i think we'll continue to have a revenue payback that's in the zone of where we are now. it might move a bit up, it might move a bit down, but we'll be in a range that will facilitate the returns that jeff just mentioned on irrs and in a revenue payback range consistent with those higher irrs.
keen fai tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it, thank you. very helpful.
operator
our next question is from toni kaplan with morgan stanley.
toni michele kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks so much. just wanted to understand the revenue impact versus the rmr growth. so i understand the equipment financing shift, but excluding that, i guess, revenue would maybe be up about 4%. and your rmr estimate looks like more of a high-teens growth. so is that largely due to a decline in installation revenue? just why it doesn't the rmr addition flow more through to the top line?
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
yeah. it's definitely that. it's a somewhat complex topic, but because we are in the process of converting legacy defenders to our historic adt ownership model and because last year, we, for a portion of the year, had legacy adt in an outright sales model, we had meaningfully more installation revenue last year. we included some description of this in our earnings materials. we estimate it's about $350 million to $400 million of lower revenue. it will predominantly be lower install revenue, which is worth about seven points. so it's not for that pressure that we have, we have additional revenue. the drivers of that additional revenue is a recovery in the commercial part of our business, which we expect to get back to something that looks more like the trajectory pre-covid-19 and then the flow-through of our m&s revenue growth that comes from the rmr adds that we had last year and expect to continue into this year.
toni michele kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that makes sense. and i wanted to ask about attrition. so just given the fewer customer relocations during covid, that was a real benefit to the attrition this year. and of course, it's a trailing 12-months metric. so just help us out with how you're expecting attrition to trend this year. i just want to make sure that we have a good sense as the year goes on, just expectations for what you're thinking there.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
sure, toni. the retention for us in 2020 was a real strength, ending the year at 13.3%, down 30 basis points from last year. some companies report net attrition. if we use that metric, we're actually closer to 10% attrition level. and so we feel good about the progress that we've made. we saw improvement in most categories, and they had a record low in q3. in the fourth quarter, we continued to improve in the categories of lost competition and non-pay, but real estate activity, as everybody knows, picked up late in the year, and we saw pressure on relocations, in particular. so we're -- long term, we're optimistic about customer retention, especially as we enter the smart home space more aggressively. we know the more our customers use our systems when devices are more plentiful, when the devices and the system is integrated in the daily activities of our customer, then we know that retention improves. so we think that we'll trade -- we think that we'll be in a range here for attrition with some relocation headwinds and some smart home and interactive rate tailwinds that we'll carry through 2021. one additional thing to mention to you. when we acquired defenders, we continued to receive a chargeback benefit for accounts sold prior to the acquisition. and that benefit expired over 12 months and was a slight metric headwind in 2020. the impact of the chargeback change in 2021 is about 40 basis points.
toni michele kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
very helpful, thank you.
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
and toni, one other point that i don't believe i mentioned. when i talk about the change in revenue recognition because of the ownership model for residential customers, that is a noncash change. so we're still collecting the same amount of revenue from customers. in fact, we're collecting even more revenue because of the success of our pricing and our financing initiatives. but we capitalized that revenue netted against the equipment costs, and then we recognized that revenue over time. so this is a different accounting treatment because of the different ownership model, nothing to do with cash. and in fact, more install revenue is one that contributed to the improved acquisition cost efficiency or revenue payback improvement that you see.
derek a fiebig -- investor relations
and toni, this is derek. if you look at [technical issues].
toni michele kaplan -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question is from kevin mcveigh with credit suisse.
kevin damien mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
could you just give us a little more context on what the $50 million investment is in next-gen technology platforms? what you expect -- how do you expect that to impact the business longer term?
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
so you were breaking up a little bit there, kevin, but i'll -- i think you're asking about the $50 million?
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
about the platform in which we're investing...
kevin damien mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
yes.
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
...with the $50 million.
kevin damien mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
yes. that's right.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
okay. give some insight on the platform?
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
yes. just for context, and then i'll ask don to describe a bit more. but the two areas of investment that we've called out is the higher sac spending that goes with the rmr as in the teams. and then the second, we noted in our materials, is approximately $50 million associated with the development of our next-generation platform, which we described on our last call. there is, of course, lots of other puts and takes that go into our cash flow guidance, but those are a couple that are noteworthy, and i'll ask don to describe a bit more about the platform itself.
don young -- chief information officer and executive vice president, field operations
yes. so kevin, we've actually inherited some nice it and project engineers from three acquisitions, red hawk, lifeshield and defenders. but in addition to that since the google announcement, we've doubled the number of engineers that are specifically working on this platform, and they're targeting another 1/3 on top of that. and that's equal by the number of engineers, by the way, that were working with google. but it's meant to basically move us to a more advanced platform than we have right now with command and control. and that platform is also meant to serve both difm and diy customers in the future.
kevin damien mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question is from gary bisbee with bank of america.
gary elftman bisbee -- bank of america securities -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. jeff, i wonder if you could just be real clear with us because it's been difficult to know. what was revenue growth ex the accounting -- different accounting treatment for install revenue? if we pull that out of 2020, what was the revenue growth for the year? and what does 2021 guidance imply for revenue growth if that normalizing and that revenue not recurring? what's the clean number, both backwards and forwards?
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
so forwards, there is about seven points of revenue pressure that comes from the change associated with the ownership model. and backwards, a bit more complex because of the interplay with defenders, with the canada disposition and with the ownership model change. but i would point you to our install revenue and the predominant driver of our install revenue growth was more install revenue associated with the ownership model change.
gary elftman bisbee -- bank of america securities -- analyst
so if we just take the actual revenue, the midpoint of the guidance range, calculate the growth rate that implies at seven points, and that's what the growth rate would imply? or is that not?
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
yes. yes.
gary elftman bisbee -- bank of america securities -- analyst
so i'm trying to think if that's clean. okay. all right. fair enough. and then on the -- two small ones. on the google investment, the $150 million, do you have any more insight on timing of when you'd spend it? and what's capex versus opex? and the other small one, just you have had a couple of press releases out about this technology that could eliminate the -- or reduce the impact of the 3g conversion because people could just plug-and-play. like what's the update on that? and what's implied in your guidance and cash flow for spending related to the conversion? thank you.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
i'll take both of those, gary, and then ask for don to elaborate on the technology associated with the radio conversion. on google, as a reminder, both parties agreed to invest an incremental $150 million in the partnership. so there is a total of $300 million. the google funds can be used for marketing, product and employee training and are generally earmarked for those three categories. we haven't yet agreed with google on the specific expenditures. we'll likely make a meaningful investment in the launch campaign, the adt + google launch campaign later this year and expect to invest an incremental $50 million. and that's built into our guide. on radio conversion, we started the year with 3.6 million conversions, shared an initial range of $200 million to $325 million net of revenue. our replacement plans are essentially on pace. despite the pandemic, we'll finish q1 with about 1.3 million radios. remaining new convert, we've updated the range to $225 million to $300 million. the majority of that will be spent this year. so the short answer on the radio conversion is that we're on track. and i'll ask don to comment on your question related to the technology company we acquired called cellbounce.
don young -- chief information officer and executive vice president, field operations
sure. and a quick correction. i think jim said 3.6 million to start off the year, which were actually 1.6 million to start off the year with, but -- so we're calling it cell bridge internally for our adt recipients of the device, cellbounce externally because we do have an agreement with at&t to provide this device for those elsewhere in the industry. but we have successfully tested this device, both in the lab and at a handful of homes. we are looking to go out and launch this, as we said on the last call, nationally this quarter. and we're exceptionally excited to do that and see how well it's looking with some of the panels that all the line systems that are particularly more difficult than others to be able to go to swap out the very os. so we're very bullish on how it's going, and we're looking forward to the first quarter rollout.
gary elftman bisbee -- bank of america securities -- analyst
and then if i could sneak one more in, jim. since you become ceo, you've obviously pivoted hard toward investment, a flurry of partnerships. you invest a lot in commercial, the diy, the adt mobile stuff and obviously, google. there's just been a lot of activity. what i hear from many of your investors is, while each one of these on their own makes sense and it's logical, we don't all understand exactly what the vision is, in particular, because you haven't really given any color on sort of what's the end game. what are you aiming for here? what is the return for adt and its shareholders from this flurry of activity? i guess one of the challenges is, you haven't given any long-term targets so that we could assess your performance. and so i guess i want to put that to you as a comment. certainly hear the optimism, but what does this all mean for revenue growth? two years, three years, four years down the road, what does it mean for profitability? what does it mean for cash flow? because i just -- there is a lot of excitement, and certainly, we understand it. but profits have been stagnant for years, and we haven't seen revenue accelerate. and so it's just -- i think there's some frustration that it all sounds good, but we don't have a great sense what the return for the company and shareholders is from all this activity in the last two years. i don't mean that to sound critical, if it does. i'm just trying to get some color on where this is heading and maybe what some targets might be to help us understand the vision you're aiming for. thank you.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i'll talk a little bit about the vision from a high-level perspective. we're going to have a chance to elaborate a good bit on this in the investor day that we do later this year. i'll ask jeff to weigh in here as well. but gary, what might appear as a flurry of activity externally is all really engineering to get our organization positioned for capital efficient growth. i mentioned this earlier to -- when i was answering pete's question, the work that we've done over the course of the last 24, 30 months has been to get the operational house in order; get attrition where it needs to be; get our revenue payback where it needs to be; set the pins from a marketing perspective to more efficiently acquire customers; develop partnerships, google being central to that; to facilitate growth and then to really take advantage of these macro headwinds that are out there. and i think that it's -- in 2021, the evidence that those pins are set, and we're ready to knock them down is mid-teen rmr adds. i think over the course of the last four years or so, our cagr on rmr adds was something like 3%. and we're talking in 2021 about the mid-teens, and that's before google kicks in, in a major way in the second half and in 2022. jeff, additional comments?
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
yes, it's something we've spent significant time on internally. we -- after spending the first -- the three or four years or the past three or four years more focused on operational execution, our next chapter is going to be more about growth being more innovative, taking the customer experience to an even better place, leveraging our brand, especially in partnership with google with further differentiating our frontline service capability, which nobody else has. and then building, as part of the innovation point, more of the technologies that further extend the realm of the various offerings that we provide for smart home and security together. and we think nobody is positioned to do this better than adt is. and as jim alluded to, we plan to hold an investor day later in the year and go through that in more detail, including some perspective as to exactly your question, what that means in terms of economics over time with some longer-term targets and objectives that goes with it.
gary elftman bisbee -- bank of america securities -- analyst
fair enough. thank you. appreciate the call.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question is from manav patnaik with barclays.
manav shiv patnaik -- barclays bank -- analyst
yes. thank you. so just kind of a follow-up to gary's question. i mean, the partnership with google, so i think you kind of answered it in that last statement, but on a high level, you're just trying to get a foot into the door in the smart home and therefore, hopefully expand the tam. is that how we should think about the real benefits of this partnership?
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
much more broadly than that, manav. we think we can leverage google to not get a foot in the smart home space, but to grow significantly and be a major player in the smart home space. i've mentioned this before, we're super excited about the hardware that google brings. the adt + google branding is something that our marketing research reveals is pretty exciting, but i'm most excited about what the partnership does from an ai perspective, video analytics and data analytics perspective. we think that we can not only compete in the smart home space, but really be a -- with google as a partner, a technology leader and provide customers services that don't exist today. that's all part of a second-generation offering, some of which will be available in the second half of this year, but will be launched when we have our own interactive platform built in-house, combined with google hardware and video analytics to launch the next-generation 1/1/23.
manav shiv patnaik -- barclays bank -- analyst
got it. and another broad question. the residential space, obviously, has been tough. and i think all the efforts you're doing make sense in order to grow better in that market, but commercial has always been the preferred area. and i'm just curious, like at some point down the road, you used the word pivot earlier. like, is there a pivot to become just more exposed to commercial? or is residential just such a big animal for you that, that's probably not something in the near future?
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
no. i wouldn't say it's not in our future. commercial, we expect to return to growth in 2021 in commercial. i mentioned this in my prepared remarks, our backlog, both install and recurring revenue, are higher at the end of 2020 than at the end of 2019. the pipeline healthy. we've got incredible upside in some of the growing verticals, healthcare, education, government, critical infrastructure. manav, we think the leadership team is outstanding. we provide the best service in the space. that's the most critical source of differentiation. and we expect to grow the commercial business in a capital-efficient way and get back to double-digit growth as we were prior to the pandemic.
manav shiv patnaik -- barclays bank -- analyst
all right. thank you, guys.
operator
our next question is from jeff kessler with imperial capital.
jeffrey ted kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
it's ironic. i feel like obi-wan, having my two pupils go right in front of me. the first question i have is on defenders. we've talked a bit about defenders today, but defenders has been a growth company for basically its entire history regardless of what it was selling. and right now, it's focused just solely on security. and i'm wondering, given the fact that you've had -- we see the accounting adjustments having been made. what i want to know operationally, what is -- what are you doing to get defenders? and have they been already -- has that group been already integrated into what we'll call the -- not just the interactive platform, but the -- being able to -- because they're able to sell, do they have and have they -- are they being trained on the it level to be able to sell a new platform that you folks are going to be coming out with over the next couple of years? and how is this -- how is defenders going to come out in the wash since it hasn't -- doesn't come out in the accounting, but it should come out in the way the operations are handled?
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. that's absolutely right. that's absolutely right, jeff. the -- so the defenders integration is going well. we're on track. parts of the teams have been integrated into the adt branch infrastructure already. we expect that the integration will be complete in the march, april time frame. we are leveraging all of the skills that the defenders organization brought to our company in a way that's incredibly efficient. we're training the organization in the adt processes, and they're doing well. we had started using our command panel -- defenders had started using our command panel even prior to the acquisition, and now they're using the panel exclusively just like core adt. in terms of the future and the products that will be integrating with google, both defenders and adt technicians and customer care professionals will be trained on that new equipment and it will be standardized as part of our offering.
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
and jeff, one thing i'd add. we talk about this internally periodically. and even if you look in our deck on slide 10, where we show our view as to rmr add growth. we list on that page four factors. but the point i want to make is, there is a lot of factors, and it's difficult to decompose the factors because they interplay with one another. so it's the macro drivers. it changes to our pricing model. it's the financing stuff we've done to simplify our offer advertising effect and install efficiency analytics. but included in those internal initiatives is just the sharing of best practices between legacy adt and legacy defenders. so we would struggle to tell you precisely how much of the 15% growth in rmr adds that we're guiding to for next year comes from that, but it's an important ingredient into that mix overall.
jeffrey ted kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
okay. great. second question, a follow-up is, having gone through the earnings results of a lot of the industrial companies in security that i cover, allegion and assa abloy and those guys. clearly, they are looking for a -- still a kind of a slow first half of 2021, hopefully, picking up in the second half. i'm not going to call it a vacation, but your commercial industrial guys who were killing it two years ago, obviously, let's call them, they had a vacation where part of -- while they could not get on the premises or they were able -- unable to finalize deals that were put off. what was -- in the interim period, what have you done with the commercial industrial -- your commercial industrial group to actually get them ready to be accelerating out of the box and not lose a step relative to some of your other large competitors so that when the market does come back, they will -- whether it's national accounts or whether it's specific large enterprise installations, you will be ready to essentially take over that growth that you had before and not be enough far behind these other companies whose only business is commercial and industrial.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. four key areas, jeff, that we took the opportunity when we couldn't have access to customer premises to really bolster up. the first is training. i don't think that we expended as much energy in training in the commercial space in any year like we did in 2020, and so we doubled down in a significant way in employee development. number 2 is recruiting. from the start, we played the long game. and if organizations weren't as healthy overall as adt, we took the opportunity to recruit some excellent talent in 2020, both at the technician level and the leadership level. the third is integration. we've done a number of tuck-in acquisitions, red hawk a couple of years ago, and so we cleaned up the house from an integration perspective. and then lastly, we advanced the cause on it systems and it integration. so we feel good about the positioning of that business and, as i mentioned earlier, expect 2021 to be a really good year in commercial.
jeffrey ted kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
all right. great. i have more questions to ask but i have to call back later. okay. thank you very much.

thanks, derek, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. i'd like to begin our first call of 2021 with some comments reflecting on our 2020 overall performance and then share some thoughts regarding our new partnerships and current growth momentum. finally, i'll offer some perspective on adt's priorities as we advance into 2021. i'll then ask jeff to cover our financial results as well as our 2021 outlook. with the world thrust into an unexpected pandemic, 2020 was an extraordinarily challenging year for so many and impacted everyone's lives in different ways. it was also a year which brought us, at adt, the gift of perspective. we were reminded more than ever of the importance of protecting one's home and family. for all of us at adt, 2020 brought a new-found appreciation for the essential role we play, partnering with first responders and serving our customers and communities continuously and reliably. after witnessing the tremendous collaborative efforts of our team during the past year, i'm humbled to be able to lead such a great organization and couldn't possibly be more proud of the collective performance of our more than 20,000 adt associates and our dealer partners. during our first call last year, on march 5, prior to the impact of the pandemic even being understood, adt provided a full year 2020 financial outlook. our guide was $5 billion to $5.3 billion for revenue, $2.175 billion to $2.25 billion for adjusted ebitda and $630 million to $670 million for adjusted free cash flow. because of the resiliency of adp's business model and the outstanding performance of our team and despite the challenges and volatility of the economy, we exceeded the upper range of our revenue, delivered in range on adjusted ebitda and performed just above range on adjusted free cash flow. as i will explain, we also set the table for accelerating our growth and continuing momentum going into 2021.
further, in 2020, we grew our net subscribers for the full year. our new u.s. rmr additions started off solid in q1 at plus 7%, but then in q2 were down 11% as most of the country began shutting down. however, we continue to drive sustainable internal improvements to our subscriber acquisition engine. this efficiency contributed to not only favorable results, but the positive momentum for our business, especially when combined with secular trend and external demand catalysts, such as new household formation, deurbanization, the desire for increased home security, the acceleration of smart home adoption and growing consumer spending on home improvement more generally. u.s. rmr additions increased year-over-year 10% in the third quarter and 15% in the fourth quarter. further, our interactive take rate increased to 86%, and we reached the milestone of three million residential interactive customers, and just this month, adt added our one millionth customer on the command platform. as we've mentioned in the past, our diy business continues to grow nicely as well, and we're excited about this complementary part of our business. we remain anchored to capital-efficient growth and the cost of acquiring subscribers also improved with a record-best revenue payback of 2.2 years. this efficiency was driven by our successful consumer pricing and financing initiative as well as benefits from the defenders acquisition. exceeding our expectations, our gross attrition metric improved by 30 basis points to 13.1% as relocations across the country were less common than normal in the second and third quarters, and importantly, our customer satisfaction was strong. we also delivered on our commitment to drive strategic partnerships and alliances to expand our reach and offerings and ultimately, to better serve our customers. on the residential front, we entered into a long-term relationship with d.r. horton, the nation's largest homebuilder. and in mobile, we introduced adt to a broader set of potential customers through the national rollout of our partnerships with lyft and instacart. certainly, our most transformative partnership with 2020 was with google. adt's long-term strategic relationship with google significantly enhances our growth opportunities.
the foundation for our partnership is a shared vision for the future of the smart and helpful home and a steadfast commitment to our customers. as a reminder, google invested $450 million of equity in the adt and has committed $150 million in matching dollars to fund marketing, product development and employee training. our partnership facilitates the development of new offerings, both services and products, as well as new technologies, which will power adt's leadership in the rapidly growing smart home market. i'm pleased to share that our partnership with google is off to a tremendous start. we'll be rolling out product integration beginning in the second quarter, and we're on track to introduce a first-generation adt + google solution in the second half of this year. finally, adt and google have agreed on an exciting new joint go-to-market branding strategy, which we'll share later in the year. summarizing a unique and unexpected 2020, we purposely and strategically played the long game and will continue to do so. adt navigated amid the pandemic with resilience and as a whole, avoided any material adverse business impacts while building a strong foundation for growth in the years ahead. we committed to persevere through the covid-19 crisis with a goal to ultimately become a stronger company, and we've done so. our momentum going into 2021 is real, and i'm excited to share a few comments about the year to come. we've invested a significant amount of time over the last few years improving our operating kpis, driving improvements in customer service, better operating metrics, improved efficiencies and field performance. having made substantial progress in many areas, we begin to focus our improved internal growth capabilities and the pursuit of strategic alliances and partnerships. as mentioned, we developed a relationship with d.r. horton, and more recently with google as a catalyst, we've added new partners such as ackerman security and dish. ackerman, a successful company over many years with customers in the southeast part of the country, atlanta in particular, will join forces with adt as a new residential dealer. ackerman also provides adt with some commercial assets.
the strategic partnership with dish expands our total addressable market to additional ex-urban and more rural geographies of the country. many of the dish technicians have experience with the installation of google products and will be a great asset for adt as we grow. our operating improvements, the partnerships we've developed and will continue to pursue, the many macro tailwinds and demand catalysts are all converging as we focus more intently on allocating capital to the vast array of growth opportunities we're now presented with. 2021 represents an exciting pivot point for adt. we'll leverage our strengths, our trusted brand, our operating excellence, our outstanding customer service, our talented field force, our national scale and our capital efficiency to lean further into high-return growth opportunities before us. with these in mind, i'd like to provide three markers to evaluate our progress in 2021. first will be the continued growth in rmr additions. after a strong 2020, we're targeting 2021 growth rates in rmr additions in the mid-teens. as such, you will see a higher aggregate dollar level of sac investment, which we're allocating toward this high-return growth. we'll continue to be disciplined in our approach with high credit standards and will remain focused on efficient sac investments with high irrs in the high teens and above. keeping these high roi standards, we plan to deploy between $150 million and $250 million of incremental residential sac in 2021 versus 2020. second, we will drive innovation highlighted with the launch of the first generation adt + google smart home solution during the second half of the year. we will also invest significantly in our next-generation, end-to-end adt-owned technology platform and continue to pursue meaningful partnerships in mobile safety. third, while covid-19 and its continuing impact provides some uncertainty, we expect to return to low double-digit revenue growth and substantial year-over-year improvement in profitability levels for commercial customers during the course of the year. our early optimism is heightened because the backlog of commercial customers was actually higher at the end of 2020 than the prior year, and the pipeline for new business is healthy.
we have an outstanding leadership team in commercial, and we're very excited about this part of our business. in summary, our current momentum is strong, and we're encouraged about our future. 2021 is positioned to be an exciting year for adt, one where our growth is more significant than in the past and where investments executed well will result in attractive, sustainable growth for years to come. i'll now hand the call over to jeff. jeff?
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
thanks, jim, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call this evening. as jim described, we performed very well in a highly unusual 2020 environment. like most companies, we encountered many unexpected dynamics, and we are very pleased that we were able to execute on opportunities to offset several of the unplanned challenges we faced. more importantly, we maintained our long-term focus and continued our strategic progress and are specially encouraged by the trends we saw in the second half of the year into 2021. as a reminder, during 2018 and 2019, our priorities centered on enhancing our service culture, improving our operations and expanding our cash generation capabilities. more recently, we have focused on strengthening our foundation and executing initiatives to drive efficient, sustainable growth in addition to recurring monthly revenue, or rmr. we are pleased with the progress we saw during the second half of 2020 with u.s. rmr additions up 12%, following a 3% first half decline driven by challenges arising from the covid-19 pandemic. on a full year basis, u.s. rmr adds grew by 5%. we concurrently grew our full year adjusted free cash flow by 14% to $675 million. by comparison and as evidence of our cumulative progress in recent years, adjusted free cash flow in 2017, the year prior to our ipo, was just over $400 million. as jim mentioned, other full year 2020 highlights include gross revenue attrition at 13.1%, down from 13.4% in 2019 and significantly below the 16-plus percent attrition for legacy adt prior to the apollo acquisition. and revenue payback at a record 2.2 times in 2020 compares to 2.3 times in 2019 and 2.7 times on a pro forma basis in 2015. as a reminder, some of our core financial measures were affected by the disposition of our canadian operations in 2019 and the acquisition of defenders in early 2020.
despite their favorable economics, these transactions reduced our adjusted ebitda, which was $533 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and just under $2.2 billion for the full year. our total year 2020 revenue was $5.315 billion, up 4%, driven by growth in installation revenue primarily due to a higher volume of outright sales transactions for residential customers, which includes volume from the defenders acquisition. this increase was partially offset by lower sales to commercial customers, which, while down for the year due to covid-19, improved sequentially in the third and fourth quarters. for the fourth quarter, total revenue was $1.315 billion, up 1% versus 2019, despite the effects of the canadian disposition and lower sales to commercial customers. the strong 2020 adjusted free cash flow, i already mentioned, up 14%, was a result of several factors, including some offsetting dynamics related to covid-19. a key contributor was efficiency in net subscriber acquisition costs, or sac, which was down year-over-year, despite our growth in rmr adds. other noteworthy items affecting cash flow included our participation in the cares act, payroll tax deferral program and the offsetting acceleration of a portion of 2020 annual incentive plan payments. in addition to strong cash generation, we built on our 2019 refinancing transactions to further improve our capital structure during 2020. in january of 2020, we refinanced our second lien notes. in august, we replaced our 2021 first lien notes with new 2027 notes. in december, we repaid $300 million of our term loan, which we then repriced in january of 2021. our resulting lower borrowing costs and extended maturities provide us with greater flexibility to deploy capital to high-return growth opportunities. in 2021, we are eager to build on our substantial progress from the past several years. we have strengthened our business fundamentals, enhanced our service culture, grown our cash-generation capability, improved our capital structure and developed new and more efficient routes to market. we are enthusiastic and optimistic about our future, and you can see, on page eight in our deck, a summarized framework of our strategic priorities.
the next chapter for our company is focused on driving more rmr growth, creating new innovative offerings, further enhancing our overall customer experience and continuing our commitment to generating shareholder returns. we plan to share more detail on our long-term strategic plans and objectives, including our adt google branding and products, during investor day later in the year. our teams across the business are energized by our strategy and our growth prospects for 2021 and into the future. as jim mentioned, we anticipate 2021 rmr additions in the mid-teens, which reflects the significant increase from our growth rates during the past few years. we are also investing to support our strategy with our new interactive platform, the development of new offerings in collaboration with google, upgrades to our infrastructure and the launch of the adt google marketing program. you can see our result in 2021 financial outlook in our investor deck. it includes total revenue in the range of $5.05 billion to $5.25 billion, adjusted ebitda in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion and adjusted free cash flow in the range of $450 million to $550 million. while many factors affect our cash flow, implicit in our guidance is $150 million to $250 million higher cash tax spending in support of the strong rmr growth i just mentioned. as a reminder, our reported revenue and adjusted ebitda are affected by the defenders acquisition and the different accounting policies applicable to accounts generated via differing channels and under differing ownership models. these different accounting policies do not affect cash flows, and we described in more detail in our investor deck and 10-k. as you can tell from our 2020 progress and our 2021 outlook, we are well positioned to capitalize on our improved capabilities in several favorable secular trends. our focus has decided to leave long term, the long game jim mentioned, and our teams have never been more excited by our future. before concluding my comments, i want to express my appreciation for our more than 20,000 employees, our dealers and growing list of partners and our investors for the continued support of our company. thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. operator, please now open the line for questions.
",2020-Q4,ADT
0.5079,,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question is from kevin mcveigh from credit suisse. go ahead.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great, thanks so much, and congratulations on the results. hey, jim of jeff, i wonder, just given the strength to the ebitda in q1 relative to the full year, was that kind of as expected or does that allow you to maybe do some incremental investment over the course of the year? i guess, just how should we think about to be relative to the reaffirmed guidance as we work our way through the balance of '21?
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
hey, thank you. thanks, kevin. yeah, more or less as expected it's a little bit better than our internal budget pockets and strength included commercial recovery monitoring services revenue that grew. we're pleased with our adds, we're pleased with our attrition. on a year-on-year basis it's affected, of course, as we described by the ownership model change, but off to a good start. and as always, we incurred some challenges some of which jim described, but we were able to execute some opportunity to offset those challenges that we feel really good about our start to the year.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
awesome. then just real quick, as really the retention looks really, really good at 13 months, is that still. i mean, there's probably still some covid impact to that, but is that store opened up a little bit? and any other puts and takes? it feels like there's a little more duration there and is that may be more operational or just the commercial remixing? just any thoughts around that as it relates to the retention?
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'll share it some, kevin, on attrition. so how're you doing, kevin? we -- so we ended the year at 13.1%, maintained that level in the first quarter. it's a improvement of 40 bps from the first quarter of last year. relocation cancels were worse year-over-year and we are favorable on what the competition and non-pay. so we shared, we expected some headwinds from the absence of the defenders charge back, but we were able to offset those headwinds.
underlying performance, kevin was strong. q1 '21 nps was better than q1 '20. our -- some of our operating metrics first-call resolution save rates are tracking nicely. and so we still think that we have some headwinds to face principally to relocation in the lots of the defenders charge back, but we feel pretty good about attrition.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
that's great.
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
kevin, it's jeff. one other thing i'd add too on your question on ebitda, which i've said in my prepared remarks, but there are some unusual dynamics year-on-year because of covid, some of which jim touched on in his response. so i wouldn't multiply first quarter by four. we've held our guidance as we've put it out originally, so still really good about where we are. it is expected to be more in the first quarter, and our guidance is the same that we shared a couple of months ago.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
very helpful. and congratulations, jeff, on the new role.
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
well, thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question is from jeff kessler from imperial capital. go ahead.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
thank you. and again, i want to congratulate you guys on your new roles including don. can you go through -- you went through very quickly at the very beginning of your presentation, jim. the the various sub headings of rmr growth, and how one rolls into the other. can you go through that again?
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
and clarify which part, i can provide more color, jeff.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
just on what sub-segments of rmr are adding up to the larger mid-teens total growth that gets you?
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer
yeah. so our overall, jeff, this is jeff. our overall rmr add growth was 25%. if i exclude from that the initial ackerman account purchase and it exclude from that the ability of purchased account that we mentioned last year, we would have been up 14%. our full year guidance was to be up in the mid-teens and implicit in that guidance, of course was ackerman, we do have ackerman when we gave a guidance, which we're accounting on a full year basis contributing something in the mid-single digits toward that mid-teens growth. aside from ackerman, our dealer channel was particularly strong, so i would call that out as another driver and then commercial recovery on -- with rmr, of course it's up a smaller base, but the commercial business coming back is encouraging as well.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
okay. okay, thank you. with regard to your your commercial business, commercial seems to have a very strong backlog, maybe even a stronger pipeline. and again, while we're here -- well, my sources in the industry basically, up and down the line are basically very, very bullish about this turning into revenue later on in the year or maybe in 2022. can you just talk a little bit about where your commercial industrial business is at this point in time in being able to drive the backlog? and maybe the pipeline if that's supporting that backlog into revenue closings, actually? when are we going to see the result of that?
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
jeff, it's jim, and and i'll share some perspective on that. we're also very bullish about the commercial business. results have been improving on a sequential basis and now we've improved on a year-over-year basis. we're pleased with our price for us, we have a good bit of work yet to do. a few headlines to share with you, we believe, that we can compete and win in this business.
we have outstanding service. we think we have the best leadership team in this space. secondly, we are confident that we'll return to double-digit top line growth in 2021. we are also feeling good about our sales pipeline and our backlog. our 3.31% backlog is it another record both for our ir and rmr. and then lastly, we think we have some opportunity to improve margin.
i mean on a run rate basis, we're confident that we can get to 2019 levels by the end of this year and longer-term ebitda margin rates in the 12% range. so, summary would be, we're also very bullish. we'll continue to invest in commercial. we're growing new verticals like healthcare, education and government. and just as we did during the pandemic year, we're taking a long-term view of this business, but feel really good about it.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
okay. and if i may just throw in one more since this is my last press conference. my, one of the areas, obviously that i have been focused on for the last, maybe, 5 or 10 years has been -- has obviously been the false alarm rates being generated by new players in the industry, as well as all players who aren't doing so well or who have legacy systems. as the industry kind of moves toward, as police departments kind of try to move toward a scoring system so that some people don't get serviced in 10 minutes and some people don't get serviced -- and get service --some people get serviced in 3 hours. where is adt right now in the project with obviously with google and other technology companies to bring some type of standard to this industry?
don young -- chief information officer and executive vice president, field operations
so, jeff, this is don. appreciate the question. as you know, we've been talking about this for a long time. as usual, adt is leading from the front on this, both, on helping to define the avs-01 they were just referring to, to help score alarms differently intrusion alarms specifically. at the same time, as the standards being developed and standard from the entire industry department [technical issues] we are working closely with google, as you know, to develop our technologies that live up to that standard. everything from verifying, location information at the timing of alarm event, video verification, a number of data streaming that we are using google's cloud to provide us to be able to provide a real-time exploring mechanism to live up to that standard.
we're really excited about it. we've seen some progress recently with rollout of signal chat, small -- somewhat small factor. we actually have signal chat deployed over 1 million customers and we're seeing a 50% reduction of false alarms just from that customer set alone. so we're already making waves on reducing false alarm, and the next wave is moving the leverage on wave to try to live up to that's smart.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
alright, great. thank you very much and good quarter. and good luck, guys.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
hi, jeff. i think if i am not wrong you've been covering adt since 1983. and on behalf of the organization, good luck in your retirement. thanks for your support over all these years. we're looking forward to working with brian, and very much wish you luck in retirement.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
thank you. i'm not leaving there -- the whole industry, but i'm even these conference calls. i am out of the sell side. by-bye.
operator

derek a. fiebig -- vice president, investor relations

today's call will also include non-gaap financial measures. for a complete reconciliation of our non-gaap financial measures, please refer to our press release.
with that, i'll turn the call over to jim.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, derek, and welcome everyone to our call. our year is off to a great start, and i want to thank the entire adt team and our dealer partners for their dedication in taking such exceptional care of our customers. while conditions are still challenging, as we work through the covid pandemic, we remain focused on making our customers' lives safe and simple at home, at work and on the go.
on our call last quarter i outlined several key priorities for 2021, including growing our rmr additions and monthly revenue base improving the performance of our commercial business and driving innovation, both internally and through our partnerships. our first quarter results reflect the progress we're continuing to make on each of these fronts. we're off to a strong start in delivering on our growth objectives. in our consumer and small business segment we're seeing solid customer demand for our products and services.
new gross subscriber additions increased by more than 30% versus the year ago quarter and 86% of our internally generated new customers opted for our interactive services, up 4 percentage points from the start of last year. concurrently, our total company customer attrition held sequentially at just over 13%. net subscriber growth combined with rising average revenue per unit and internally generated new customers drove 25% growth in overall rmr additions or 14% excluding this year's initial ackerman account purchases and the smaller bulk account purchase we mentioned on our first quarter results last year.
with the strong start to the year, we are firmly on track to achieve our full year target of mid-teens rmr growth. to get there, we still plan to spend $150 million to $250 million in incremental investment in subscriber acquisition. the majority of that incremental investment is expected to hit in the first half of the year, including $116 million in the first quarter.
we continue to take a disciplined approach to growth. this quarter, we increased net subscribers and grew our rmr additions, while also maintaining our revenue payback at 2.2 years. our path to achieving our rmr outlook target involves a number of important tactics with two of the more important ones being first, to increase the reach of our products and services and secondly, to expand the value proposition for customers. our partnerships with d. r. horton, lyft and instacart place adt products into the hands of homes of more customers every day, and our dish partnership along with ackerman, as a new dealer is expected to expand our reach into more geographies, as we further build national scale that no other provider can offer.
we also continue to expand and strengthen our commercial capabilities with tuck-in acquisitions. we're also developing partnerships that allow customers to receive even more value from their relationship with adt. for example, we've joined forces with both established and new insurance tech firms like branch and hippo to give customers more options to protect their life, property, family and assets and save money on their homeowners insurance. we're regularly engaging with potential new partners, plus meet customers increasing demand for smart security product across all aspects of their personal and professional lives.
so as we think about our key priority have capital efficient rmr growth, not just this year, but also in the future, we believe our initiatives around subscriber acquisition efficiency and customer value will be boosted by external demand catalysts. we expect the increase in homebuilds trends toward de-organization, evolving interest in security and in particular growing smart home adoption will all contribute to long-term revenue growth.
our second priority, already is to improve the performance of our commercial business after a challenging 2020 largely as a result of the pandemic, we return to revenue growth and margin expansion during the first quarter and generated a $20 million increase in ebitda. we still have work to do both on revenue growth and margin rate, which remains below 2019 levels and we'll continue to invest in the commercial business throughout the year.
importantly, our backlog in this part of the business remains at record levels. we've expanded adt's commercial footprint with the acquisition of safe electronics and through our exclusive partnership with wg security products a technology-driven provider of shoplifting prevention solutions. this acquisition and partnership combined with the premium service and premium services our team provides and the gradual reopening of customer premises post-covid are producing great momentum in our commercial business. we're also making progress on priorities around innovation through both our partnerships and our own internal efforts.
our google partnership will provide more customers access for rapidly evolving smart home services by combining the past of both worlds. google's best-in-class smart home products and analytics and adt's best-in-class premium service and smart and safe home innovations. we share our plans to gradually roll out google hardware in the adt ecosystems. our customers can now purchase google products. the google voice assistant, the nest hub and the max hub can all be purchased and integrated into our customer smart home system by adt's unrivaled network of technicians.
while we expect to roll more integrated products in our joint go-to-market branding, as we move through this year and into 2022, i want to underscore that this is a long-term relationship. our initial focus is centered on building a solid foundation that will allow both adt and google to drive the most long-term value for our customers.
this partnership approach and the transformation, it will drive across adt positions the company to compete and win in the rapidly growing smart home market. in addition, we have a long and proud history of innovation at adt with a robust and growing internally developed portfolio of patents and other valuable intellectual property, as well as the developers, engineers and other innovators who will help turn our proprietary data and insights in the innovative new services and products for our customers.
we are increasing our innovation investments this year, planning an initial $50 million on next-generation solutions that will power our future services, products and customer experience. with adt owned and developed solutions combined with google's hardware and technology we can further differentiate our company in the eyes of customers. and while we have strong momentum in our business we like most companies also face challenges.
while access to customer premises is much improved today versus last year, the pandemic is still affecting our operations and we're managing customer interactions carefully with the focus on safety.
our 3g radio conversions remain on schedule so far this year, however, the worldwide chip shortages affecting many industries are adding some complexities including limiting the benefits we can achieve with our sell downs product.
while we have meaningfully increased our technician capacity during the past year, we're also faced with recruiting challenges in labor markets, which are increasingly tight. we're focused on managing these challenges, as we did in the first quarter and excited by the ongoing growth we intend to deliver through 2021. in closing, 2021 is off to a very strong start and we're excited about the continued evolution of adt.
we have a durable revenue model, and our focus on growth is producing a better top line. with a trusted brand, national scale and the best technicians in the industry we have an unmatched set of competitive advantages and we are driving innovation and transformation across all aspects of the business, not just for 2021 but for many years ahead. with that, i'll turn the call over to jeff for a more detailed review of our first quarter results and our outlook for the year.

thank you jim, and thank you everyone for joining our call today. i'll reiterate jim's comment that we are off to a solid start to 2021. the highlight of our first quarter was our very strong growth in recurring monthly revenue additions for rmr, which includes our ackerman account purchases. these growth trends are as planned with positive net new additions an increase in average pricing and strong attrition performance.
our resulting base of rmr grew by approximately $6 million compared to the fourth quarter and $10 million compared to the prior year. over time, we expect these trends will lead to more growth in monitoring services revenue, which grew by 2% in the first quarter compared to last year. our adjusted ebitda at $542 million was essentially flat year-over-year being slightly better than our internal plan.
the key positive adjusted ebitda drivers included growth in monitoring and services revenue in commercial improvements, which were offset by the non-cash effect of our ownership model change. before going into more detail, i want to add some color to our segment change. effective in the first quarter of this year, we adjusted our operating structure and our reporting to segregate our consumer and small business or csb operations from our commercial operations. the resulting separation of these segments will add transparency to our results.
the commercial segment, which comprised approximately 20% of first quarter revenue is composed of large commercial customers with expansion facilities and or multi-site operations which often require sophisticated integrated solutions. the csb segment is made up of all other customers, including residential homeowners, small business operators and other individual consumers. these segments services, including our core premise-based security and smart home solutions in addition to other offerings such as health and mobile security.
you can see our first overview about the two segments in the earning deck including some historical detail in the appendix. the highlight for the first quarter in our csb segment was our strong increase in addition to units in rmr. beyond the ackerman account acquisition was especially strong overall in the first quarter. we also continue to sell more interactive services which is becoming the norm for new subscribers. interactive customers now make up more than 50% of our total csb subscriber count. the resulting mix shift is helping produce a modest increase in revenue per unit for this segment.
the highlight for our commercial segment is a return to year-over-year growth after a challenging 2020 pandemic-driven environment. both the revenue and adjusted ebitda increased in the first quarter, as gradual reopening at customers' locations increased demand for and fulfillment of our services. commercial ebitda grew by around $20 million due to the stronger revenue and margins including the benefits of net improvement in provisions for credit losses and overall cost discipline. we have strong backlogs for commercial demand and expect results to continue to recover with an objective of returning to 2019 run rates during the course of 2021.
turning to cash flow in the balance sheet, adjusted free cash flow of $64 million was ahead of our internal budget driven mainly by timing items, but down from last year, due mainly to a $116 million increase in net subscriber acquisition cost or sac. this higher sac investment is as planned is consistent with our growth focused and includes approximately $73 million from our initial ackerman account purchases. our trailing 12-month revenue payback held flat to last quarter at 2.2 times and is down compared to last year's 2.3 times despite the mix shift toward dealer-generated accounts, which are slightly more expensive on an incremental basis being direct accounts.
our balance sheet remains in a healthy position to fund our growth initiatives. a highlight in the first quarter was our january first lien term loan repricing transaction, which reduced the spread by 50 basis points and libor floor by 25 basis points, which translates to about $20 million in lower annual interest costs. combined with other refinancing transactions in 2019, in 2020 we have collectively reduced our annual cash interest by well more than $100 million.
as we look to the rest of 2021 based on demand trends and early results of our growth initiatives, we remain confident in the full-year guidance we shared in february, which we affirmed in today's press release and included in our deck. i also want to point out that our adjusted free cash flow will not be evenly achieved by quarter due to cash and interest timing and the ackerman account purchases in the first quarter. our adjusted ebitda will likewise not be consistent by quarter due to our ownership model change and investment timing.
we shared in february, that our full year guidance includes rmr growth in the mid-teens, and we are off to a very solid start. other things equal, more growth in rmr additions leads to more sac investments. as always, we are managing several potential offsetting items and we will update you on our guidance in august. one other note is that we made solid progress on 3g conversions in the first quarter during which we converted more than 500,000 radios. we continue to estimate a range of $225 million to $300 million of total net cost for the program, which is excluded from our adjusted free cash flow measure. we have incurred a net of approximately $136 million on this program to-date including $59 million in the first quarter.
finally, we announced on our last call that we are planning an investor day this year. we look forward to seeing many of you there, hopefully in person. at that event we plan to lay out our strategic vision that underpins our excitement and confidence in the future along with the longer range financial framework.
in conclusion, i'd like to join jim, in thanking the entire adt team for their great work, and i want to thank all of you for your support and for joining our call today.

[operator instructions] and our first question is with kevin mcveigh from credit suisse. please proceed to your question.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
congratulations. jeff, just to follow up on the guidance question. i noticed the slide wasn't in the deck. are you reaffirming the revenue and ebitda guidance as well for the full year? and any reason why it's not in the deck or in the press release, the guidance?
jeffrey likosar -- chief financial officer and president of corporate development
no, no page just because there's really no news beyond what i said on the call. we are running the business so well in line with our expectations so far. we expect to be within the same ranges that we shared at the beginning of the year. and as i described on the call, the ultimate cash will depend a bit on the rmr add in the second half of the year. and then the seasonal trends are affected, of course, by covid dynamics last year, some of which are continuing to affect the trends this year. but our full year guidance remains in the same range as it was at the beginning of the year.
kevin mcveigh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. and then just on the retention. i think the retention would be my estimate by about 30 basis points. any thoughts on that? is there any way to think about how the retention sits with smart home customers relative to the core residential in terms of the delta on that?
james d. devries -- chief executive officer, president and director
sure, kevin. so yes, we ended the quarter at 13.3% attrition, a little bit of color. we were favorable in loss to competition in nonpay. relocation cancels like last quarter were a little worse year over year. we think some of that is the covid effect of delaying relocations. we also experienced the expected headwinds from the absence of the defenders chargeback on a t12 basis, that's about 35 to 40 bps. so some of that was offset by our safe efforts. and then to your point, there's some really good lead indicators in terms of the shift in product mix there should be a tailwind to retention. so for example, we know that customers with cameras and video services have better retention characteristics and sales of command and video are at their highest level ever in 2021. and then not unimportantly, credit score correlates pretty heavily to attrition and customers acquired in the first half of 2021 had the highest mix of credit scores in the past five years. so we felt pretty good about the quarter. and as you know, long term, we feel bullish on retention.

our next question is from ashish sabadra with rbs capital markets.
ashish sabadra -- rbs capital markets -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. i just had a question on the google partnership. you've introduced some integration, integrated products there and launched joint marketing. i was wondering if you can share any early results. what kind of traction have you seen from the joint product and joint marketing?
james d. devries -- chief executive officer, president and director
sure, ashish. i'll give a little bit of color on google. anticipating this question, i really want to start by giving, sharing some context with you. so most, much of our work this year is about building a foundation for future growth. so we're developing our own software platform. we're improving our diy offering. we're making investments in our commercial business and essentially putting the pieces in place to leverage the google partnership over the long term. so it's in that context of building a foundation that i'll share a couple of comments about google and how things are coming along. as you'd expect, we continue to feel good about the relationship with google. we've got several products that are already integrated into the adt ecosystem, the mini, the hub, the hub max, mesh wifi is in pilot. we'll have the doorbell in our product portfolio still this year. we anticipate diy product in q1 of next year. as with a lot of our partners, not just google, we're navigating supply chain, are based on successfully navigating the supply chain. but so far, it's gone well. i've seen some of the early advertising work, and it's very good. we're already in market with some light co-branding with google. and we're working closely with them on quality testing and basically ensuring that the infrastructure, the supply chain and the customer experience is all in great shape.
ashish sabadra -- rbs capital markets -- analyst
that's great. good to hear the solid progress that you're making on that front. maybe just if i can ask a question on the commercial side. obviously, really strong growth, significantly beat our expectations, and you highlighted strong backlog as well. you also mentioned share gains there. i was just wondering if you could provide any color how there are some big wins. obviously, you won the dollar business last year. any big wins there. and within the commercial, any products in particular that are gaining more traction? any incremental color would be helpful.
james d. devries -- chief executive officer, president and director
sure. so i wouldn't point to any single individual win. it's a lot of successful business across a pretty broad spectrum of customers. our national account business is doing exceptionally well. we have just an outstanding team in that space. but i'd say the success is largely due to market share gains. and it was across a significant customer base and across all of our products, fire, intrusion, card access and video. we had a solid q2 with revenue. ebitda is recovering well. as i shared on the call, our backlogs on june 30, were at another record level. ashish, this continues to be a business where we're confident we can compete and win. we've got, in addition to a strong backlog, we've got a strong sales pipeline, and we're pleased with our progress. growth and margin improvement will always be linear in this business. we're playing for the long game and investing in a number of new verticals, healthcare, government, education, but we think this business has a lot of runway, and we feel great about the quarter.
ashish sabadra -- rbs capital markets -- analyst
that's great. and congrats on a good quarter.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question is from brian ruttenbur with imperial capital.
brian ruttenbur -- imperial capital -- analyst
a couple of quick questions. first of all, on attrition. it was up slightly from the previous period. that's not necessarily indicative of anything, but i want you to address that and then talk about where you see attrition by year end of 2021? and are we going to hold in that low 13%? can we break 12%, into the 12s? can you talk a little bit about that? and then i have a follow-up.
james d. devries -- chief executive officer, president and director
sure. thanks for the question. so the, there's not a great deal to add beyond what i shared already. the favorability for us was largely around lost competition and non pay. i'm hesitant to predict where we're going to be at the end of the year. we've got a headwind, as i mentioned, from the absence of the defenders chargeback. that's about 35 to 40 bps. but there's just a number of positive lead-ins status. our customer parametrics are improving. our service backlog is currently at a six month low. we had fewer service requests in july than any of the last nine months, our customer save efforts are tracking nicely, brian. so i feel good about it over the long term. i'd love to get into the 12% and even lower than that over the long term, but hesitant to predict how we'll end the year.
brian ruttenbur -- imperial capital -- analyst
okay. and then about the commercial recovery, that's the next question. can you address, you guys are gaining a lot of market share. can you maybe say what you're doing in terms of gaining that market share? is any of this a new office? or is it retrofitting offices? talk a little bit about that because i'm seeing out there in the market with allegion and other suppliers as well as providers that new office is dead, retrofit is on the way up. and i want to know where you're gaining your traction in the commercial space.
james d. devries -- chief executive officer, president and director
yes. it's across the business. there is, for sure, some retrofit work. there's some new construction. i think that accounts for about 10% or 12% of our revenues, but it's a business hit for us, it's hitting on a lot of cylinders and it's tough to tie it to a particular sector. i shared this earlier, we've got a fantastic leadership team in commercial, great commercial technicians and you win in this business by great service and building a reputation for great service. and brian, that's what the team is doing day in and day out, and we're being rewarded for it.
operator
our next question is from george tong with goldman sachs.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
your gross rmr additions were strong this quarter, up 28%, which actually accelerated from 1q. and i think the prior indication is that 1q would be the peak for gross rmr additions. so could you talk about perhaps was there any pull forward in gross rmr additions in the quarter. and if not, would you say you have an improved outlook from what you had previously for full year gross rmr additions, given your strength so far in the first half of the year?
kenneth porpora -- executive vice president of finance
george, it's ken. we agree. we have 28% year over year growth in the quarter for q2. and as jim mentioned, a high quality of performance about the credit scores and the number of devices. so it's a great installation quarter for us. so i'd like to do back out last q2 and look at 2019, just to kind of normalize the covid, especially in q2 last year, that's really when it popped. so versus 2019 q2, it was actually up 13% in probably the same period. so pretty healthy rmr growth. we did see that across multiple channels. dealer is probably the first one that comes to mind that both diy, small business, as jim mentioned, and also residential direct showed that year over year growth. so q1 was boosted by ackerman. q2 was heavy organic growth, and, but we were bouncing up against a pretty easy compared to q2. jeff mentioned in his comments that we don't anticipate the same level of growth in the second half of the year, but we like all that from a growth perspective, especially with our rmr base, ending up 4% higher for the quarter.
james d. devries -- chief executive officer, president and director
and george, just a follow-up to kenneth question here. again, no change to our perspective on the full year where we've shared previously, we expect our full year growth rate to be in the mid teens, and that goes with the financial ranges that we shared. and as we grow more, we'll invest a bit more sac and vice versa. if the growth goes another direction that reduces sac and generates more cash flow but consistent with our full year guidance unchanged from what we shared back in february.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then we're getting closer to the google joint product launch in the second half of the year. could you perhaps elaborate on what the remaining milestones are in order to make that a successful launch? and at this point, do you have enough flexibility to contemplate including some benefit or impact from the launch into your full year guide?
james d. devries -- chief executive officer, president and director
george, it's jim. we won't include, or i'd say, very minimally include any incremental revenue as a result of google. we have a handful of products in play, the significant advertising for google and adt together will be next year. in addition to the products that we have now, the only new product, an important product and a product that we're anxious to have in the portfolio, but the only new product will be the doorbell. and so there's light touch promotional work today. there's some light-touch co-marketing today, but nothing incremental this year as a result, built into our plan as a result of google.

and our next question is from kenneth williamson with jpmorgan. i'm sorry, we actually have reached the end of our question and answer session. and i'll now turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks.

james d. devries -- chief executive officer, president and director
thanks, derek, and welcome, everyone, to our call. we're off to a very solid start through the first half of the year, and i want to thank our entire adt team and our dealer partners for serving our customers so diligently and delivering solid results for our shareholders. during our february call, i outlined several key priorities for 2021, including growing our rmr additions and our recurring monthly revenue base, improving the performance of our commercial business and driving innovation both through our internal expertise and through our strategic partners. jeff will walk you through our second quarter results in a few minutes. in summary, a number of areas within our business are performing exceptionally well. our small business channel, our commercial segment, diy and our dealer channel are all delivering strong results. in the second quarter, across the business, we grew gross rmr additions by 28% versus last year. we also see some opportunities. we're working to further increase volume in our direct residential channel. and on the expense side, we're making progress on addressing service cost pressures we experienced in the quarter. overall, we feel very good about our results for the first six months and have good momentum going back, going into the back half of the year. this evening, i would like to share perspective about what we've achieved as well as where we're headed, not just in 2021, but into the future. during the past several years, we have grown revenue by more than 20% from just over $4 billion to more than $5 billion with approximately 80% of that revenue from recurring monthly service to our customers. we've established a sizable commercial business through acquisitions and organic growth, now approximately $1 billion of revenue.
we've pivoted to include more smart home products, increasing the number of devices installed per customer from 14 to almost 20 today, which correlates to an increase in average revenue per unit. and we've improved our service levels, increasing customer satisfaction with gross revenue retention improving from approximately 84% for legacy adt to just under 87%. and we have increased our revenue generation and strengthened customer satisfaction, which has translated into an improvement in our trailing 12 month revenue payback from 2.7 years to 2.2 years. and importantly, we've captured these positive outcomes in our financial results, growing our cash generation capabilities during the same time with adjusted free cash flow of $675 million last year. as to the direction we are heading in, at our core, adt is a mission driven company, and that mission is dedicated to making our customers' lives safe as well as simple from our sosecure app offering three protection options to residential customers who have made us the most trusted name in the smart home security space to multimillion dollar commercial installation, we deliver on our mission every day to over six million customers. adt's scale and breadth of offering is unmatched in the marketplace. our path forward is focused on three areas.
the first is driving revenue growth through differentiated service to a larger customer base in our core business. the u.s. smart home and commercial protection markets are expected to grow steadily with a total revenue opportunity north of $100 billion in the next five years from just under $75 billion today through. through our direct channels, our dealer network and our partnerships with leading homebuilders like d.r. horton, we're connecting with more customers than ever before as we respond to increased customer demand for smart home automation. of note, our new customers are increasingly choosing more integrated offerings, and we firmly believe that the more a customer interacts with their system, the greater the opportunity we have to build a longer term rewarding relationship with them. this relationship is further solidified by the premium service adt provides from installation by best in class technicians to always there customer service to operate in the industry's highest certified monitoring centers, no one takes better care of customers than adp's team of 20,000 people. we remain focused on the customer experience and continually research areas where we can modernize and refresh. by investing in our digital capabilities, we will deliver the level of service customers value most and provide it in a more streamlined cost effective way. we had an excellent quarter on the commercial side of the business. our growth is largely attributed to higher market share.
we continue to see tuck-in acquisition opportunities where we can increase our market footprint and expand the offerings we provide to our customers. the second area of focus on our path forward is driving adjacent growth. this includes building relationships with our strategic partners in spaces such as multifamily property management, building and construction, insurance and ridesharing. we're also actively looking at ways to further capitalize on consumer confidence in adt's brand, which has earned tremendous trust with our customers and maintained over 95% brand awareness. the opportunities afforded to us run the gamut from expanding to new commercial verticals or beyond the home to new opportunities like automotive or solar. these adjacent markets provide potential growth and expand the market opportunities for adt. additionally, a number of the adjacent opportunities provide for deepening relationships with our current customers. the final area of focus is shaped by increased innovation both through our internal expertise and through our strategic partnerships, especially through our relationship with google. adt was founded nearly 150 years ago, and we are proudly one of the longest tenured companies in american business, but i'm even more proud of adt's growing culture of innovation and reinvention, which is crucial to continuing to thrive in the future. related to our commitment to innovation, it's been almost a year since we announced our google partnership, along with their equity investment in adt. and over that time, we've made progress while simultaneously learning from each other along the way.
we're now offering integrated google products such as the voice assistant, hub max and piloting mesh wifi. and shortly, we'll be including the google doorbell in our portfolio of products with expanded offerings planned, including a refreshed diy lineup in early 2022. additionally, we're working closely with google to develop our joint marketing plans. we've already begun some marketing and promotions, which feature google product, and we're working with google closely to develop our joint advertising plans, which we expect to deploy in 2022. during our planned fourth quarter investor day presentation we'll present our long term strategy for the company. we are looking forward to providing a holistic update then on our partnership with google, both in the context of our current transformation efforts and our long term strategy. i'll now turn the call over to jeff to take you through our second quarter financial results.
jeffrey likosar -- chief financial officer and president of corporate development
thanks, jim, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. as jim described, we delivered a solid quarter, continuing our progress on many objectives, especially including growth in additions to recurring monthly revenue, or rmr and improved commercial performance. for the second quarter, gross rmr additions increased by 28% compared to 2020, reflecting our investment in customer acquisition, our continued focus on differentiated service and offerings and pandemic related weakness last year. on a year to date basis, we have grown our rmr additions by 26% or 20%, excluding this year's initial ackerman account purchases and the smaller bulk account purchases in the first quarter of last year. our resulting rmr base grew to $352 million, an increase of $14 million versus last year. over time, we expect rmr growth to lead to more monitoring and services revenue, which increased by 4% in the second quarter. we are fortunate that our portfolio includes a variety of customer segments and routes to market. our dealer channel has been especially strong and contributed a larger percentage of new rmr additions than we planned in the second quarter and the first half of this year. while they come at somewhat higher incremental acquisition costs compared to direct addition, dealer generated accounts deliver solid returns. importantly, we have remained disciplined while growing with early attrition on recent customer additions trending favorably. our trailing 12-month revenue payback remained at 2.2 years through the second quarter despite this mix shift toward dealer. total second quarter revenue was just over $1.3 billion with adjusted ebitda at $542 million, both slightly exceeding our internal budget. rmr growth, improved commercial performance, lower bad debt expense and general cost controls all contributed positively to our results. offsetting headwinds versus 2020 included the noncash effect of our ownership model changes in higher service costs. as you will recall, we changed our segment structure effective in january of this year, and i will share a couple of comments on our segment results. the highlight in our csb segment continues to be the strong rmr additions. we again also grew our net subscriber count in the quarter and customers are increasingly selecting more integrated smart home systems.
interactive customers now make up more than 55% of our total csb subscriber base, which contributes to a modest increase in average revenue per unit. our csb monitoring and services revenue at $965 million increased by 3% versus last year. installation and other revenue declined as planned, reflecting the noncash effect of ownership model changes. our broad offerings and best in class service set the foundation for future csb growth. in our commercial segment, we continued performance improvements after a pandemic induced set of challenges in 2020. second quarter revenue grew by 23% in aggregate, with installation and other up 32% and monitoring and services up 12%. our commercial segment also delivered strong ebitda margins. we are very encouraged by our first half progress in commercial, and our strong backlog gives us confidence entering the second half. we also are pleased with our cash generation, which remains a priority even as we invest in subscriber acquisition costs and our next generation platform. adjusted free cash flow was $227 million through the first half of this year, in line with our internal plans. we also continue to improve our capital structure to support our growth objectives, including the completion of three transactions during the past month.
we renewed and improved our receivable securitization agreement. we extended our revolver to 2026 and upsize the capacity to $575 million. and most notably, we refinanced our $1 billion 2022 note with a new 2029 notes. as a result of these and other transactions over the past several quarters, we have addressed near-term maturities, strengthened liquidity and reduced our borrowing costs. we remain very comfortable with our overall capital structure and liquidity position, which enable us to invest in our future. as we look to the rest of the year, we are maintaining the full year outlook ranges we shared in february. the first half trends continue, we may be at the lower end of our adjusted free cash flow range due to more spending on subscriber acquisition costs. however, our full year sac spending depends on second half rmr additions, which are affected by residual dynamics from covid-19 and other factors that have altered normal seasonal trends in quarterly comparisons. we continue to expect full year rmr additions growth in the mid teens with a lower growth rate in the second half compared to the first half as we originally planned. as always, we remain focused on the efficient deployment of capital to generate strong returns over time. in summary, we're entering the back half of the year with solid momentum. our overall revenue and growth initiatives are expanding our rmr base, and our commercial business is performing well. we also continue to advance the longer term objectives that will shape our next chapter. we remain excited by our future and we are well positioned to deliver positive results for our employees, dealer partners, customers, communities and investors, both in 2021 and in the years to come. thank you for joining our call today, and thank you for your support of our company. operator, please open the call for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from gary bisbee with bank of america securities. please proceed with your question.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys, good morning. some exciting news there. i guess, let me start with a question on sunpro. the -- obviously it's grown dramatically. but can you give us a sense how profitable is it right now, and when you think about growth over the next few years, how are you thinking about that? is it -- is that 100% cagr sort of sustainable, or do you think that the business is likely to slow as it matures in the next couple of years? thanks.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, gary. it's jim. i'll give a couple of just contextual responses more at a strategic level and ask jeff to comment as well. obviously, we're super excited by the acquisition, all the opportunities. we're especially excited given the growth that they've had, positive ebitda and cash flow. we've been attracted to the solar space for some time. for us, this is an opportunity to increase tam in an adjacent market and really accelerate our growth. we were attracted to the industry for all the reasons you would expect. there is a massive shift underway driving the residential solar adoption, overall transition to renewable energy. we were specifically attracted to sunpro for a handful of reasons. their management team is first-grade, fantastic customer service. and we think we can bring some assets to the party that are from adt that can further accelerate the growth, leveraging our brand, cross-selling to our base, cross-selling to our new subscribers and bringing scale advantages that adt has and that sunpro will be able to leverage. so i'll -- and i'll ask jeff to address some of your specific questions.
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer and president, corporate development
yes, same here. we are very, very excited about the space, the expanded footprint, the larger size of market available to us. one of the attractions is that they have been very fast-growing company, but have been profitable, generated positive cash during that growth. and implicit in our comments where we talked about we -- approximately multiple, you can infer from that that we're anticipating forward ebitda in $80 million range we shared in our materials.
their trailing 12-month revenue is a little bit less than $700 million. they've grown during the year, so the run rate from a revenue perspective is approaching $1 billion. strong cash conversion and we're expecting continued growth. we're very excited by the contribution and what it means for our future and then we'll of course share more detail once we get the transaction closed, concurrent with the rest of 2022 guidance.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, great. and just maybe another follow-up on that, so i understand how you could likely have a meaningful impact on their ability to acquire customers. beyond that how do you think about synergies? jim, i think you did say help sac in both directions. so i don't know if there is an obvious play as to how it can help core adt and beyond that are there other synergies we should think about that you think supports the transaction? thank you.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
sure thing, gary. it's principally a revenue synergy play for us. there is more definitely some cost take-out opportunities much a bit in negotiating with supply chain, helping with things like talent acquisition, just bringing the scale that adt has to bear on a meaningfully smaller company. so we think we can get some margin expansion by deploying those cost synergies, but principally the big opportunity for us is on revenue synergies. the -- what i mentioned early, the opportunity to cross-sell into our base, the opportunity to cross-sell to new subscribers, we're looking at some really interesting things around bundling smart home and solar together. we've done a good bit of research with our base with solar in tenders, with non-solar in tenders. we know that our brand plays incredibly well and we're bullish both on the revenue synergy side and then there is some cost synergies to pick up as well.
gary bisbee -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great, thank you.

our next question comes from george tong with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, thanks. good morning. on the sunpro acquisition, just to touch on the last point on revenue synergies, you talked about the opportunity to cross-sell into the base and to bundle. can you potentially give us a quantification of how much this acquisition can lift underlying growth both at adt and at sunpro?
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
actually, george, we're not -- beyond what jeff shared, we are not ready to give guidance on 2022. we think we purchased this at a really attractive price, about 10 times forward ebitda, so that implies an ebitda next year of about $80 million. but beyond that, we're not ready to share specific numbers. the only other thing that i will share though is we have a number of our dealers who are currently selling solar. obviously, it's not adt solar. they've got relationships with other companies, but the cross-sell experience has been really successful and really inspires confidence in us that we're going to, both in direct and dealer be able to cross-sell to the base and new subs. we're not ready to give specific numbers today that will be embedded in the 2022 guide. we'll share much more at investor day in q1. but beyond that, not more than $80 million in ebitda next year.
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer and president, corporate development
and one thing i'd add -- george, i'll add to that, we evaluated the company, a variety of different financial models as you can imagine. we effectively underwrote it without necessarily counting on synergies. jim says we think we bought it for a good price, that's true. i mean, it's especially true if we model in synergies. i also wanted to emphasize that the sellers' consideration is via adt stock. so it became clear in the conversations and part of buying for a good price that the sellers were highly attracted to adt stock. so that also doesn't quantify the synergies, but it just gives you a sense that both parties are highly attracted to -- what the two firms can do together.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then looking at revenue payback, it looks like revenue payback 1 times to 2.3 times in the quarter that compares with 2.2 times last quarter and 2.2 times last year. and you also narrowed the free cash flow guidance range to reflect more of a focus on growth. so given those moving parts, can you talk about your overall efficiency and the acquiring customers are you seeing improving efficiency or any changes in how efficiently you are able to deploy your sac?
ken porpora -- executive vice president, finance
hey, george. it's ken porpora here. i'll take that one if it's all right. as the guys mentioned, we're up 7% year-over-year in rmr growth. again, last year with covid impact, i actually look at it versus 2019 as well. versus 2019, we're up about 17%. so good growth in the topline rmr added. what you are seeing there is yes, some of the payback you see at 2.1 times to 2 times to 2.3 times, lot of it is our dealer mix. dealers are having a killer year and a killer quarter. direct is up as well. but dealers, that mix is a little more expensive for us, but if you think about the economic returns, these are healthy returns and we're happy with all of that additional rmr added that we're getting that pushed the 2.2 times up to 2.3 times. this -- the average customer life extends over eight years, so good economic pieces.
if you think about the future and where we can bring some of the efficiency and kind of where you're going with it, the revenue payback over time, especially with some of the bundling of products, the google innovation that we have going, as well as thinking forward now with solar, it brings opportunities, just bring greater efficiencies and greater upsells from a revenue standpoint, as well as cost efficiencies. so again, we like where we're at right now, good, strong economic returns, but still have some legroom to improve as time passes.
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer and president, corporate development
and george, i'll add. you mentioned guidance. we're really pleased with our performance this year and executing overall as planned. we -- as you know, we tightened, our range is toward the higher end of our initial range on revenue and adjusted ebitda. due to the rmr growth that, in many respects, come from the sac investment, so it uses, look at the year-on balance and while we're able to do that, our rmr adds up in the mid-teens. the balance is up $15 million. that equates to $100 million annualized, the revenue at the higher end, ebitda at the higher end, we closed some finished line on 3g and lte commercial underway. while we have a couple of months left, we're very pleased with our performance during the year.
george tong -- goldman sachs -- analyst
very helpful, thank you.

our next question comes from toni kaplan with morgan stanley. please proceed with your question.
jeff goldstein -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey guys this is actually jeff goldstein on for tony. in the slides you mentioned that mns revenue benefited from an increase in average pricing, is that more given the mix shift toward interactive products, or are you also getting price on a like-for-like basis across your services? just how should we think about the pricing environment overall, especially in the face of rising inflation in the market as a whole right now?
ken porpora -- executive vice president, finance
jeff, largely, it's an increase in some of the interactive services, especially video take rates are high, continue to be up quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. the average price of some of our base services continues to be pretty confident at this point. but we are looking at some of our service revenues for high material facility going and service the customer in their home, we are taking a harder look at that and what we charge for some of that billing. but the main increase that you're seeing there is the mix in interactive, specifically video.
jeff goldstein -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, fair enough. and then, i'm curious on the labor side. are you running into issues either around employee turnover or ability to find new tax? and if that is the case, do you think you'd sacrifice any revenue because you couldn't find the labor, and then any expectation on your end when you would expect any labor pressures, if there are any to this day going forward? thanks.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
yes, jeff, it's jim. it's -- so labor is absolutely an area of focus for us. i think in the us there is now something over 9 million open jobs, like many employers who are working through talent acquisition strategies across a broad range of our positions, technicians, sales, customer care. i would say to date, labor shortages have had a immaterial impact on sales, immaterial impact on our technicians and ability to install, but it's a daily challenge for us, and part of the problem isn't just lack of candidates, but a mismatch between the skills of the candidates available and those that we need. so net-net, labor and a tight labor market are on our radar screen as is talent acquisition, making sure that we've got an attractive employee value proposition has never been more important. to date, no material impact for us.
jeff goldstein -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thanks for the color.
operator
our next question is from ashish sabadra with rbc capital markets. please proceed with your question.
ashish sabadra -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. so jim, as you mentioned, adt has embarked on several initiatives over the last several years, including commercial, diy, google, and now sunpro. can you just comment on the management bandwidth who manage so many different initiatives? and maybe just a follow-up to that could be also, are there areas such as commercial security which may not be as core with the google, diy and sunpro. so are there areas where you think that could be potential right for -- potential areas for divestiture as well? thanks.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so ashish, from a management bandwidth perspective, we've been incredibly fortunate that the companies that we acquire have the management teams, the leadership teams of those organizations have joined and stayed with adt. that's the case in the acquisition of diy, that's the case with red hawk, that's the case with a number of tuck-in acquisitions that we've done in commercial, and we feel really good about the sunpro leadership team joining adt going forward. and in addition to that we'll be operating adt solar really semi-autonomously. the integration will be pretty limited. we want to ensure that the organization is getting all of the benefits of adt, that stays nimble and focused on growth. and i think from a combination of retaining the leadership talent at sunpro as with our commercial acquisition, and operating the business without a heavy lift in integration, we're going to be able to handle it from a bandwidth perspective.
ashish sabadra -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's very helpful color. and maybe, if you could just also address the question on the portfolio rationalization? are there, you believe, certain businesses within adt which may not be as core, given the focus on the residential business?
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
you broke up a little bit there, but i think you were asking about the prospects of divestiture of any of the businesses that are non-core. and for us today, we're continually doing a portfolio review, the businesses that we're in, diy, commercial, obviously our core residential and sunpro, there's no immediate plans, no serious conversation about divestiture. we're always contemplating how to unlock value for our shareholders. so while it's not on the radar screen today, perhaps someday in the future, but we think that, ashish, there is a lot of advantages to having these businesses together, and at least today, as we look at the landscape, can't really see a divestiture scenario.
ashish sabadra -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's very helpful color. thank you very much.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from brian ruttenbur with imperial capital. please proceed with your question.
brian ruttenbur -- imperial capital -- analyst
yes, thank you very much. congratulations on the acquisition and the quarter. so just going back a little history, you've gone from a security company to a home automation company. you're now into solar, and i totally get that. but what's next, what pieces are you missing? do you need to add hardware, do you need to add additional services, is it more video? can you tell us what you're missing out of the portfolio and where the future is of adt?
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we're feeling pretty, brian, where we stand today. we're looking at opportunities to increase tam [phonetic] in adjacent markets. auto is an area that we kick tires on a bit, we're looking at some interesting things around use cases, expanding use cases to leverage our mobile product. health is an area that we've contemplated. but we feel pretty good about the existing portfolio. a lot of the innovative effort now is really on how do we improve our existing product. as you know, we're building our own interactive that -- product called the adt plus will be unveiled and integrated with google at the end of 2022, and we're doing a lot of work around monitoring and smart monitoring, working to improve that product and really retrod the industry. so i conclude, while there is not -- we don't see a hole in our lineup, but we see opportunities to continue to innovate to make what we've got better.
brian ruttenbur -- imperial capital -- analyst
great, thank you. as a follow-up, talking about -- but you kind of led in with my google update. so you have a partnership agreement with alarm.com, i believe, until mid 2022. are you going to need to extend that, are you going to have the google software ready to go, adt google partnership ready to go by kind of mid 2022 or -- just give me a roadmap a little bit and the timing of that?
don young -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yes. so brian, this is don. the partnership with abc will continue into the foreseeable future. we got a lot of customers that are in both the pulse and on the command & control platform that will stay on those platforms until sometime in the future. it makes sense to perhaps upgrade them, but we'll continue to partner, we'll continue to develop and mature those platforms. at the same time, we're looking forward to rolling out our own interactive platform, of which we've had some recent success launching for our diy customers on november 2. we're actually well ahead of plan in rolling out that platform and it was a seamless deployment. so we're really bullish and excited about the things that we did with the rollout in 2022. can't get into the specifics, as to milestone, but soon we'll able to go ahead and discuss it on our investor day.
brian ruttenbur -- imperial capital -- analyst
just a follow-up on that don, real quick, on the november 2 you start rolling it out to, is it more beta or is it actual live to diy customers?
don young -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
no, it's live. we have a little over 100,000 diy customers that were using an older version of the platform, but we -- since replaced with the newer platform, the one that we intend to use or what we call difm customers in the future. it was always our plan to go ahead and not experiment, but to still have the phase test that with a handful of live customers, and i'm happy to say that we're about 10 days into it now almost, and we have had no issues whatsoever.
brian ruttenbur -- imperial capital -- analyst
great, thank you.
jill greer -- senior vice president, finance & investor relations
thanks, don. that's going to wrap up the analyst portion of our call. i'm going to turn it back to jim for quick closing comments.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jill. so in closing, i'd like to extend my appreciation to our adt employees and dealers. we had a strong quarter, a terrific quarter. i'm proud of your collective efforts. of course, i'd like to formally welcome sunpro to our adt family, couldn't be more excited for this next phase of our growth and the launch of adt solar. so thank you. thank you as well for everyone joining our earnings call this morning. we're optimistic about finishing the year strong as well as adt's future and looking forward to the growth ahead. have a good day everybody, and thank you.

and with that, i'll turn the call over to jim.
jim devries -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jill, and welcome, everyone, to our call. this is an exciting day for adt as we announced just this morning where we have reached an agreement to acquire one of the largest residential solar companies in the country, sunpro, in an all-stock deal. adt will be expanding our residential footprint into the fast-growing residential solar space. jeff will be covering our third quarter financial results in more detail shortly, but i'd like to share a few highlights of the quarter from my perspective. first, the impact from our growth initiatives is reflected in our revenues with rmr additions up 7% for the quarter and 19% to-date. second, the rebound in our commercial business continues with revenues up nearly 18% over last year. third, we're making good progress on the innovation front with the google relationship continuing to move forward and just recently an exciting new partnership with doordash, which leverages our in-house developed mobile platform. fourth, 3g replacements. our outstanding field operation leaders and technicians have executed well on our 3g objectives. we have successfully completed 85% and remain on track for full completion for at&t customers by the february 2022 sunset date. finally, overall, we remain on track to deliver on our 2021 commitments, while simultaneously building a solid platform for future growth.
regarding our growth platform, i want to spend some time talking about the transformation we're executing at adt and how our move into the residential solar segment complements our strategy. adt is an iconic, extraordinary brand, one that is underpinned by the trust our customers place in us. historically, our brand has been centered around in-home security. adt is evolving to more of a lifestyle and consumer technology brand. a brand that will deliver safe, smart and sustainable solutions for our adt customers by focusing on safety, automation and energy management.
our google partnership, along with our new solar footprint provides us with a much larger presence in the home automation and energy management markets and our strategic steps to broadening adt's total addressable market. these are fast-growing segments with tech-forward [phonetic] as well as eco-friendly aspects that appeal to a broad range of customers. additionally, the strategic partnerships we've formed over the past few years are an integral part of the evolution, from our google relationship, which provides a path for best-in-class products, technology and analytics, to new alliances such as redfin and doordash, which are expanding adt's offering beyond the home. we're in the middle of an exciting transformation.
expanding our residential offerings into the growing solar segment is a logical next step, adding a new dimension to the integrated experience our customers want. demand for residential solar has grown exponentially in the past several years as consumer acceptance of solar has increased and pricing has become more attractive. and with solar, we see a path for significant growth ahead as the market is already at $15 billion with only 3% home penetration. in addition to the savings and peace of mind that come with solar, there are of course significant environmental benefits. the average residential solar system offsets about 100,000 pound of carbon dioxide in 20 years. that's the equivalent of driving a car for over 100,000 miles.
we're extremely optimistic for what solar can bring to adt's future and we are confident we have the perfect partner in sunpro. sunpro's, founder and ceo, marc jones, his talented management team, and their 3,600 plus employees have built a great customer-focused company, while simultaneously executing a proven growth strategy. we're excited to bring solar into our adt family, will now be branded as adt solar. a point worth reiterating, marc jones and the selling shareholders are taking their consideration in adt stock, demonstrating their conviction regarding the adt go-forward story. given our size, scale, and partnerships, we anticipate adt solar to be immediately one of the leading players in the residential solar market with the most recognized brand in the segment. adt's national scale will provide a unique platform to accelerate adt solar's penetration into other markets, beyond the gulf region and western states where sunpro currently operates.
with over 6 million adt customers, we will have the ability to now cross-sell solar and importantly, the opportunity to bundle adt packages for security, home automation and energy management. in particular, combining cross-selling with adt's industry-best network of accomplished dealer partners, many of whom already have experience selling solar, we have the opportunity to significantly reduce acquisition costs for both our solar and csb segments.
regarding the formal solar acquisition, we're in the process of securing regulatory approval and we expect the transaction to close before year-end. we expect it to be positive to ebitda and free cash flow immediately and accretive to eps during the first 12 months. the acquisition will be funded through a $160 million of cash used to pay debt and seller's shareholder taxes and by issuing 77.8 million shares of adt common stock. the deal price is very attractive and values sunpro at approximately 10 times next 12 months ebitda.
an additional point to note, sunpro has a minimal amount of capex. after closing, adt solar will operate as a wholly owned adt subsidiary and therefore become a separate segment, similar to our commercial business. therefore, the initial integration will be minimal, enabling us to quickly implement our cross-selling and dealer initiatives, while also maintaining our momentum in other parts of the business.
we're planning for 2022 to be a key year for our google partnership as we deliver upgraded and enhanced hardware, software, and monitoring solutions. our adt and google teams are working closely together to ensure that we deliver a consistent high-quality experience for our customers, both in the coming months and long-term.
we continued to make good progress over the past quarter with google, and look to launch the doorbell nationally in january, with cameras and thermostats shortly thereafter. our timeline ensures that despite supply chain challenges, we will have sufficient supply on hand to meet expected customer demand. on our current timeline and assuming supply chain constraints are manageable, the work of our joint product and engineering teams are tracking to sequentially release additional pro-install and diy solutions during the course of the year.
we are confident that our complete suite of innovative, integrated google products, when combined with our next-generation app and technology platform will be transformative for adt, unlocking new functionality and expanding utility for our customers. we're looking forward to sharing more of our exciting initiatives with all of you at our upcoming investor day.
so in closing, we continue to put in place the right building blocks for our long-term growth strategy. we initiated a shift several years ago with strategic moves into commercial security and focusing more assertively on smart home automation. our next phase will unfold with the formal google product launch in the coming months and with our expansion into the residential solar market, both of which will accelerate adt's transformation to becoming the safe, smart and sustainable provider of choice.
and now, i'll turn it over to jeff to cover the third quarter in more detail.
jeff likosar -- chief financial officer and president, corporate development
thank you, jim, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. with more than three quarters of the year complete, we continued to demonstrate solid performance from our growth initiatives and our broader operational execution. our increased investment in customer acquisition continued to deliver very strong results, with gross additions to recurring monthly revenue or rmr, up 7% year-over-year for the third quarter, and up 19% year-to-date. the resulting rmr base grew to $356 million, which is an increase of $15 million versus last year and represents almost $4.3 billion of durable annual revenue. we remain on pace to achieve our mid-teens full year growth objective for new additions to gross rmr.
total company third quarter revenue was just over $1.3 billion with adjusted ebitda at $554 million. our year-to-date performance on these measures is tracking ahead of our original plans and we have improved our full year outlook with newly updated ranges toward the upper end of our previous ranges.
rmr growth improved commercial performance in general cost controls all contributed positively to our results through the first three quarters. offsetting headwinds versus 2020 included a non-cash effect of our ownership model changes, technology investments and higher service cost trends, which we have improved in recent months. as the only large-scale national player in our space, we acquire customers through several diverse channels and sales tactics. our dealer channel has been particularly strong throughout 2021 and has contributed a larger percentage of new rmr additions than we planned. dealer generated accounts delivered solid returns and included attrition protection for the first 13 months. due to our strong customer retention overall, our average customer tenure is more than seven years. this is significantly beyond our 2.3 year trailing 12-month revenue payback and illustrates the long tail [phonetic] benefit of our growth strategy.
on a segment basis, the highlight in consumer and small business or csb, has been our very strong rmr additions. we again grew net subscriber count in the quarter and our customers are increasingly selecting more integrated and comprehensive smart home systems. interactive customers now make up nearly 60% of our total csb subscriber base, helping drive an increase in average revenue per unit. csb monitoring and services revenue at $976 million increased by 4% versus last year.
installation and other revenue declined as expected, reflecting the non-cash effect of ownership model changes and integration of defenders. because we completed the transition earlier this year, the year-over-year effect of these non-cash items will be significantly reduced next year.
we also continue to improve performance in our commercial segment. third quarter commercial revenue grew by 18%, with installation and other up 19%, and monitoring services up 17%. we expanded our ebitda margin rate versus last year, while continuing to balance near-term results with a long-term focus. we achieved these results, while navigating supply chain dynamics in commercial which caused some challenges on installation timelines for certain jobs. overall, we are pleased with the recovery in commercial after a challenging 2020 and we are optimistic about our trajectory.
turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash generation remains a priority even as we invest in subscriber and rmr growth and our next-generation platform. adjusted free cash flow was $289 million through the first nine months of the year. we are narrowing our full year guidance range to $450 million to $500 million as we continue to prioritize investments in rmr growth and account for the mix shift toward dealer generated accounts i mentioned earlier.
another highlight in the quarter, as discussed in our last call, was the july refinancing of our $1 billion 2022 notes with new 2029 notes. with our balance sheet efforts over the past several quarters, we have addressed our near-term maturities and meaningfully reduced our cost of debt. our weighted average maturity is now approximately 5.5 years with no debt maturing until the middle of 2023. we remain very comfortable with our capital structure overall.
to summarize the discussion of our results, i'm very pleased with our progress this year and resulting momentum in the business. as planned, our overall revenue and growth initiatives are expanding our rmr base and csbs, and our commercial business is recovering well versus last year's challenges. we also continue to advance long-term objectives that will shape our future. these all support a 2022 that improves on our 2021 results.
additionally, our acquisition of sunpro is a great next step for adt, as jim described. it broadens our residential portfolio, features several characteristics complementary to our existing business and provides an exciting platform to accelerate our growth. the financial profile of sunpro is more like our commercial business within csb, including relatively low capital intensity and high rate of cash flow conversion. with almost $700 million of revenue during the past 12 months, which has grown at a compounded rate in excess of 100% since 2017, we are expecting sunpro to immediately contribute to our growth in revenue, adjusted ebitda, and adjusted free cash flow. we are very excited by the sunpro business and we look forward to completing the acquisition process during the coming weeks.
we are now planning to host our investor day in the first quarter of next year where we will share more details about the sunpro acquisition, our overall growth strategy, our longer term financial framework and guidance for 2022.
thank you for joining our call today, and thank you for your support of our company. operator, please open the call for questions.
