thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] your first question today comes from andrew buscaglia with berenberg. please go ahead.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question. can you talk about -- so just digging into your guidance, so implies a fairly large ramp in the q4, and q3, it looks a little bit more muted. can you talk about the -- which reflected in your guide, and i get the sense your margins are strong, but i get the sense your holding back a little bit on the top line there. so what's -- how did you come up with that guide?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
good morning, andrew. so we are guiding at this stage for nominal growth of about 3% to 5%. that would translate into a 2% to 4% on an organic basis. and if you remember last year in q3, we had a very strong growth about 15%. so you have to take this guide in the context of a tough compare. and to answer a bit more specifically to your question. at this stage, we are planning to have growth across our portfolio either from a product standpoint or regional standpoints. and we feel good about the guide, we are presenting to you today, based upon our ability today to cover key trends in the market. from a profitability standpoint, our guide includes leverage on the ebitda line at about 22%, that would be about 100 basis point improvement in term of profitability. and as you have seen now for a few quarters where we believe, we have opex or gross margin leverage in the p&l due to the operational discipline we have in the company and that is also reflected in our guide.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
got it. and i think there's a little bit of confusion with regards to when your bigger competitors having substantially weaker results. what -- i guess, can you comment on, what you're seeing? do you think -- i think you're gaining share generally. what are you seeing in the channel and -- yeah, if you could talk a little bit more about inventories at distributors?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. first -- i won't be able to comment on other competitors results or anything like that, but we feel good about where we are. we have a strong and compelling vision for the company that we have been executing diligently on over the last several years, specifically in q2. i think we executed very well and drove strong profitable growth across the company. we had solid performance in asia pac, emea and north america both direct and through our channel. we saw from a product perspective, particular strength in our mobile computing portfolio and services and from the vertical perspective, retail, e-commerce as well as transportation logistics were strong performers. but all that verticals were up for the first half. and yeah, we have -- today, we have a strong competitive position. basically on the base of the strength of our product portfolio, and i think also our value propositions are resonating very well with our customers. and specifically on the inventory position, let's say, we manage channel inventory very carefully every quarter all the time. we continue to have the channel inventory be within -- comfortably would be within the band of what we consider to be normal. so there's nothing unusual for us in that area. and maybe sales, so we compensate our sales people on the sales out. so there is no incentive to drive, say overstocking of the channel.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay, got it. thanks guys.

the next question comes from jim ricchiuti with needham & company. please go ahead.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you, good morning. i'm wondering as we look out at the second half guidance, what is that i assume for larger deals. i wonder, can you characterize your larger deal pipeline, you clearly had some -- it sounds like some competitive wins thus far this year.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so we are not planning and then normal amount of large deals. they are not totally contemplated in the guide, we are putting forward, jim, and maybe joe can complement.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yeah. large deals have become an important part of our portfolio. and in the second half, we expect a number of large deals, but as olivier said, not unusable for that part of the year, in particular q4, is usually a large deal quarter and we don't expect an unusual number of large deals in this year relative to previous years.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you. and just my follow-up question, just as it relates to the macro environment, it seems like you're seeing pretty good strength in your core markets. but where are you, if at all seeing signs of potential caution from the customer base? are you seeing it in the smaller markets like manufacturing, which is very fragmented, but still a reasonably sizable part of your business.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i'd start by saying that our solutions have become much more foundational to our customers' strategies. they are -- our customers are much more dependent on our type of technology to be able to execute on their top priorities. things like we help them increase workflow efficiencies particularly important in tight labor markets. we provide real-time guidance to the front line of their employees, and hence the customer patient experience and we do all this through our partner ecosystems. so our business -- we've worked hard on making sure that we have diversified our business as much as we can across geographies, products and verticals. and i think that is helping us. every quarter, we'll see some countries or some verticals have some ups and downs, this is no different. last year was maybe a little unusual in that -- it was very broad based, but we mentioned last quarter and it still holds through that -- mexico would be a little soft based on geopolitical environment, but generally, we saw a strong performance across most of our sub-regions across the world.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question today comes from paul coster with jp morgan. please go ahead.
paul coster -- jp morgan securities -- analyst
yes, thanks for taking my question. so anders, i know many investors are concerned the so-called androids upgrade cycle might be peaking. can you give us your latest thoughts on where we stand in the replacement of windows ce and windows mobile? and why you believe that the growth might persist beyond this year?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. first, i'd say -- from a broader perspective, i'd say that we are seeing a broad and innovative portfolio of products and solutions more broadly across the entire portfolio driving solid growth across the business. so android and mobile computing is one aspect. but this is something that's much broader for us than one product line. again, i go back to some of the things that i think differentiates us in the market of some things like our deep understanding of work flows and giving our customers the ability to leverage data at the edge to take more good real-time decisions to help to optimize and drive their businesses. so we're very excited about opportunities in all of our product lines. and there's several megatrends that support the growth like the on-demand economy.
now specifically to mobile computing, we have seen great growth over several years now. and we're certainly very excited about the progress we made and the outlook we have for that business. there are several drivers for the growth we've seen. now there's things like a number of new use cases they are being deployed that's underpinned by the strong portfolio of software capabilities that we have developed for our mobile computing portfolio. so this new use cases, i think, the best being long-term growth drivers. a couple of examples, a lot of our customers are looking to consolidate multiple devices or multiple applications onto our mobile computers. one example will be many verticals and many customers are using or have historically used dedicated pbx or wireless pbx phones for people. now with our workforce connect application, we can consolidate that device and that use case onto our mobile computers. another trend we're seeing is that our customers are looking to put more and more technology in the hands of all their people. so pushing technology further into the organization, so the trend of having a device for everybody is gaining a lot of traction. and i'd say also our big screen portfolio of mobile computers, so tablets and vehicle-mounted computers are seeing a lot of new use cases and interest also.
now specifically to the android transition, it clearly has been the catalyst for growth for us. we still have over 60% market share in android. and the overall market -- mobile computing market is now more than 50% made up of android devices. we still think that there's lots of potential in this market. we anticipate or we forecast that there is still about approximately 10 million legacy windows devices in the market. and these devices are not all going to be converted to android by 2020, when microsoft stops supporting their older mobile operating systems. so this conversion cycle will take longer. we see good drivers. our software continues to be a great driver and new devices -- we released some new devices specifically to capitalize on the warehouse transition, that's ramping up now, so our mc33 and mc93 products. so android is clearly a great driver, but there's only one of several long-term drivers for our mobile computing business.
paul coster -- jp morgan securities -- analyst
quick follow-up. you're obviously investing a lot in software. you're acquiring your way into software data services, cloud applications, apis and some. how is this expressed in your business model, because i know some folks looking in vain for the software line and it's not there. so just translate into margin improvement on the hardware side?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
well, first i'll give you a couple of thoughts around our software business and the strategy for it. we've gone from having kind of made historically, say downward devices to smarter devices and now more smart infrastructure. so very much focused on driving a performance edge for our customers and it's entire portfolio and software has become a great differentiator for us. our software dna layer makes it lot easier for our customers to integrate, manage and their suites of zebra products. so the -- specifically we launched the savanna data services, that's a great new capability for us that enables zebra and our partners and our customers to more easily access data as well as enable zebra to monetize that data. it also then helps demonstrate thought leadership for us and moves us up the stack as a solutions provider and it will help pull through our broader solutions as well. software is still a modest part of our overall business, but software as a differentiator is something that's embedded into all our devices also, but we do expect it to continue to be a bigger and bigger part of our business.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
and to complement paul on the business model impact. clearly, the strong gross margin performance of the company, which we have posted now for several quarters is also due to the strength of the software offering and you don't see that necessarily in the software line in the p&l, but it's reflected also in the strong gross margin we have hardware, as anders said. and these software offering allows us to sell based upon return on investment basis rather than just speed and feeds. and we are as a result, perceived as a thought leader in the industry and that is reflected in the way we price.
paul coster -- jp morgan securities -- analyst
thank you.

the next question today comes from brian drab with william blair. please go ahead.
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
hi, good morning. i was wondering if we could just maybe drill into slide 6 a little further and just curious on the 3% growth in ait. can you talk about may be just specifically within that segment, first, in terms of end markets, retail manufacturing, p&l, which were above or below 3%? and then it would be great too, if you could mention in terms of geographies for ait, which were above or below 3%? thanks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. i will start here. so first, ait grew in q2. we did see fewer large deals in q2 2019 versus last year. so we were not able to replicate all of the large deals that we saw last year, and they were mostly in retail but also some other ones. in the -- within our printing portfolio, i'd call out rfid printers as a particularly strong growing segment of our portfolio. but overall, our printer portfolio, overall ait portfolio is positioned very well, and we like the grow prospects we see in the market here. we do have a strong and fresh portfolio of smart connected printers, which has really an unrivaled manageability through our link-os and that's a great differentiator. from a regional portfolio, we saw good growth from printing in asia pac, and we saw it in europe particularly. i think i would call out those two as the strongest areas for us. even china had good growth for us, which is a good printing market. so we were up high single digits in china as well. so if we are offsetting some of the discrete electronics manufacturing by penetrating other manufacturing sectors in china like automotive and other heavier manufacturing. does that answer your question?
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
yeah. i mean, i was hoping maybe -- yes, that's all helpful, obviously. but i was hoping maybe more specifically like -- and i guess you're saying retail was below 3% and manufacturing and t&l were above? i mean, i still feel like i'm guessing at the specific answer to my question. i'm trying to read between the lines and i guess 3% from the other regions were below -- i mean some are above and below. i'm just trying to reconcile this with what we're seeing for some of the capex trends in these end markets.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
the way we model our printing business is actually we are not seeing today any key outliers as anders and joe mentioned earlier, you can have a vertical of particular country being an outlier in a particular quarter. but we would characterize printing as being strong across the majority of the portfolio. that was the case in q2 and that's also our assumption in the rest of the year. no particular outliers really, brian.
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then just a follow-up on a different topic. so the android business is doing very well. and these products are relatively new in your portfolio and whenever there's a new product, obviously, there's opportunity to take some of the manufacturing cost out over time. and i'm wondering is that a key lever that you might be able to pull over time as kind of optimizing the cost to manufacture these android products?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so we always look at -- we do value engineering routinely as part of our product roadmaps and look at bringing out costs and based on volume, we renegotiate pricing with our suppliers. i would say here that we have been actively doing this for some time. and the cost -- the margin position now on android products are very much in line with the margin position on our legacy windows devices. so we -- this is not something that we haven't done. this is something that we have been doing actively for some time.
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
all right. okay, thanks. that's helpful. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from keith housum with northcoast research. please go ahead.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning, guys. question for you, olivier, when you're talking through the geographical growth, it sounds like retail and healthcare continues to be a significant driver of that growth. quite honestly, it's been several years we're seeing that. and we're expecting to perhaps say t&l and warehousing and manufacturing perhaps contribute more to that growth here this year and perhaps into next year. can you provide a little more color on the growth you're seeing in those segments? and are they jumping onto the android train? or is there still a little bit time before you see it happening?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so i'll take that for you here. but first, you asked basically about t&l and manufacturing and any other kind of vertical for us. but transportation and logistics goes up very strong in q2. it's up double-digit in q2. it tends to have a very solid growth profile. if you look at the last 18 months, t&l has done very well. there is some strong secular trends that supports that. you see t&l providers are facing expedited delivery times, labor shortages. a number of new economics that comes with delivering one box every household versus a number of boxes to corporations. so all of those things are kind of being good backdrop for us to talk about how we can help introduce automation and technology to help address those issues. i think we are uniquely positioned in many ways to help our customers drive those or capitalize on those issues. in transportation and logistics, the android is having a particular play now in the warehouse transition. the warehouse is now starting to really ramp moving from microsoft to android. and we see our intelligent edge solution. so smartpack, location solutions, rfid and so forth to also be particularly well-suited for the p&l space and the warehouse and giving us thought leadership position also.
if we then move to manufacturing. manufacturing was not as quite as robust in q2. but it has performed very well over the last 18 months or so. we -- our portfolio is increasing, enabling industry folder out. so we see manufacturing as a sizable market opportunity for us. manufacturers are looking for increased visibility into their supply chain. and the android transition is also accelerating within manufacturing. also, our location solutions has manufacturing as its primary vertical market.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
i'd like to add one more thing. this is joe heel. we spoke before about the fact that of the legacy windows devices, about 10 million, we think remain to be replaced in the market. and if you look into more detail into that, our remaining installed base, we believe the majority of that is in the warehousing and manufacturing space. for a variety of reasons, those customer's have been slower to adopt those technologies. but we do expect that, that adoption will now pick up. and you see this reflected in the fact that we've released just in the past quarter the mc33 -- the mc93, i apologize, and before that, the mc33, which are the flagship devices that serve that warehousing manufacturing market. and we're seeing good adoption in that space as evidence of the android transition now focusing heavily on warehousing manufacturing going forward.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great, very helpful. and then i get this question often, i know it's a very imprecise science year. but the 9 million to 10 million mobile computers that we think still have or installed windows. that number really hasn't moved probably over the past year or maybe in 18 months that we've been talking about it. is there anymore precision that we can get on -- are you guys are getting at a number to say that, that number still remains at roughly that same range? or you still adjust, this is our best guess based on incomplete data that's out there?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
it is incomplete data, i guess, and that -- we can't go and identify each and every one of those 10 million devices. but it has come down in the numbers we've used on our calls over the last 18 months has come down. but i'd say the reason hasn't come down may be faster is that -- there was only last year that the market switch to be more -- over 50% android from microsoft. so there's still a substantial amount of legacy windows devices being sold into the market. so while we are, say, eating into the installed base from one end, we're adding to it or the industry is adding to it on the other end with new legacy devices.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
yeah, good one.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
i think the one dynamic that has perhaps surprised us a bit as well is that in those segments that still have very high penetration of windows mobile computers, our customers have continued to buy mobile computers at relatively high rates. there are some markets around the world where more than 50% of the mobile computing revenues are still in the windows category. so that's prolonged. the windows existence and -- will also prolong the transition cycle to android going forward.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so maybe i'd add a couple of questions that kind of talks about android being having peaked or being close to peaking. we certainly don't see that. we expect the android transition to continue for some time, and when you then couple that with the proliferation of new use cases and deeper penetration of devices into corporations, we believe mobile computing is going to be a good growth business for some time.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
got you. good point. and if i could just squeeze one more in here in terms of the share repurchase. did i hear you guys say that you guys are on a cap the share repurchases at 2% of the share outstanding annually? and then are you guys willing to take on additional debt to be opportunistic with the share repurchases?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so keith, you summarized it well in term of what we're planning to do. so let me give a bit of background of why the buyback. so one, we achieve now our -- the bottom of our leverage range of about 1.5. we will achieve that in the third quarter start of the fourth quarter. that's why we believe that buyback should be on the table. and we believe that the strength of the cash flow of the company will allow us to invest in the business, invest in m&a and still do a buyback. and to your point, we plan to buy back within a 12 months period, about 2% of the share outstanding. would we go higher opportunistically? we would see.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. and so -- are you willing to take on additional debt in order to fund those debt repurchases?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
we don't think we need to do that. the strength of the cash flow will allow us to finance buyback with the cash of the company.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great, thanks guys. i appreciate it.
operator
the next question comes from richard eastman with baird. please go ahead.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yes, good morning. could olivier or anders, could you just speak to pricing and price capture in the quarter? and what actions were taken if any on pricing in both the channel and quite frankly, i know and the larger projects, it is a bid process. but has pricing inched up on the large bid opportunities as well?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so we work in a competitive environment. we've had strong competitors, and it's always been a competitive market. we've been able to focus very much -- our attention on making sure that we have very compelling portfolio of solutions that are attracted to our customers, and we are certainly looking to see us getting a premium in the market. i think we have been able to achieve that for a long time. obviously, we have to compete on occasion for deals, but we've so far been able to do that well and offsetting any price pressure with additional cost reductions to maintain or even now increase our gross margins. but i wouldn't characterize that the price pressure or the competitiveness of the market is particularly different today than it was three months ago or six months ago. maybe, joe, you have any further comments?
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
our margin picture always has two parts. we already talked about the large deals, anders described that very well. and the other part is what happens in our run rate, which is the pricing of the transactions. it goes primarily in smaller quantities to distribution. and we've developed, i think, a very good level of expertise to work closely with our distributors and partners to understand exactly where the market price is and to price that in the competitive way so that we can continue to grow. and we've been pleased with our ability to realize a good pricing in that segment, while continuing to gain share.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
could i -- and just to put some clarity on that. when i look at the adjusted gross margin year-over-year, i think, it's up 100 bps, 100 basis points. is there a price capture piece of that? the price year-over-year on a consolidated basis with the channel, with the products, did it add 20 basis points to that gross margin improvement? or is there a number, olivier, that you could just slice out of that and say, look, on a consolidated basis, both through channel, through direct that we're capturing so many basis points of that 100 as price?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
it's difficult to answer with precision. we -- the strength of the margin is due to multiple drivers. the way we price the value of what we offer and also the supply chain efficiencies that i mentioned earlier. i wouldn't point to one in particular, and it's very difficult to pass all the pieces, richard.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. is -- sorry.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
no, i was going to say, we mentioned earlier software becoming a bigger part of our portfolio. that's helpful. i should also mention services has been able to improve margins quite nicely in q2. and we expect that to continue to be a strong margin contributor.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. and then could i ask again. just against that consolidated 7% core growth for the quarter. did the channel grow at or above that in the direct business? i think you alluded to some of the retail wins maybe not as great this quarter. but just a growth rate on large direct wins averse the channel? how did it look relative to the 7% core?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so one, it does change quarter-to-quarter. in q2, our direct sales were stronger than the growth in the channel. but in q1, we saw it the other way. there the channel is stronger than the direct sales of the large deals.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. okay. and just my last question. i'm looking at maybe explore revenue was a little bit below where i thought it might come in. now arguably, we just straight line the acquired revenue per quarter. but i'm curious if you could maybe just speak a little bit to the xplore acquisition and maybe what's -- how you're may be repositioning or investing in their product portfolio to whether you're expanding their adjacent markets or what's the investment strategy at xplore? and what's the hope for benefit there going forward?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes. as a reminder, first, we bought xplore to really help strengthen our broader big screen mobile computing portfolio, right. that includes xplore, our et5 portfolio tablets in our vehicle-mounted computers. and this portfolio as a whole has been growing very nicely and that includes q2. we had very good growth across the portfolio in q2. and since we acquired xplore, it has really helped us cement us as the clear number two in the rugged tablet space. we think -- we continue to think of that is a very attractive market. our new xplore products have been very well received, and we have our first android-powered xplore tablets now available in the market. the integration is going well. and we now working on really optimizing the go-to-market to help drive scale and efficiencies. we've got in all -- this is -- xplore is now available for all our partners to resell. and we're looking to see how do we capitalize also in some of the near adjacencies where xplore has some strength that hasn't been historical strengths of zebra. and joe, can help.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yeah. so perhaps you asked about, how we are investing and as you said repositioning. and i would specifically identify two things. the first, anders, just identified, which is the tablet market has additional vertical depth that outside of the core verticals that we've been talking about zebra for many quarters now. things like government, public safety and utility segments would be examples of such areas. and we are repositioning and investing in penetrating those segments, number one. and number two would be, the announcement that we just made to launch the l10 android version. i think it's a very important additional investment. why is that? because it enables us to leverage that strength that we talked about earlier. our software capabilities, our mobility dna capabilities in android, we can now leverage that into tablet space, and we think that will differentiate us. so those are two areas of investment we've made.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay, very good. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from james faucette with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
erik lapinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. this is erik on for james. thanks for taking the question. you mentioned a global customer roll-out in transportations and logistics including low-density monitoring. just wanted to ask, is this including your smartpack solution? and maybe on that, if you can talk about how trials have been progressing, if you have more color on just timing to prove roi there?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes. so that specific reference was to smartpack. and our broader portfolio of what we call intelligent edge solution, smartpack, smartlens, rfid, location solutions and so forth, is progressing nicely. we have a growing pipeline of pilots. and we're certainly working hard to make sure we can convert all of those pilots into proper commercial roll-outs over time. but we feel, we're making good progress and it's also truly helping us or position zebra as a thought leader and it pulls through a lot of our other products as well. and joe, have some more comments.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yeah. two more sort of flavors of color here. you can think about the expansion first in the way that anders mentioned going from smaller trials where we're really trying to prove the technology and also prove the roi of the solution to the customer to roll-outs that include hundreds or thousands of back doors where we now monitor the loading. and we now have multiple customers where we are rolled out in that sense. and we see that continue to expand. the other direction of expansion is there are multiple use cases within the solution. so you can monitor not only the loading of trailers, but you can also monitor the loading of air cargo containers for example. and there are other examples of how this technology and this solution can be expanded. we are doing so in both of these directions.
erik lapinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great. that's really helpful. thank you. and then maybe just if you could us get a sense of how you're thinking about your capital allocation strategy given the newly announced share repurchase program? and if that potentially impacts any plans for m&a and your strategy there?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so the priority for us is to invest in our business, either organically and inorganically. we believe that m&a would be a strong vector of growth for the company. and we believe that based upon the strong cash flow of zebra that we can invest in the business and still return excess cash to a buy back. so no big change at this stage, erik. and as we have reached now the bottom of our targeted leverage range, we believe we can do the three investments i've mentioned, organic, inorganic and buyback.
erik lapinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's great. thank you.

and our last question today comes from jeffrey kessler with imperial. please go ahead.
jeffrey kessler -- imperial capital, llc -- analyst
thank you, and thank you for getting me on the call. i wanted -- you alluded a little bit to the institutional market before. i want to know if you could update us a little bit on penetration into not just what you call safe cities, government civil projects, but also the education market, k-12 and college, which seems to be in other areas of security and tracking and aidc. we're seeing a lot of growth in that specific market [indecipherable] gestating for so long.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'll start and then joe will provide some extra color. but first, on the public safety market. that we talked about that on the call today. we think that is an attractive market opportunity for us in the range of several hundred millions of dollars. and i think its market has pushed to grow materially as rugged computers becomes a valid choice and enables new use cases there. historically, the public safety market has been made up of either kind of traditional dedicated first responder devices that you are familiar with. but also there's been a lot of consumer devices in that space. and we think that there is room for our mobile computers as well as a good way of augmenting that market and providing growth for zebra. and maybe some other thoughts from joe here.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yeah. if you look at the public sector opportunities, including education, i think, we would say we see the majority of the opportunity in the public safety first, and in government, second. i think that would be sort of our order of opportunity priority at the moment.
jeffrey kessler -- imperial capital, llc -- analyst
okay. and secondly, i'm wondering if you -- have you taken into account the -- with regard to your -- with forex guidance, the possibility that forex could be better or worse and expected in particularly places like the uk if things don't get organized there? is that in the guidance already?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
it is. and by the way, fx at the moment is a headwind. and as we've said before, we have multiple levers to manage the p&l of the company. and we believe that we can manage fx as well.
jeffrey kessler -- imperial capital, llc -- analyst
all right, excellent.

good day, and welcome to the second quarter 2019 zebra technologies earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. please note, this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to mike steele, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
michael a. steele -- vice president, investor relations
good morning, and thank you for joining us today. before we begin, i need to inform you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking and subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission.
during this call, we will make reference to non-gaap financial measures as we describe our business performance. you can find reconciliations of our gaap to non-gaap results in today's earnings press release and at the end of the slide presentation.
this presentation will include prepared remarks from anders gustafsson, our chief executive officer; and olivier leonetti, our chief financial officer. anders will start with our second quarter highlights. olivier will then provide more detail on the financials and discuss our third quarter and full year outlook. anders will conclude with progress made on zebra's enterprise asset intelligence vision. following the prepared remarks, joe heel, our senior vice president of global sales will join us, as we take your questions.
also throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from the recently acquired xplore technologies, temptime and profitect businesses. this presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com, and will be archived there for at least one-year.
now i'll turn the call over to anders.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. our team executed well and drove strong profitable growth in the second quarter. as you can see on slide 4, we reported net sales growth of more than 8% or 7% on an organic basis. and adjusted ebitda margin of 21.2%, a 150 basis point year-over-year improvement and non-gaap diluted eps of $3.02, a 22% increase from the prior year.
we continue to outpace the competition through our innovation, unmatched scale and deep relationships with customers and partners, our mobile computing, data capture and printing portfolios have never been stronger. this has been accomplished through focused r&d investment to build upon our best-in-class offerings.
we saw a broad-based global growth in q2, with solid performance both the direct and through the channel. operational discipline and cost efficiencies enabled us to accelerate profit growth without compromising our investments in our employees and growth initiatives. enterprise mobile computing was a bright spot, growing double digits, as we continue to extend our lead in the industry, through the broadest selection of android powered solutions. enterprise workers are utilizing our mobile computers for a variety of new use cases.
we are also benefiting from the multi-year transition to android from the windows operating system. organic investments in initiatives to diversify growth are paying off. for example, rfid solutions and our workforce connect software application, were additional bright spots in the second quarter. we also continue to see acquisitions as a vector of profitable growth for the company and the way to penetrate attractive adjacent market opportunities.
in the second quarter, we announced and closed on the profitect acquisition. profitect is the leading provider of prescriptive analytics, which is an attractive growth opportunity for us and advances our position as a solutions provider as well as our enterprise asset intelligence vision. overall, our solid first half performance and leadership position in the market provides us confidence in our outlook for the year.
with that, i will now turn the call over to olivier to review our financial results, discuss our outlook and our new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation afford us the ability to return capital to shareholders, while continuing to invest in our business.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
thank you, anders. let us start with the p&l. as you can see on slide 6, net sales grew 8.4% in the second quarter, which translated to 7% on an organic basis, before the impacts of currencies and acquisitions. we saw diversified growth in each of our reporting segments in most regions. enterprise visibility & mobility segment sales increased 9.2%, led by particularly strong demand in mobile computing and support services. asset intelligence & tracking segment sales increased 2.9% with growth in printing, supplies, services and retail solutions.
turning to our regions. in north america, sales grew 7%, primarily driven by strength in mobile computing, services and rfid. we saw particular strength in retail and healthcare and had some major competitive wins. emea sales increased 9% with relative strength in mobile computing and services. we saw growth across most countries. retail and transportation and logistics, were particularly strong with continued traction in rfid. sales in our asia-pacific region were up 7% with relative strength in our mobile computing and printing categories. we realized strong growth in australia, southeast asia and china. latin america sales were flat, primarily due to lower sales in mexico due to continued geopolitical weakness. adjusted gross margin expanded 100% -- 100 basis points from the prior year period, primarily driven by go-to-market discipline, as well as increased productivity and cost efficiencies, particularly in support services.
consistent with one of our key operating principle, adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 100 basis points from the prior year period. we have a balance approach of driving operating leverage, while continuing to make prudent investments in growth initiatives. second quarter 2019, adjusted ebitda margin was 21.2%, a 150 basis point increase from the prior year period. we drove non-gaap earnings diluted share of $3.02, a 22% year-over-year increase.
turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide 7. we generated $165 million of free cash flow in the first half of 2019. this was $68 million lower than the prior year period, entirely due to the increased working capital usage in the first quarter, which we previously discussed.
free cash flow generation in the second quarter was higher than the prior year period, and we expect a strong second half performance. our 1.8 times net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio is below the midpoint of our targeted range of 1.5 to 2.5 times. as anders mentioned, today we announced that our board has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. our strong balance sheet and cash flow profile enable us the flexibility to maintain our debt leverage target range, one, investing in our business, including acquisitions and repurchasing up to approximately 2% of our shares outstanding annually.
let us turn to our outlook on slide 8. we're currently cycling our prior year third quarter exceptional performance. that said, net sales growth in q3 2019 is expected to be between 3% and 5%, which assumes an approximately 2 percentage point positive impact from recent acquisitions and then approximately 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency exchanges. we believe q3 2019 adjusted ebitda margin would be approximately 22%, which assumes higher gross margin and operating expense leverage from the prior year. non-gaap diluted eps is expect -- is expected to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.35. we are maintaining our full year 2019 net sales growth to be between 5% and 8%, which assumes approximately 2 percentage point positive impact from recent acquisitions and approximately 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency rate changes.
given that we are assuming about 50 basis points additional adverse impact in fx from our prior guide, we have effectively increased our organic growth guide by approximately 50 basis points. full year 2019 adjusted ebitda margin is now expected to be approximately 22%, an improvement from 2018 and our prior guide. our team has been driving gross margin improvement and operating leverage at the high-end of our expectations.
we continue to expect that full year 2019 free cash flow will exceed $625 million. unlike 2018, we assume that working capital would be a use of cash in 2019. you can see other full year 2019 modeling assumptions on slide 8.
with that, i will turn the call back to anders to discuss the progress we are making on our enterprise asset intelligence vision.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, olivier. we are very pleased with our q2 results and the momentum we see in our business. now turning to slide 10. we are advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision to enable every frontline asset and worker to be visible, connected and optimally utilized. zebra enables this vision by providing a digital view of the entire enterprise. our products and solutions sends data from assets, products and processes. this information including status and location is analyzed in real-time to determine the best possible operational action to improve productivity and provide greater insight into business operations.
an integral part of our solutions ecosystem is savanna, our cloud enablement platform that connects our devices and powers our intelligent edge solutions. savanna benefits our partners and customers by providing visibility of workflows at the frontline of business. in june, we launched savanna data services, which delivers sensor information, data analytics and event triggers through application programming interfaces or apis to enable workflow optimization. savanna supports developers through a self-service web portal with monetizable api-based data services, which empowers our partner community and end customers to build secure, scalable, digital services with ease and speed.
it is a clear step forward in elevating our reputation as a solutions provider, enabling customers to enhance the analytics layer of the sense analyze act framework. as a proof point, dawdle, a london based e-commerce service provider has been an early user of savanna data services. they have been leveraging print from cloud apis to reduce the deployment time of its ship from store proposition.
longer term, they expect to use the blockchain ledger of savanna to distribute data across the supply chain to reduce return handling costs and get items back into inventory more quickly. we've also been advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision through acquisitions. the most recent being profitect in q2. profitect complements our growing suite of other zebra software applications including workforce connect, motionworks and our visibility services offering.
additional profitect's offerings, its technology and talented team, expands our relevancy deeper and wider in global retail operations. the solution identifies areas for improving inventory and pricing accuracy, idle stocks and sellable merchandise and assortment discrepancies. overtime, we expect to leverage profitect's artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities to address all of the vertical markets we serve.
we also intend to incorporate profitect's functionality into savanna to further build out the analyze and act layers of the platform, benefiting both zebra and our partners. the acquisitions we have made over the past year enable us to scale attractive existing categories where we are underpenetrated and enter high growth new markets outside the core, that advance us as a solutions provider. in addition to profitect, temptime has enabled us to expand our smart supplies offering into time temperature monitoring and xplore has augmented our enterprise tablet portfolio with best-in-class ultra rugged form factors.
we have made solid progress on our enterprise asset intelligence vision, as we help businesses across many industries digitize their operations and gain a performance edge. we are doing this by leveraging our deep knowledge of workflows and capitalizing on key technology megatrends including mobility, automation, cloud computing and the proliferation of smart devices and sensors, all of which create opportunities for zebra.
slide 11 highlights the range of vertical markets we serve, including healthcare, retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics and manufacturing, as well as otherattractive markets that broaden and diversify our growth opportunities. in healthcare, our fastest growing vertical, our solutions translate into more efficient operations and increased patient safety. we recently implemented a clinical mobility solution with nemours children's health system that empowers its staff to improve operations at its two hospitals, including remote patient monitoring.
this customer replaced it's smartphone consumer devices used by nurses with our healthcare purposed tc51 mobile computers to improve connectivity, durability and collaboration. we helped to provide a seamless bridge between the medical devices and electronic health records for a 360 degree real time view of patient health and status for optimal care. our improved capabilities are as a solutions provider are moving us up the stack with healthcare providers like nemours.
in retail and e-commerce, we are a trusted strategic partner with the leaders in this space. we have found that most retailers see significant opportunity for improvement with their omnichannel fulfillment capabilities as they stretch to meet consumers' heightened expectations.
our customers are deploying a wide range of increasingly complex solutions that can include rfid, professional services and software applications such as workforce connect. we are also seeing an increasing number of our customers equipping their associates and shoppers with our mobile computers that empower them with the real-time information they need to successfully execute omnichannel fulfillment and elevate the overall in-store experience.
this increase level of tech investment delivers a high roi to the customer and is necessary to compete effectively. the prominent department store chain recently chose to upgrade its mobile computers in their stores with our latest android powered tc52 model to enable their new omnichannel strategy. as this retailer rolls out our solution, we are providing professional and support services to ensure a smooth transition. we have seen many competitive takeaways like this one, with prominent retail and e-commerce players, who require a best-in-class enterprise grade solution.
in transportation and logistics, most customers site capacity utilization, labor shortages and expedited delivery requirements as top challenges they face over the coming years. by helping to drive increased productivity and efficiencies, zebra can help bring their operations to higher level with their current workforce and resources. the results of our recent warehouse vision study, show that more than three quarters of respondents say that, augmenting workers with technology is the best way to introduce automation in the warehouse. as a thought leader and trusted advisor, we are demonstrating a number of proven ways to meet this need. for example, zebra will be rolling out a solution with the global transportation and logistics customer over the next year. we will be enhancing the effectiveness of parts of delivery in europe with that solution featuring tc57 mobile computers, various professional and support services, and the monitoring of the load density of the customers air cargo containers.
in manufacturing, our customers are looking for trusted partners, who can increase their operational visibility and efficiency. a notable example can be found with a major asian contract manufacturer, who is rolling out our rfid solutions on its plant floor, to increase accuracy and reduce costs. beyond our traditional verticals, we are excited about our opportunity in adjacent markets. for example, we are well positioned to make new inroads into the federal public safety market. our tc57 and tc77 enterprise class mobile computers as well as our l10 and xslate r12 rugged tablets are now certified for use on the firstnet network. our offering is ideal for a wide variety of mission-critical applications inside and outside the four walls.
in summary, we are excited about the innovative solutions we are implementing with a diverse set of customers worldwide to address their increasingly complex business priorities. the success we are realizing in the marketplace demonstrates the progress we are making with our enterprise asset intelligence vision. we continue to focus our investments in solutions that extend our lead in the industry and drive shareholder value.
now, i'll hand the call over to mike.
michael a. steele -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, anders. we'll now open the call to q&a. we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible.

[operator instructions] and our first question will come from jim ricchiuti of needham & company. please go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you. good morning i was wondering if your q4 guidance reflects -- perhaps reflects a larger-than-normal contribution from large projects.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
our expectation for q4 is that we will have a fairly normal distribution of large deals. we certainly don't expect there to be a higher proportion of larger deals than normal.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and you cited a couple of times the strength in rfid, and i'm wondering if there's any way you can provide a little bit more color on that: the type of growth you're seeing, maybe where you're getting traction in rfid, and just your general view of that market.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. rfid is enabling our customers to gain real-time visibility into their supply chains. and we're seeing an acceleration of growth in rfid due to now being able to lower the cost of implementation, having an improved level of accuracy and enhanced software capabilities for rfid generally. companies are also much more eager to innovate around their supply chains. so that's all driving a stronger adoption for rfid. and we've invested in both the product and the go-to market sides, so we have strength in our go-to market capability, have greater reach and more skill sets in that area.
and we are seeing strong double-digit growth in our portfolio, which includes now strong performance from our fixed readers but also our handheld readers as well as industrial and mobile printers. we also have our location solutions activities. we're doing our ls. we talked of that as being up nicely in q3. and some other newer solutions like smartlens, that leverage rfid to be able to always be able to sense inventory in a retail store as an example. so overall, rfid solutions are getting much more traction and interest from our customers, and we're participating nicely in that growth.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
and one quick one. was that ups contract that you announced -- congrats on that, by the way. were you the incumbent? or was that a competitive win?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
so the contract was with usps, and we were not the incumbent.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from james faucette of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, team you have erik on for james. maybe just quick. during the quarter, you had released a couple of press releases on wins in the public safety market. is that becoming an interesting end market for you to focus on? maybe anything we should be thinking about there?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
yes, i'll start and then i'll ask joe heel to add some extra color. but yes, we think the public safety market and firstnet, as an example, are to be good incremental growth opportunities for us. those are several hundred million dollar markets that are, today, served predominantly by either very unique purpose-built devices or consumer devices. and we believe that there is a good opportunity to introduce our type of solutions in that market. and as you've seen, we've had a few press releases where we've been able to secure wins for our xplore tablets and our mobile computers and printers. so we see that as an attractive new growth market for us.
joachim heel -- senior vice president of global sales
and i would add that we've invested in resources dedicated specifically to serving the federal and state and local government entities in the united states. we also have added resources in other countries around the world to serve the market. the xplore acquisition is brought to us some of those resources because xplore, as you may know, already had a footprint in that particular area. and combined, those resources are a push for us into this attractive new segment.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
it's really helpful. and then maybe just on some of the strength that you're seeing in t&l. how much of an impact are newer solutions, like smartpack, having on that?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
so first, i'll tell you, our value propositions are resonating across all our vertical markets. and all our vertical markets are up year-to-date, so we see good growth across all of them. but a number of the challenges that our customers are seeing around having to drive increased workflow efficiencies and tight labor markets, being able to provide real-time guidance to the frontline of their business and enhancing customer and patient experiences, all of those, our solutions here are much more foundational to us being able to help our customers execute on their strategies. specifically to t&l, q3 was a particularly strong quarter for t&l for us. we're up double digits, strong double digits. we've seen very healthy secular trends that are helping to drive our growth.
expedited delivery, labor shortages, e-commerce overall with the sheer volume of deliveries are great drivers. and the t&l industry, they're introducing lot of automation and technology to help address these challenges. and i'd say we are uniquely positioned to help them with these needs. the warehouse transition to android is a great driver also in the t&l space as they have lots of warehouses obviously. and i'd say in the last year, we've actually won a number of very attractive postal contracts, where the usps being the most recent one. our -- you asked about some of our other solutions, so i'd say our intelligent edge solutions, like smartpack, location solution, rfid, wearables, they're all helping to demonstrate our thought leadership in the industry, and off a smaller base, they're growing quite nicely.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
our next question will come from brian drab of william blair. please go ahead.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
morning, thanks for taking my questions. the first one, i'm just looking at the tariffs and the guidance that you gave for the first quarter and in 2020. and am i thinking about this correctly if i just do the simple math. if you have a $20 million impact from the first quarter that we're going to see maybe a 170 or 200 basis point impact on gross margin, and maybe around a $0.25 or $0.30 eps impact? i don't know, olivier, if you could help put a finer point on that impact.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
that's correct, brian. your math is correct. at the midpoint, $20 million would be a good estimate.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
okay. and then just on the usps project, congratulations on that. and over what time period do you think that those 300,000 would be deployed?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. first, we're very pleased and proud of the trust that the usps has placed on us to be their partner in this project. this project augments our relationship with them. the usps was already a customer of other products and solutions from zebra. this is a multiyear contract. it's the largest in our history, so we're -- i'm obviously very pleased with that. the solution involves us rolling out 300,000 tc77 mobile computers, also the full suite of our mobility dna software tools, other more customized software solutions as well as managed and professional services. the -- and this is a multiyear contract, as i said, so we would expect deliveries to start ramping up in the first half of next year and go on for a couple of years, few years.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
okay, thanks a lot.
operator
the next question will come from paul coster of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
paul coster -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking my question. i'd like to sort of take brian's question a little bit further on the tariff mitigation. and it looks to me like your intention is to slowly wind down the impact of the costs through 2020. would it be fair to say that we've got something like a $50 million hit to gross margins over the course of the year, and that by the fourth quarter, you're lapping the effects of this quarter's action and will have no year-on-year degradation in gross margins?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
actually we believe that we will have mitigated substantially the impact of tariffs by midyear next year. so as we discussed earlier, we would model $15 million to $25 million impact in q1. the impact in q2 would be lower and pretty much immaterial in the second half of the year.
paul coster -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and is it your sense that the cost structure that you've achieved in reconfiguring the supply chain will be equal to or better than that, which you originally had in china, tariffs aside?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
on -- in aggregate, it would be about the same cost structure.
paul coster -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
and the next question will come from keith housum of northcoast research. please go ahead.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
pardon me mr. house i'm sorry. i had it on mute. in terms of understanding growth in the quarter, could you help us understand how much of that growth came from some of your more tangential products? so when you're talking about growing the product portfolio, how much of that's kind of moved from the newer products or the noncore products?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
well first, i'd say i think we executed very well in the third quarter. we had 3% growth, but that was on top of 15% growth in the q3 2018 time frame. we did see solid performance in north america and emea, which was partially offset by a softer spending environment in china, which really attributed to the entire shortfall. we did see particular strength in our mobile computing portfolio and services. and from a vertical perspective, healthcare, t&l were very strong. but all verticals are up year to date. and the -- our newer solutions, they're small, off a smaller base but they're growing quite nicely overall. so we're quite pleased with how we are progressing with the -- with our intelligent edge solution set.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
got it. as a follow up, moving the supply chain outside of china, can you help us understand the, i guess, the experience you guys have in doing this with your contract manufacturers? and should we be concerned at all with the risk that might be associated with any issues that may pop up that may either result in additional costs or perhaps delays in the supply chain?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
so we have long relationships with these partners. that's -- it's a handful of companies that we have worked with to assemble our printers, mobile computers in china so far. and we're basically staying with same partners, moving to other locations in southeast asia. the -- we are obviously focusing very much on both speed and making sure we can continue to have excellent quality. we're doing a number of things to minimize the risk of any disruptions.
so it's -- we are not changing the supply side on most of things. we are but changing the assembly locations, and we have a lot of experienced managers from these companies that we will augment with our own team to ramp up these facilities. so we think that this is very doable. and compared to when we outsourced our supply chain for printers back in 2010 time frame, this would be a somewhat less complex undertaking.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
and keith, 2 additional points if i may. first, the countries where we're going to go are not greenfield countries. that's point number one. and point number two, we're duplicating lines. meaning, we could always, at any time, keep supplying the u.s. market from our plants in china, if needed.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
great, thank you.
operator
our next question will come from richard eastman with robert w. baird. please go ahead.
richard eastman -- robert w baird -- analyst
yes, good morning. perhaps you could just touch on maybe the role price plays here going forward, kind of covering the delta between tariff costs and supply chain mitigation efforts. just a thought maybe around when price -- any price increases become effective. and then is there a price contribution? is it a point or 2 that plays into the fourth quarter revenue guide?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
so the -- by far, the main aspect of our tariff mitigation strategy is to move the supply chains out of china to avoid tariffs overall. we have announced some modest price increases. but the vast majority of these savings and effort goes into the moving of the lines. we, yes, we want to make sure that we compete for the long term and that we will be able to gain share and have a competitive position in the market and continue to earn our customers' trust. so we've been very selective in how we've applied price increases. so it's a modest part of the overall mitigation. it is -- but it is somewhat mitigating the impact, but it's not offsetting the impact.
richard eastman -- robert w baird -- analyst
okay. and as a component of the fourth quarter revenue guide, is it as much as a point? or is it just -- any order of magnitude there?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
it would be much lower than that, rick.
richard eastman -- robert w baird -- analyst
okay. okay. and then just a question around the u.s. postal contract. given the accessories and the device management software and the support there, is that -- are the mobile computing sales -- or put it this way. are the gross margins on that contract going to be similar to what we're currently delivering in evm?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
i would say the usps contract was a competitive process, and we had to compete on both offering the best overall value to our customers, which include a superior product but also a competitive price. so the -- but we are not able to explicitly talk about the margins on specific individual deals. but rest assured that this is accretive to our p&l and adds shareholder value to us.
richard eastman -- robert w baird -- analyst
yes. and was that a competitive advantage against some of the device management software? and was there a competitive advantage in the bidding process for that contract that goes beyond just the hardware mobile computing product?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. i think that usps and, i would say, virtually all our customers are looking at the overall offer, and software is playing a bigger part of that, as a differentiator and something that they can leverage to minimize the cost for implementing, maintaining and supporting the fleet after it has been deployed.
richard eastman -- robert w baird -- analyst
they're good.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
okay. thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from jeff kessler of imperial capital. please go ahead.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
thank you. first question is about -- on your, i guess, on your fourth quarter and year-beginning call, you talked the -- you talked about how your consultative process had begun to grow to about -- recall about 8% or so of revenues were generated by deals that were actually negotiated almost entirely at the c-suite level. and i'm wondering if you could give us an update on the ability -- on what you've done over the course of the year in basically getting -- in basically getting a top down on the best type of contract because of -- just because of a longer-lived relationship that seems to be developing.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. i don't necessarily remember the specific numbers you were quoting there. but we do have a lot of excellent relationships with the executives of many of our customers. and i think that goes back to our ability to help them solve their biggest issues, their priorities. we can help them implement their strategies much more, so they see us a much more valuable partner and, therefore, want to understand what we have to offer and how we can work together over a longer period of time, not just over delivering a specific project set. so our vision, our solution's ability to help our customers deliver on their priorities are great drivers for establishing more executive-level relationships.
joachim heel -- senior vice president of global sales
i would add 2 things. this is joe heel. over the last two years, large deals, deals that are over $1 million have been the fastest-growing segment of our business overall. and those deals generally require that we have relationships at all levels of the organization, including at the senior levels. and so we've been developing both our sales force, our partner relationships and our relationships with our customers in such a way that they can support us winning those types of deals.
and we think we've been somewhat successful in that. the other piece that's played into that is that many of the newer solutions that we've spoken about and that anders has mentioned earlier, things likes smartlens or smartpack, those are solutions aimed at solving a particular business problem. and those are generally business problems that are at the center of our customers' strategies and, therefore, have the attention of senior decision-makers in those companies. and they help us in order to build those relationships, but also to address those needs and then be successful with those types of sales.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
okay. my follow-up is when we're looking at some of the newer, smaller, faster-growing businesses, some -- obviously healthcare comes to mind and certain areas of the t&l, certain specialty areas of the t&l area. can you talk about where gross margins had been? and where they are now relative to the rest of the company? are they at company level yet? or is this the type of thing where we're going to see -- hopefully, going to see improvement going that reaches or perhaps exceeds the average gm of the company?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so jeff, a few things. one, those new solutions, despite being expanding, are growing at a much higher rate than the company average, so faster growth. and the gross margin profile of those new solutions is higher than the company average because of, as anders and also joe mentioned, because of the value we're providing, the economics for both parties, our customers and ourselves, are better.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
thank you very much. i appreciate it.
operator
our next question will come from andrew buscaglia of berenberg. please go ahead.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
hey guys can you talk a bit about the -- your initiative to drive sales from the supplies market? has that helped your margins this quarter? and generally, with the usps contract, as you deliver more sales related to ancillary products, should that help your margins longer term?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
so you asked about supplies and usps, i think? so first on supplies, that's one of our adjacent markets that we put a fair bit of effort behind to make sure we can drive attractive growth. it's been growing nicely over the last several years, and we're focusing both on adding new capabilities, new differentiation that are more in line with our enterprise asset intelligence vision. i would highlight then we have in sourced the capability of supplying rfid tags, so smart tags, as well as our temptime labels, which can indicate exposure to temperature over -- either short or longer period of times.
from a margin perspective, the overall margin profile of our supplies business is a little lower than our corporate average, but not much. and we're obviously working hard to make sure that we improve both the growth rate and the margin rate for that. for usps, it's a complete contract and includes accessories and other products. i'm not really in a position to comment specifically on the margin profile of the different subcomponents of the contract. but again, it's accretive to our bottom line and should drive attractive shareholder value returns.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
okay. and then related to -- with that usps contract, you said it was the biggest one in your history, i believe. are there other deals out there like this that you see as potentially moving forward over the next 12 to 18 months?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
so that said, there's a -- not a lot of contracts are in one signed contract gets to be this large, but we have a lot of customers that have very large installed bases, but they tend to buy more over time versus having one contract. so there's a number of customers that have substantial installed bases that are in the same ballpark as usps.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
our next question will come from jason rodgers of great lakes review. please go ahead.
jason rodgers -- great lakes review -- analyst
yes. just wanted to ask about the share repurchase. what level you have implied in your 4q guidance? and was that at the bottom of your range or very close to the bottom? what are your thoughts to accelerating share repurchase to help offset the tariff impact in the first half of next year?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so jason, we are not assuming buyback -- the impact of buyback in our eps range. the reason for this is we believe it's the best way to really describe the operational performance of the company. having said that, we expect to be in the marketing q4 to our buyback program and our level of participation will depend on stock price levels. but again, no buyback impact in the eps guide.
jason rodgers -- great lakes review -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from paul coster of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
paul coster -- jp morgan -- analyst
just want to look at the windows to android upgrade cycle. where it stands? how the competitive landscape has changed, if at all, this year? and what the duration of that upgrade cycle remains to be in your opinion?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
oh, yeah, thanks for taking my second question. yes. first, our mobile computing business continues to perform very well. we had a strong quarter in q3, and that was on top of an exceptional quarter last year. we had several drivers that are supporting that growth. the number of new use cases continues to expand. i'll tell you our software capabilities is a great driver for this. we also seeing the consolidation of multiple devices or applications on top of our devices. workforce connect is a good example of that where we -- our employees used to carry a mobile computer and a pbx wireless phone. that's now been consolidated into one device, one zebra device where the voice -- running a voice app. the trend of having a device for every worker is also a big driver.
we've seen lots of our customers want to make sure that as many of their workers are connected as they can. and today, we estimate about 1/3 of eligible employees do have a device. so we see great opportunity to continue to drive penetration deeper into our customer accounts. specific to the android transition, that continues to be a great catalyst for us. we -- there's -- we still estimate about 10 million legacy windows devices in the market, and we continue to also still enjoy over 60% market share of enterprise -- android in the enterprise. the tail side of those 10 million devices, legacy windows devices being upgraded or refreshed to android will probably be longer than what we had originally expected.
so the windows devices go out of support in 2020, but we do expect that there will be certain market or use cases or customers that will continue to leverage windows devices as there's still a fair bit of windows devices being sold into the market. but the software capabilities of our android portfolio is one of the drivers for switching people over. and the momentum we have in the warehouse, that's a big opportunity. that's kind of started more recently. we launched the mc33 and the mc93 products in the last year, and they are specifically kind of aiming at the warehouse space. so we expect that the android transition will continue to be a driver for several years to come.
paul coster -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to mr. gustafsson for any closing remarks. please go ahead.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
yes. as we wrap up, i want to thank the zebra team and for our partners for delivering another quarter of strong, profitable growth. i also want to acknowledge that this week, we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the highly successful enterprise acquisition. our team has transformed our organization and the industry, and we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us. i appreciate everyone's dedication as we continue our journey. have a great day, everyone.

operator
good day, and welcome to the q3 2019 zebra technologies earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to mike steele, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
michael steele -- vice president of investor relations
good morning. thank you for joining us today. before we begin, i need to inform you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking and subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission.
during this call, we will make reference to non-gaap financial measures as we describe our business performance. you can find reconciliations of our gaap to non-gaap results in today's earnings press release and at the end of this slide presentation. this presentation will include prepared remarks from anders gustafsson, our chief executive officer; and olivier leonetti, our chief financial officer. anders will start with our third quarter highlights. olivier will then provide more detail on the financials, discussing our fourth quarter outlook and our decision to diversify our global sourcing footprint. anders will conclude with progress made on zebra's enterprise asset intelligence vision. following the prepared remarks, joe heel, our senior vice president of global sales, will join us as we take your questions.
also throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth our year over year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from the recently acquired profit, tact, explore technologies and 10 time businesses. this presentation is being simulcast on our website and investors that's zebra calm and will be archived there for at least one year.
now i'll turn the call over to anders.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
thank you, mike. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. our team executed well and drove profitable growth in the third quarter. as you can see on slide four, we reported net sales growth of 3%, which was on top of 15% growth in the prior year period; an adjusted ebitda margin of 22.7%, a 160 basis point year-over-year improvement; and record quarterly non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $3.43, a 19% increase from the prior year.
growth in our north america and emea regions was partially offset by soft spending environment in china. however, our diversified business is enabling us to successfully navigate an uneven global macro economy. we continued to extend our lead in enterprise and enter 2020. with that, i will now turn the call over to olivier to review our q3 financial results and discuss our q4 outlook and the initiative to diversify our product sourcing footprint.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
thank you, anders. let us start with the p&l. as you can see on slide six, net sales grew 3.5% in the third quarter, which translated to 3% on an organic basis before the impacts of currencies and acquisitions. we saw growth in each of our reporting segments. enterprise visibility & mobility segment sales increased 2.7%, led by growth in mobile computing and support services. asset intelligence & tracking segment sales increased 3.5%, with growth in printing, services, location solutions and zebra retail solutions. turning to our regions.
in north america, cells grew 6% primarily driven by strength in mobile computing services and rfid. we saw particular strength in sk retail and transportation and logistics. emas sales increased 2% with quality strength in data capture, printing and services. we saw growth across must country trees return and transportation and logistics were particularly strong and we saw continued traction in rfid. cells in our asia pacific region declined 5% unfairly due to macro softness in china, latin america sales declined 2% due to fewer large orders in mexico adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis point from the prior year period, primarily driven by go to market discipline, cost efficiencies, and favorable business mix. all of which was partially offset by 20 basis points net impact from release four times.
consistent with one of our key operating principles, we drove operating leverage while continuing to make prudent investments in our growth initiatives. as a result, adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 70 basis points from the prior period. third quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda margin was 22.7%, a 160 basis point increase from the prior period. we drove non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $3.43, a 19% year-over-year increase, which includes a $0.03 eps impact from list 4 tariffs. turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide seven. we generated $376 million of free cash flow in the first nine months of 2019. this was $36 million lower than the prior year period, entirely due to the increased working capital usage in the first quarter, which we previously discussed.
free cash flow generation in the second and third quarters was higher than the prior period, and we expect a strong finish to the year. our 1.6x net debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio is near the bottom of our target range of 1.5 to 2.5x. we continue to pursue opportunities to lower our cost of debt while maintaining a flexible structure. we recently amended our credit agreement, which will lower our cost of borrowing by approximately 25 basis points as the lower pricing becomes effective in late october. this action, along with an expanded european accounts receivable factoring program, positions us for lower overall cost of debt. in q3, we repurchased $20 million of shares under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization.
our strong balance sheet and free cash flow profile provides us the flexibility to maintain our debt leverage target range while investing in our business, including acquisitions and returning capital to shareholders. like many other technology companies, we have been sourcing the vast majority of our products from china. on slide eight, we provided a detailed update on the impacts of -- to zebra from the section 301 tariffs on products imported to the u.s. as previously mentioned, zebra is paying a 25% tariff on list 1 through 3, which includes certain scanners, components and accessories. we have substantially mitigated these tariffs through a combination of supply chain moves and pricing adjustments. starting midyear, we began executing on an initiative to diversify our global sourcing footprint to mitigate list 4 tariffs that were announced in august, which impacts mobile computers and printers.
we are working with our contract manufacturing partners to replicate production lines in order to move most of our u.s. volumes to broader asia. these actions are expected to result in up to $30 million of onetime pre-tax charges through mid-2020, plus between $10 million to $15 million of capital expenditures. with these supply chain actions, along with modest price adjustments announced in september, we expect to substantially mitigate list 4 tariffs by midyear 2020. in the fourth quarter, we expect these tariffs to negatively impact gross profit by $5 million to $10 million. the impact is expected to peak in the first quarter at between $15 million and $25 million, as we realize a full quarter of impact, and should moderate through mid-2020 as we launch alternate sources of supply. had we have taken no action, we would face greater than $100 million of annualized tariff duties. let us turn to our outlook on slide nine. net sales growth in q4 2019 is expected to be between 4% and 6%, which is on top of an 11% nominal growth in the prior year period. this outlook assumes an approximately 1 percentage point positive impact from recent acquisitions and an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency changes.
we believe q4 2019 adjusted ebitda margin would be between 22% and 23%, which assumes operating expense leverage and a lower gross margin entirely attributable to a $5 million to $10 million expected net growth margin impact from list 4 tariffs. non-gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.75. the estimated negative net tariff impact is between $0.08 and $0.15, and we're assuming a negligible impact from share repurchases. that said, we will be opportunistic with our share repurchase program. we continue to expect that full year 2019 free cash flow will exceed $625 million. you can see our other full year 2019 modeling assumptions on slide nine. with that, i will turn the call back to anders to discuss the progress we are making on our enterprise asset intelligence vision.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and a director
thank you, olivier. we expect to finish the year strong despite an uneven macroeconomic environment and incremental tariffs. now turning to slide 11. we are leveraging our deep knowledge of workflows to help businesses across many industries digitize their operations. technology megatrends, including mobility, automation, cloud computing and the industrial internet of things are enabling us to drive new use cases and transform the workflows of our customers. we serve a wide range of vertical markets, including retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing and healthcare as well as other attractive markets that diversify our growth opportunities. retail continues to be a vibrant vertical end market, according to third-party research firm, ihl group.
there's also significant investment by retailers to improve omnichannel capabilities to meet increased customer expectations. we are a trusted strategic partner with many of the leading retailers and e-tailers. recently, a major u.s. grocer selected zebra to roll out 39,000 of our tc52 mobile computers over the next two years. store managers, department heads and associates will utilize them to -- for multiple in-store applications, including customer service, inventory management, out of stocks, planogram compliance, backdoor receiving and store audits. another solution that is enabling retailers to drive a higher level of inventory accuracy is rfid, which we have been deploying to improve our customers' omnichannel capabilities. in the transportation and logistics space, we are seeing particularly strong demand for our solutions.
for most it and operational decision-makers, labor recruitment and productivity are top challenges in the increasingly on-demand economy. with innovative solutions to drive increased productivity and efficiencies, zebra can bring their operations to a higher level with their current workforce and resources. we have secured a substantial number of global business wins recently, including our largest deal of all time with the u.s. postal service, where we will help them deploy 300,000 tc77 mobile computers over the next several years. this solution will feature our mobility dna suite of software tools that increase worker productivity and strengthen data security. we will also provide accessories, help desk support, repairs, maintenance and software applications and development. in manufacturing, our customers are looking for trusted partners who can increase their operational visibility and efficiency.
more than 80% of manufacturers plan to implement just-in-time operations within the next five years. being able to stock only the items they need reduces inventory cost and waste. we are pleased that 3 leading north america dairy manufacturers recently chose zebra's new tc77 mobile computers and zq520 mobile printers to enhance their direct store delivery workflows. the global healthcare system is facing significant challenges, including staff shortages, rising costs and life-threatening medical errors. health care providers are turning to zebra's technology to improve patient safety, increase staff workflow efficiency and comply with new regulations. we were recently awarded our largest european order of healthcare-purposed tc52 mobile computers. this healthcare facility handles blood donations across more than 75 centers. we enabled the customer to automate the patient journey and benefit from our superior product and software life cycle management. now turning to slide 12.
we are building upon our strong foundation, expanding our role as a solutions provider. zebra is uniquely positioned to deliver enterprise asset intelligence, which is our vision to enable every frontline asset and worker to be visible, connected and optimally utilized. we pursue this vision by advancing our capabilities in the sense, analyze, act framework. our products and solutions sends data from assets, products and processes, providing a digital view of the enterprise. this information, including identity, location and status, is analyzed by growing -- by the growing set of software solutions from zebra or our industry-leading channel partner and developer ecosystem, which then drives directed action naturally within frontline workflows.
as we discussed last quarter, our organic investments and acquisitions have been enhancing our capabilities on the sense, analyze, act spectrum. savanna, our data intelligence platform, connects our devices and powers our intelligent edge solutions. savanna benefits our partners and customers by providing visibility of workflows and giving perishable frontline data a home so it can be leveraged via machine learning and artificial intelligence to generate new insights that drive business performance. as we have discussed, our acquisitions are advancing this vision, including temptime's temperature intelligence solutions and xplore's ultra-rugged tablets.
additionally, profitect's prescriptive analytics solution complements a growing suite of other zebra software applications, including workforce connect, motionworks and our visibilityiq managed services offering. looking ahead, we are focused on investing in key growth areas that are adjacent to our core business and where we have the right to play. these include computer vision, machine learning, artificial intelligence and intelligent automation. computer vision is an exciting emerging sensing technology that enables the automatic extraction and understanding of useful information from a digital image or video. zebra currently utilizes aspects of computer vision in new offerings such as smartpack. however, we see substantial opportunities that are not yet sufficiently addressed in the marketplace.
because of this, we are investing in experienced engineering talent with the skill set and capabilities to address emerging computer vision use cases in various vertical markets. for example, in retail, computer vision, software and tools can be used to assess inventory levels, support shelf scanning, monitor checkout activity and enable frictionless checkout. artificial intelligence and machine learning are critical to building out our analytical tools and capabilities. our acquisition of profitect and their talented team expands our relevancy deeper and wider in retail. and over time, we will expect to leverage their capabilities to address additional vertical markets. we also intend to incorporate profitect's functionality into savanna to further build out the analyze and act layers of the platform. the rise of computer vision and analytics is driving a wave of intelligent automation, which is also a natural extension of our vision.
unlike repetitive automation, intelligent automation leverages our sense, analyze, act framework to improve workflow efficiency with or without human involvement. a key example is our recent venture investments in companies that specialize in the collaboration of humans and robots to fulfill orders in the warehouse. we look forward to showcasing new zebra solutions that leverage these enabling technologies at the upcoming national retail federation trade show in january. our customers' demand information about what is happening at the operational edge of their business so they can run smoother, safer and smarter. as a thought leader, zebra is being requested by customers worldwide to address their increasingly complex business priorities. we are responding to this call by continuing to focus our investments in solutions that extend our lead in the industry, advance us as a broader solutions provider and ultimately drive shareholder value.
now i'll hand the call back over to mike.
michael steele -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, anders. we'll now open the call to q&a.
",2019-Q3,ZBRA
1.0,1.0,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] the first question will come from jim ricchiuti of needham & company.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you. two questions, first, i wanted to just talk a little bit about the strength you're seeing in the order book entering 2020, i'd like to know, particularly, which areas of the business and geographies. and then i have a follow-up question as it relates to some of the color you're providing with respect to the coronavirus risk. so just on -- first on the areas of the business where you're seeing the strength. it sounds like good strength in rfid, but i wonder if you could talk a little bit more about it and the sustainability of that strength. thank you.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you. first, i think we -- our team executed very well in q4, we were up almost 5% and that was on top of a 9% growth in 4q '18. so we had a very tough compare. we saw very solid performance in north america and emea. that was offset by softer spend environment, particularly in china. we did see particular strength in our mobile computing portfolio, but also in services and rfid, as you mentioned. we grew all our vertical market -- verticals that we serve, led by healthcare as the fastest with strong double-digit growth followed by retail transportation logistics and manufacturing and for the full year 2019, all verticals we're up also. so we have a very diversified business which is enabling us to post solid growth despite now being in a more uneven global macroeconomic environment. and i guess lastly, we're quite confident that we grew share in 2019.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
and so you see those trends as with respect to your guidance-- those same trends are playing out in your q1 outlook.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think we have a good outlook for the first quarter of 4% to 7% growth. and that's over an 8% growth of the last year. we entered the year with a solid backlog, we have healthy inventory levels in the channel and so we expect now faster year-over-year growth starting to kick in here faster than q4, and we continue to see north america and emea as the strongest geographies for us and we also currently expect china to continue to show softness. i don't know, go-to-market side, i think we have good discipline around our offerings and pricing and our value proposition continues to resonate well. for the first quarter, though, we aren't expecting the usps to participate, that roll out will start in q2.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. thank you, anders for that. and just with respect to the coronavirus, i think we all appreciate the challenges of trying to forecast the business with these fast moving developments. but i'm wondering, as you see the business now, are you -- does your guidance for q1 anticipate any revenue potentially shifting out into q2? i mean, you've highlighted some additional freight expense and then the $0 million to $50 million impact that you identify on sales, is that -- i wonder if you could talk a little bit about whether that is more supply chain related or potentially demand related that you're anticipating. thank you.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
let me answer to this question, jim. so as you indicate that the situation is obviously very fluid. we have new news every day. our base case or the 47% growth for q1 assumes the impact of the coronavirus as we know it. so for example, we have reflected shifting demand, lower demand in china, additional freight cost and to give you a bit more colors on what is going on with our supply chain, our teams are taking their pills pretty much multiple times a day, all our tier 1s, our key partners are back to work and ramping productions. our tier 2 partners are largely back to work and ramping production every day. and our supply chain is operating with some manageable bottleneck. so the situation is fluid and we believe we can manage the impact of the virus as we know it. if we were to have an impact in q1, we don't think it would be the case, on top of what we put in the guide. we believe that the impact will be timing and that our full year guide would be intact.
now, let me comment on the additional $0 million to 50 million additional potential risk on the top-line. again, that's not our expectation. our expectation is that we would be able to mitigate the impact of the tariff as we know it, but if the ramp of our production was not to be as per our expectation, we wanted to give you some bookends about the potential impact and we size the impact to $0 million to $50 million, again would be timing if that unlikely scenario was to materialize.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
okay, then just one thing to add to that. we've talked on earlier calls about our supply chain diversification strategy to mitigate the impact of tariffs. so our manufacturing in vietnam and malaysia for printing and mobile computing is now ramping up and would have an impact on the quarter also.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question will come from meta marshall of morgan stanley.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks. maybe first question just on -- you mentioned the usps deal coming in, in the second quarter. and just maybe what explicit you've built into the year as far as that deal, just given the size and magnitude. and then maybe second question just -- you're below kind of your net debt target at this point. so just how -- and you are going to generate a meaningful amount of free cash flow in the next year. so just how are you thinking about use of free cash? thanks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so, yeah. thank you. i'll start with the usps part. so first, we are very proud of our usps win. that's a big win for us and it augments the relationship we had with usps. they were already customer of our other product and solutions before. the specific solution helps the usps optimize the visibility of package delivery and also the execution across their carrier network. this is a multi-year contract. it's the largest in the history of the company and i think it highlights the strength of our value proposition here. the award includes our tc77 mobile computers, mobility dna, some custom software, as well as, managed and professional services. the ramp-up is -- it will start in q2 and the -- our outlook assumes the majority of orders will be deployed in 2021.
we've taken a prudent view here and only included the orders that we have visibility into our 2020 outlook. as the u.s. 3g cellular service providers will be ending 3g service at the end of 2021, that is definitely a consideration for the roll-out cadence and we expect that the usps will basically be done by, with the entire roll-out, before the end of 2021 to make sure that they have devices they can work on, on the 4g network. and i said -- maybe come back to that later, but we won a lot of other good postal service wins that joe can pick up on.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yeah, just as additional context, right, postal services around the world are making the transition that many of our customers are making from windows-based to android-based devices and we've been fortunate to participate in and win the largest tenders in each of the four regions we participate in. in asia, we won the largest deal, which you know about with australia post, in latin america, earlier in 2019, we won the largest deal there. and recently we've also won the largest deal in the european postal system, all of which have transitioned to our android computer. so postal service is one of those areas of strength for us at the moment.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
let me cover your cash allocation question. so as you indicated, as you related to, our leverage ratio at the end of the year was 1.3 times net debt to ebitda, the lowest since the enterprise acquisition. our business has a strong cash flow generation, we would be investing in the business organically, but also deploy our cash through m&a and also investments in our venture fund. we also will deploy cash to a buyback program. as a reminder, we have -- we had an authorization for $1 billion buyback authorization. we bought to date about $47 million and we would be in the market this year. we believe that, over the year, we'd buy back above 2% of the market cap of the company and we would be more opportunistic in a particular quarter, based upon the behavior of our stock price. but the guide for eps in q1 does not assume any impact from buyback.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thanks, guys.
operator
the next question will come from brian drab of william blair.
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i just wanted to ask following those comments, anders about the usps. the majority of orders you said would be delivered in 2021. this is, well, public knowledge that this is a $570 million max contract, it doesn't seem like it's impacting the 2020 year as much as -- at least i was expecting, i mean, i was thinking maybe this is like a $150 million a year and would add three points of the growth rate in 2020. it doesn't look like you've incorporated that much in the 2020, given it's starting in the second quarter. but when you say the majority in 2021 in the contract, should we -- like those devices should be delivered by the end of 2021. i think some people including me -- i'm being left with the impression that maybe this could be like $400 million or $300 million plus in revenue in 2021 just from this contract. and i -- can you just help us reconcile that if i'm way off?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
well, first the -- we have a -- basically looked at the delivery schedule that we have received from the usps which is the baseline we have for what we've included in 2020 and that assumes that the majority of orders will be delivered next year. now there is certainly an opportunity that some of that can be pulled in, but that's not part of our base case, we want to -- our base case is that whatever they have told us today will be as the -- as their projected delivery schedule is what we put in our guide and our outlook. but there is -- no, there is opportunities that can be better.
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
but...
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
yeah, we will consider -- we would consider the hold up assumptions we have factored in the guide to be prudent.
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
well, i need -- i'm looking for more specifics than just that. you know what i mean? i think that if you say what you said so far in the call, i guess i would reasonably model it like $400 million in revenue from 2021 from this contract.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
yeah. that's the best information we can...
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
is that -- and is there any shipment to this contract you think beyond 2021 or it's pretty much, you said it's done really with deliveries by the end of '21?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
in there is -- there can be deliveries afterwards, true, there includes, also, other parts of it, repairs and other services that could come with it and they have the opportunity to continue to replace damaged devices or buy beyond what they have initially said. so the contract doesn't end at the end of 2021 and the number they have put out in the --the total dollar volume put out by the usps envisions that this is not a two-year contract but a longer contract.
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay. is it possible that you could have deliveries that total more than $300 million in revenue to this contract in 2021?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i don't think we want to comment on the specific dollar amounts for this contract. we can kind of -- we've tried to share what we know today and what we think is a prudent outlook for 2020 and i think we have to leave it at that.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
and, brian we have also a few large accounts as part of the portfolio as well. so usps is obviously one of them, but not the only one.
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
all right. it's the only one that i saw a $570 million figure associated, that's why i'm asking about it and it's the largest in the company's history, as anders has mentioned. so, and then just where are you with the 15 -- where is the industry with the $15 million figure in terms of the upgrades? what's your latest view or comment on that? thanks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, so the -- on android, broadly, as i've said, we have a number of good drivers for the android business, i'd say three clear strong drivers. first, we will be around new use cases. if you go back and look at the number of applications or use cases, our customers used mobile computers for, say five years back, it was probably mid single-digits. today, most of our larger customers are probably more like 50, 60 different use cases and applications and we think that is going to continue to expand. so that's been a great driver. the android transition from the legacy windows operating systems continues. there were several of the older windows os versions that went out of support at the end of january of this year. our best estimate is that there is still approximately 10 million legacy windows devices in the market that needs to be upgraded. our market share in android continues to be very strong at 60-plus percent and the warehouse migration there is still gaining momentum, i'd say, and a great opportunity for us.
at the second half of last year, certainly in q4, we did start to see also, i guess, a new driver and that's android refreshes. so it's now five years since we started shipping android and some of those devices are now getting ready for a refresh. the earlier devices we had don't have the memory or processing capabilities to support all the different use cases, all the different applications our customers are putting on it as well as the processing requirements required by -- to run the newer -- the most recent android versions.
and lastly, i'd say, also, as a new trend we're seeing is, our customers are looking for to deploy mobile computers much more densely or deeply into their organizations, they are looking to have basically a device into the hand of every employee, particularly in healthcare and retail. we are expanding our portfolio of solutions to enable our customers to have the right device for the right worker, where we can then generate a positive roi for them in those areas. we have had an order in q4 from a large u.s. retailer, which included our new ec30 device, which was intended to be basically deployed to all their employees. and that drives also a lot of workforce connect applications because most of those applications of use cases are predicated on driving greater collaboration between store employees or inter-store employees and customers.
brian drab -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay, thank you for all that detail. i appreciate it.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah.

the next question will be from keith housum of northcoast research.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning, guys. i was hoping for a little bit more color on the guide. if -- it looks like the full year guide is actually a little bit more conservative than the first quarter. especially, i can appreciate the fact that the postal service will be more back-end loaded sort of 2021, but still it should add, i think, approximately a few points of growth for the third and fourth quarter and you have easier comps you are going against. so what are you seeing on the horizon, i guess, that gives your full year guidance and perhaps a little bit lower than what we might expect based on the first year guidance -- first quarter guidance?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so we believe -- so as you indicated, keith, most of the usps order will be deployed next year. we believe that for the remaining of the year that this outlook is prudent. it's going to be a more than respectable growth based upon what we see in the market, based upon the strength of our go-to market, based upon the strength of our product and solution offering, we believe that we should be able to deliver this prudent rest of the year guide, keith.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
okay. so are you forecasting processes -- the overall demand market to actually be decreased or they kind of maybe get a litlle bit worse? is that part of your expectations for economic growth?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
that's not the case. so far, if you look at the performance of zebra, q4 of 2019 was stronger than q3. q1 guide is going to be stronger than q4. so, we see an acceleration of the business. but based upon the various macro events and other phenomenon happening in the market, we believe it's the most prudent approach to guide in the way we did.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
okay. and a follow-up question for you on operating expenses. r&d was up, sales and marketing was up perhaps a bit more than we thought. are those increases, i guess, quarter-over-quarter, is that more due to acquisitions or was there perhaps a change in intent in r&d to increase investment there?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so if you look at opex as a proportion of revenue, we have been scaling that ratio significantly every quarter, actually even more in q4. if you look at the r&d line, we indeed add the impact of acquisitions playing out in the quarter. but the key principle we have in mind as we manage the p&l of the company is to scale opex as a proportion of revenue rather than looking only at opex. and we have been able to do that every quarter, mainly in q4, actually.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
all right, thank you.
operator
the next question will come from richard eastman of robert w baird.
rick eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yes, good morning. olivier, could you just double back for a second to the gross margin degradation we saw in the quarter and maybe just provide a little bit of color around both ait and the evm decline year-over-year in basis points? if you could just sift through that a little bit, you mentioned tariffs, you mentioned this large order. was that in the mobile computing side? and just maybe sift through that a little bit just to give us a sense of maybe that -- it's an unusual number here and not to model that kind of going forward.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
absolutely. so as you indicated, and i would go through the details in a second. the q4 margin profile wise was exceptional and the guide for q1 and the full year of 2020 implies us going back to normal. so going back into the details, richard, we -- relative to the implied guide we had for q4, our margin rate was lower by about 1 point. as i indicated in my prepared remarks, this 1 point degradation is due to large margin orders that we have to shift to meet our customer year-end budget demands. that impacted ait and evm but mainly mobile computers.
and if i was to go through the various elements of impacts trying to bridge the point, the lower point we had a margin relative to our guide, the impact of higher tariffs than expectations were about 40 basis point. the impact of higher freight as we had to expedite those large orders, the impact was about 20 basis point and the lower margin due to the mix of large orders was about 40 basis points. so you see the full impact, the full break of the one point. now we are working all the time on initiatives to improve gross margin. we believe we have a nascent set of activities, we will launch in 2020 to improve gross margin. we could go into the details, if you want, richard, and we feel definitely that q4 was an exceptional point.
rick eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
could you -- when you look out to '20, for the full year in '20 and you look at the gross margin, perhaps year-over-year, would you expect you're taking out some of the cost of the tariff and the supply chain that comes out of the adjusted number? so should we expect to see 20 to 40 basis points of gross margin improvement for the full year when we look out to 2020?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so we believe that we will increase gross margin 2020 over 2019, net of the elements you mentioned, so tariffs and exceptional freight cost. and why am i saying that? let me give you maybe a few examples of the levers we're using. so from a pricing standpoint, for example, we have been addressing more and more reach verticals part of the market, healthcare being one of them, for example. we have been deploying resources to maximize, this is actually not the only one, the segment mix improvement will drive margin up. that would be one.
we're also launching a new tool, we have been piloting this tool now for about a year. the new tool for pricing transactional orders using machine learning has been launched, as we speak. we believe that, that will improve our margin profile as well. and from a cogs standpoint, very quickly, we are designing to value our products that has been a constant with platforming also, our various products are using the same platform across various product lines and one which will have also a material impact on the margin profile for 2020 is that we have reset our service network outside north america. and that will significantly improve the margin of our service business and now more so a material impact on the margin of zebra as a whole. so again a nice set of activities to keep improving the margin profile of the business as we have done now for a number of years.
rick eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
and just -- maybe just one last question along similar lines here, but as we have moved production out of china into vietnam, i think you mentioned malaysia, does -- number one, does that -- is that mostly mobile computers and printers or are there scanners being done there? and then just by definition, is that movement to vietnam and malaysia, do you pick up some basis points of gross margin or lower cogs on that movement out of china just structurally?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so, i'll take this one. so first, the objective here is to move u.s.-bound volume out of china to ensure we can mitigate tariffs. we are moving out our printing volume to vietnam, and most of our mobile computing volume to malaysia, but also going to some other countries. on the scanning side, that was already outside of china. that was in -- we manufacture our scanners in mexico and in taiwan, primarily. but with these programs looking to wrap up by middle of this year, we would expect to largely mitigate all the tariff impacts.
from an ongoing gross margin perspective, we think of them as neutral today, while, say, labor cost might be a little lower in vietnam. early on, we will have a little bit more freight cost moving piece parts and other components into vietnam. but over time, we will work on making sure that we get that to be an improvement to our gross margins.
rick eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. excellent. thank you.
operator
the next question will come from paul coster of j.p. morgan.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, this is paul chung on for coster. thanks for taking my questions. so just a follow-up on mobile computers. are you still kind of selling windows-based mobile computers and is that kind of keeping the opportunity at 10 million units? and then you mentioned you're seeing more android refreshes happening, suggesting maybe a lifecycle of five years. is this kind of a shorter lifecycle than your legacy products and what are the main factors kind of driving that refresh, assuming this contribution is quite low at the moment kind of relative to your new deployments? if you could confirm that as well. and i have a follow-up.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
all right, i'll see if i -- hope that i can remember. i'll start with the the -- if we are selling microsoft devices into the markets still? and the answer is yes. we -- i think it was 2017 for us where we switched over to make android at the highest volume of our business, but we do still sell and support our customers who have existing deployments of microsoft devices. but it's fair to say that i don't -- i can't think of a large new customer that have selected windows. it is basically to service the existing installed base of those accounts and over time, they are -- i would say, they are all looking to migrate to android. now we have the, i'd say, the highest proportion of our volume in android. so if you look at other players in the industry, they are still selling more windows devices and some of them are selling more windows than android even. and if you look at some markets like asia, windows is still quite a strong platform there. it might seem a little counterintuitive as some of those software packages have gone out of support, but that is what we're seeing.
so on the one hand, we are eating into the 10 million legacy devices by shipping new android devices, but on the other end of that volume, we and others are adding new windows devices also.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
and just to complement, we see that as a positive trend. we have been able to post a strong sales performance in mobile computing despite the market still buying a lot of windows due to, as we said earlier, new use cases, and also a device for hold being a new trend in this part of the market.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
and i'll also touch on the android refresh and then i'll ask joe heel here to add in some more color. but on the android refresh, we started shipping our tc55 and mc40s about, give or take, five years back. those devices bode on the, say, longevity in the market, wear and tear, but maybe more so based on the memory capacity processing speed and so forth are no longer able to support our customers objectives. our customers are looking to deploy many more applications which all use memory and processing speed and also if you're looking to upgrade to newer current android versions, they all require more memory and more processing speed.
so -- i think this is a fair comment around android overall that the refresh rate will be higher than for windows devices. there is a lot more innovation going on around the android platform than there was historically even when windows was, say, a fresh and the default operating system platform for the industry. so we do expect to see a higher level of android refreshes than we did on or shorter lifecycle for our android devices than we did for windows.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yeah. perhaps there's some additional color on that. i think you are seeing five-year lifecycles at this point, but we do see customers making their roi calculations often with three-year time horizons now. so we do expect that the life expectancy that our customers will have will trend in that direction.
and if you think from the customer perspective, you'll -- we would say -- we would cite three things that customers are saying are driving them to these refreshes. one is applications. there is a significant increase in applications that customers are putting on our devices where they originally may have used to adjust for inventory management, now they use it for a customer application, they use it for voice communications. there is a significant increase of those applications. number two, with those applications come new demands on the technology. the technologies need more memory, as anders was saying, in addition to the inherent technology requirements, driven by the ongoing android upgrade cycles, right? those are on very short 18 months or so intervals. and then the last piece is reuse cases that are being put on devices all the time where they're being used for purposes that five years ago were not even being envisioned. so all three of those are driving the increased refresh -- shorter refresh cycle and increased refresh volume.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks for that. and then switching gears on new products, particularly the kind of new automated robots you were showcasing at nrf, do you have any kind of customers highlighting that solution in groceries, and are you seeing any kind of actual demand to deploy these solutions or are we kind of bit early? and then if you could also provide an update on smartpack solution for trailers. do you see any momentum there? just kind of want to get a sense for solutions in the pipeline, kind of newer solutions and which ones you think will have the biggest impact in the near term. thank you.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
first, i'd say that our new solutions is going to be intelligent edge-type solutions, have been growing very nicely for the last several years. so obviously off a smaller base, but the growth rate has been quite attractive and met with our internal expectations for 2019. at nrf we showcased a number of new solutions. we had our smartsight solution with our ema robot. we had our mp7000 flatbed scanner with color camera, we had smart edge with our heads-up displays, so you saw a number of new solutions that are quite different from the type of solutions that the industry has offered before. on smartsight, first that -- we've been developing that for several years, we have it in pilots with some large customers. so we certainly expect that there'll be demand for it. we are working with a number of our customers to figure out how can we be best introduced into their environments.
and our smart edge with the heads-up display, that's, i think, a very attractive solution. it helps to really modernize the whole interface with warehouse management systems and drive great productivity improvements and the heads-up display is just one way that we can render those benefits, but they can be done in a variety of other ways also. and i think, joe, can add some additional value on how we've been doing with customers on these.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
sure. so first of all with the -- you also asked about smartpack. smartpack is one of the solutions we have great expectations for. and we introduced that with a large u.s. lead customer where we have a very broad deployment with tens of thousands of dock doors deployed and we now have several other customers that are piloting this in an advanced mode and we have one customer now in europe, which is a significant milestone to take this to another continent, that is broadly deploying this across their european network of thousands of dock doors. so we're confident about the smartpack solution being one of the successful ones.
the other two that are worth mentioning in our ief portfolio of solutions are rfid. rfid, we've had this in the prepared remarks, has been extremely strong for us for quite some time. we believe this solution has reached a tipping point and the other one we would mention is workforce connect as a solution for collaboration that leverages our mobile computers has also been a very strong solution for us in across multiple large customers.
paul chung -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
the next question will be from andrew buscaglia of berenberg.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hi, guys. a quick question on -- so you made the comment that you saw some more share gains in 2019, which is -- it's -- i think that's fairly well known, but it's sort of a double-edged sword in that i'm trying to get a sense on your pricing and your pricing power this year. do you have concerns that your competition will maybe use pricing as a lever, and i guess what fortifies you from side stepping that?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so, if i understood you correctly, you're asking if our competition is using pricing as a lever to compete against us?
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yes and if that is a concern of yours, given you're selling...
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, well, it's a competitive -- first it's a competitive market. we are working in some very attractive but competitive markets and price is definitely a factor. now, that's not new. i wouldn't say that pricing is anymore competitive today than it has been historically. we try to differentiate ourselves by making sure that we have the best solutions, first and foremost, and we tend to win with a premium over our competitors. so we -- i think our -- for a variety of reasons, the breadth of our solutions, the innovation around our solutions and some of the uniqueness that we have that others can't match, enables us to get that extra premium. it's not intimate, but it is a meaningful premium. and then, joe, maybe you...
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
i'll add two things. so we do pay significant attention to the subject of pricing. i'll give you two specific examples or data points. one is in the mobile computing area where we have the majority of -- we have had some of the significant share gains, we talked about earlier. the majority of those deals are done on, what we would call, a price concession, so special prices given to our customers. and we have a great discipline within the company of managing those price concessions. and so we pay a lot of attention to that from a sales management perspective.
the second thing you heard in the prepared remarks that we're introducing some capabilities in the pricing area and we are deploying some software and capabilities that allow us to manage pricing at a very granular level, precisely because this is a very important lever for us.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
got it. okay, that's helpful. and, olivier, you mentioned pushing more into the software and services. it's obvious that's kind of the route you guys are going long term, but do you care to talk about or do you have an internal vision or target of where you see that as a percentage of your portfolio? and then, i guess, what's the strategy? do you still want to get out with more products like more things like smartsight before you really go all-in focus on that side of the business or will we continue to see software kind of roll-out in tandem with products?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so if you look at the service and software part of the portfolio, it has been, particularly this year, growing at a higher rate than the overall company average. the reason for this, as you start to have a sense, is based upon all the new capabilities we are launching and being as a company, a true orchestrator of our customer's workflows and that drives an increase in the revenue for this part of the market, but also an increase in the profile for -- margin profile for the company overall because of this impact. where that could go? those markets are large and we are excited about our ability to win and play in those markets.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
all right, thanks guys.

operator
good day and welcome to the q4 and full year 2019 zebra technologies earnings conference call. all participants will be in listen-only mode. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. please note this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to mike steele, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
michael steele -- vice president, investor relations
good morning and thank you for joining us today. before we begin, i need to inform you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking and subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission.
during this call, we will make reference to non-gaap financial measures as we describe our business performance. you can find reconciliations of our gaap to non-gaap results in today's earnings press release and at the end of this slide presentation. this presentation will include prepared remarks from anders gustafsson, our chief executive officer and olivier leonetti, our chief financial officer. anders will begin by discussing our fourth quarter and full year highlights. then olivier will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our 2020 outlook. anders will conclude with recent progress made on advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision. following the prepared remarks, joe heel, our senior vice president of global sales will join us as we take your questions.
also throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from the recently acquired cortexica, temptime, and profitect businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. this presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. now, i'll turn the call over to anders.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. our team drove profitable growth in the fourth quarter. as you can see on slide 4, we reported net sales growth of 4.6%, adjusted ebitda margin of 21.4%, which expanded by 30 basis points, and non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $3.56, a 15% increase from the prior year. we posted a record level of eps, although it was at the lower end of our guidance range due to tariff expenses at the high end of our expectations and prioritizing a higher mix of large mobile computing year-end budget orders, each of which impacted gross margin.
our diversified business is enabling us to post solid growth despite an uneven global macro economy. the continued soft environment in china was more than offset by growth in our north america and emea regions. we grew all our major verticals led by healthcare, retail and transportation and logistics. we drove double-digit growth in our enterprise mobile computing portfolio which capped another exceptional year. our customers utilize our mobile computing solutions for new use cases on the android platform as we benefit from our leadership in the transition from the sun-setting windows operating system.
we also continued to drive higher service attach rates on our product sales, which bodes well for future quarters. rfid was another bright spot in the quarter, growing strong double digits. lower operating expenses enabled us to expand ebitda margin, despite transitory tariff expenses that weighed on gross margin. by mid year, we will have a more diversified sourcing footprint, which will enable greater operational flexibility and mitigate the tariffs.
in q4, we acquired cortexica vision systems to accelerate our computer vision capabilities, which i will discuss later on the call. for the full year, zebra delivered solid results with 5.5% sales growth, 90 basis points of adjusted ebitda margin expansion, 18% non-gaap eps growth and $624 million of free cash flow. we continue to build upon our industry-leading offerings by investing in innovative technologies that elevate our role in enabling the intelligent enterprise. we are entering 2020 with a solid order backlog and we are optimistic that we can drive another record year of performance. with that i will now turn the call over to olivier to review our q4 financial results and discuss our 2020 outlook.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
thank you, anders. let us start with the p&l. as you can see on slide 6, net sales grew 4.8% in the fourth quarter, which translated to 4.6% on an organic basis before the impacts of currencies and acquisitions. we saw growth in each of our reporting segments. enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales increased 6.3%, led by growth in mobile computing and support services. asset intelligence and tracking segment sales increased 1.2% with relative strength in services and zebra retail solutions.
turning to our regions, in north america, sales grew 8%, primarily driven by strength in mobile computing, services, and rfid. we saw broad-based strength across our primary vertical markets. emea sales increased 4% with relative strength in mobile computing and services. eastern and southern europe were bright spots in the quarter. sales in our asia-pacific region declined 8%, primarily due to continued macro softness in china due to trade tensions. latin america sales were flat. adjusted gross profit increased nearly 1% from the prior year period. adjusted gross margin contracted 190 basis points to 45.8%, primarily driven by a nearly full percentage point net impact from list 4 tariffs and an unfavorable sales mix of large year-end budget orders. we view this q4 rate as exceptional and not a new normal. adjusted operating expenses declined $12 million from the prior year period and improved 230 basis points as a percentage of sales. this improvement was primarily due to reduced project spend and lower incentive compensation expense, partially offset by the inclusion of expenses from recently acquired businesses. we will continue to drive a balanced approach of driving operating leverage while making prudent investments in growth initiatives.
fourth quarter 2019, adjusted ebitda margin was 21.4%, a 30 basis point increase from the prior-year period, including the temporary one point negative impact from tariffs. we drove non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $3.56, a 15% year-over-year increase, which includes the $0.16 negative impact from list 4 tariffs.
turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide 7. we generated $624 million of free cash flow for the full year 2019. this was lower than the prior year period, as expected, primarily due to the timing of working capital items. we paid down $312 million of debt in 2019 after the funding of acquisitions and venture investments. we ended the year with 1.3 times net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio, which is the lowest level since the acquisition of the enterprise business more than five years ago. we repurchased $47 million of shares in 2019. our strong balance sheet and cash flow profile provide us ample flexibility to invest strategically and return excess capital to shareholders.
on slide 8, we provide an update on the anticipated impacts to zebra from the section 301 tariffs on products imported to the u.s. we are on track to diversify our global sourcing footprint, which will mitigate list 4 tariffs that became effective in september, impacting our mobile computers and printers. we continue to work with our contract manufacturing partners to replicate lines in order to move most of the u.s. volumes to broader asia. these actions are expected to result in up to an additional $25 million of one-time pre-tax charges through mid-2020 plus $10 million to $15 million of capital expenditures. with these supply chain actions, we expect to substantially mitigate tariffs by mid-2020.
in the first quarter, we expect these tariffs to negatively impact gross margin by approximately $10 million and decline to $5 million in q2 as we launch alternate sources of supply outside of china.
let us turn to our outlook on slide 9. we entered 2020 with a higher-than-expected order backlog and solid pipeline of opportunities. our contract manufacturers and all the areas of our supply chain in china have experienced delays as workers returned from the new year later than usual due to the coronavirus outbreak. our outlook incorporates our best view of the coronavirus impact. we expect net sales growth in q1 to be between 4% and 7%. this outlook assumes an approximately one percentage point positive impact from recent acquisitions and then approximately 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency changes.
we believe q1 adjusted ebitda margin would be approximately 20%, which assumes improved operating expense leverage and a lower gross margin attributable to a $10 million impact from list 4 tariffs and approximately $4 million of additional freight cost due to the supply chain delays from coronavirus. non-gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of $2.90 to $3.10. the estimated negative impact from tariffs and additional freight cost is approximately $0.22. we assume a negligible impact from share repurchase. that said, we will continue to be opportunistic with our share buyback program. also, we estimate that we could have an additional $0 million to $50 million impact to sales related to the coronavirus outbreak if the situation becomes meaningfully different than expectations.
we expect full-year 2020 net sales growth to be between 4% and 6%, which assumes an approximately 30 basis point positive impact from recent acquisitions and an approximately 1 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency changes. full year adjusted ebitda margin is expected to be slightly higher than 22%, an improvement from 2019 as we work to drive gross margin expansion and operating leverage. we do not believe that the coronavirus outbreak, as we understand its potential impact today, will have an material impact on our full-year outlook. we believe the risk to be mainly in timing of order fulfillment in near-term.
we expect that full year 2020 free cash flow will exceed $700 million, a substantial increase from 2019. you can see other full-year 2020 modeling assumptions on slide 9. with that i will turn the call back to anders to discuss the progress we are making on our enterprise asset intelligence vision.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, olivier. we are optimistic about our business as we enter 2020 and we believe we can continue to successfully navigate an uneven global macroeconomic environment. now turning to slide 11. we collaborate closely with customers to transform their workflows, so that they can achieve their strategic goals. the value proposition we bring to the market has translated to sales growth in each of our primary verticals for q4 and the full year. in healthcare, our fastest growing vertical, we are addressing a broad set of challenges that hospital systems are facing across their operations. these challenges range from bedside care to the management of medical supplies and equipment throughout their supply chain. as an example, we have been rolling out mobile computing solutions to the national health system in the u.k., enabling digitization at the bedside to treat patients, which improves the level of safety and generates real-time and actionable data to optimize the entire supply chain.
for manufacturers, zebra addresses their needs across their business. these include planned floor productivity enabling the smart warehouse and optimizing field operations. our solutions are resonating with customers because we can demonstrate a positive roi for our solutions even in a challenging environment. we are excited that multiple prominent manufacturers in north america recently deployed multi-million dollar android mobile computing and printing solutions to help maximize their productivity in b2b workflows including direct store delivery.
in the transportation and logistics space, our customer staff are overextended and their end customers expect service and information instantly in an increasingly on-demand economy. the success we are seeing in this vertical is attributable to the real-time visibility we are bringing to our customers' supply chain, which enables them to increase productivity.
i would like to call out our team's success in becoming a partner of choice for nearly all of the largest postal systems around the globe, including the us postal service, which will begin to deploy our mobile computers in the second quarter. we empower postal carriers with the mobile technology to increase productivity by scanning, tracking and tracing packages across their network with high level of data security.
in retail and e-commerce, omnichannel fulfillment is a critical area where retailers are making significant investments. rfid has become an increasingly important option to improve omnichannel capabilities because it can deliver close to 100% inventory accuracy. as more and more items are source tagged at the point of manufacturer, rfid gains momentum. we are currently deploying an rfid solution to several hundred stores for a major apparel retailer. this customer conducts daily scans of the entire store with handheld rfid devices in less than one hour, which is driving increased sales uplift and lower inventory shrinkage. this customer has also purchased several thousand of our combination rfid readers and barcode scanners for their point of sale transactions. we are pleased with the strategic relationship we have forged with this customer as we collaborate on proofs-of-concept to address additional in-store use cases that can improve their top and bottom-line results.
now turning to slide 12. as a trusted strategic partner, we orchestrate the end-to-end workflows for customers in the primary verticals that we serve. last month at the national retail federation expo, we showcased how we accomplish this in retail and e-commerce through a full suite of innovative solutions. these solutions address many operational challenges our customers face as they reinvent their business models. prescriptive analytics, machine learning, computer vision and mobile computers for all associates are a few key enablers to intelligent retail that we featured at the show.
advancements in technology now allow retailers to generate an unprecedented amount of frontline data on their stores through mobile automation systems, shelf edge cameras, mobile computer scans, inventory, point-of-sale, rfid and other sources. this heavy flow of information is actionable in real-time with our software solution.
zebra prescriptive analytics, formerly known as profitect analyze massive data streams utilizing machine learning to identify variations in the data in real time. the most impactful recommendations are instantly prioritized and sent directly to workers' mobile devices to take action for optimal outcomes. we have deployed our proven offering with many leading retailers including the home depot, walgreens, family dollar, asta, rei, ahold delhaize and many more. computer vision capabilities are becoming an increasingly important component of our offering in retail and other vertical markets we serve.
in q4, to further accelerate our capabilities in this area, we acquired london based cortexica vision systems, whose talented engineering team has been developing vision-based analytics and artificial intelligence solutions that include object recognition through machine learning, image and video analysis and visual search. at the nrf expo, we introduced solutions with our innovative computer vision capabilities, including a flatbed scanner that can visually identify fruits and vegetables, as well as our new intelligent automation solution smartsight that features a robotic vision system which rolls through store aisles. the system can identify critical issues such as stock-outs or price discrepancies and direct a worker through a mobile computer to correct the situation. we plan to leverage our enhanced computer vision capabilities in next generation offerings to address emerging use cases in markets that we believe represent a multi-billion dollar opportunity.
we were proud to feature office depot at our booth this year. they demonstrated how they have deployed zebra's purpose-built mobile computing solutions to empower their associates to transform the customer experience and improve operational efficiency across their stores and distribution centers. their solution includes our workforce connect software application for efficient collaboration among associates. there is a strong and growing trend at many retailers to equip all their associates with mobile devices that enable collaboration with co-workers and customers. we are ensuring that we have the appropriate purpose-built portfolio of mobile computers for our enterprise customers to empower their entire workforce. we featured some of these at nrf and we expect to roll out additional offerings later this year.
in closing, our core product offering continues to resonate well in the market. we are broadening our role as a strategic solutions provider, partnering with our customers c-suite. and we are continuing to invest in capabilities that digitize and automate enterprise operations. we've opened large, new attractive market opportunities for zebra including intelligent automation and computer vision applications, new point-of-sale solutions and mobile devices for all. now, i'll hand the call back over to mike.
michael steele -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, anders. we'll now open the call to q&a. we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible.

[operator instructions] and today's first question comes from andrew buscaglia with berenberg. please go ahead
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my question. i wanted to touch on your q2 sales guide. you had a good backlog into the quarter, and it seemed as though you're asia your north america sales seemed to be ok this quarter. so i'm wondering, is this just a function of your backlog? and beyond that, is there a concern you just haven't quite seen the effect of this hit other regions outside of asia?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
andrew, we have, today, a lower visibility of the business due to the impact of covid-19. and we are basically pegged as a business to the economy. and a lot of what we see in q2 is a question mark on the length of the stay at home and also the impact of the various stimulus packages, either current or to come. and if you study the company over the recent past, we have an history of rebounding quickly when the economy restarts. now when it comes to q2, specifically, what we see today is obviously the impact only due to covid, we believe we are in a strong competitive position. we believe that, for example, in q1, we have gained shares. we had a strong backlog entering the quarter.
and we see today from a top line standpoint mainly an impact being more pronounced on run rate, which is part of the business going through distribution. and we have seen our distributors, partners adjusting the level inventory. so this is what we see today going on. but we believe we have a strong value proposition, which works well in good and bad times, and we're going to be ready to manage this downturn, andrew.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
okay. and then your guidance for ebitda margin. i think it was a bit ahead of where some people were expecting. directionally, is this a function of your gross margins being up sequentially? what's really what's behind that margin guidance? that's sort of ballpark.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so if you look at of course, so if you look at ebitda, at the midpoint, the ebitda margin will decline year-on-year by about 270 basis points, so 270 basis points. 1.5%, so 150 basis points is due to one-off items, either associated with tariffs or associated with the management of the pandemic, mainly impacting our freight expense. and then the balance is a point of margin being lost due to run rate mix. so if you look at today, if we disaggregate the revenue between bid and run rate, run rate margin is much higher than bids, and we have seen the run rate of revenue declining. however, the margin profile for run rate and bids have been increasing sequentially now for a few quarters. so what you see at play in the profitability is a margin impact and largely large proportion of the margin impact being due to tariff and c19. from an opex standpoint, we believe we're going to be able to retain the opex as a proportion of revenue constant or relative to last year.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
got it thank you
operator
and our next question today comes from paul coster at jpmorgan. please go ahead
paul coster -- jp morgan -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking my question i've got to. the first one is, can you give us your latest thoughts on the usps projects? and i know as we throw the second question in now and that is, it sounds like you expect the channel to destock. is that a 2q phenomenon in the guidance? or do you think it will take more than one quarter for them to do that? and can you quantify that in any way?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes, paul, i'll take both of these ones. first, on usps. usps contract continues as per our expectations. as we've talked about before, this is a multiyear contract. we're certainly very proud of it, the biggest in our history. i think it highlights the strength of our value proposition and the strength of our relationships. our teams our respective teams, the zebra team and the usps team, they continue to work very closely together. both sides are very engaged. so there's no expectations or signs from our side that this will be pushed out in any way. as we said in our last quarter call, we do expect to begin ramping up in q2 or ramping deliveries in q2. and we do assume or expect that the majority of all the orders will be deployed by the end of 2021 as the back end is kind of gated by the when the u.s. carriers stop 3g service. and at that point, usps will need to have moved off to new devices.
we have received new orders beyond the current orders, so some new use cases but within the same framework for an additional 30,000 units. so the business with usps for us continues to be good, and we certainly look forward to starting to deploy in earnest. and then the other one on destocking in the channel. at the moment, i'd say, on a global basis, our distribution partners who are the ones who hold inventory are holding a normal days on hand inventory. we don't see it being high or low, particularly. it's going to be within the band that we consider to be normal. what we tend to see early in the downturn is that when sales out goes down, from a disti perspective, they adjust their days on hand, which means they don't have to buy as much in the short term.
and then that tends to be more of a one quarter type of activity. so here, we are assuming that there will be a reduction in the run rate for our distis and partners, which will cause some level of lesser inventory or maintain to maintain the same level of days on hand inventory.
paul coster -- jp morgan -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from keith housum with northcoast research. please go ahead
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning, guys. anders, you know, you're one of you guys that's been around since the great recession back in 2008, 2009. can you just give us some of your thoughts in terms of how, i guess, your customers are responding now? and is there that same level of fear now that you had back then? i think we understand how your business has changed. but what was your interpretation of how the customers are reacting?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i think the obviously, there's a very different drivers for this crisis versus the 2009 crisis. so i'd say our customers today are probably not as well, back up and say, it very much now depends on which kind of vertical or subsegment of the business you're in. i think in 2009, every customer had concerns about liquidity and so forth. here, we have a bit more of a have and have nots. so if you're a mass merchant, a grocer, e-tailer or in healthcare, some of the delivery businesses, you're doing very well. they are super, super busy. and if you're more of a brick-and-mortar retailers selling apparel, you might be having shut down all your stores. i think from a customer behavior perspective, i'd say when the kind of the orders around work from home started to be enacted, it probably took two, three weeks for our customers to kind of scramble and get themselves organized to adapt to the new kind of working environments. they were very focused on just making sure their operations were continue to run. but in the last month, i'd say, they've started to come back and start engaging with us on both current and more future-oriented projects.
and we're trying to be make sure we make good use of video conferencing to continue to engage and have the sessions with our customers. and i don't perceive that our customers overall are maybe as concerned with how long or how they're going to come out of this recession, maybe it feels like they have a bit more confidence.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
got it. and then i think i heard some of this in your script, but can you clarify again, like what percentage of your business do you think has done to essential customers?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
we didn't talk about it from the entire business. but if you look at retail specifically, which is our largest vertical, 2/3 of our business there goes to mass merchants, grocers and e-tailers. and those are all deemed essential. we've seen some interesting trends there that as people are adjusted to buying from home, not necessarily visiting the store as much. so buy online pick up in store has become much more popular. grocery volumes have gone up materially, but buy online pick up in store has gone up exponentially. and i think that's consumer behavior that is unlikely to revert back to what it was. i think consumers have now learned a new way of all shopping that they like. then if you move look to healthcare, there we have, i would say, the majority of our business is tied to essential activities, acute care, specifically. and we have been part of pop-up hospitals, drive-through test facilities and just scaling existing healthcare facilities to be able to take care of the number of covid-19 patients that come in.
but obviously, there's parts of healthcare that has been deemed nonessential, which but that's a smaller part of our business that do elective care and so forth. within transportation logistics, that's a i can't really have i don't have a good percentage number, but it's a good part of that business is obviously also part of the essential economy, moving making sure that the essential supply chains work all the way from pharmaceuticals to food to e-commerce. i'd say here, for us, the last-mile delivery so many more deliveries to households today, and the last-mile delivery drivers tend to have our type of devices. and so that's been helpful. but on the other hand, we see other transportation logistics businesses like aviation, auto, rental car companies and so forth that are under a lot of pressure. and lastly, manufacturing, there, i'd say, a lot of the discrete manufacturers, aviation and automakers, are not essential. they make up less than 5% of our total revenues, while most, i would say, process manufacturing companies like food and pharma are deemed essential for us.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
an additional point, keith, as well, which we think is important. we think that the current situation will actually accelerate the secular trends we are serving. e-commerce, tracking, digitization of workflow, we believe that those trends are going to be even more important going forward.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes. i think that to that point, we see that our solutions have become more necessary for our customers as we really do empower the frontline workers across all the end markets. so these are the people who cannot perform their duties from home. they have to be in a hospital, the grocery store delivery truck. and so i think the crisis is helping to accelerate trends around digitization, automation across our industries.
operator
and our next question today comes from jim ricchiuti with needham & company. please go ahead
jim ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you could move on a question on anders, maybe i just wanted to go back to your comment about the haves and have nots and that slide 13, where you talk about some of the essential parts of the business in terms of vertical channels. is it fair to say that the essential components, whether it's retail, e-commerce, healthcare, that, that's been you're anticipating that as a net benefit in the first half of the year? or put another way, would you expect that, that potentially, if we've seen increased investments in those areas, that falls off in the second half in addition to the recessionary pressures that you're seeing in the traditional markets? i'm just trying to get a sense as i think you can't give guidance for the full year. but i'm just trying to get some feel for how that essential business might change from q2 to q3. i think you alluded to q3, olivier, being a particularly challenging quarter.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes. so we're going to stop short of trying to give real color or guidance on the full year here. but i'd say, for us, we do our expectations is that this is not a long-term change in how we operate and the world operates, but more of a several quarter activity. so we certainly expect it to impact q2 and q3. and then depending on how quickly the world rebounds, we will follow. i'd say, for us, one of the benefits we have is that we have a very robust business, a very diversified business across product lines, vertical markets and geographies. and our value propositions tend to work in good times and bad times, right? good times, our customers are expanding, they're investing in their business, and they use our equipment to help them do that. in tougher times, they tend to trade opex for capex, so they try to use us to get more efficiencies.
in the say, right now at the eye of the hurricane here, we are seeing, obviously, the many of the essential business being very busy, busier than they had been before. and i think how they are behaving today is that they are generally very focused on just making sure they can scale up their operations and scale up the use of technology, but not necessarily having the bandwidth to think very creatively about how to leverage new solutions. i think that will come when the world settles down a little bit more. customers that are not operating today, say, people who have had to shut down their operations, we are talking to them still, though, to make sure that we stay engaged and figure out how can we help them drive more of the digitization and automation of their businesses as they come back. so we feel that we are we want to engage with all the customers that we have. but the obviously, the ones that are essential are much more active in both running their businesses and looking to figure out how to scale them.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
let me add something, if i can. this is joe heel speaking. the concept, jim, that you mentioned about the haves and the have nots that anders described earlier, also applies to a certain extent within the essential customers. so for example, in healthcare customers, you have, of course, covid-related activity, which is, at the moment, receiving a lot of attention and funding and therefore, also activity from us. but you also have elective procedures, which are being put off and corresponding investments that hospitals are making are being postponed. within retailers, you see a lot of things around buy online pick up in store, but for example, automation activities, like we showcased with our robot solution that we introduced earlier, those are being paused. now the good news is that we're not yet seeing a drop-off in confidence among those customers. the customers are still engaging with us remotely on those longer-term solutions. and so we expect that, that have not part will continue even in those essential sectors in the future.
operator
and our next question today comes from meta marshall with morgan stanley. please go ahead
erik taylor lapinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, this is erik on for meta. maybe just staying on the question of kind of conversations with customers. it sounds like for the most part, you've seen maybe a pushing off of projects. but can you help us, i guess, contextualize, like how much could the reason potential just scaling down of maybe the size of some orders? or have you seen any potential cancellations from maybe customers most impacted?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so today, we've only seen a limited number of push outs. we have not seen any cancellations or any scaling down of orders, as you put it. i think and the customers that have pushed out tends to be the ones that are not operating today at all.
erik taylor lapinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then maybe just changing gears a bit. on share repurchases, understanding you kind of capitalize on the lower share price in the quarter. like how should we think about the pace moving forward? would you continue to be opportunistic? or should we kind of expect maybe more focus on cash flow preservation just looking at the uptick there?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so we feel strong about the cash flow generation of the company. as we said, as i said, we believe we can protect the majority of the free cash flow of the company even during this downturn. now the priority for cash allocation is going to be to invest in the business either organically or inorganically. we bought $200 million worth of shares. so it's about 2% of our shares outstanding. so at this stage, we are going to be mainly investing in the business and buyback would not be a priority. now it's not going to be totally off the table, but not a priority.
operator
and our next question today comes from richard eastman at robert w. baird. please go ahead
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yes, good morning. and thank you. could you perhaps olivier, could you perhaps just expand a little bit on the supply chain issues that you had in the quarter? and maybe just speak to this malaysian facility, which i'm assuming was a subcontractor facility, had some closure and some downtime. is it up? and do you could you just kind of give us a sense of how much revenue that may have impacted the first quarter?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i think i'll start with this, and then olivier can help fill out some details. so if you go back until our q4 call, we highlighted that covid-19 would have an impact on our supply chain, but there was on the supply side of things. since then, the china has largely returned to normal, it took a little longer than expected, i'd say. and there was dependent partly on where our contract manufacturing partners were located. so they had to return workers through two-week quarantine periods and so forth. but by the end of the quarter, our chinese contract manufacturing partners were, i think, all working within at over 90% capacity. so i think it came back a little slower, but it came back. we also then, in the quarter, tried to ramp up both our vietnam and malaysia facilities.
and timing was a little more challenged as we were supposed to do that the monday after the lunar new year. and obviously, no chinese people were allowed to travel there to help set it up and to teach people, but we were, i think, quite agile and creative. so we set up video facilities so that we have people in china sitting and watching via video what people in vietnam and malaysia were doing to teach them as well as we could. and the vietnam facility has come up very nicely. it manufactured the same number of printers that we had expected, while the malaysia facility started off a little slow, but then it got shut down based on the marshall law that malaysia implemented. but we're using the same techniques to get that facility up and running. the impact on q1, i think, was very modest from that perspective. we have diverted and tried to make get as much out of china as we could. it had similar impact on tariffs as we now have to manufacture everything in china or more the vast majority of our products in china, instead.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
and going forward, we expect that the supply chain issues are going to be largely behind us. and what you see reflected in our guide for q2 is mainly some demand pressures.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes. actually, i think i call out to our supply chain is in order. they've done an excellent job of being agile and working in a very dynamic situation to make sure that the all these issues had minimal impact on q1 and q2.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
and then just as a follow-up question, are there any receivables or credit issues that you are watching within the virus don't hold a lot of inventory, but are there any credit issues so we that you're watching carefully?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so we're spending a lot of time on working capital, obviously dso, most particularly. so far, the answer is no. and the way again, we feel strong about our balance sheet, we feel strong about our free cash flow and we feel strong about our working capital. and we want to use, in selected cases, the strength of our balance sheet to increase the competitive position of the company. so from a credit standpoint, so far, no particular issues, and we want to help our partners to navigate through this difficult time using our balance sheet.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
and one more thing, maybe just to add some color on this. one thing that i think benefits us here is that our partners, they their business is to resell our products. so if they are cut off from supply of our products, if they can't get access to our products, their business goes away. so there is a strong incentive from our partners to pay us to make sure that they can stay current and continue to do business.
operator
our next question today comes from brian drab at william blair. please go ahead.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. i was wondering, first, if there's any way that you could help us by trying to quantify the backlog that you're entering the second quarter with and maybe compare that to a typical quarter. do you typically enter a quarter with, say, two or three weeks of backlog? and now you have double that, or can you talk in some terms like that to give us a sense?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
so the size of the backlog entering the quarter was not out of the ordinary. and this size was slightly higher due to some of the dispatch center issues we mentioned. so we had to shut down for about a day at the end of the quarter one of our dispatch center and that was about $20 million. so that would be part also of the opening backlog, but nothing out of the ordinary.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
you can think of it as the business continued to do well through the first quarter. so order flow was normal. and the one additional thing was that the $20 million that we couldn't ship out of the north america or the americas distribution center that flipped into q2.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
okay. that seems smaller than i would have thought. so that's, i mean, like 2% of revenue. so that's enough for you to call that out. there's no other source of additional backlog entering 2q?
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
nothing of significant out of the ordinary.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
okay. and then i was just curious, it was why did that facility if you can talk about this, why did that distribution center have to shut down? was that a state-driven decision? or was there an illness there? and do you think that this is a potentially a risk in the going forward with other distribution centers and facilities?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so this was an outsourced facility, and there was a case of covid-19. so they shut down for 36 hours and came back in slower. we even before then, we had started to take some pretty dramatic drastic actions in making sure that we had team a, b, c and so forth that we had put out more spacing between people, taking a lot of actions to make sure that if anybody were to get infected, it would impact as only a small team and not the entire facility. so if something like that were to happen again, i would expect it to have much less impact than it had in the first quarter.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
another one, which is of size also, the quarter was very back-end loaded for obvious reasons, right? the supply chain started slowly at the start and ended up strong. so we had to ship a lot in the last few days of the quarter, and a day of shipment was worth much more than ever before. but we're confident that, today, largely the risk from this distribution center standpoint is going to be mitigated going forward. we have very good plans to mitigate those risks now.
operator
and our final question today comes from jeff kessler with imperial capital. please go ahead
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
thank you. um, you mentioned briefly the three acquisitions that you've made, that were not part of the original discussion. could you just update us on whether or not investment in them is going forward? and if they if so, what role have they played or could they play later on in the year and into 2021?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so i assume you talked about temptime, profitect and cortexica. these are acquisitions we did last year, yes. so i'd say all three are performing well. temptime was the first one we made in the beginning of 2019. they design and manufacture visual time-temperature monitoring solutions. it goes on a lot of them goes on vials of vaccines in the developing world. obviously, great it's very topical today, although we don't have a vaccine yet for covid-19. but that's...
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
kind of why i'm asking the question.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes. okay. so we're obviously in contact with who and others to make sure that when that happens, that we can offer our solutions to ensure that the transportation of that vaccine can be temperature-controlled and quality controlled. profitect was the second acquisition we did in june of last year. that is the they do the prescriptive analytics, taking lots of different data inputs from a variety of sources, primarily in retail, and using machine learning, ai to detect anomalies. and i'd say that's even more critical today as retailers are trying to figure out what they have on the stores, what errors they have and how to quickly be able to assess rectify that with and being less dependent on having a physical presence in the store to be able to do this.
and lastly, cortexica, which was the computer vision company we acquired at the end of last year. this is a smaller business, mostly focused our intent with that is to really leverage the competency of that team, less so the kind of the product or the revenue stream. so they are very been very active in engaging with building out our computer vision capabilities around our ema robot, particularly, but also solutions. and they've been a great addition to our team. they have great skill sets.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
okay. my follow-up will be quick. it has to do with your partner program. you mentioned that some of your partners are essentially, if you don't provide them product, they have nothing to sell. the question is about have you made any tweaks in that program during this period of time as you've seen ebbs and flows in your supply chain and going into through the channel that increases for some folks and decreasing for others? and what have you been doing with your partner program too, if you want to call, to make it more efficient for both them and you?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes. i think this is an excellent question for joe heel.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yes. so in our partner program, we've had a lot of requests from partners that we help them both technically with training, but also financially and with the program terms, in particular, like many of the programs, we have some elements in the program that are or you can think of it like a frequent flyer program, where you have to reach certain levels. and we have already announced that we are adjusting those program terms. we're essentially extending it for an additional year. we're also adjusting some of the thresholds that partners need to reach in order to earn their rebates. these are the typical things that you would do in response to a changing business environment when the partners can't earn their targets. and i think so far, it's been quite well received because it means that the partners will be able to operate their businesses at the different levels and still achieve their targets.
operator
anyway, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn the conference back over to mr. gustafsson for any final remarks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you. yes. i would like to thank our employees, customers and partners who are working the frontline. we remain committed to supporting you through this challenging time. be safe, everyone.

thank you, mike. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. first, i would like to say that our top priority at this time is the health and well-being of our employees, customers and partners. we are grateful to all of the frontline workers, especially those sacrificing their personal safety so that all of us can continue to live and work safely through this challenging time. those on our customers' frontlines are heroes, serving in hospitals, grocery stores, delivery vehicles, warehouses and other parts of the essential supply chains that help keep our lives as normal as possible. many zebra employees are also on the frontline, supporting the build and repair of products and solutions that are essential to our customers doing their jobs safely and efficiently. to all those heroes, we say thank you. the financial results we published this morning reflect a challenging first quarter environment.
we realized a net sales decline of 1% adjusted ebitda margin of 19.1% which contracted by 200 basis points and non gap diluted earnings per share of $2 and 67 cents and 9% decrease from the prior we had a strong start to the year, and january and february generally played out to our expectations. however, late in the quarter, as covid-19 evolved into a global pandemic, we experienced significant supply chain disruption, including product manufacturing delays, restrictions on transportation of goods and the temporary closure in late march of a key distribution center supplying the americas. we took extraordinary steps to produce and supply our mission-critical products to customers around the world. our team was agile, pivoting our resources quickly to closely monitor the situation and take bold action. for example, we chartered plans to expedite product delivery from china to north america and europe to meet customer commitments. despite best efforts, we were unable to completely fulfill our order book in the quarter, resulting in a high backlog as we entered q2. production in china is now returning to normal, and we have stabilized our global supply chain through mitigating actions.
in addition to the supply chain challenges, we saw softer demand through the channel globally, and china sales were very weak, with covid-19 exasperating trends that had already been soft due to trade tensions. however, in any environment, enterprises worldwide utilize our solutions to address the evolving needs of their customers. in this changing environment, our solutions have become even more necessary for our customers. i would like to highlight a few notable q1 wins supporting critical use cases in omnichannel, e-commerce and healthcare. one of the world's largest mass merchants purchased 40,000 of our zq6 series mobile printers to address a number of front of store use cases, including online store pickup, pharmacy fulfillment and shelf tagging. additionally, we deployed several thousand tc5 series mobile computers to a large e-commerce player in asia. this follows our competitive takeaway win last year of their printing and scanning business. with covid-19, this e-tailers demand is growing exponentially. they have been hiring staff, and we are working with them on additional solutions. in healthcare, we supported the nhs nightingale temporary hospital in the u.k. we provided an installed solutions supporting the identification and flow of covid-19 patients.
nurses at nhs have also been using our tc five series healthcare mobile computers to arrange virtual visits between patients and their loved once as expected transitory effects of tariffs and expedited shipping expenses weighed heavily on q1 gross margin and eps. we have taken decisive actions to mitigate this impact, which drove operating expense leverage despite lower sales volume. we continue to remain agile and take appropriate action as results are pressured due to the challenging macro environment.
with that, i will now turn the call over to olivier to review our q1 financial results and discuss our outlook.
olivier leonetti -- chief financial officer
thank you, anders. let us walk through the p&l on slide six. net sales declined 1.3% in the first quarter, less than 1% on an organic basis before the impacts of currencies and acquisitions. the covid-19 pandemic caused supply and demand impacts to our consolidated sales growth of approximately seven percentage points. despite our sales decline, we believe that we generally outperformed in the market globally. our enterprise visibility & mobility segment sales was most impacted by the covid-19 disruption and sales decreased 2.9%. in the larger supply chain impact was the temporary closure in north american distribution center that anders referenced, which delayed shipments of mobile computers into the channel. asset intelligence & tracking segment sales increased 3.2% in with relative strength in printing and zebra retail solutions. we saw solid growth in managed and professional services across both segments of the business, primarily driven by solid attach rates on increased product sales over the last 12 months.
our locations solutions business was lower due to a pause in project spending. turning to our regions in north america, sales were flat; a declining mobile computing due to covid-19 supply chain challenges was offset by growth in all other major categories. the emea sales increased 7% with relative strength in mobile computing, printing and services. we saw particular strength in central europe. sales in our asia pacific region declined 21%, driven by covid-19 impacts on top of continued softness in china due to trade tensions. china was down 35%, driving most of the regional sales decline. latin america sales declined 11%, led by lower mobile computing sales, largely impacted by supply chain disruption. adjusted gross margin contracted 200 basis points to 45.2%, driven primarily by list four tariffs and expedited freight as well as unfavorable large order mix. adjusted operating expenses declined $5 million from the prior year period and improved 10 basis points as a percentage of sales.
this improvement was primarily due to prudent cost management and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by the inclusion of expenses from recently acquired businesses. first quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 19.1%, a 200 basis point decrease from the prior period, driven entirely by lower gross margin. we drove non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $2.67, a 9% year-over-year decrease, inclusive of $0.17 negative impact from the transitory effects of tariffs and expedited freight expense. turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide seven. we generated $95 million of free cash flow in q1. this was higher than the prior period, primarily due to lower use of working capital. we repurchased $200 million of shares in q1, leaving $753 million of remaining capacity under the authorization. from a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at a modest 1.5 times net debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio. turning to slide eight.
we are well equipped to navigate the unprecedented global environment that we are facing. as i just mentioned, our balance sheet is in excellent shape with low debt levels and $740 million of capacity under our revolver. we deliver mission-critical solutions, increasingly diverse end markets. our capital-light business model as a highly viable cost structure due to our outsourcing of product manufacturing and driving the vast majority of our sales volume to third-party distribution. we also have a strong free cash flow profile with a flexible cost structure and capital expenditures, typically less than 1.5% of sales. we also have a track record of preserving profitability and cash flow in challenging times. we use a playbook to take appropriate actions in various scenarios, preserving capacity for investments in the business that improve our competitive position. let us turn to our outlook. given the low visibility due to covid-19, we are withdrawing our outlook for full year net sales, adjusted ebitda margin and free cash flow. we now expect these three metrics to be lower than last year, which would we address through cost actions to enhance our profitability and cash flow. q2 and q3 are expected to be particularly challenging quarters based on macroeconomic forecast, independent market research and feedback from our partners and customers.
in this freed environment, we have done extensive scenario planning and identified many operational and financial levers that we can pull. it is imperative that we stick to our principles of acting swiftly to preserve profitability while doing no harm to the business through reinforcement of our culture. this enable us to prioritize strategic investments so that we emerge stronger than the competition as the market rebounds. as anders mentioned, we entered the second quarter with a strong backlog, driven by temporary supply chain disruptions from the pandemic. as the virus spread, end market weakness is affecting all of our major geographies across the globe. the impact is more pronounced in our run rate business through the channel, as third-party distributors are recalibrating inventory levels. given these pressures and elevated uncertainty, we expect net sales to decline in q2 between 11% and 17%. this outlook assumes an approximately 50 basis point positive impact from recent acquisitions and an approximately one percentage point negative impact from foreign currency changes.
we believe q2 adjusted ebitda margin will be between 18% and 19%, which assumes lower operating expenses and a lower gross margin, reflecting a $5 million impact from list four tariffs and approximately $9 million of cost to mitigate supply chain disruption from covid-19. collectively, these transitory items, i expect it to impact margin by approximately 150 basis points and eps by $0.22. non-gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.50. please reference other 2020 modeling assumptions on slide nine. on slide 10, we provide an update on the anticipated impacts to zebra from section 301 tariffs on products imported to the u.s. we are generally on track to diversify our global sourcing footprint by mid-2020, despite some modest delays due to covid 2019, particularly in our malaysian facility. in vietnam, we have been ramping our expectations. this initiative is expected to mitigate our geographic concentration risk.
it also adds the immediate benefit of substantially mitigating these four types that became effective last september, impacting our mobile computers and printers. we continue to work with our contract manufacturing partners to replicate production lines in order to move most of our u.s. volumes to broader asia. these actions are currently expected to result in approximately $20 million of onetime pre-tax charges in the first half of 2020, plus approximately $10 million of capital expenditures. in the first quarter, tariffs negatively impacted gross profit by $7 million. we expect this impact to decline to $5 million in q2 as we launch alternate sources of supply outside of china.
with that, i will turn the call back to anders to discuss our enterprise asset intelligence vision and end market trends. thank you, olivier. slide 12 highlights how we are enhancing the value proposition for our customers. our solutions are even more critical today than ever as we give the frontline and edge by empowering them with technology to do their job most effectively. industry-leading companies trust zebra to equip their workers and facilities with the solutions that bring their mission-critical operations to the next level. we are uniquely positioned to address this challenge because we have a deep understanding of workflows and unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base. we can address big global problems such as ensuring food safety across the supply chain or a broad range of more localized issues like increasing bed turns in the hospital, modernizing distribution centers to satisfy e-commerce demands or ensuring that retail associates and store inventory are optimized to maintain product availability. we have been bringing our enterprise asset intelligence vision to life for our customers. we are doing this by enabling them to identify their assets through barcode, rfid and computer vision. locate their assets with our vertical specific solutions and understand their conditions such as temperature, trailer capacity, and device security, so that their frontline workers can take the best next action in real time. methods for sensing, analyzing and acting on operational data from the frontline of business have undergone massive transformation in past years as the on-demand economy has taken hold. inefficient manual processes have evolved into workflows that are augmented and enriched by purpose-built technologies, including hardware, software and intelligent edge solutions that bring it all together. businesses are now demanding information about what is happening at the edge of their operations so that they can run their entire operation smoother, safer and smarter. they generate large volumes of data and are uncertain how to take all those disparate points of information and effectively put it to work in near real-time. we have been investing in software solutions and services that help our customers leverage real-time data to better orchestrate their workflows and gain a performance advantage. investments in advancing our capabilities in this area remain a top priority. on slide 13, we highlight the primary vertical markets that we serve. exciting longer-term growth opportunities remain and new ones are evolving as customers in these markets are pressured to improve their technological capabilities in an increasingly on demand economy. that said, we are seeing mixed trends in this challenging environment, depending on the subsector. many of our customers are deemed essential businesses, while various others may be temporarily closed for business. in healthcare, the pandemic dramatically increases the need for additional acute care capacity, which is the primary area that we serve. our suite of purpose-built healthcare solutions are enabling pop-up hospitals, drive-through testing facilities and labs to scale quickly and provide safe and efficient care. other parts of healthcare have seen a slowdown, as government mandates in many locations have paused non critical care in elective procedures until further notice. approximately 2/3 of our business in retail is the mass merchants, grocers and e-tailers who are serving essential customer needs. many retailers rely on our technology to execute their omnichannel fulfillment effectively. e-commerce and buy online pick up in store transactions have increased as more consumers navigate purchasing from their homes. however, social distancing and stay-at-home orders are further impacting department stores and certain apparel retailers who are heavily reliant on in-store purchases. in the transportation and logistics space, increased online purchasing from households is driving significant incremental parcel volume and delivery, which drives increased demand for our solutions. conversely, government-mandated restrictions are severely pressuring passenger airlines, rental car providers and certain segments of the distribution industry. the manufacturing sector has been challenged with global trade tensions and is facing additional challenges today as stay-at-home orders have deemed many discrete manufacturers, such as auto, aviation and specialty goods, nonessential. that said, some of these customers have been created with their idle operations by producing medical equipment like ventilators, utilizing our solutions. many segments within process manufacturing, such as food and pharmaceutical companies, remain essential and are less impacted. in closing, we are confident that our business fundamentals and strategy are sound and that this crisis will not last. by focusing on serving our customers' needs and continued investment in innovation, we expect to extend our market leadership position as the market rebounds. now i'll hand the call back over to mike.
mike steele -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, anders. we'll now open the call to q&a. [operator instructions]

operator
we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question will come from tommy moll with stephens. please go ahead.
tommy moll -- stephens inc -- analyst
good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
all right, good morning tommy.
tommy moll -- stephens inc -- analyst
anders, i wanted to start on the reflexis deal, could you articulate for us how important integrating software as part of your revenue mix will be going forward and what are some of the strategic rationales -- in other words, what does that allow you to do in terms of increasing stickiness with the customer relationship. what are the other advantages it brings to zebra and then as a related point, as you do head into more software driven sales, should we think about that market as one that's more competitive than where you've traditionally competed or how do you want to frame-up the competitive dynamics there? thank you.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah that's good. i'll start and i'll ask jo heel to help out also. first, just reflexis is a great company -- very excited that it's part of our portfolio -- part of the zebra family here now, it's been a demonstrated leader, intelligent workforce management and task execution for many years and it's been deployed by hundreds of retailers around the globe to help drive employee productivity and retention and many, many of those customers are common to zebra and to also to our zebra prescriptive analytics solution. so, when we look at reflexis and zebra prescriptive analytics and other software solutions we have, we see them as being very synergistic with our overall solution.
if you think of our framework around, sense-analyze and act i think that's probably the easiest way maybe to show how we -- how we think about creating it more complete solutions for our customers, but we have had historically a great strength around the sense and some in the analyze part, but being able to sense what's happening in the physical world has been kind of our foundation. but over the last few years, we have expanded our capabilities around the analyze and the act side quite a bit, and both zebra prescriptive analytics and reflexis are examples of that. and now, when we -- prior to actually the acquisition of reflexis, we had a number of customers ask us to do more tight integration between zebra prescriptive analytics and reflexis, they felt that there would be something that would help get more value out of those investments. zebra prescriptive analytics continue to feed actions into reflexis' action engine to help combine all the different actions that the retail might do in a prioritized way.
and then we can leverage our other software assets like workforce connect to be able to tie back into our mobile computers so our store associates can either scan items in the store or enter other data that can be fed into zpa or into reflexis, but also then be receiving updates or actions from that, so that the reflexis system can deliver even greater value by being able to do that. and for zebra as a whole with our suite of solutions as a service, we can become more strategic to our customers. we can start enabling them to address more complete workflows, and by that we can increase the roi of our overall solutions and be a more strategic thought partners, they think about how they develop their business. so, we definitely feel that this is a very compelling path for us and very excited about what we can do with this. jo, you want to add something?
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
no. perhaps i'll underline two things that you touched on, one is the fact that we are synergistic, not just on the product level, as anders described, how we think we can bring together the different product capabilities we have, but certainly also on the go-to-market and sales level where we have a very strong share in the retail market already and bringing reflexis to those retail customers is immediate cross-sell opportunity that we have, we're actually discovering that it also works the other way around, that reflexis has some customers that they can bring us into and cross sell that way, and that leads into the strategic opportunity that anders described, right which is reflexis generally has a strong presence in the operation side of retailers and this now gives us an opportunity to solve their problems, strategically.
and this perhaps also addresses the second part of your question around do we see this as a more competitive space. certainly there are different competitors in the pure workflow software area, however none of them have the capability that we have to bring together -- the sense-analyze-act part of the ei [phonetic] vision and to solve the problem holistically, so we look at this as a space where we can now differentiate ourselves actually from both the traditional competitors that we have and the competitors at reflexis.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, just around i'd say, i've been on the phone with many of the largest customers of reflexis over the last month or two and i'd say uniformly, they are very excited about the combination. they are passionate about their reflexis solution, but they also see the value that a combination with zebra and the extra resources, we can have and our vision for how we can continue to add value to their operations. so, i think so far it's been a great feedback from the market and from our customers.
tommy moll -- stephens inc -- analyst
thank you all. that's all very helpful. as a follow-up i wanted to shift to some of the end market commentary you offered, anders specifically within retail and e-comms, it sounds like some of the larger customers have accelerated their plan for the omnichannel integration or leaning into their e-commerce platforms. so two related questions, how durable do you see that trend being or maybe you could frame up qualitatively -- if not quantitatively, how far ahead you think your current backlog gives you visibility into maintaining a robust pace of sales.
and then, moving to the smaller customers or potential new smaller customers, are you seeing anything not even in terms of order trends just interest level that suggests that maybe the playing field here has expanded, if you just look around the retail landscape. there are a lot more engaged in omnichannel or talking about it at least now than there were a year ago. so, i just wonder if maybe there is a tam aspect to this dynamic as well where it's shifted in your favor? thank you.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'll start and then i'll ask jo to add a little bit of color to it also. first, i think in this environment, our solutions have become even more critical for our customers. we are, i'd say, uniquely positioned to empower front-line workers across all our vertical end markets and covid-19 has been accelerating a number of secular trends around digitization and automation, and it's probably most apparent in retail around e-commerce, around omnichannel and buy online pickup at store. here we've seen particularly around mass-merchants, grocers and e-tailers that they have been the most -- the quickest, i guess to pick up on this in the, and that's about two-thirds of our of our business. but i'd say, the largest retailers have been the -- mostly been the most aggressive or the earliest to start adopting and investing in solutions around omnichannel and e-commerce.
they have seen a great growth in their omnichannel and buy online pickup at store businesses and they have -- still believe that there is lots of market share that they can continue to grow and take. so, they are continuing to invest heavily in building out their capabilities and scaling their capabilities compared to where it was say, just six months back. for smaller retailers, i'd say generalizing a bit now, they were maybe not quite as quick to invest in omnichannel capabilities. it's a big investment and a complicated one at times, but i think the covid-19 and the changes in customer buying behaviors and the step up in change in how comfortable consumers are with omnichannel and buy online, pickup at store as example has made it i think abundantly clear for smaller retailers too that if they want to compete, they need to build these types of capabilities.
so, we see the pipeline of business around these larger trends around digitization, automation and particularly in retail, as quite robust and we think that this is a trend that will be going on for quite some time. and we're just saying that i think for now, we see the pipelines of these types of opportunities as we look into 2021 as being as robust as we would have expected them to be in prior years at this time. jo?
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yeah, i'll add perhaps two thoughts. i do think there is -- there is a tam expansion that's going on, but i see it a little differently than you were perhaps suggesting. one big area -- it has to do with the fact that in order to enable all of these omnichannel capabilities, you need a deep capability in the company more broadly than just at the front, where the items are being picked up, and one thing in particular that you need to do with it, i think favor us in this case is number one, you need to enable your associates in your store, because that's where most of the instant -- how many channel capability is being created and that means you need to digitize and give every worker a device in some form and we are far from that today so that's a tam expansion.
and the second piece is, you need to extend that modernization into your supply chain and we're seeing a lot of activity in terms of digitizing and automating the supply chain and that's clearly related to this acceleration of e-comms.
tommy moll -- stephens inc -- analyst
great. thank you all. i will turn it back. appreciate it.
operator
our next question comes from jim ricchiuti with needham & company. please go ahead.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
to follow-up on that -- some of the last commentary that you were making anders. it sounds like you're still anticipating a fairly robust environment with your larger customers. so it's not as it -- potentially there is some digestion from the investments that they make and then as it relates to the small, medium segment of the market, i wasn't sure to what extent you are seeing a recovery there? i mean, is there the potential over the next one to two quarters that you could have both areas of the business, both large accounts and the smb actually moving in a consistent fashion toward stronger growth?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. firstly, i think we're seeing a faster than expected improvement in our end markets, and we are cautiously optimistic about how the economy will recover into 2021. i think here our industry leadership and our investments in our business will also enable us to rebound stronger than our competitors, and to that point that's why we feel confident to guide for both the top and bottom line growth in q4. when we looked at our q3 performance here, our run rate was improving. it's not back to pre-covid-19 levels, but it is definitely improving and strengthening and i think that was something we saw globally and our large deal deals were obviously very strong in q3, but we still have a good pipeline into our larger customers and how they are looking to invest in q4 and beyond. jo, do you want to add anything to this also?
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yeah. perhaps just two things. if you look at our pipeline, as an indicator it's as strong as it was on a relative basis a year ago. so, we have a strong pipeline, it gives us good confidence and our run rate has been recovering -- maybe, we didn't say that clearly enough -- but it's clearly a driver of the growth that we've been seeing and we expect that to continue as well.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. and just as a follow-up question, this relates more to just some reports that we've begun to see, including one by a large retailer that had been considering deploying in-store robots for inventory analysis and has now pulled back apparently on that initiative, and i know you guys have looked at that market. i guess my question is, if you look at the opportunities there does it appear that it looks like some of the major retailers may opt for simply putting more devices in the hands of store person as opposed to maybe looking at some of the other in-store automation with robots and things like that?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. first, i'd say that i don't think that our customers see one solution as being able to solve all problems for them; deploying more devices or putting more devices in the hands of more associates is clearly a trend and something that our customers see us as being able to drive high roi and enabling all of them to be connected to their applications and systems and be able to be fully utilized in that respect. with respect to the robust solutions, you mentioned also, we believe that there is a good market opportunity for those types of solution, in addition to using handheld computers.
we have our smartsight solution for this and i think that's progressed very nicely since we announced it at nrf this year. we've seen increase in demand and pilots from many customers, particularly i would say here now in the last few months from grocers. i think, so far, our pilots have proven the technology and we've been able to prove the roi around just based on labor savings alone, and the accuracy of our reads have been very strong and we've -- here is an area where we've leveraged our to cortexica acquisition. so, we've employed a lot of the computer vision technologies from that into smartsight and to some of our other solutions to accelerate our ability to extract useful information from digital images.
so, we see a good healthy pipeline of customers who are interested in piloting this solution with us, and we have pilots in north america and europe at this stage, although it's also fair to say that covid-19 has made it harder for us to engage on customer sites, which is making it a little slower to ramp these pilots up, but the interest is as high as it was pre-covid i would say. jo, any further comments from you?
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
i would like to add maybe one thing here. let's remember what were the retailers trying to solve with this robotics automation solution. what they're trying to solve is the accuracy of inventory in the store and there are many different capabilities and solutions that solve the inventory accuracy problem in the store and they are suited differently to different types of store formats, as well as merchandise assortments. and while we do believe that there is a place for the robotic inventory accuracy improvement, other solutions like rfid or simply using the data from associates devices like you can do with zebra prescriptive analytics are capable solutions for certain store formats and merchandise assortment.
so, the key in our mind will be having the capability to look at all of these different solutions and bring them to a customer and that's what we're going to be in a position to do, including the robotic automation.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes. i think that's a good point just to emphasize again from -- going back to the first question, we had. this is where the breadth of our portfolio enables us to go in and talk to our customers about what is the problem you are trying to solve, and then look at how can we bring our solutions, our technology to bear to best solve the problem they're trying to sell versus coming in and saying, ok, i have -- whatever you problem is my hammer is what's going to solve it. so, i think this is a great example of how the breadth of our solution plays to our advantage.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. thank you for that. congratulations on the quarter.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from meta marshall with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks. maybe a couple of questions from me; one on the denmark healthcare win. just any context as to -- was that your traditional kind of partner ecosystem that brought you into that deal, was that more healthcare focused partner that brought you in. and then, just maybe on the improvement that you're seeing in smb, are there any particular geographies or particular type of customer that you're seeing more movement from? thanks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. again, i'll start and then i'll ask jo to provide some extra color. so first on denmark, the denmark healthcare when we had; is very exciting win for us and i would say almost uniformly our healthcare partners are uniquely focused on healthcare. it's very rare that we have partners that are strong in say retail or manufacturing and also in healthcare. the -- those are very different end markets -- the solutions are very different, their problems are very different so it tends to lead to a much more vertically oriented -- entire value chain for us. then around smb, we did see improvements in our run rate across all geographies on a sequential basis.
i think that this is something we expect that we'll continue to see as the economy recovers into q4, we've certainly seen a good progression of the run rate and the smb business here as we get into q4, but also as we look further into 2021. jo, any more comments from you? are you muted jo?
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
i am. i do apologize. two comments, on the healthcare partners one particular type of partner that is very important for us in the healthcare space are the electronic medical records companies. we have excellent relationships with them, both from an isv and resale perspective and that has been a good source of growth for us in healthcare market. in the smb segment, the one other one i would call out in particular is china. so, in china, we've seen a resurgence i think of the -- in particular, manufacturing customers that are so essential for our printing business and they actually contributed to the [indecipherable]
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thanks.
operator
our next question will come from richard eastman with baird. please go ahead.
rick eastman -- baird -- analyst
yes, good morning and thank you. just wanted to explore the gross margin for a minute, here, the adjusted gross margin by segments here. both segments were down 300 basis points to 400 basis points maybe a little bit surprised around ait, that segment being down. so, my question maybe is twofold. i mean, first of all around the freight expenses, we're using the term premium freight, is the freight expense up structurally, given the realignment around our subcontract manufacturing base or is that specifically to the urgency around some of these e-commerce large orders and getting those here? what does that impact?
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yeah. rich, so i'll take this. i want to start by, i think our teams have been executing well, what we can control around gross margin and if you look at the drivers, it's pretty consistent across both of our segments, both from an unfavorable business mix as well as the premium freight costs. and if you look at the -- more than 3 points and again kind spread between both segments, from both large deal mix as well as unfavorable business mix, and just to give an example in q3, the mix of large deals was actually greater than what we saw in q2.
another example, which speaks to the ait point, if you look at our printer business, it has a larger proportion within run rate and exposure to the manufacturing vertical along with generally higher gross margin, and then another point on premium freight cost and to answer your question, really it's from capacity constraints not so much from the change in our manufacturing footprint, and we're seeing our cost per kilo up 2 times to 3 times from what we saw pre-pandemic, again, just as some of the capacity has come offline with reduction in air travel internationally. and i think what's important, if you look at the underlying gross margin trends excluding the mixed dynamics, they do remain healthy and as the economy recovers and our run rate business improves, so will gross margin which you will begin to see here in q4.
rick eastman -- baird -- analyst
and ait has the same, again, large order impact on ait -- on the printer side of the business, as it does on the mc and scanning?
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
what i'd say it's less reliant on large deals, but it has a higher proportion within the run rate, a higher proportion of run rate business.
rick eastman -- baird -- analyst
okay. and when you look at -- let's move out when things normalize around the mix of business between the channel and large orders, and then kind of this freight -- this premium freight starts to dissipate. are we still kind of at this normalized gross margin level for zebra let's call it 47% with modest upside. is that still a normalized gross margin here?
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yes. so, as we get past the pandemic, we do expect to get back to pre-pandemic levels for both ebitda rate and gross margin rate, and like i said, the like-for-like margins remain healthy, we also would expect the vast majority of our opex to return as the environment normalizes. we have -- i'd say some bit of that will be permanent savings that we'll look to reinvest around the opex side, but again we do expect to get back to the pre-pandemic levels both in ebitda and gross margin rate.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
maybe just add one thing to that. we continue to also develop our portfolio, so as you think of our --- the software solutions we talked about here earlier, they tend to come with a higher gross margin certainly and as they scale, we would expect them to have a very attractive ebitda margin too.
rick eastman -- baird -- analyst
understood. and then just my second follow-up question -- just around the sales and sales channel. just a quick question -- when we look at the fourth quarter revenue guide of plus 3% plus 7% plus, is the assumption in there that the channel -- north america as well as europe is up year-over-year. is that assumption in your revenue guide for the fourth quarter?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so, your question was, if the channel is expected to be up year-over-year? yeah.
rick eastman -- baird -- analyst
channel as in run rate. i'm sorry.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
as in run rate, yes ok. so yes, i'll start here again, and i'll have jo provide some extra color again, but first we're quite pleased to be able to guide for both the top and bottom line growth year-over-year in q4 here, but the 3% to 7% expectation in growth and that includes 150 basis points of positive impact from reflexis. first, the large deal activity remains very strong, but the underlying business is recovering faster than we expected and we are also benefiting from some pent-up demand in q4. as we entered q4, we also had a strong backlog that helped us in this area. the higher -- large order mix that we've seen compared to prior year will continue, but not to the same degree as in q3. so, we do expect the run rate and the channel business to continue to sequentially grow and jo any more color for you?
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
i don't think i have anything to add. you said it.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah.
rick eastman -- baird -- analyst
very good, thank you for the color. much appreciate it, and fantastic work on the quarter to be sure.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from brian drab with william blair. please go ahead, the floor is yours.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
hi, at this point i have two quick follow-up questions to the recent questions that you were just addressing. i appreciate that gross margin shrinking back to the pre-pandemic level, i'm wondering if you could put a finer point on that is it something that we could expect in 2021 or does the large postal service order may be the way on that somewhat in the near term? is that a longer-term expectation or is that a 2021 expectation?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i think it's a little too early for us to give 2022 -- detailed 2021 guidance at this stage, but we do expect that our gross margins will continue to sequentially improve along with the economy, and along with the improvement in our run rate business.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
and then anders, you just highlighted also that the software business, of course should be a tailwind for gross margin, as that business grows and with reflexis it's obviously a bigger piece of the business. can you give us any sense for how -- what percentage of revenue now we are at in terms of software? is it -- can you even say if it's more or less than 5%? i know it's not something you've really said in the past, but it's becoming a more meaningful piece and we don't really know how to model the impact on gross margin without some sense for them.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah obviously, we're very excited about the software business and our software and services business has been growing quite nicely. the software business as a whole, i think is still in the single digits for us, but it's been, as i say, has been growing quite nicely and we would expect it to be a much bigger part of our business as we go forward.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
all right, thank you very much.
operator
your next question will come from keith housum with northcoast research. please go ahead.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning, guys and thanks for the question. and nathan congratulations and welcome to the call. hey guys, wanted to dig in a little bit further into the us postal service. anders, i think i heard you say that the deal is on a pause until late first quarter and then we'll finish up in 3q of next year. so, is the plan still to end i guess late summer? i'm just trying to get a little bit more idea on the third quarter. and in terms of the pause, are we talking the end of the first quarter -- so don't expect much in the first quarter 2021 from us postal service?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. first, the pause that we now have is a planned activity from usps, this was always their intent to not deploy new devices during kind of their peak season, and it will start ramping up again in the second half of the first quarter so it was -- q1 will be certainly lower than q2 and q3 and we expect that late summer we will be basically wrapping up and then we'll continue obviously with other projects and expansions of this project with usps.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great, thanks. and then just as my follow-up, in terms of the temptime business, can you just press cover -- is there an opportunity with that business to take advantage of perhaps any covid-19 vaccine that might be out there on the horizon, and how is that business doing and how it'll play here?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so, you said temptime?
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
correct.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes. so temptime has been doing very well in q2 and q3 based on the traditional vaccines that they covered -- all the vaccine vials that we cover there. we are working with who and a number of pharmaceutical companies, logistics companies to ensure that we are well positioned to provide solutions with respect to covid vaccine when that becomes available. we have received initial orders from people who are kind of proactively looking to build up an inventory and our capabilities for this, but they have been quite small, but we expect that, that can be a nice addition to the business in 2021.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great, thank you. good luck.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question will come from blake gendron with wolfe research. please go ahead.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah hey, thanks, good morning. i do want to circle back on the deal size evolution here, i know that we've been talking about it this morning. but if you were to quantify the year-over-year impact of deal mix, in terms of bps or whatever that would be super helpful. and then, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being pre-pandemic normalized mix versus 1 being sort of the trough where large deals dominated in the second and third quarter, i would imagine. where do you expect the fourth quarter to be just because you do anticipate some of the smaller deal size coming back.
and then, as an offshoot to that on working capital, you offset some of the receivables friction with payables and things like that. are the receivables they are -- is that impacted by deal size as well where we should expect maybe a little bit of friction just given the mix?
nathan winters -- acting chief financial officer
yes. so to answer your first question around the growth we're seeing in both respect to the large and non-large deals. so again, just to clarify, when we say large deals, those are greater than $1 million in the third quarter, the large deals grew over 35% and our non-large deals were down over 15% and hard to put 1 through 10 classification on, i would say as we get into q4, it is going to be slightly higher large order mix than the prior year, but definitely not to the same degree as q3 and we'd expect that to continue to maybe go back to pre-pandemic levels as we head into 2021, as we see a gradual recovery in the economy.
and on your last question around ar factoring, i wouldn't say we've seen any additional friction relative to deal size. it had a modest impact on our year-to-date cash flow and we expect to see a relatively modest impact on our full year guide.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
maybe just one more add to this and the prior question, so we've had a lot of focus from investors on usps and the impact usps had on our business and us is obviously a large deal, but it was not what drove our q3 overachievement. usps came in very much as per our expectations.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
understood. i appreciate that additional color. and then a follow-up if i could, on the regional growth you broke it out in the slide deck. looks like, north america, europe, latin america is kind of trending actually a little bit better than maybe some upper indicators would suggest. apac was down pretty heavily maybe more so than other companies have disclosed at least directionally. so, on asia pacific is the issue there just -- first of all, is it a discrepancy and then is it due to china versus non-china, is it to help a specific end-markets or customers, is there something going on with the channel inventory levels there. i'm just trying to get a better feel for, i guess the weakness in apac.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
well first, more globally i'd say what we see globally and also in asia-pac is some of the secular trends that are supporting our business have accelerated as part of covid, so around omnichannel, the digitization and automation those are all -- those are global trends, and in asia pac though we have -- our business has been driven more by, say, a run rate business rather than large deals. so, the run rate business in manufacturing, it has been larger parts of our asia-pac business than in other areas.
and specifically in q3, i think the covid-19 drove bigger declines in southeast asia and india where good parts of those countries were more or less shut down, so that was more impactful for asia pac, but asia pac was up from -- sequentially from q2 and china actually returned to growth and as i said, we have new leadership in china, a new general manager who is doing a great job there for us. we did also see some relative strength in australia in q3.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
that makes sense. thanks a lot for the time.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah.
operator
our next question will come from andrew buscaglia with berenberg. please go ahead.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
hey guys. i just wanted to clarify something; the usps award. so, you said you're going to wrap up most of the deal or most of that award by end of q3. i think the deal was -- the award was $570 million in total or upwards of, i guess what portion of that will be fully ramped up, because i know there's follow on stuff that is comprised within that $570 million?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think the contract award was up to a maximum of $570 million. i don't think at this stage, we can give you -- when we break out and say specifically how large account the -- the volume for the usps will be as part of this contract.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
okay. also in your q4 guide, it was a nice guide and i think about a 30 year sales is emea which didn't quite rebound as much as north america and now we're starting to see lockdowns again. so, i guess what have you contemplated in that guide, is it conservative and does it take into account, kind of what's going on in europe?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
we feel confident in our sales guide for q4, it reflects the positive momentum we have in the business. we entered the quarter with a strong backlog, we had very healthy levels or lower levels of inventory in the channel, so the quarter is actually more front-end loaded than normal. so, we do see that as giving us great confidence in our guide, but there is obviously still continued pressures from covid and some uncertainty around this. i'd say though specifically to europe and some of the lockdowns there that -- i think if you compare this to april when -- or end of march when the lockdown started, i think now companies -- most of the lock-downs are intended to be more on the aspect of the social life rather than enterprises and business life. and i think companies, like ourselves, we have learned i think how to operate much better in this environment.
so, i would expect that the impact of a lockdown would be less severe now, and the lockdown would again i think drive some of the trends that we've talked about around omnichannel, buy online, pick up in store and so forth, which would have some offsetting positive impact for us.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
all right. that's helpful color. thanks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our last question today will come from jeff kessler with imperial capital. please go ahead.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
thank you. when you talk about providing a full, let's call it recurring revenue saas type of solution that you're developing going forward, which vertical markets have been -- which vertical markets do you think have been most interested in, at least, talking about how to get to a -- if you want to call it a full zebra solution for them at this point?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i'm not sure if i can say that any vertical has been more excited about this than others -- maybe i can say though that our, if you look at some of our more recent software acquisitions like reflexis and zebra prescriptive analytics or profitect as it was previously known. the primary vertical markets that they address have been retail. so, we're probably further along in retail than we are in other markets, but i'd say, i would highlight healthcare is certainly an industry -- or a vertical that has a lot of interest in broader solutions and acquire them as a service.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
okay. and the follow-up, in terms of what types of services and or technologies might the add-on to usps once you've done the first part of the -- once you've finished the first part of the contract would that be instructive for other -- for other areas in which you might be able to expand your total available market?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'm not sure if i want to get ahead of ourselves and talk about what possible business we might win from usps in the future. usps is a customer of many of our diff products already, so printing, scanning and mobile computing services -- some software solutions. so, i see opportunities for us to engage across a broad suite of solutions. but, i don't know that i want to highlight any specific ones for you.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
okay. and just quickly in that line of thinking on new types of technology, with regard to your mobile scanners and with the other technologies that you're employing, have you been taking a look at the increase in other types of identifiers such as such as ble or nfc -- other types of technologies that may be complementary to what you're using right now?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so, i guess the broad answer will be yes. we're certainly looking at all sorts of data capture type of technologies, our mobile computers, many of them have nfc already, so we're always looking to see how we can provide the right type of functionality to enable our customers to get the best roi for those solutions.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
this is jo heel. you might remember that we introduced the proximity monitoring solution that's based on bluetooth low energy, which is built into our devices and nfc technologies, for example are used in solutions we have for railway ticketing. so, those are all technologies we're already using and we think have more potential in the future.
jeff kessler -- imperial capital -- analyst
okay, great, thank you very much.
operator
this will conclude our question and answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to mr. gustafsson for any closing remarks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. to wrap up, i would just like to thank our employees, customers and partners who are working the frontline during this challenging time. our team is executing well through the pandemic and we are proud that our technology solutions are helping enterprises navigating through the challenges of covid-19 as the world recovers. stay safe everyone.

good day, and welcome to the third quarter 2020 zebra technologies earnings conference call. all participants will be in listen-only mode. [operator instructions]
i'd, now like to turn the conference over to mike steele, vice president, investor relations.
please go ahead.
michael steele -- vice president-investor relations
good morning and welcome to zebra's third quarter conference call. this presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. slide two conveys that the forward-looking statements we make today are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our sec filings. during this call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures as we describe our business performance.
you can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. this presentation will include prepared remarks from anders gustafsson, our chief executive officer and nathan winters, our acting chief financial officer.
anders will begin with our third quarter results, then nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our fourth quarter outlook. anders will conclude with progress on advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision and trends in our end markets. following the prepared remarks, jo heel, our senior vice president of global sales will join us as we take your questions. now, let's flip to slide 4 as i turn the call over to anders.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you mike. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. we are honored that our solutions are empowering frontline workers in their battle against covid-19. i am proud of our employees' resiliency and focus on serving our customers' critical needs during these challenging times. our top priority continues to be protecting the health and well-being of our employees, customers and partners as businesses continue to progress with their reopening plans.
in q3, our results continued to be pressured by the global macro environment. for the quarter, we realized net sales growth of 30 basis points. adjusted ebitda margin of 20.3% which contracted by 240 basis points and non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $3.27, a 5% decrease from the prior year. as a result of excellent execution by our teams and the faster than expected recovery in demand, each of these measures exceeded our outlook. demand from our large strategic customers has been at record levels driven by accelerated trends to digitize and automate workflows. not surprisingly, the pandemic has disproportionately impacted our smaller customers and certain end markets, which has resulted in a significant shift in business mix.
together with premium shipping costs, this has weighed on gross margin. in light of this pressure we have continued to diligently manage discretionary costs, to preserve profitability and cash flow. despite the challenging environment, our enterprise customers have been prioritizing spend with zebra and i would like to highlight some notable q3 success stories. we expanded our relationship with a leading e-commerce retailer, experiencing significantly increased order volumes. they require trusted technology solutions that enable improved supply chain and order fulfillment execution to empower their labor force. we are deploying our mobile computing, scanning and printing solutions across their growing global footprint.
innovation, quality and value are critical partner attributes cited by this customer, and we are proud that our team is delivering to their high standards. the hospital system in denmark has chosen to replace a competitor with our clinical point of care solution. in q3 they began a multi-quarter deployment of our health-care purposed tc5 series mobile computers and accessories, which will interface seamlessly with their electronic medical health record system. we have continued to deploy tc7 series mobile computers to usps postal carriers as planned, and are now passing through their peak holiday season expecting to resume in late q1 with the goal of completion by mid-q3.
we are proud that we are able to help our customers meet their mission critical needs in an increasingly on demand economy. we continue to view acquisitions as a vector of profitable growth for zebra, and the way to elevate our role as a solutions provider. in early september, we closed on the reflexis acquisition in a few minutes, i'll elaborate on how this acquisition is synergistic to our offering.
with that, i will now turn the call over to nathan to review our q3 financial results and discuss our q4 outlook.
nathan winters -- acting chief financial officer
thank you anders. let's start with the p&l on slide 6. net sales increased 30 basis points before the modest net impact of currencies and acquisitions. as anders mentioned, large order volume was much stronger than the prior year. this was offset by a decline in small and mid size business through the channel, which disproportionately impacted printing and data capture. our enterprise visibility & mobility segment sales increased 4% driven by solid growth in mobile computing and services. our asset intelligence & tracking segment, including printing and supplies continue to be most impacted by the global recessionary environment with sales decreasing 7% from the prior year.
this was a notable 18 point sequential improvement from the q2 decline. we realized solid growth in our managed and professional services and zebra retail solutions. location solutions declined from last year due to lower project activity during the pandemic. we realized significant sequential improvement in each of our regions from q2, as we continue to recover from the peak of the pandemic. in north america sales increased 6%, mobile computing and data capture returned to solid growth and services continued to perform well.
emea sales were flat, services and mobile computing were bright spots. we also continue to see strength in central and northern europe. sales in our asia-pacific region declined 13%. china was a bright spot returning to modest growth. latin america sales declined 20% with all major product and service categories declining. adjusted gross margin contracted 390 basis points to 43.8% driven primarily by more than 3 points from unfavorable business mix and nearly 1 point from premium freight costs, which was partially offset by improved services margin.
underlying margin trends across the business, excluding mix dynamics remain healthy. adjusted operating expenses declined $17 million from the prior year period and improved 150 basis points as a percentage of sales. this improvement was primarily due to disciplined cost management and lower compensation expense, while preserving our planned investments in the business. third quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 20.3% a 240 basis points decrease from the prior-year period, driven entirely by lower gross margin.
we drove non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $3.27, a $0.16 or 5% year-over-year decrease. turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide 7. we generated $482 million of free cash flow in the first 9 months of 2020. this was $106 million higher than the prior year period, primarily due to a lower use of working capital as well as our expanded accounts receivable factoring program. our balance sheet is strong. from a debt leverage perspective, we ended q3 at a comfortable 1.8 times net debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio, 0.5 times higher than last quarter due to financing the acquisition of reflexis. now, turning to slide 8, we have demonstrated that we can deliver solid results in a challenging economic environment, while continuing to invest in our future.
our consistently strong free cash flow generation is driven by our capital-light business model, flexible cost structure, diversified end markets, strong execution and disciplined cost management. let's now turn to our outlook. we are encouraged by the faster than expected recovery with small and mid-sized businesses and are beginning to realize the benefit of pent-up demand from many customers who have paused their spending earlier in the year. based on these trends, and our healthy channel inventory levels, we expect q4 adjusted net sales to increase between 3% and 7%. this outlook assumes an approximately 150 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of reflexis and a neutral impact from foreign currency changes.
we believe q4 adjusted ebitda margin will be between 21% and 22% which assumes modest operating expense leverage from the prior year. gross margin is expected to be slightly lower than last year, reflecting higher large order mix in a soft, but improving macro environment, as well as an offsetting year-on-year impacts of premium freight and tariff expense. non-gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.90. you can see other modeling assumptions on slide 9. note that, we now expect free cash flow to be at least $650 million for the year, which is higher than 2019.
with that, i will turn the call back to anders to discuss how reflexis is synergistic with our enterprise asset intelligence vision as well as trends in our end markets.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you nathan. slide 11 highlights how we are building on our foundational capabilities to elevate our value proposition with customers as a solutions provider. our unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast installed base of products, uniquely positions us to solve our customers' complex challenges at the edge. we are investing in emerging technologies that help our customers better orchestrate their workflows by leveraging real-time data to gain actionable insights. we are excited to have reflexis on board, which further helps zebra bring our enterprise asset intelligence vision to life for retailers and other end markets.
reflexis is a demonstrated leader in intelligent workforce management and task execution. their platform is utilized by hundreds of retailers around the globe to drive employee productivity and retention, while also improving customer engagement. reflexis is synergistic with our existing suite of solutions as a service. as you can see on slide 12, these include smartcount, which is an innovative self-scan and physical inventory management solution. our smartsight robotic solution, which uses automated intelligence to help identify issues on the store shelf in real time.
our workforce connect data and voice communication and collaboration application for mobile workers and zebra prescriptive analytics, which provides data-driven insights and a prioritized list of prescriptive actions that help maximize efficiency and reduce shrinkage. zebra's suite of solutions work in unison with our product portfolio to provide real time contextual tasking. this capability is critical for successfully addressing the inevitable unplanned events that occur throughout the workday.
over the next few quarters, we will continue to invest in the seamless integration of reflexis' market leading platform with our complementary software offerings to optimize the experience for frontline workers. we are also investing in our go-to-market efforts to drive accelerated traction with our unmatched suite of solutions. we believe that our enterprise customers will realize a compelling roi by empowering all of their associates with these solutions. on slide 13, we provide an update regarding the mixed impacts, we are currently seeing in the primary vertical markets that we serve.
we also highlight the exciting longer-term opportunities in our end markets as customers invest in our technology, in an increasingly on-demand economy. trends are improving since our last quarterly update, although it is still a mixed picture depending on the sector. in healthcare, our solutions help hospitals intelligently flex their capacity to serve patients. there was a pause in non-critical care during the peak of the pandemic straining the budgets of health service providers, which is changing now that elective procedures are resuming.
longer term, the need for increased real-time visibility into the entire patient journey and the demand for innovative solutions to provide safe and efficient care continue to make healthcare a high growth, end market opportunity. retailers are prioritizing investment in our technology for their complex omnichannel fulfillment strategies and related warehouse automation needs. demand from large retailers is at record levels as e-commerce and buy online initiated transactions have increased dramatically through the pandemic.
we have also begun to resume business with many department stores and specialty retailers that have been reopening their doors. in the transportation and logistics space strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes and last mile delivery, which is favorable to zebra. passenger airlines, rental car providers and other related businesses remained challenged. the manufacturing sector continues to be most impacted with covid-19 and global trade tensions. key segments within process manufacturing such as food and pharmaceutical companies have held up relatively well, continuing to operate through the pandemic.
we've seen mixed trends in discrete manufacturing with those in aviation and discretionary specialty goods, particularly challenged. a bright spot is our solid recovery in chinese manufacturing. in closing, we are successfully navigating through this challenging environment while we continue to invest in advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision. this is enabling zebra to emerge from this crisis in a stronger, competitive position. we also believe that our longer-term prospects are strengthening as secular trends to digitize and automate workflows have accelerated.
now, i'll hand the call back over to mike.
michael steele -- vice president-investor relations
thanks anders. we'll now open the call to q&a, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from andrew buscaglia from berenberg. please go ahead.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
morning.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
so your guidance, such a strong q1 guidance, yet for the full-year, it seems conservative. and can you talk about what you're expecting toward, more toward the back half of the year, because your guidance implies maybe for evm more low single-digit growth, ait probably going negative in q4. what's built into that back half, any color would be great.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
first, our industry leadership and our steadfast investments in the -- in our broad solutions is what's enabling us to rebound stronger and i think faster than our competitors. so we do expect double-digit growth for q1, but also for the full year 2021. and obviously, this is a strong rebound from a more challenging 2020. we do feel as confident as ever about our business. we do expect growth across all our regions, verticals and business lines as we look at 2021. but we are a bit more cautious about our -- the assumptions we put into our second half forecast, given the global macro uncertainty that we're facing. and we're also starting to cycle so much tougher comps in q4. we should also mention -- we are not assuming any growth in large deals or large accounts in the second half of 2021.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay. and how much of usps is in the q1 guide, because that's such a big guide. and then, maybe any other color you can give us on usps into q2 and q3. so maybe percentage that it accounted for per quarter or something.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. so on usps, the roll-outs progressing as we expected. the teams are continuing to be highly engaged, as we noted the current roll-outs around our emc 300,000 tc-77 and the 300,000 roll-out, we paused that since october going into the election and holiday season. and we do expect that to resume in late q1 and really a modest impact in our q1 guide.
and then, for the full-year, we expect usps but a point of our sales growth, of the usps growth to account for about a point of our full-year growth primarily in the first half of the year.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
so not much, so that q1 guide, not much, because that's all pure organic, very little related to usps, that as pure like end market demand -- is it primarily in evm or is it or is there sort of a bulky order in ait or one of the other?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes, that's correct on usps and i'd say broad-based across both segments in q1.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay. right. thanks guys.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
there has been nice to see the business has performed very nicely in q4 and the outlook for q1 across all our products and verticals.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay. thanks, anders.

the next question is from tommy moll of stephens. please go ahead.
tommy moll -- stephens inc -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
good morning.
tommy moll -- stephens inc -- analyst
anders, i wanted to start with a follow-up on your retail and e-commerce end markets. and in the second half of last year, maybe most of last year, once the pandemic took hold, it sounded like within those end markets, it was larger customers who are leaning in quicker into some of the omnichannel capabilities that you offer? then, in today's commentary, you indicated that some small customer activity has resumed and is looking positive, maybe some of that is on the printer side. but i'm curious what you could give us on the mid or smaller-sized customers within those retail and e-com's end markets, anything changing for the better there or any context would be helpful.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. first, i'd say that across all the verticals that we are uniquely positioned to empower front-line workers to perform their duties better and more effectively and with higher customer service, particularly where covid-19 has helped accelerate some of those secular trends around digitization and automation. so each of our four primary verticals have had a positive growth trajectory as we entered into 2021. and we're making good progress also in some newer expansion verticals that we talked about in our prepared remarks. now, specifically, for retail and e-commerce, i'd say, we saw a step change in consumer adoptions of omnichannel e-commerce as part of the early phase of covid. if you look at in the store, buy online pickup at store and other delivery used cases, we're growing very rapidly. and in the warehouse, a lot of investments in technology to help automate them or also necessary for retailers to transform their business models. and we're starting to see pilots for our enterprise asset intelligence solutions starting to resume. and other trend that we seen in retail is around equipping all associates with a device that's also very synergistic with our reflexis workforce and task management solutions where they work very much hand in hand. and the strength we saw around more small and medium-sized businesses was broad based. it includes retail, also e-commerce is probably less of smaller companies, that is more large businesses, but the small and medium-sized business strength that we saw, especially expand across the four verticals that we work in.
joachim heel -- senior vice president-global sales
perhaps an addition from my side, jo speaking. in the depth of the pandemic in the q2-q3 time frame we saw that the large retail and e-commerce customers have the wherewithal to continue investing and in fact charged headlong if you will into transforming their businesses, whereas small and medium-sized customers paused their spending and were a bit cautious, in particular outside of the u.s. we saw this phenomenon. but we also learned that the solutions that we have, in particular on the printing and scanning side, are essential to these customers and they ultimately need to come back and refresh those and that is driving a lot of pent-up demand that we were seeing in q4 as they returned to make those essential purchases.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
that's very helpful, thank you both and anders, you referenced something i wanted to ask as a follow-up relating to the proof of concept type pilots that you have with some retailers, where potentially all associates in the store have some kind of device. what additional color could you give us there just in terms of what inning we're in and in terms of those pilots, when there might be an opportunity for some larger-scale commercialization of that concept and then i noted, let's see, last month, end of january, you introduced a new mobile computer series, the ec5x, and the description there sounded like it might be tied to these pilot concepts. so i wonder if you could comment on that product innovation as well to the extent it's related.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, for our customers to introduce a device for every worker, that's a great opportunity for zebra. great expansion for us. our estimate is today that in retail, about one-third of all store associates are equipped with the device. and i'd say today, it varies greatly between retailers, how deeply they have penetrated into their associate base with devices. some are much further long than others. we are -- we have worked to basically expand our portfolio of mobile computing devices to ensure that we have an appropriate form factors and price points to enable our customers to take this more deeper into their associate base and we expect that this will be a continued trend. i'm not sure i expect it to be a big step function changes in behaviors, but more looking to continually add to -- add devices to the store associate base to be able to ensure that they are all connected and able to take advantage of all the other digital tools and solutions that the retailers offer.
joachim heel -- senior vice president-global sales
maybe.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i don't know jo if you have any.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yeah, i wanted to just point out two other things that i think address this question. one, you're right about the release of the ec5, it's ec50 and ec55, which are device that combine consumer-like form factor with all of the advantages that we bring into the enterprise android ecosystems and so we expect that that device in particular will play a role in this trend of device fall, but i also wanted to point out another synergistic part of our strategy, which is the acquisition of reflexis -- well reflexis, as you know, does task and workforce management and therefore needs to reach every worker within the enterprise, in particular, of course, retail, which is their dominant vertical, and so therefore, having a device in the hands of every worker, now all of a sudden becomes essential again and now we're in a great position to meet that demand.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
all very helpful, thank you. and i will turn it back.

the next question is from jim ricchiuti needham & company. please go ahead.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, good morning. anders i wanted to just follow up on the comments about the second half and the assumptions around large deals. how does that -- say you're not assuming large deals. how does that compare with prior years because typically some of that large deal activity does materialize i would assume as you're going through the year?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
that's correct. we -- and so this is more a matter of limited visibility into the second half than it is that there is a certainty that there won't be growth in larger deals. i think this is similar to how we generally i think forecast our years. so yeah.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. and i wonder if you could, my follow-up question is just regarding component constraints. we're hearing throughout the supply chain tightness in semiconductor components and i'm wondering to what extent that's impacting you guys as you think about your supply chain.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. we've definitely seen the lead times extending and -- but our team is working diligently and i think we are on top of it. we have incorporated whatever visibility we have to extend that lead times for semiconductors and other components into our outlook also, particularly for the second half.
james ricchiuti -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from meta marshall with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks and congrats on the quarter. i guess i just wanted to dig into how you guys are thinking about gross margins into q1 and into 2021. clearly you guys saw a pickup in kind of your smaller customers, which would have helped gross margins in q4. you clearly have some large deals and still some overhang from freight as you head through 2021. so just how we should be thinking of the progression of gross margins through 2021 and then maybe just as a second question, just given the kind of very healthy cash flow that you guys saw in 2020 and kind of the continuation of that into 2021, how do you guys think about balance sheet prioritization currently. thanks.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yes. so if you look at our full year guide ebitda of 21% to 22%, we expect gross margin to improve year-on-year primarily due to the order size mix normalizing, which we saw in q4 and implied in our q1 guide. we do expect premium freight cost to persist around $30 million to $40 million, yet declining in the second half as air travel returns and within the full year guide we do expect opex to increase as a percent of sales, once you include the full year of reflexis as well as the majority of our spend returning post covid including incentive compensation and travel, particularly in the second half. i also think it's worth noting when we look at the full-year ebitda guide, reflexis, as we've stated, can be dollar neutral here yet slightly dilutive, given the investments in go-to-market and the platform and then we do expect that to scale over time.
on your second question, if you look at free cash flow of $895 million, a strong finish to the year, really around improved core working capital performance particularly in ar. we saw very strong collection activity and some early timing at the end of the year as well as our q4 sales were front loaded driving some of the benefit, as well as small incremental ar factoring, lower taxes, interest expense, and incentive comp kind of driving the year-on-year beat. so when we look at, for 2021, we do expect it to decline, but primarily due to just exceptional 2020 performance and really more normalizing the free cash flow conversion rate over the two-year period.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it, thanks.
operator
the next question is from paul coster of jpmorgan. please go ahead.
paul coster -- jp morgan -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking my question. i am just wondering if we are at the sort of, inflection point for the company in terms of the mix shift and margin outlook. as the ait business comes back, that will be driven by the smaller accounts here obviously has higher margins, but you've also got the software and services business growing faster, sounds like figure it out. here you're probably saying in excess of 50% growth for the reflexis business, which has what 20 percentage points higher gross margins than the rest of the business. so it all feels to me like we're heading toward a new margin structure over the next three or four years, can you comment on that.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
the margin structure or more of the business inflection generally?
paul coster -- jp morgan -- analyst
well, not. yeah, the margin, i guess it's related obviously anders. but our gross margin is going to be expanding from here on out and is the business mix i suppose going to be permanently changing here?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. okay. i think nathan is in best positioned to answer that.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, paul. so if we look at margin and margin expansion over time, we do believe we can go higher. we have many levers to achieve that. i think as you mentioned scaling, some of the newer markets with richer gross margin reflexis being an one of those proof points.
and we always continue to focus on driving higher gross margin and productivity through all of our operational efficiencies across the business. and we've had a track record of doing that and driving profitable growth. and we do expect ebitda margins to get back to the pre-pandemic levels in '21. and we really don't see any reason that, that should be constrained as we move forward in terms of continued expansion.
paul coster -- jp morgan -- analyst
i guess i'm not asking my question very well. but with -- is that going to be a mix shift toward ait and service and software and will that drive-up the margins structurally over the long-term, not just to pre-pandemic levels, but to sort of almost pre msi acquisition levels?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i'd say first, maybe think about the business around our core near adjacencies and around the enterprise asset intelligence or intelligent edge solutions, so more the newer stuff. i do believe that our core business, ait printing and scanning side including services are very healthy, good shape and i expect them to continue to grow at a nice rate over the longer term. i don't expect printing to kind of break-out from the pack here. printing has been a bit more up and down over the last year. so we had probably a bit more of the pent-up demand in printing solutions than we had in some of the other solutions. but if you look into our -- the enterprise asset intelligence vision that we have in the intelligent edge solutions, i do expect that our software assets and some of our more intelligent automation solutions to grow faster than the company average from a gross margin perspective. and obviously the scale will help us here, but also as we invest in some of the newer solutions, it will be up and kind of investment phase first. and then, we will see margins expanding we believe quite nicely once revenue starting to grow.
paul coster -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay, thanks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
does that answered your question?
paul coster -- jp morgan -- analyst
yeah. yeah, it does. just in passing on the -- with respect to reflexis am i right that it's posting more than 50% compound growth at the moment. and can you just comment on the growth rate tam time as well.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so we aren't commenting on the specific growth rates that they have. but reflexis has been growing at a nice double-digit growth rates for the last several years. and we have high expectations that will continue to do that. and it will also help accelerate some of our others -- growth of some of our other software assets that it will be benefiting from being associated with and incorporated into the reflexis platform. and tam time has had nice growth over the last few years. and we do see this year the opportunity to accelerate growth as we support covid-19 vaccine roll-outs also distribution, so that we do expect a double-digit growth for a our tam time business as well.
paul coster -- jp morgan -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
the next question is from joe aiken of william blair. please go ahead.
joe aiken -- william blair -- analyst
thanks. this is joe on for brian today. i want to start, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, some wins beyond your traditional end markets. i think you mentioned waste hauler in particular. i was wondering if you could maybe just provide a little more color, any context around what brought you into that win and maybe what the opportunity is in different non-traditional end markets that you're seeing and how many of that could be going forward?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. i can start with this and then jo can also provide some extra color here. but -- and so we have made -- maybe so first of all on the product side, we've invested in addressing some of the use cases that we see in some of these new emerging verticals, government utilities and so forth. but also we made meaningful go-to-market investments and we've said you probably started with our acquisition of xplore.
but then we've tweaked our other products to also address these use cases more. so it's been a big focus of ours and the investment of ours over the last several years to make sure we position ourselves for this. and we now have a portfolio of solutions and partners that can help us get into these opportunities and win them. jo?
joachim heel -- senior vice president-global sales
yeah. i would only add, the end markets that have shown some particular promise our government both federal and state and local as well as the broader service industry, where the highest hauling example fits in, the xplore acquisition, where xplore has a strong market. the rugged tablets are a strong product offering into those markets has been instrumental in leading us there. but it also has been something we've been pursuing for some time. but it does, it does take some time to buildup the channel infrastructure as well as fine tune the product offering and higher the appropriate type of dedicated and the expert sales reps who can operate in those verticals. and we feel we now have that in place and it's beginning to pay off.
joe aiken -- william blair -- analyst
great. thanks to both of you. it's really helpful. and i know, on some past calls, you've talked about the transition to android on the mobile devices in the past and the benefit you're seeing from that. is that transition largely over at this point? and maybe just to put a finer point on that, what percentage of devices do you estimate that you're shipping today are running microsoft operating system?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
first around our mobile computing platform overall maybe we saw solid growth in q4. we did benefit from recovery in the small and medium-sized business segment there also. there's three trends that i think are worth highlighting, the android transition is one of those. but i'll start with new use cases. we talked earlier about the second trend, which was around more so -- putting a device into hand of every worker. but use cases has probably been the biggest driver. think about omnichannel and retail, healthcare is the newer vertical, which largely is new use cases. and then, the third trend around the android transition, we still have lots of momentum around the android transition and a lot of opportunity left in that. we have our market share in android is still around 60%, but android now makes up about 80% of our mobile computing sales. we've often talked about the transition -- from transitioning all their legacy windows devices to android. but today, i think the opportunity to refresh existing installed older android devices is actually bigger. they are -- our estimate is that there is now low double-digit millions of android devices in the markets with somewhat shorter refresh cycle than the old windows devices used to have. and which expect that there is about a high single-digit million windows devices out there. so it's more of a balanced perspective and we certainly like to get both of those. and but android has been a great catalyst for growth for us.
joe aiken -- william blair -- analyst
that's really helpful. thanks for taking my questions.
operator
the next question is from richard eastman of robert w. baird. please go ahead.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
just a quick question. could you tell us the china tariff rebate impacted gross profit margin, did that impacts the evm margin? was that solely confined to evm?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
it was -- thanks for the question. so out of the $12 million, $8 million was associated with evm and then $4 million was for ait.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. okay.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
in the fourth quarter.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yeah, in q4, ok. and then, just a question around maybe the balance that you saw in your go-to-market. so, for all of '20, can you just kind of tell us how the direct business did relative to the channel? i'm just thinking sales growth or decline?
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yeah. i can start and then jo can provide some additional color also. our direct business obviously did very well because we had a strong large deal activity, but also a lot of the larger customers that we worked with, we have been supporting through channel partners. so our channel centricity -- so that's how much of our revenues go through channel partners was actually i think an all-time high in q3 or q4. so we have maintained a high degree of channel centricity in the business. jo?
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yeah, i see.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
exactly. our strategy has been and will be to be a channel first, go-to-market approach and i think that's paid off very well for us here in the pandemic because the strong relationships with our partners have been instrumental in helping us recover faster. i mean we're seeing that in particular in the run rate, but as anders said a large -- if you recall the contribution of large deals made to our second half in particular, it's remarkable that the channel centricity percentage business going through the channel has expanded in light of that, right, and that is part of our strategy.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
when you speak to some of the smaller and medium customers, is that visibility coming through from the vars, i mean, we speak about the channel, but we obviously put distribution in there versus the vars, i guess my question is what's the visibility on the vars in the smaller and medium-sized customers rebounding in '21. do you have that visibility either in orders or is it front log and conversation with vars or?
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
we rarely have visibility to specific individualized orders and small medium businesses. right.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yeah, yeah.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
we do have to see distribution and channel in between, but what we know is that our distributors have a very strong outlook for the upcoming quarters at least and are ordering strongly with us as we indicated our order volumes have been strong and that's i think a reflection of that optimism that our distributors are feeling, in particular also from smb customers.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
i see. so when you look into '21, i'm really trying to get at is, obviously, the gross profit margin assumption as nate pointed out is higher in '21 and is the mix of end customers there from small to medium. obviously, you mentioned large orders in the back half of the year. you're a little cautious there. but is that mix supporting that upward migration in the gross margin when you think about '21?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes. we expect to have a more traditional mix of business in 2021 than we had in 2020 where for q2 and q3 particularly large deals were over-represented and we do -- as jo said, our visibility around individual, smaller deals are not great, but our channel account managers do meet with our channel partners and work on forecasts and looking at specific deals and what support they need from us and so forth. so we do have some level of visibility, but obviously the further out in time you go, the less clear that visibility is.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yes, i understand. and just staying on this gross margin for one more second, from a pricing perspective, what's the assumption going into '21. are we able to capture enough price to recover some of the cogs inflation that we're seeing in the business, it would appear so, but is there any price increase, a net price increase, that you might expect or is it mainly kind of net pricing?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so, maybe first when probably when you talk about cogs increases, is that the freight charges you're referring to?
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yes, some freight charges and just any other cost inflation in the supply chain -- in your supply chain?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think we don't modify our pricing based on what we believe to be a temporary cost inflation for freight, but we do have a lot of analytics and thoughts around our overall price points and where the market is and we do always strive to get a premium for our brand. so pricing and margins, obviously are very strong focus that we have across the company, but we haven't necessarily gone and changed our price list because of this.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yeah. okay.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
well maybe another way to think about this is if you looked back at 2020, the mix of our business in terms of small versus large was skewed toward the large, right?
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yes.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
because as you said, the small.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah.
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
so there was a pause in purchasing from the small that resumed toward the end, but in the long-term analysis, small was down relative to the long-term average. in 2021, we expect that mix will return closer to normal and therefore, simply because of the mix effects, we think that the average price points would normalize as well as a result of that, right. that is an effect.
richard eastman -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay, that's my answer. okay. excellent. thank you.
operator
the next question is from keith housum of northcoast research. please go ahead.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen and congratulations on a good quarter and good guidance. just trying to unpack the printer growth a little bit more. can you help me understand in terms of that growth, is a substantial part of that growth being driven by, i know the smbs but also growth in the supply business as well?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes. yeah, we had obviously great growth in both printing and supplies. both printing and supplies were up double digits in the quarter. our printing business was up across the portfolio. we did benefit from some pent-up demand, particularly in emea. you remember emea also was hit harder early on in the pandemic, so there was probably a bit more of a rebound to be had there. i'd also say though that we have -- early in 2020 we took a number of actions to strengthen our go-to-market and strengthened our channel ecosystem, particularly around printing and i think that is now bearing fruit for us also so we are more competitive, and that's helping to accelerate our share gains in printing specifically, but we did see our business through -- our smaller business, small to mid size business recovered quite nicely. it recovered faster than we had expected. i think it's fair to say in q4, manufacturing has been a relatively light vertical, but a strong vertical for printing generally, but lighter over last year but that was also coming back and strengthening and rfid was actually a very strong quarter for printing. i think it was a record quarter for print rfid. and then on supplies, we did see strong performance in supplies, particularly north america and temptime also had a strong fourth quarter, but overall though i'd say that we have a very strong portfolio of smart and connected printers that have an unrivaled manageability through our linquest operating system and that is a true differentiator in the market.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
okay, appreciate it. and just one follow-up, i think a comment made earlier during the q&a. and i think the commentary was that the u.s. postal service will contribute about 1% growth for the year with most of that coming in the first half. but i also heard you guys say that it's going to be only very modest for the first quarter. so that could imply, if i have number -- if my math is right, that you guys could have $400 million contribution in the second quarter from the u.s. postal service? is that right and is that include ancillary projects as well as the main 300,000 devices being fulfilled.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yeah. so if you look at the usps for the year regarding the size of the rollout, i think if you look at the 300,000 printers and what we expect to deliver throughout 2021. i think you can -- you really do the implication of we're selling about $2 million mobile computers annually. that can help you in for in terms of an average price range. i think the number you have for q2 is a little bit higher than what we'd anticipate in terms of the full year implied guide.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
all right, thank you.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yes. remember, we've talked about earlier the total volume of mobile computers for usps this contract is about 300,000 over two years.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
all right. yeah, just doing the math there, i guess that $400 million roughly. i understand it might be a little bit high, seems a little bit more than a lot of us were assuming for the entire value of the contract and we realize you guys fulfilled some last year as well as, as we go fulfill this year. so it seems again perhaps higher than obviously we're assuming.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, it might be as i said, i think the best way for you to think about usps this year is to the 1% of our growth in 2021 is coming from growth of our usps business. and i would say, q2 is the only quarter, but q1 we'll start ramping up toward the end of q1, but q2, q3 will certainly be part of it.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
so its 1% of your growth, not 1% of the business, ok?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. 1% of our growth. yeah.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
got it. okay. thank you.
operator
the next question is from blake gendron of wolfe research. please go ahead.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. thanks, good morning. one to follow-up there with some of the growth commentary [technical issues] so, do dollar impact from what you would consider pent-up demand to be greater or less than 4q? and do you expect some pent-up demand follow through into the second quarter? and i guess, longer term, i mean, are we going to see this pent-up demand idiosyncrasies show up in subsequent years, just based on the replacement cycle or is it going to normalize fairly quickly as we recover here on the pandemic?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
well, yeah. the pent-up demand concept is a little hard to get be overly specific about the impact of it. but i'd say that starting with, our products and solutions and our mission-critical for our enterprise customers and they need that to compete effectively in our on demand economy. the sales to our larger companies, larger customers as we've talked about an earlier question remained strong. and they have prioritized spend with us to better position themselves to address the newer automation and digitization trends like omnichannel as an example. and that's a larger customers' we are better positioned to pivot their businesses early in the pandemic to align with how consumers wanted to behave. how the economy was working at at that point, while smaller customers had to kind of pause spending or certainly cut back on it.
but i think, now we see the smaller companies coming back and other customers are also realizing that they need to invest in order to compete, competing in the same way they did prior to covid is not necessarily going to be a successful formula.
and i think that part of this is also that we have been able to execute very well during the pandemic and we've been able to gain share. our supply chain has shown great agility to be able to respond to customers that quickly want to ramp up their order volumes. and i think we were able to do that well and see some opportunities that way. now -- so we have been realizing some good demand from this pent-up demand you can say, which helped us in q4 and i expect it to help us in q1 here also.
but more broadly, though, as we look forward, we are very excited about the business overall and the growth prospects that we have not just it did in q4, q1 but longer term based on our ability to help our customers digitize and automate their businesses.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
and blake just to add, this is nathan. it's obviously as anders mentioned a tough one to quantify. and if you look at our q1 guide, we kind of think of the pent-up demand is likely contributing low double-digit growth on top of mid-teen growth from what you can say is our normal growth rates, the impact of acquisitions, fx as well as cycling from a comp perspective versus last year, where we started to feel the impacts of covid late in q1 last year.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. that's helpful. i understand it's tough to quantify and to segregate everything, but the longer-term growth outlook is kind of what i was getting at and that's constructive. my follow-up is on evm. i'm just wondering over the last, call it 12 months or through the pandemic, what the growth of existing customers is with evm versus new customer wins? how you see that evolving i guess here over '21 and beyond? and is there any major margin difference between one or the other or should we think about evm kind of along the same lines and delineate large versus small customers in terms of margin difference?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i'll start by saying, new customers, if you're looking for kind of brand new customers that haven't done any business with us, it's rare that we have those because most companies are doing some level of business with us. so it's probably more that we have new awards or new use cases with those customers. again it's hard -- we can only -- we really only have visibility into that for our larger customers. and i think we have had a good healthy flip of new customers and i expect that we will continue to add new use cases and new applications.
if you look at our portfolio of solutions, we've invested meaningfully to ensure we can expand the number of use cases that help address our customers most pressing problems. so we feel good about our ability, our competitive positioning and our ability to win some of these new use cases. they may not necessarily be brand new customers, but they are might brand new use cases. jo, i dont know if you have any comments?
joachim heel -- senior vice president, global sales
yeah. i mean, i would add that i mean to your point about is there a big margin difference between the two, i would say not noticeably. the new customers that we are able to acquire so ones that were previously competitor customers, they have been meaningful ones, of course, right? i mean, usps is one example of those that was in the last 12 months. but they do range from the small to the large and therefore i would expect without having done the analysis that there isn't a meaningful margin difference between the two.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's very helpful. one more if i can sneak it in here, balance sheet is in great shape. i'm wondering if you could just level set the capital allocation thoughts here and maybe update us on the m&a pipeline?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll start. we ended the year at 1.2 times net debt to adjusted ebitda, which is below our 2.5 target maximum. our priority remains organic and inorganic investment in the business and we're excited about the opportunities we see both of those, in both of those areas. we do have our share repurchase and believe that's a flexible way to return capital. and we'll remain opportunistic in that approach, which is evidenced by our 200 million we purchased in 2020 and we'll continue that into this year.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
and on m&a, we are certainly very excited about the outlook for our business and m&a is a -- we think of it as a growth vector for the business. we think of m&a as a way for us to accelerate the execution on our enterprise asset intelligence vision. so it's not a stand-alone growth driver. it is something that we think about how and a way for us to accelerate the execution on our vision.
we're targeting let's say select bolt-on acquisitions as well as higher growth acquisitions that can truly help move our enterprise asset intelligence vision forward. we see good opportunities in digitizing and automating supply chains and different workflows. and we, as nathan talked about, we have a strong balance sheet that can support that.

good day, and welcome to the zebra technologies fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings results conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to mike steele, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
michael steele -- vice president, investor relations
good morning and welcome to zebra's fourth quarter conference call. this presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. slide 2 conveys that the forward-looking statements we make today are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our sec filings.
during this call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures, as we describe our business performance. you can find reconciliations at the end of this slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition.
this presentation will include prepared remarks from anders gustafsson, our chief executive officer and nathan winters, our chief financial officer. anders will begin with our fourth quarter results, then nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our 2021 outlook. anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision. following the prepared remarks, jo heel, our senior vice president of global sales will join us as we take your questions.
now, let's flip to slide 4, as i turn the call over to anders.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. i am proud of our employees resiliency and focus on serving our customers critical needs during the pandemic. through their efforts, we were able to deliver exceptional results to close out a challenging 2020. for the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of more than 10% or more than 8% on an organic basis and adjusted ebitda margin of 23.5%, a 210 basis point year-over-year improvement. non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $4.46, a 25% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow.
each of these measures significantly exceeded our outlook. we generated more business in q4 than any other quarter in our history. our teams executed well to satisfy a faster-than-expected recovery in demand from smaller customers through our distribution channel, particularly for our printing solutions.
demand from our large customers also continued to be strong due to their need to digitize and automate workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy. we also drove improved profitability and cash flow while investing in research and development projects to drive sustainable profitable growth. our record q4 results capped a challenging full-year 2020 in which we realized slight declines in sales and earnings per share. however, we did achieve record-free cash flow of $895 million for the year.
with that, i will now turn the call over to nathan to review our q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2021 outlook.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
thank you. anders. let's start with the p&l on slide 6. in q4, we return to profitable growth after particularly challenging first nine months of the year. net sales increased 8.3% before the impact of currency and acquisitions. our sales mix of large and small orders normalized to pre-pandemic levels driven by a recovery of our run rate business, which was driven in part by pent-up demand.
our asset intelligence & tracking segment, including printing and supplies, significantly benefited from the recovery in smaller business demand with segment sales increasing 14% from the prior year. our enterprise visibility & mobility segment sales increased 5.6% driven by solid growth in enterprise mobile computing solutions.
we also realized strong growth in services and software driven by our managed and support services and zebra retail solutions. from a regional perspective, we realized solid year-over-year growth in north america and significant growth in emea, while asia pac and latin america were slower to recover. in north america, sales increased 6%. printing, supplies, data capture, and services were bright spots. in emea, sales increased 20%. printing, supplies mobile computing, and services grew double-digits as we saw strong demand through our partnered distribution channel.
apac sales were down 4% year-over-year yet increased sequentially. printing and mobile computing were bright spots and we saw modest growth in china. latin america sales declined 15% with all major product and service categories declining in a challenging macro environment. adjusted gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 47.8% driven primarily by a $12 million recovery of china import tariffs paid in prior periods and improved services and software margin.
business mix had a negligible impact on year-on-year margin comparisons. additionally, this quarter's results were impacted by $10 million of premium freight costs. adjusted operating expenses increased $28 million from the prior year period and improved 20 basis points as a percentage of sales. we continue to diligently manage costs while accelerating high return investments in the business. fourth quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 23.5%, a 210 basis point increase from the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher gross margin. we drove non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $4.46, a $0.90 or 25.3% year-over-year increase.
turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide 7. we generated $895 million of free cash flow in full year 2020. this was $271 million higher than the prior year. free cash flow conversion of 130% was significantly higher than our target of 100% primarily due to timing of customer collections and vendor payments. lower 2020 payments of incentive compensation, taxes, and interest also contributed to the improvement.
our balance sheet remained strong. from a debt leverage perspective, we ended 2020 at 1.2 times net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio, which is comfortably below our 2 -- target maximum of 2.5 times.
let's now turn to our outlook. we entered the new year, with a strong order backlog and healthy channel inventory levels. we are encouraged by the pickup in demand, primarily from our smaller customers, which includes pent-up demand from those who had paused spending during the peak of the pandemic. this momentum, along with our sales pipeline, positions us well for double-digit sales growth for the first quarter and full year 2021.
in q1, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 25% and 29%. this outlook assumes a 300 to 350 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of reflexis and foreign currency changes. we anticipate q1 adjusted ebitda margin of slightly higher than 23%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. non-gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.50. for the full year 2021, we anticipate adjusted net sales growth between 10% and 14% with growth moderating through the year as we cycle more challenging comparisons and navigate a continued uncertain global economic recovery.
this outlook assumes approximately 3 percentage points additive impact from the acquisition of reflexis and foreign currency changes. we anticipate full year 2021 adjusted ebitda margin between 21% and 22%, which assumes gross margin expansion from the prior year. we expect free cash flow to be at least $700 million for the year, we do not expect to repeat the exceptionally high level of free cash flow conversion that we achieved in 2020. please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide 8.
with that, i will turn the call back to anders to discuss how we're advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision in our end markets.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you nathan. our team has done a fantastic job executing in a challenging environment. we have strong momentum entering 2021, supported by our order backlog and pipeline of business. we continue to build on our industry-leading offerings by investing in our people, operations, and innovation to drive sustainable growth. in 2020, we acquired reflexis and launched a record number of new products and solutions to ensure that we continue to advance our industry leadership position.
slide 10 highlights how we are building on our foundational capabilities to elevate our value proposition. we are uniquely positioned to solve our customers complex operational challenges. our unmatched access to frontline operational data from our vast install base of products and solutions can be harnessed to gain real time actionable insights. the result is a more intelligent enterprise with optimized workflows. through the pandemic, there has been a dramatic increase in the adoption of omnichannel and online shopping. retailers need proven solutions to overcome the significant fulfillment challenges posed by this profound behavioral shift. if goods are not delivered or made available for pickup as promised, the retailer risks losing its shopper to a competitor. to address this issue retailers have been prioritizing their capital spend in our broad portfolio of solutions with a sense of urgency.
we are enabling retailers to generate an unprecedented amount of valuable data captured through mobile computers, point of sale systems, rfid, and other intelligent automation solutions, all of which are critical to digitizing their operations.
key benefits to the retailer include better operational visibility and insights, increased employee collaboration and labor productivity, improved inventory accuracy, well-equipped associates with real time actionable information, and more satisfied customers. last month, we participated in the national retail federation's virtual sessions where we showcased how zebra's solutions help retailers deliver a superior omnichannel shopping experience. at one of the sessions, autozone explained how our reflexis workforce and task management solution equipped their associates with highly flexible mobile technology that enables enhanced customer responsiveness and provides insightful data for analytics and reporting.
we are proud to enable autozone to go the extra mile to delight its shoppers. now turning to slide 12. we continue to be excited about our opportunity to help our customers' meet their mission-critical needs in an increasingly on demand economy. as a trusted strategic partner, we orchestrate end-to-end workflows for customers in a variety of end markets.
as i mentioned, retailers continue to prioritize investment in our products and solutions to address their omnichannel fulfillment strategies in related warehouse automation needs. in q4, we secured multi-million dollar orders from a range of e-tailers, mass merchants, grocers, department stores and auto parts retailers.
in transportation and logistics, strong e-commerce growth continues to drive parcel volumes, while last mile on demand fulfillment has become increasingly important. italian post recently selected our printing and scanning solutions for their 13,000 post offices. separately, the deployment of our tc-7 series mobile computers to united states postal service carriers is on track to resume as expected in late q1 with the goal of completion in q3.
in healthcare, the need for increased real-time visibility into the entire patient journey as well as the demand for innovative solutions to provide safe and efficient care continue to make healthcare our highest growth end market opportunity.
in q4, we grew our relationship with one of america's leading healthcare providers. new acute care applications have made it increasingly important for this customer to equip more of their clinicians with mobile computers. the most recent use case we addressed was covid drive-through testing without healthcare purposed tc-5 series mobile computers, which seamlessly interfaces with their electronic medical record system.
although, the manufacturing sector has been hardest hit in 2020, we are optimistic regarding our prospects of returning to growth soon. we see vibrant opportunity to increased automation in workflows and we are viewed as a visionary in this market.
in q4, we also secured notable wins beyond our traditional end markets. this included a competitive takeaway win with a leading waste hauler in north america. this customer-initiated a multi-year roll-out of our 85-series tablets, accessories and related services for its dispatch application, which is improving training and productivity among its drivers, dispatchers and supervisors.
another important win was with one of the largest metropolitan police departments in the united states. using our tc-7 series mobile computers along with zq-5 series mobile printers. the implemented an automated parking citation application, that generated enough revenue to cover their technology investment in a matter of months.
in closing, we continue to find substantial opportunities in our primary end markets and we are excited about the emerging prospects we see in newer markets. we are well positioned for ongoing success, as the need to digitize and automated workflows continues to accelerate.
now, i'll hand the call back over to mike.
michael steele -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, anders. we'll now open the call to q&a. we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get to as many of you as possible.

thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and the first question today will come from damian karas with ubs. please go ahead.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
hi, good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
thank you.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
so you had mentioned that some of the first quarter sales strength was on pent-up demand from your smaller customer base. but just thinking about the current order strength you're seeing as you progress through the second quarter, would you still characterize some of that as pent-up demand? are we kind of past that at this point and it's really more reflective of your underlying run rate demand, if you will?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
well, and first, we are very pleased with our first quarter results here and the outlook we could provide. we -- the business is supported by some strong secular trends that have accelerated during the pandemic, like omnichannel and [indecipherable]. most companies today are very focused on automating and digitizing their businesses. and for us, that resulted in double-digit growth across all regions, across all products and solutions, as well as all verticals, so very broad-based demand for us.
we did see particularly strong growth from small and medium-sized customers, and that was partly driven by pent-up demand, but it's only partly driven by pent-up demand. yeah, but -- we also saw strong demand from our large customers, our larger strategic accounts. and i think another factor here was that based on our performance, i'm -- i certainly expect that we continue to take share in the market.
nathan, do you want to add something?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. so this time on the pent-up demand. i think one, it is an estimate, so this isn't a precise deal reconciliation. and we think it is recovering most of our 2020 miss to our original plan and guidance last year and recovering that here in the first half of the year, which is contributing low double digits, both in the first and second quarter.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
okay, that makes sense. and then, i think you spoke in the past that, sort of, later in the year is when you start seeing sort of the larger projects, if you will, larger orders. at this point, do you have some visibility there that you've kind of baked that into your guidance in the back half or should we still expect that there could be some larger projects that haven't taken hold yet?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i think what we've said is, it tends to be that our visibility into the larger deals or into our pipeline overall increases with time. so the closer -- the further we enter the year we get better visibility, we'll have to be through the second half and q4. so part of what you see today is that we have gained some better visibility into both [indecipherable] how we expect the run rate to progress, but also on some of the larger deals. but we don't have perfect visibility, so clearly there is opportunities for deals that we don't necessarily have in our stored as high likelihood in our pipeline today.
joe, do you want to add something to this?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah. i would say that the large deal momentum has continued evenly throughout the year. and we have prospects for large deals in the second half, just as we did in the first half. one of the large deals that you're aware of is the usps deal, which is of course contributing to our q2 and q3 as we have said.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
very, very helpful color. thanks, guys. i'll pass it along.
operator
okay. and the next question will come from tommy moll with stephens. please go ahead.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
good morning.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
anders, it's sounds like compared to a quarter ago, when we talked both in terms of geography and market, it sounds like everything or nearly everything is better than expected, a quarter ago. but if you had to pinpoint maybe one geography or one end market that's improved the most, just as a driver for the raised revenue guidance, what would you point us to? and if i'm mistaken, and if there is any geography or end market that's gotten a little weaker over the last quarter that would be good to know. although, maybe just based on your tone and comments today it sounds like there weren't any?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
this is a hard question today, because we have...
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
[indecipherable]
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
broad-based demand. i don't think we've ever had a quarter where we've had each of our four regions, each of our verticals and each of our main product categories all growing double-digits. so it's hard to pick who stand out as particularly strong or weaker. but i'll probably just highlight maybe north america as particularly strong, as being also our largest region here, we grew by 28%. so we saw very broad-based demand across basically all our portfolio, the entire portfolio. but printing supplies, mobile computing, rfid, services, software, they were all up double digits. and we had strong wins across all our vertical markets in north america. and our newest vertical, the government vertical also demonstrated good growth. and i think demonstrates the investments we've made in both product and the go-to-market for the government vertical paying off here now.
on a -- from a vertical perspective, maybe healthcare, just want to highlight. it's been our fastest growing vertical for some time and we expect it to continue to be the fastest growing one. it had a very nice performance in q1. i think the transformation in healthcare is accelerating. it started off in acute care, but it's moving into other areas now, like ambulatory care, contact tracing, even remote patient care. and healthcare patients are now expecting or demanding a more digital experience and they prefer that also. and our purpose-built solutions are critical for healthcare providers to be able to improve the overall patient journey to drive -- and to drive greater productivity for the healthcare providers across their operations. and some of our solutions in healthcare also used specifically, but for covid response like drive-through testing and vaccinations, cold chain logistics and so forth.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
maybe i can add something too. if you look at the regions nominally, the one that's swung the most from last quarter was latin america. latin america was the one that was hardest hit in the pandemic and has rebounded the most, but it's also our smallest region.
in terms of verticals, another one that is notable is manufacturing, which was hit very hard in the pandemic as well and we're seeing some good rebound in that area. i think the biggest swing that we haven't mentioned yet is one of deal size and customer size, right? so, notably our run rate and the purchases by small and medium businesses have accelerated and are catching up now to what was a big driver in past quarters of the larger customers, investing in e-commerce and digitization. we're now seeing that in the small and medium business, which of course manifest in our run rate.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
thank you, both. that's very helpful. if i could ask one follow-up. anders, i wonder if you could update us on some of the pilots you have with retail customers, where all our or at least a lot more of the store associates are carrying one of your devices. what's the progress there? how are you making the roi case to the potential customers? and to what extent does reflect this factor into the strategy there?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. the device for all is a big opportunity for us. we're very excited about how that's progressing. we see the theme around how most companies wants to automate and digitize their operations is playing a big role in driving this. across every vertical, i would say, our customers are looking to put technology in the hands of more of their employees and be able to have them be connected and be able to both enter data, as well as react to data. we see the relationship with reflexis as very synergistic. and that, if you have a mobile device you can now look at inventory stock-outs, or other information and upload that to the reflexis task engine, which now can make smarter decisions, can prioritize the highest roi action, and then mobilize that to the right worker at the right time by [indecipherable] through somebody who then is carrying a mobile device. so it's a very strong synergistic portfolio that adds basically -- and the network effect it adds to the value of both device and both solutions by having both under one roof.
the progression on deeper penetration is also progressing. so if you go back, 7 years, 8 years or something, our large supercenter in retail might have had seven or eight devices and today they routinely would have maybe 70 or 80, but they may have several hundred employees. and we think that having a shared device for those associates when they are in the store is big objective for, i would say, the vast majority of our customers. and that's progressing. we have some good examples of where we've provided -- expanded our portfolio to provide that kind of full range of devices across the price and performance curve. and where we've combined software and devices to really enable much deeper penetration.
and joe, maybe you want to share some examples of this?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah. i'll give you one example of the connection of our device for all and our saas software. one of the largest retailers in australia is using our ec30 devices together with workforce connect to enable their associates to do tasks in the store, but also communicate with one another. and that's one of the key use cases, which is -- and by the way also enabled by reflexis in the future is to have the associates be able to interact with each other, which requires that all of the associates have a device. so, i think that's a pretty good example of it.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
great. thank you, both. we'll keep our eyes out for more progress on those fronts. but i'll turn it back for now. thank you.
operator
and our next question will be from andrew buscaglia with berenberg. please go ahead.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
hi guys. i was hoping you could talk a little bit more on gross margins in the quarter, which were obviously very strong. can you break out what -- you mentioned software and then that reflexis or just acquisitions in general helping? can you break out what that contributed in the quarter?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, andrew, this is nathan. firstly, our teams have been executing very well on what we can control. you see that through the gross margin improvement year-on-year up 370 basis points. about two-thirds of that is related to business mix, as well as volume leverage. we have especially high mix of large orders, due to the recovering small and medium business that joe mentioned earlier. and about a third of that was from expansion of our service margins, as well as the reflexis acquisition. and most of that coming from expansion within our service business.
i think the one thing to also note, as we stated last year, we look at our underlying gross margin trends. they remained healthy throughout 2020. and we expected the overall margin and we're seeing that play out to improve as the mix has returned.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
got it. and evm had particularly very strong gross margins, 49%, is that sort of the run rate we're looking at going forward? i know you have those freight expenses coming in. but yeah, is this sort of, kind of the path you're taking? are you -- do -- you think you can grow or expand margins even from that kind of elevated level, given some of this software and services integration?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i think, over time, we do expect for our margins to improve. i'd say, q1 was especially favorable due to the strong mix of small and medium-sized business. but i think as that normalizes to more of a normalized level as we move forward, we do expect evm margins to improve over time, particularly as you mentioned with the growth and expansion of our software solutions.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
okay. and maybe just last one. in q2, stuff got into that guidance unless you -- if you assume a pretty big ramp in sg&a? so, do we expect a step down in gross margins just in q2, for some reason or given the freight expense?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yes. so if you look at our q2 ebitda guide of 21% to 22%, it is up nearly 3 points year-on-year due to favorable business mix from 2020. sequentially, it is down 4 points, most of that is due to lower gross margin. as we said, as deal size, i think, comes back from the exceptionally high level we are -- we had here in q1. and you also have crs seasonality, a slight care for recovery in the first quarter all lowering gross margin sequentially. as well as we do expect higher opex, as we continue to accelerate investment in our new solutions both in r&d and go to market.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
and the next question will come from jim ricchiuti with needham and company. please go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
hi, good morning. just wondering if -- what kind of headwinds you might be seeing or anticipating for the full year, just as it relates to what we've all been hearing about component constraints, higher raw material prices? and just along those lines, do you anticipate potentially having to take any pricing actions going forward just given the supply chain issues?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. i would first characterize the supply chain issues that we're working on in two categories. one is, logistical bottlenecks and the other one is around the industrywide semiconductor shortages that has been in the press quite a bit lately. first on the logistical bottlenecks. that's really caused by an increase -- a combination of increase in demand when combined with a reduction in commercial air traffic sort of fewer commercial airplanes, which used to cover or carry a lot of commercial freight also. then you have -- add on a little bit of container shortages and port congestion on top of that. but this has resulted in air and ocean rates on -- pretty much on all our key routes, having increased by a factor of two, since the start of the pandemic. so, we are incurring premium freight cost as a result of this. and we are prioritizing customer -- meeting customer expected delivery dates. so, we have been using -- leveraging all modalities of freight to get our devices and products to our customers, including chartering flights from europe -- from china to europe and the us. but this has had a negative -- a negligible impact on revenues.
and i'd say, our supply chain team has done an outstanding job of being able to manage this and minimize the impact on the business. they had issues around the semiconductor shortages and this impacts some of our products more than others. our teams are -- have been doing a great job of managing all angles of optimizing allocations for us. we have a history of thoughtful contingency planning, which i think is helping us here. we tend to qualify multiple components when we can and even have multiple suppliers when practical. we have seen, again, modest increases in surcharges related to sourcing these components. but despite the -- both of these issues that i mentioned, we are confident in the full year sales outlook that we gave. the outlook incorporates both of these points.
and lastly then on the price action you asked about. we continuously assess pricing based on the competitive environment. so, we always look at that, but there is -- we have no imminent plan of addressing or having, let's say, a broader price increase to address these supply chain issues.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
and thank you. and the follow-up. just on the ait business. and i'm just wondering how -- what you're seeing in the market -- in the legacy -- this legacy part of your business compares with previous recoveries and other economic cycles?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. we had an exceptional quarter for print. the growth rates were well above average -- corporate average. we -- as we saw growth across the portfolio and certainly pent-up demand had been an issue here. smaller customers through the channel, it was recovering quite nicely. and we also over the last year or so, taking some steps to strengthen our go-to-market around our eco channel -- channel ecosystem. and i think that's made us more competitive. and we've been able to accelerate some share gains. our printing -- rfid printing business was also particularly strong. and even the supplies business was doing very well. [indecipherable] time was up double digits. so it was a very strong performance across the board.
and maybe also highlight that, joe mentioned earlier, the manufacturing was up very strongly in q1 after having had a tougher go in 2020 and a little bit further -- beyond that also it would further that out. and printing is the most exposed to manufacturing. so when manufacturing goes up that would have a disproportionate impact on our printing business.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
well, thank you for that. congrats on the quarter.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
the next question will come from meta marshall with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks. a quick question. some of these smaller customers come back. what are they asking you for that may be different from -- what they were asking you from before. clearly, they still going to face some challenges in the competitive environment. just wondering, what they're asking you for in particular? and then maybe on the healthcare opportunities. just as you move past some of these kind of covid boosted use cases, where are you seeing the most traction in these cases there? thanks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. i will start, and then, i will ask joe to also provide some color here. so first on smaller customers and what we're seeing, what's different. i'd say two things, meta. one is, irrespective of size, i would say, pretty much all customers across all verticals are looking to figure out how can they digitize and automate their businesses more. and they do look to our type of solutions to connect the physical world to the digital world, to really help them connect that physical workflow -- those workflows into applications and automate them better. so that is a broad-based theme across basically all sizes of customers and verticals.
the other point that would be -- our larger customers who generally able to pivot to a covid operating world better. they were generally seemed to be essential businesses -- were deemed to be essential business, while many of our smaller customers, many of them are in manufacturing had to shut down. and now as they come back, i think they are looking to make investments that enables them to compete with some of their larger presence [phonetic] who have made more -- who have invested earlier in those digitization and automation themes.
joe, do you want to add anything to this?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
i think you said it well on the small-and-medium businesses. clearly, the pent-up demand portion of -- we're still most pronounced among the smbs, i would say, and they're catching up more on their pent-up demand. but beyond that, it is really those small-and-medium businesses going to the next level of digital transformation, just as their larger resident [phonetic] have.
and you get also asked about healthcare. and -- on the healthcare beyond covid 19 use cases, we're seeing an expansion, as anders has mentioned in the prepared remarks into new areas of healthcare like ambulatory care, like remote patient care. so the use of tablets, for example, in order to enable remote patient care is a big use case. communication, of course, is the big use case. and one that we're also seeing a lot of interest in is, asset and people tracking in hospitals, locating the right person, or locating the right asset for a particular procedure. those are new use cases and are driving some of that accelerating demand [indecipherable].
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
and the next question will come from keith housum with northcoast research. please go ahead.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning guys, and congratulations on a great quarter, and the solid guidance. just want to unpack the gross margin growth, again, just a little bit more? software and services obviously had a great step up compared to in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter last year. and i understand last year's step up was due to european services improvement, something that's getting further improvement this time around. and this 47%, roughly, gross margins, is that sustainable going forward? is this like a new normal for you?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
hey, keith. so just -- first part of your question, to the growth in both our service and software. now again, seeing on both ends, right at the -- the addition of reflexis gross margin being higher than the company average is helping. but also from an organic basis, up nearly 7 points year-on-year from our core service business. and part of that is due to the actions we took over the last several years to improve efficiency and streamline the repair operations and the team is continuing to work that.
and then the other is, now with double-digit revenue growth, i've seen that volume leverage flow through the p&l is the other big driver of the margin improvement. and we do expect that to continue to grow year-on-year as we grow the top line, as well as improve efficiency in the operations.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. great to hear it. and then, in terms of your overall growth, i understand there's multiple drivers of your revenue growth. but can you touch on perhaps the growth that's been contributed from the new products and perhaps expansion into new markets that you're perhaps, we're not doing as well in before? just trying to dimensionalize some of the growth aspects there?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, when you say new products, you mean new types of solutions, or were just new products more generally?
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
i mean, more types of new solutions, looking for new customers, new use cases. and perhaps, your prior generation of products that did not have previously addressed.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
okay. yeah. i'll start and joe, you can provide some [speech overlap] year also. so i'd say, we did see rfid having a very strong quarter in q1. rfid had a tough going last year, but that's really started in q2. so there was -- q1 last year was more of mill [phonetic], was pretty reasonable quarter. so this is a strong rebound for rfid. and we see these types of solutions which are more contactless is having a great -- being in demand and see more deployment of them.
i would say, also our software solutions are having great traction. the combination of the reflexis, zebra prescriptive analytics and workforce connect provides a very differentiated value proposition for us. and each of those offerings by them -- and of themselves are performing very well. but when you then combine it with as a suite and then look at the -- how they interact with our mobile devices that provides a very compelling offering, which we see having great, great opportunities for us to continue to grow. and some of our other intelligent edge solutions are still probably a little slow in ramping as we've had -- still have a hard -- we don't have access to our customers' facilities to the extent we used to, to do pilots and proof of concepts and other types of engagements like that. but we expect that to ease up here as we get through covid and get back into more normal way of operating with our customers.
joe?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah. i'll add -- maybe add a couple of things that could be helpful. in terms of the mobile computing segment. we talked about the device for all. and as andrew said, previously described, we are seeing an expansion of this. this isn't necessarily always a big game, where someone just rolls out devices to everyone. but an expansion to additional sets of people, right? that you can -- now you use it for transport in a hospital, not just for nurses, for example. so that's been a big expansion. but we've also had some very innovative use cases. one of them, we recently published in the press release for a tire change, that is now using our devices to not only keep track of the tires in the inventory, but also measure the tread gap and offer a new service to a customer. that type of innovation, i think is, is going to be providing new use cases as well.
and i'm also quite proud of our ability to grow the tablet segment, that we accelerated through the acquisition of xplore some time ago and to combine with our own et tablets, and we have some very good traction there.
from a vertical perspective, two that i would call out is the government and healthcare segments. the healthcare segments have seen a good acceleration internationally. you know that we've always had a reasonably strong position in north america. but now we're seeing deals in japan and australia, in the u.k. that are sizable, right, where these institutions are modernizing their infrastructure globally. and government is, we've mentioned is an area, not just in the u.s., but also in other countries again, around the world that we've made substantial go-to-market investments, and we're now seeing accelerated growth. most of the mobile computing, but also some printing opportunities with governments around the bar.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
the next question is from richard eastman with baird. please go ahead.
richard eastman -- baird -- analyst
yes, good morning. just very quickly on the gross margins. it -- did the chair -- the china tariff benefit, did that all fall into the evm gross margin?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
it would have fallen between both evm and printing. so we had both -- i don't have the exact split off them, but it was...
richard eastman -- baird -- analyst
okay.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so equally -- or proportionately weighted between evm and ait.
richard eastman -- baird -- analyst
okay. and then just -- is there any visibility on that? i mean, going forward, q2 to q4, is that benefit continue?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
but, do you expect the benefit to continue? we have not included that into our guidance for the quarter or the year in terms of incremental benefit. as -- quite frankly, it's very hard to predict when and how the claims we've processed will be approved and paid. but it's something we continually work and actively manage. but yeah, it's pretty tough to predict the timing of when we expect to get the recovery from the government.
richard eastman -- baird -- analyst
i see. okay. and then just, just maybe as a second question around the core growth in the quarter was 25%, i believe. could you just speak to what the growth relative in the channel was versus direct? and does the u.s. postal service fall in the direct piece that you're going to hopefully define for me?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'll -- i think, joe can probably provide most colors. but the usps will be in channel customer, i think, joe. and second, our channel business had a fantastic quarter, with i believe stronger growth than what we had in our direct accounts.
joe?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yes, i can confirm that. so our strategy has and remains to be channel-centric, with the vast majority of our revenue going through the channel. and i'm happy to report that our channel has once again grown faster than our business overall, and has therefore expanded the portion of revenue that goes through the channel.
richard eastman -- baird -- analyst
is -- and just lastly, and related to this. i've got a question on just the press release that came out a little bit ago here, kind of mid -april. but you talk about this partnerconnect alliance track. and it's complementary to the independent software vendor track. but just talk about maybe this expansion of non-selling var [phonetic] partnerships. and just, what that brings to the table here? and is that, there is an investment made in these channels? but just, maybe just speak to that, how that expands the opportunity set for zebra?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
do i need to take that, anders?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes, please.
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah. of course, vars has been the core of our partnerconnect program. we've added isvs, especially in the android transition because of the importance that the software that runs on our devices has and how the customer comprehends that as an integrated solution and wants to buy it that way. so we recognized isvs as influencers of the customers, aligned ourselves closely with those and, and are proud to have some of the largest isvs in our program. but we've also recognized that there are other important influencers. i'll give you an example to make this real, which is, if you think about network equipment providers. people that provide wifi infrastructure, for example, for a customer. almost similar to the isvs. they are looking to provide solutions to customers, like for example, locationing capabilities, right, within the environments that they outfit. and by working with us, they can enable such solutions. and we recognize that and created this alliance track in order to allow us to work more effectively with those kinds of partners. and it's paying off very nicely for us.
richard eastman -- baird -- analyst
so it's basically lead generation. i mean, is that what you look to it? these other influencers around id products?...
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
it is lead gene... i'm sorry, go ahead.
richard eastman -- baird -- analyst
no, that was my question.
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah, it is lead generation, but it is perhaps even more effective in allowing us to close the opportunities, right? when a customer sees that we're aligned and that we're working together, we have a greater chance of winning.
richard eastman -- baird -- analyst
okay. okay. very good. thank you.
operator
the next question will be from brian drab with william blair. please go ahead.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. just first on the ebitda margins. i guess the full-year guidance implies that the -- first of all, you gave us the 21.5% midpoint for the second quarter, but then the full-year guidance implies the same kind of 21.5% level for the third quarter and fourth quarter. i'm wondering if that's kind of fair to assume that, that will be the run rate for the balance of the year and no big swings between third and fourth quarter?
and also, is the premium freight headwind something that will persist or is that -- can that fall off maybe later in the year? and i'm just wondering, how much conservatism might be baked into that 21.5% after putting up 25.5% almost in the first quarter?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
so if you look at our full-year guide of 22% to 23%, we do expect gross margin in that to improve year-on-year, and particularly our software solutions grow. and we do expect premium freight cost of $50 million to $60 million, which we've raised by $20 million and most of that coming in the second half. because we really don't see any change in those expectations from what we're seeing here in the first half, or at least it's hard to predict when the -- particularly the supply side will come back around commercial air travel. and that's also $20 million higher than all of our 2020 transitory costs, including tariffs.
and we also expect to continue to invest in and grow opex as we accelerate investment in some of the high roi opportunities and including the continued integration of our software offerings with reflexis.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then, can you provide some details on the competitive environment as you're seeing it? anything you can share in terms of what your share of the mobile computer market is now from your perspective and what your share of the bar coding equipment market is? just that so much has changed in the last year with the industry just exploding.
and then also within mobile computing, can you talk about what percent was android versus windows-based in the quarter? thanks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
all right. i'll start and we'll see if i missed anything. but if -- so competitive environment. first i'd say, we are very confident in our competitive positioning. i'd say as confident as we've ever been probably. we're coming out of covid 19 with good momentum and it provide -- we've actually gained share as we've gone through last 2020 here. we took the attack of continuing to invest in new solutions and staying as close as we could with customers. we actually launched more new products last year than we've done in the other year in history, and i think that's coming back to benefit us here now.
our markets are, we think very attractive. we have some strong secular growth trends. i mentioned kind of the trends around digitizing and automating workflows as a broad theme that i think that's something that's very broad-based and very -- we believe will be something that companies will invest in for several years. the -- we have some strong advantages also. we have our scale, our go-to-market network, the ecosystem we have there. so there is a number of things that will make us a formidable competitor from that perspective.
and lastly, i'd say our vision. our enterprise asset intelligence something that differentiates us from our competitors. when our customers look, talk to us, they are not looking to just buy device for here and now, they are looking to see how they can partner with somebody who can help them drive that digitization and automation of their operations into the future.
from a share perspective, we get share data from independent sources and they tend to lag. so we only have q4 data. but we had a record share in mobile computing over, i think it was over 50% on print and we -- the number 2, i think is, i believe 12%, certainly directionally in that area. on print, we have a low 40%, 43% i think it is...
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
and our next second competitor is low double digits. i think also about 12%. and in scan, we have about 30%, where the second largest is more like 24%. so, we have strong position across our business.
and your last question was about the mix of android and -- windows. and we now have over 85% of our mobile computing sales are android.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
thank you.
operator
please proceed mr. anders, if you needed to answer the question further.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
well, i just -- our share in android remains particularly strong. we probably have approximately 60% of the share of android, so we're particularly strong in that android element.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
yeah. that's a good answer.
operator
thank you, sir. and the final question will come from blake gendron with wolfe research. please proceed.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for squeezing me on here. i want to start with cash flow. so relative to the wording of at least $700 million in the prior guidance, the current guide is appreciably higher. so i'm wondering, how we can think about free cash conversion in the context of both, number 1 growing software mix and number 2, the healthy channel growth that you mentioned. i would imagine that hardware-led pent-up demand recapture would see some working capital drag in 2021. but as we look into 2022 and beyond, is there a way we can think about free cash conversion that's perhaps structurally different from what it's been in the past?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
and so, the first part of your question is just in terms of the full-year guide of greater than $850 million really just aligns to the increased profitable growth outlook for the year. so no notable changes in -- from a working capital perspective relative to our last guide. our target year in and out -- year-in and year-outs be at 100% free cash flow conversion. this year it'll be slightly lower than that just because of the strength we had in 2020. but we don't see that noticeably changing and something we can achieve over time as we look -- as we move forward.
blake gendron -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then one quick follow-up here. interesting win with the tire customer. and that application seems like if all the machine vision -- there is a large machine vision competitor, that is a small handheld scanner device. business somewhere in zebra's purview, there's a little bit of overlap. do you think that this overlap increases, particularly in the manufacturing realm? is there any m&a to do here? a lot of what we're hearing in terms of automation, ai deployment within the manufacturing facility is coming from the machine building customers, which seems like it's on the periphery of what zebra does, but that would be helpful perspective.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. machine vision is a very exciting, sensing and data acquisition technology for us that helps us enable intelligent automation solutions. we've already incorporated machine vision into a number of our solutions like smartpack, smartsight, our mp7000 flatbed scanners for the color camera. so, we just clearly see great opportunities to continue to leverage machine vision to create unique solutions for our customers. the tire tread depth sensor, that is an accessory that we put on our mobile computers to be able to do, but it's another example of how we're trying to find use cases where we feel that we have a strong right to play and where we can be competitive.
i now expect that machine vision is going to be continued area for us to invest. we acquired a company called cortexica about 18 months back, i think it is now, that was basically as an engineering team that has deep expertise into machine vision. their focus was on figuring out how to extract useful information from digital images and video and we put -- they put, they have been a great addition to our team and helping our other solutions -- accelerate the deployment of our other solutions.
operator
ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to mr. gustafsson for any closing remarks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. so to wrap up, i would like to thank our employees and partners for their focus, dedication and resiliency, leading to exceptional q1 results and an improved outlook for 2021. our top priority continues to be protecting the health and well-being of our employees, partners, and customers as we recover from the pandemic. stay safe everyone.

operator
good day, and welcome to the first quarter 2021 zebra technologies earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. please note this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to mike steele, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
mike steele -- vice president, investor relations
good morning, and welcome to zebra's first quarter conference call. this presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year.
slide 2 conveys that the forward-looking statements we make today are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our sec filings. during this call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures as we describe our business performance. you can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release.
throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition.
this presentation will include prepared remarks from anders gustafsson, our chief executive officer; and nathan winters, our chief financial officer. anders will begin with our first quarter results, and nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our revised 2021 outlook. anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision. following the prepared remarks, joe heel, our chief revenue officer will join us as we take your questions.
now let's flip to slide 4, as i turn the call over to anders.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. our team delivered exceptional first quarter results, with strong performance across the business, resulting in record sales and profits. for the quarter, we realized; adjusted net sales growth of 28% or 25% on an organic basis; and adjusted ebitda margin of 25.3%, a 620 basis point year-over-year improvement; non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $4.79, a 79% increase from the prior year, and strong free cash flow.
our teams executed well to satisfy a stronger-than-expected recovery in demand from smaller customers through our distribution channel, and continued strong demand from large customers to digitize and automate their workflows in an increasingly on-demand economy. we realized strong broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across our four regions, each major product and solutions category, as well as in all of our vertical end markets. we also significantly expanded profit margins, driven by favorable business mix and lower travel expenses, while at the same time, we continued to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable profitable growth. given our momentum and pace of innovation, we are increasingly confident in our growth prospects.
with that, i will now turn the call over to nathan to review our q1 financial results in more detail and discuss our improved 2021 outlook.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, anders. let's start with the p&l on slide 6. in q1, adjusted net sales increased 28.3%, including the impact of currency and the reflexis acquisition, and 25% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions. direct sales to large customers grew double-digits, and we saw even higher growth from smaller customers through the channel, partially driven by pent-up demand. our asset intelligence & tracking segment, including printing and supplies grew 21.4%, while enterprise visibility & mobility segment sales increased 26.8%, driven by exceptional growth in enterprise mobile computing.
we realized strong double-digit growth in services and software. and also had strong growth in our rfid solutions, which is beginning to rebound from the depths of the pandemic. we recognized double-digit growth in all regions. in north america, sales increased 28%, with mobile computing, printing, services and supplies each growing double-digits. in emea, sales increased 22%, with solid growth across all sub regions and solutions offering. apac returned to growth with sales up 19% led by strength in china, australia, new zealand and india. latin america also returned to growth in all sub regions, with sales increasing 31%.
adjusted gross margin expanded 370 basis points to 48.9%, primarily driven by favorable business mix, and higher service and software margin. the favorable year-on-year impact from china tariffs was offset by $11 million of incremental premium freight charges. adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 280 basis points. we have been accelerating high return investments in the business, while prudently managing discretionary costs.
first quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 25.3%, a 620 basis point increase from the prior-year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. we drove non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $4.79, a $2.12 or 79.4% year-over-year increase. eps growth also benefited from lower interest expense and a lower share count, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate.
now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide 7. we generated $214 million of free cash flow in q1. this was $119 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. in q1, we had $13 million of venture investments in two companies that provide real-time asset visibility and artificial intelligence solutions. our balance sheet remains strong. from a debt leverage perspective, we ended q1 at a modest 0.9 times net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio.
let's now turn to our outlook. we entered q2 with a strong order backlog and healthy channel inventory levels. we're encouraged by the broad-based robust demand we are seeing across virtually every dimension of our business. as customers step up their plans to invest in digital transformation. this momentum along with our sales pipeline gives us the confidence to provide a strong q2 guide and to substantially raise our full-year outlook.
in q2, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 38% and 42%. this outlook assumes a 450 basis point to 500 basis point additive impact from the acquisition of reflexis and foreign currency changes. we anticipate q2 adjusted ebitda margin to be between 21% and 22%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage. it also assumes approximately $18 million of premium freight expense, which is roughly the same gross profit impact we realized in q2 2020 from the combination of premium freight, covid mitigation and china tariff impacts. non-gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of $4.00 to $4.20.
for the full year 2021, we are raising our guide for adjusted net sales growth to be between 18% and 22%, which reflects our increasing optimism for solid growth in the second half of the year, despite supply chain constraints from certain product components. this outlook assumes an approximately 3 percentage point additive impact from the acquisition of reflexis and foreign currency changes. we have raised our expectation of full-year 2021 adjusted ebitda margin to be between 22% and 23%, which assumes operating expense leverage and meaningful gross margin expansion from the prior year. despite an expectation for premium freight charges of $50 million to $60 million as we work to mitigate global supply chain challenges. we now expect free cash flow to be at least $850 million for the year, due to our revised outlook for increased profitable growth. please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide 8.
with that, i will turn the call back to anders, to discuss how we're advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision in the markets we serve.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, nathan. i am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business, which allows us to increase our 2021 outlook. our team has done an outstanding job navigating us through the pandemic. slide 10 illustrates how we are working with our customers and partners to advance our enterprise asset intelligence vision. by leveraging zebra's leading portfolio of products, solutions, software, and services our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance.
businesses across all industries are adopting solutions that digitize and automate their operations at the edge to help them compete more effectively in today's increasingly on-demand economy. with our innovative solutions, our customers frontline associates can now anticipate and react in near real-time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as machine learning, prescriptive analytics, and computer vision. we have been making solid progress integrating reflexis market-leading workforce management and real-time task management solutions with our existing software applications to optimize the experience for frontline workers, as well as reduce complexity for the corporate teams that support them.
our value proposition is to ensure the best next action, where every worker is easily identified, assigned, and completed; leveraging artificial intelligence gathered from real-time inventory or point of sale data. we are receiving very positive feedback from customers on the software portfolio enhancements we have planned for this year, that will enable a unified experience across labor planning, tasking and workforce communications. we also continue to invest to accelerate the go-to market traction of our growing suite of solutions.
slide 11 highlights how the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving our business. consumers have been raising their service level expectations in this on-demand economy. enterprises are investing in zebra solutions with an increased sense of urgency, due to a significant increase in omnichannel shopping. forecasts for global e-commerce sales and parcel shipping volumes to double over the next several years. track and trace becoming increasingly important for a wide range of use cases. and healthcare patients seeking a more digital experience.
automating strained workflows with proven technology provides an attractive return on investment. the benefits to the enterprise also include increased productivity and efficiency, as well as higher customer and patient satisfaction. these opportunities are not exclusive to large enterprise customers, as we are seeing similar trends with small and medium-sized businesses.
to capitalize on the favorable e-commerce trends i just mentioned. yesterday, we announced the launch of zebra's first cloud-connected label printer designed specifically for the small business home office customer, featuring eco-friendly cartridges and mobile application software to easily design, and print labels from anywhere. with the launch of the zsb series printer, we enter an approximately $400 million market with an attractive recurring supplies revenue stream. we have been innovating at a record pace, despite the pandemic and this soho label printing offering is a proof point of our focus on expanding into attractive adjacent markets where we can provide a differentiated offering.
now turning to slide 12. we understand the operational challenges our customers face in the increasingly on-demand economy. as a trusted strategic partner, businesses of all sizes in a variety of end markets turn to zebra to help optimize end-to-end workflows. in retail, there has been a sharp increase in omnichannel and online shopping. to retain business, retailers need to deliver goods in a timely manner or make them available for pickup when promised. to address this challenge a wide range of retailers have been prioritizing investment in zebra solutions that provide higher inventory accuracy and utilize their labor more effectively.
for example, a leading uk supermarket chain recently purchased over 5,000 zebra zq610 mobile printers, for nearly 1,400 stores and added thousands more tc52, tc77s and ps20s for their existing zebra fleet of devices, to enable inventory management, omnichannel fulfillment, and other critical use cases across their operations. they are also evaluating zebra's workforce management and scheduling software applications we use across all their stores. additionally, we have received very positive feedback from a large fashion accessories retail customer who has adopted our new option for zebra prescriptive analytics to feed directly into our reflexis workforce and task management software offering. other retail customers are planning to adopt this capability soon to leverage the synergistic benefits.
in transportation and logistics, strong e-commerce adoption continues to drive exponential growth in parcel volumes, putting pressure on supply chains, even as they hire more workers. this is one of many reasons a wide variety of companies are attempting to digitize their operations with our technology. a large car-rental company recently began deploying 5,000 et56 rugged tablets at their airport locations to enable mobile associates to perform point of sale check in for improved customer service.
in healthcare, the need for real-time visibility into the entire patient journey, as well as the demand for technology that ensures safe and efficient care continue to make healthcare our highest growth end-market opportunity. the top ranked us hospital system recently selected zebra's mobile scan and print solutions to integrate with their new electronic health record software application, where patient bedside care which enables positive patient id, specimen collection and medication verification. zebra's easy-to-use mobility solution and device management applications allows this customer to streamline clinician workflows, increased accuracy, and enhanced safe patient care.
although the manufacturing sector has been hardest hit in 2020, sales rebounded to double-digit growth in q1. we are focused on increasing automation in workflows for our customers and have been recognized as a thought leader in this market. we recently secured a takeaway win with a global food manufacturer, who purchased more than 1,000 zebra mc93 mobile computers and 8051 tablets. this customer has been equipping an increasing number of associates with technology to enhance their manufacturing, shipping, and receiving workflows; ease-of-use, functionality, lifecycle management, and support were notable selection criteria cited by this customer.
in closing, we are performing well in our primary end markets, and we are excited about the emerging prospects we see in newer markets to digitize and automate workflows.
now, i'll hand the call back over to mike.
mike steele -- vice president, investor relations
thanks, anders. we'll now open the call to q&a. we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up so that we can get to as many of you as possible.

[operator instructions] the first question comes from damian karas with ubs.
damian karas -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
hi, good morning everyone. so i just wanted to ask you a little bit about the component shortages. obviously, still, we're able to drive some pretty strong growth in the second quarter and expecting to see that in the third quarter as well. but would you be able to quantify how much of a drag, if any, of the component shortages are on your sales this year?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
yes, i'll start, and then i'll have nathan also help out here. so the first, i'll start on the kind of the industrywide semiconductor shortages. they've been very well documented by the press, obviously, over the last few months, and we are impacted. i said impact, though, is not uniform across all components. some components are impacted much more than others, but it's a much larger number of components that we're kind of working than we would in a normal quarter.
but i'd say our team is doing a great job in working all angles to optimize our allocations and there's been great collaboration between our sustaining engineering groups to ensure we can qualify new alternative components that have less lead time to ensure we get this much available product to provide to our customers as we can. we did raise prices here recently to mitigate some of the impact of the increased component costs. and i said, despite these shortages and the price increases that we have increased, we're quite confident in the increased full year outlook that we announced today.
nathan andrew winters -- chief financial officer
and damian, just to answer the question on the q3 and full year guide, the risk associated with the shortage have been incorporated in our outlook. but it would be really tough to quantify, and i think really constructive to speculate on what that number could be unconstrained.
damian karas -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. and then i wanted to ask you a little bit about the freight headwind. i mean, second quarter, despite having those, i think you were able to outperform on the margin front. so just curious why we shouldn't -- but you're expecting a pretty abrupt drop here, 300 basis points in the second half. shouldn't we expect you to kind of be able to manage those as you we're in the second quarter? and i guess, additionally, should we be thinking that next year, you will be able to kind of completely reverse these premium freight expenses?
nathan andrew winters -- chief financial officer
yes. so maybe if you take us back on just where we're seeing the bottlenecks because there's really three different areas in terms in the incremental cost. one, which we've seen earlier in the year, and we've talked about in our previous calls around the lower international commercial air travel, container shortages, port congestion. so we're on the supply side of it. that's where we're seeing our air and ocean rates two to three times since the start of the pandemic. and those really have not come down over the last several months. if anything, oceans gone up, air rates have stabilized.
in addition, because of the global supply constraints, along with the increase to global demand, we're now expediting component parts from our tier one and tier two manufacturing partners, along with shipping a higher percentage of printing, in particular, via air versus ocean. and so those are also really driving the step change in terms of the transitory costs from q2 into the second half. in addition, you have the manufacturing shutdowns in parts of southeast asia, in particular, for us, vietnam and malaysia due to covid, there's further constrained supply.
so as we see today, you're expecting the impact to persist at least through the end of the year. it's hard to say when those will abate into next year. but again, the team is doing a great job of managing the impacts with our customers really through extraordinary actions and communicating the lead times. so as you look at our second half guide, i think there's two things to think of. one is the step change increase in terms of the incremental cost. and in q2, we also had $12 million of china tariff recovery that we don't expect to repeat in the second half that was an offset in the second quarter.
damian karas -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
understood. thank you very much for the insight. good luck.

our next question comes from tommy moll with stephens.
thomas allen moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good morning, and thanks for taking my question. anders, you've talked about a robust backlog and pipeline. any comments you could give to augment there would be helpful. do you have any sense of whether the momentum is sustainable through the year-end and even into next year? and any comments you could give us on channel inventory levels as best you understand them would be appreciated as well. thanks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
yes. i will start here, and then i'll ask joe heel to also provide some color. first, we're obviously very excited about and pleased with the performance we had in the second quarter. we exceeded the high end of the guidance range here. and to the previous question, we have extraordinary collaboration between our supply chain and sales teams to satisfy very strong demand in a supply constrained environment. the strong secular trends that have been supporting our business for a long time, they have accelerated through covid, and we don't see any abatement in those trends. they're continuing to build. i'd say our customers across pretty much all our vertical markets are prioritizing, digitizing and automating their workflows.
i think omnichannel is probably the best example in retail of the retail vertical. most retailers investing meaningfully in building out their omnichannel capabilities and digitizing their operations that way. we did see double-digit growth in all regions as well as across all our product and solutions categories as well as across our four main vertical markets. we did see our small and medium-sized customers do particularly well.
so the growth we saw here was definitely to a large degree, driven by our small, medium-sized customers. and that was partly, i think, a result of pent-up demand, but we see that largely being behind us at this stage. but even our large strategic accounts performed very well with strong growth. and based on this performance, i do expect that we will continue to take share in the market. our inventories are healthy in the channel today, but it may be at the lower end of our expected ranges. joe?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
i think that's fair. i mean, on the inventory side, we're working hard with our distribution partners to keep our inventory at the levels that we need to sustain the demand, but at the same time, to serve every possible demand, which is at the moment, as you can tell, very, very strong. and we're trying to serve all of the demand we can and taking our inventory to the lower end of what we consider our healthy range. when it comes to the backlog and the pipeline, it is very strong as you're seeing.
and what i can underscore what anders was saying, this pandemic has definitely triggered a wave of digitization and automation in our customers that is leading to projects and demand that we did not see before the pandemic. so that is a sustained driver of momentum that we see. and we also are enjoying because customers are aware of the supply shortages, we're enjoying good pipeline visibility. our customers are working with us to give us that visibility for an advance, and that gives us confidence for continued growth into the next year.
thomas allen moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thank you. both those are helpful answers. anders, i wanted to follow-up with a question on adaptive vision and your entry into the fixed industrial scanning and machine vision markets. a couple of part question here. just any context you could give us around any prior relationship you had with adaptive vision or how you came to know the asset? anything you can do to frame the size of the market opportunity where you think you've got a good shot at competing? and then what advantages you bring in those markets? they're adjacent to markets where you currently play and have substantial share, but what advantages do you bring in these new markets?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
yes, i'll try to summarize this here. but first, we're excited about our entry into the fixed industrial scanning and machine vision market. these are solutions that really accelerate our enterprise asset intelligence vision. this is more on the sense side of the sense analyze act framework, but it helps us provide some new ways of capturing data that we can then analyze and enable our customers to act on. this is a very attractive market we see, but it's quite fragmented. it's a multibillion-dollar market that our new portfolio then can address, although we're not addressing the entire market on day one.
but we are continuing to invest in it to add functionality, to add capabilities that we can go after a bigger and bigger part of the market, but we really are focusing initially mostly on the fixed industrial scanning market. our value proposition, we believe, is very strong, and the focus is on the ease of use of these types of solutions as well as the ability to upgrade cameras and devices in the field. so those are, we believe, two strong differentiators that we have. the adaptive vision is a great way for us to augment the, say, the cameras that and the software we had developed. it's a way for our customers to more easily be able to develop and build and implement applications for how to basically engage in machine vision, or fixed industrial scanning, or incorporate machine vision and fixed industrial scanning into their workflows.
and we've been familiar with adaptive vision for some time. and we've been looking at ways to augment our own internal software development in that area to make sure we can come up with a really strong offering. and we felt that adaptive vision had a very attractive solution, very strong solution, and there was nice fit with zebra.
thomas allen moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst

our next question comes from jim ricchiuti with needham & company.
james andrew ricchiuti -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for the additional color on some of the cost issues that you're incurring in terms of freight and components. i wonder if you could spend a few moments talking about opex, both sales and marketing. g&a up by a healthy amount sequentially, admittedly with a significantly higher sales. so i'm just wondering how we might be thinking about opex in the second half of the year? and i have a follow-up, andrew, for you on some of the acquisitions.
nathan andrew winters -- chief financial officer
yes. so i think from an opex perspective, if you look year-on-year, there's a couple of major drivers in terms of the overall increase that really impact every quarter. last year, we took some actions mid-year around, salary reductions in the peak of the pandemic to help offset the impact as well as a lower incentive comp as we're obviously below our planned targets for the year. so those two alone drive a significant increase year-on-year, along with the full year of reflexis us in the p&l. and starting to, again, invest particularly in r&d and go-to-market with some of the discretionary cost increases.
so if you look for the second half of the year, i'd say the ramp in the first half will continue. but i wouldn't expect to see a real step change increase from where we saw spending in the second quarter. but again, the year-on-year increases are all pretty consistent for each quarter.
james andrew ricchiuti -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
thanks, nathan. anders, you talked about the acquisitions, both adaptive and fetch. you talked about, i think, as being a fragmented market. and i'm wondering to what extent might we see you in addition to internal development of these technologies, look at potential additional m&a to expand your footprint?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
yes. obviously hard for me to comment on specific opportunities here. but we are excited about both of these markets, the fixed industrial scanning and the autonomous mobile robot market. and we have had long-standing organic development activities that we now have augmented by the acquisitions of fetch and adaptive. but i'd say, first, more generally about m&a, first, we're very excited about our business and the outlook for our business. we do see m&a as a vector for growth.
i think the adaptive vision and the fetch robotics acquisitions are -- we're excited about them. we think that we can deliver good growth and good returns on those. we do look at all m&a opportunities as a way for us to accelerate and advance our eai vision. we're targeting selective bolt-on acquisitions that also have high growth. and look at around the -- what i talked earlier about the customers' need and interest in digitizing and automating a number of workflows across all of their supply chains. that provides good opportunities for us to continue to add to our capabilities. and so we do look at m&a as a way for us to accelerate that growth. and we have a strong balance sheet that can support m&a activities also.
james andrew ricchiuti -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
and your pipeline for m&a?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
yes. we obviously have a team that scans the market broadly around our target areas where we have particular interest. we have a good healthy pipeline of opportunities. you never know what really work out, where we'll come to terms or not, but we do have a healthy pipeline of opportunities.

our next question comes from paul chung with jpmorgan.
paul chung -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. so just another follow-up on machine vision, fixed industrial scanner. so how large is this business today? and will the solution eventually kind of be led with software similar to your peers kind of resulting in very accretive margins? what is the strategy to kind of take share from larger players in the industry, maybe competitive pricing? and then another on m&a in general. very strong free cash flow, high-quality earnings provides you kind of a nice cushion for broader opportunities. should we expect continued preference for software solutions over time and resulting kind of higher margins longer term?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
yes. i will start, and i'll also ask joe to comment on this here. but i think your first question was around the fixed industrial scanning machine vision market. so we believe it's a very attractive market. it's a near adjacency to what we do. and it's quite a fragmented market. if you look at the market share table there, there's one or two players that have reasonable share, but then it's a long tail of smaller players. we are entering the market, say, primarily through or initially with our fixed industrial scanning portfolio, which is distinctive process to our core competencies and use cases where we have a very strong right to play. but we are adding both, say, on the capabilities, both on the hardware side, on the camera side, but primarily here on the software side to be able to then address a larger part of that market.
software is a big differentiator in all our devices, right? if you look at mobile computing, print and scan, the majority of our engineers, a huge part of the differentiation and the value add comes from the software. and we certainly expect that to be the case here also. so we are investing in building more of that software capability. that division was an inorganic way to accelerate some of that, but we also do that organically. we should also not underestimate or minimize the importance of the investments we're making in the go-to-market. i mentioned earlier, i think, that we are putting in a specialized track in our partner connect reseller program to specifically address recruiting fixed industrial scanning machine vision partners to help accelerate that growth. and maybe, joe, you can expand on that a little bit?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yes, exactly. i was going to comment specifically on your question around what's our strategy to take share. so you know that we have the fixed industrial scanning and the machine vision parts of this. the fixed industrial scanning is a natural extension of the leadership that we have in the scanning part of the market. and we're, of course, translating that technically to succeed in the machine vision part. that's where the software piece is essential. and the acquisition of adaptive now gives us industry-leading software capability. so we fully expect to translate that into share gains. but there's more to it than that.
we specifically want to use the software to enhance that ease-of-use value proposition. that's critical to these customers. how easy is it to use and to deploy. and that's also important for the second part of the strategy to win, which is using partners as a way to compete in this market. all of these solutions are deployed through partners for us. we're a very partner-centric company, as you know. and that is also what we're going to use to compete and win in the machine vision space. and making our software easy to use is a value proposition, not just to the end users, but to the partner specifically. so hopefully, that's helpful.
paul chung -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
yes, very much. and lastly, on fetch robotics. i know it's early days, but if you could talk about how you see this business ramping, how material revenues can be over time kind of from a small base, the margin outlook, competitive environment, all that good stuff, some key customers you hope to get some cross-selling opportunities? and if you could expand on kind of use cases beyond warehouses and fulfillment centers.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
yes, it's a broad question. it can take a while to answer all of it. so i'll try to give you a high-level response here. but first, we haven't closed on the acquisition yet, but we are certainly excited about it. we have worked with fetch as a venture investment for quite some time. so we believe we understand the market, we understand the team, and we see great opportunities to leverage the fetch's broad portfolio of amrs. they have the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry. and they have a very strong, very capable cloud-based software platform for how to deploy and manage these robots.
and then here at zebra, we have been more focused on technology enabled, the workers in warehouses. and by combining those two to be able to control and optimize both the flow of robots and the workers, we think we can offer a superior roi to customers in manufacturing, in warehouses and a number of these use cases. fetch has say, initially been mostly focused on the kind of contains market. so more of movement of goods, but we see there's a number of other use cases that are also growing fast where they have solutions that are very well suited to pursue those also. and here is another area where i think our strength that we have in our go-to-market organization, i'll ask joe to comment on this also, will augment as well.
we know virtually all of these large customers in transportation logistics, in manufacturing, retail, whatever industrial vertical we're going after, and we can help, i think, with providing those introductions and position to be our broader automation workflow solutions with those customers.
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yes, a particular attribute of the market that we're focusing on is that we're targeting those areas where humans and robots work together. and so the notion of a cobot, right, the collaboration between the two, is at the heart of the strategy. so that means we're targeting use cases like person to goods picking and conveyance. and those use cases allow us to take advantage of a broad installed base we already have, where workers in warehouses have mobile computers, and they're now being augmented by robots.
so this means that we can take advantage of the orchestration between the two, and there's really no one else in the market that can do that to the extent that we can. and as a result, we're taking this strong platform capability that fetch has with robots that can go across a broader range of use cases than anyone else and can deliver products with safety and speed that no one else can and combining it with the orchestration of humans to achieve overall productivity improvements that are unequaled. and that's really the strategy.
paul chung -- jpmorgan chase & co -- analyst
thanks so much.

the next question comes from meta marshall with morgan stanley.
meta a. marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. on the price increases that you guys noted, can you just give a sense of the degree or how broad they were? and like are you expecting those price increases to be transitory, so the channel may hold less inventory in the near term? just how you see that interaction? and then just maybe a second question. just getting a sense of the postal service concentration this year, or the usps deal, still expected to be primarily q2, q3 this year?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
yes, i'll start, and then i'll ask nathan to comment here also. but first on the price increases. pricing is obviously something that is very important to us and something we continue to assess and address. we do regular checks to make sure that our solutions are priced competitively to the end users as well as that our partner community have the right profitability part of our overall go-to-market activities here. the competitive actions and competitive positioning is obviously a key part of how we assess pricing here. and we believe that the price increases that we have now announced are appropriate. they respond to some of the competitors who also announced price increases and everybody hasn't.
so we believe that we have kind of assessed this based on very granular based on products and geographies to make sure that we don't put ourselves at any competitive risk with these. we see the cost as being transitory, and we want to play the kind of a long-term game here, though, making sure we maximize the value of the corporation longer term, and we don't want to seed market share in the short term for that either.
nathan andrew winters -- chief financial officer
and then from usps perspective, the rollout is progressing as expected and as we communicated earlier in the year. this is for the current rollout of the full emc solution of 300,000 units to the carriers with the goal of largely completing here at the end of the third quarter.
meta a. marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. i mean, just coming back to the price increases, like is there just a range we should think of just on the top line of what that impact is across the portfolio? or is that just too difficult to assess at this point?
nathan andrew winters -- chief financial officer
i'll take that. so we just rolled the price increases out last week. and i would say from a full year perspective, it's within the margins from the full year revenue.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
with the rollout price increases there's a lag time between us announcing and being effective in the market. so you can see that this will be impacting our q4 business rather than q3.
meta a. marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. great. thank you so much.
operator
the next question comes from keith housum with northcoast research.
keith michael housum -- northcoast research partners, llc -- analyst
good morning guys. congratulations on a great quarter. just looking at the, i guess, cost of goods sold here and the transitory costs, that being the premium freight costs. is there anything in the adjusted ebitda margin guidance and thought process that suggest that some of the impact will be perhaps longer term? for example, increased labor costs or anything else in there that again, will perhaps go on beyond the rest of this year.
nathan andrew winters -- chief financial officer
yes, keith, between the two buckets, if you look at the, say, labor costs or the raw material cost increases, that's what the price increases we've taken is meant to largely offset that. so if we think about from a mitigation of the inflationary prices, i think as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year, those will be largely mitigated with the price actions we've taken. the logistical bottlenecks are the one that -- from the timing, i think, is still to be played out. again, i think we expect no changes between now and the end of the year. but really, we're taking kind of one quarter at a time and reacting accordingly to optimize and maximize profitability as best we can.
keith michael housum -- northcoast research partners, llc -- analyst
okay. fair enough.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
maybe just to build on that a little bit. so the logistics and the semiconductor component cost, we consider those to be transitory. on the labor side, there's always some upward movement in labor rates. but if you think of the amount of labor that goes into our cost of goods sold, it's very small. so it's a single digit, i think, high single-digits part of our value add is from labor. so it's not something that meaningfully changes the p&l.
keith michael housum -- northcoast research partners, llc -- analyst
got it. got it. and as i look at your full year guidance, anders, historically, you guys have always had a very strong fourth quarter, sequentially a big uptick from the second and third quarter. the guidance you're providing here suggests perhaps you've been roughly a flat fourth quarter. so is there a thought process that businesses kind of pulled ahead during the year? or how are you thinking about the fourth quarter? any potential upside to that?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
well, i think the implied guide for the fourth quarter that we had in our full year number here certainly would indicate this growth, not as strong growth as we've had in the first half or in -- we guided for q3. but q4 was a very strong quarter last year. so we saw a great recovery in the fourth quarter. but we do see continued strong demand from our customers. the momentum is very strong. we don't see that abating. this is more of a tougher compare than anything. i don't know if, nathan, you want to -- or joe, want to add anything?
nathan andrew winters -- chief financial officer
yes. i think from a sequential standpoint, keith, in terms of the typical update from q3 to q4, i don't think it reflects anything from a weakness in the fourth quarter as much as just strength we're seeing here in the third quarter. and as we've noted earlier, when you look at our days on hand inventory and the strength, i wouldn't say sales pull-ins are not a major factor. it's really just that acceleration of investment from our customer base. and if anything, where we're getting the visibility is in the backlog and funnel, as joe mentioned, in terms of giving us confidence in the full year, particularly the fourth quarter guidance.
keith michael housum -- northcoast research partners, llc -- analyst
okay. thanks. i appreciate it.
operator
the next question is from andrew buscaglia with berenberg.
andrew edouard buscaglia -- joh. berenberg, gossler & co. kg -- analyst
good morning guys. so i wanted to ask on r&d. you're spending this you're on track to spend about $560 million or so. and i'm wondering how much of this over the last, call it, 12 months, is related to this vision and amr kind of push? and then secondly, at what point can you start to really leverage that r&d line. do you need to be spending cost $550 million a year going forward?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
well, first, i'd say r&d investments is a key activity for us. that is what really drives our longer-term growth. and i would say if you look back over the last several years, the investments we've made in product development and r&d has had a great return for us. so we want to make sure that we have a portfolio of fresh solutions that offer real value to our customers so we can compete and grow the business. we look at our r&d investments across a number of horizons, you can say, our investments in our core that would have a very short-term return kind of the near adjacencies, which would have a little bit longer return, say, a couple of years, two, three years, and then more innovative new solutions, more of the enterprise asset intelligence type of solutions here which will have a little longer-term payback as they're more ground-up innovations.
in many areas, let's say, you mentioned fetch specifically, we developed our own robots with smartsight before. so there's certainly been a way for us to both learn the industry, but there's also attractive ways for us to leverage those investments across. so when we do make acquisitions, we see that as a great way for us to augment our own internal programs and drive us into new high-growth adjacencies where we can make a difference. did that answer to your question?
andrew edouard buscaglia -- joh. berenberg, gossler & co. kg -- analyst
yes. no, that's helpful. and if i heard correctly, you got nice healthcare award this quarter. like that area is taking kind of a back seat to all excitement going on in retail and e-commerce and logistics. can you update us on healthcare in terms of -- you are still seeing that narrative play out post covid, where people are accelerating investments in automation there?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
yes. i think across all our verticals first. i mean, covid has accelerated the secular trends that we talked about all our end markets are driving solutions that help to digitize and automate their workflows and empower frontline workers to be connected and optimally kind of utilized. each of our primary vertical markets grew double digits in the second quarter, and we continue to invest in expanding in each of these ones. specifically for healthcare, i'd say we saw our healthcare markets, they started in more acute care, but it's been moving into other areas like outpatient, remote patient care, covid testing, vaccine distribution.
so our efforts in healthcare continues to expand into new areas. it's also expanding geographically. so the win we talked about today was in europe. and i think here also the healthcare patients are taking a book out of their e-commerce or kind of online shopping activities also. they are seeking a more digital experience, which is putting some extra pressure on healthcare providers to make sure they can offer similar type of experiences for the patients. and i'll say here, our purpose-built devices and solutions are critical for healthcare providers, not only to improve the patient journey but also to drive greater productivity for the healthcare providers.
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
i might add that in healthcare, there's two other phenomenon that will drive continued growth. one is that, we know that healthcare systems, depending on where in the world you are, this is in a different stage, have pulled back on some of their spending because they didn't have income from the elective procedures that they usually enjoyed. and as we come out of the pandemic, we see more of that income returning to for-profit hospitals and then their ability to spend on these solutions returns as well. and we've seen that. and the international growth is another big dimension. anders mentioned the european piece, but we also see significant interest in different parts of asia that we haven't seen to that extent before. so there are two more growth factors that we expect.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
just one more comment on this will be, i expect the healthcare to continue to be our fastest-growing vertical over the longer term. but it's great to see that we have this diversity in the business across our main four verticals and some other newer ones coming up. but in q2 here, manufacturing, which was our fastest-growing vertical, manufacturing was the one that was the hardest hit by covid-19 and the macro was a bit tougher going into that with tariffs and other things. but the opportunity to increase automation in workflows through wearables and heads-up displays and the need to track and trace sourcing components at sub-suppliers through assembly, all the way through distribution is providing great opportunities for us. so all our vertical markets performed very well, but manufacturing was actually the strongest one for us in q2.
andrew edouard buscaglia -- joh. berenberg, gossler & co. kg -- analyst

our last question is from rob mason with baird.
robert w. mason -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
yes. good morning. thanks for the question. anders or joe, wanted to get your thoughts on how quickly you thought you could pull together the channel, the partners, to be able to sell your fixed industrial scanning and machine vision products? and i'm curious also if you envision those being two separate channels, or both products will go through the same channel? and then also relatedly, i guess, maybe what percent of your existing channel is suitable to sell those products?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
yes. i'll start and joe can provide some extra color here also. so we have worked on our go-to-market strategy and our channel engagements basically since we started working on the product and solutions. so this is not something we're kind of doing serially. this has been something we've done in parallel to a large degree. so you can say there's a venn diagram of partners out there. there are partners who we currently have who are also in the fixed industrial scanning machine vision space that we are obviously having a great -- already have a relationship with and with easy expansion to add our fixed industrial scanning and machine vision capabilities to their portfolio, but also recruiting new partners that are not necessarily zebra partners today, but are strong in that space.
and we've seen good interest and response rates from them. and i think they have been impressed with our solutions and they see how we can add value to them. so this is obviously a big part of what we need to do now and for the next year to ensure that we deliver the revenue growth that we are intending or planning for. but so far, i'd say that the response from the channel has been very positive.
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yes. i appreciate that you're asking this question because channel is central to our go-to-market strategy, right? we're a very channel-centric company. and as we were designing this go-to-market approach, we spent a lot of time on this. first, we created a dedicated track in our partner connect program, which is very important to serve the needs of these particular partners. a percentage of our current partners are also machine vision distributors and sellers. i would estimate that that's a small percentage. the majority of machine vision partners we need to recruit. and we have made great progress in recruiting these partners already.
we have a very strong group of partners that have already signed up to sell this force. and that's because of what we were talking about earlier that we've designed the product with a particular value proposition geared toward partners. we wanted it to make easy for those partners to deploy and sell these solutions. we think that's critical to success, and that's essential in how we've designed the product. so we're very pleased with both the number of partners we've already been able to recruit and the pipeline of additional partners that we have that is interested in selling our product.
robert w. mason -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
very good, very good. just one follow-up. nathan, the china tariff recovery, it was a nice contribution in the second quarter. what's assumed in the third quarter or second half for that or the potential for that to recur?
nathan andrew winters -- chief financial officer
yes. so we have no incremental amount assumed in the second half guide. our total claim was just over $30 million, and we've recovered $27 million to date. so i'd say the large majority that's left is in reconciliation. so i would expect the amount that's left to go is fairly small, and the timing of that is a little bit unknown just as we reconcile those last few batches of transactions.
robert w. mason -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst
i see, i see. and just to clarify as well in your guide. you've assumed nothing for fetch because it hasn't closed, but just how should we think about the profit impact. small business, i know, but i assume you're planning to invest fairly heavily or aggressively. and would that be material in the second half or fourth quarter?
nathan andrew winters -- chief financial officer
that's right. so it is not assumed in the guide since we haven't closed. and it's about a $10 million run rate revenue business and unprofitable at this time as it scales, but i'd say not material within the margins of our overall guide.
robert w. mason -- robert w. baird & co. incorporated -- analyst

operator
good day, and welcome to the zebra second quarter 2021 earnings results conference call. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to mike steele, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
michael steele -- vice president of investor relations
good morning, and welcome to zebra second quarter conference call. this presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. slide two conveys that the forward-looking statements we make today are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our sec filings. during this call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures as we describe our business performance. you can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release.
throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. this presentation will include prepared remarks from anders gustafsson, our chief executive officer; and nathan winters, our chief financial officer. anders will begin with our second quarter results. then nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our revised 2021 outlook. anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision. following the prepared remarks, joe heel, our chief revenue officer, will join us as we take your questions. now let's turn to slide four as i hand it over to anders.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, mike. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. our team delivered exceptional second quarter results with strong performance across the business, resulting in record sales and profits. for the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of 44%, or 40% on an organic basis; an adjusted ebitda margin of 23.6%, a 530 basis point year-over-year improvement. non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $4.57, a nearly 90% increase from the prior year and strong free cash flow. despite ongoing industrywide supply chain challenges, our teams successfully satisfied stronger-than-expected demand from customers, both direct and through our distribution channel.
similar to q1, we realized robust broad-based demand with double-digit sales growth across all four regions, each major product and solutions category as well as in all of our vertical end markets. our customers continue to digitize and automate their workflows with a sense of urgency in the increasingly on-demand global economy. we also significantly expanded profit margin across our business more than offsetting escalating global supply chain costs. we also continued our balanced approach to scaling operating expenses while investing in initiatives to drive sustainable profitable growth.
with that, i will now turn the call over to nathan to review our q2 financial results in more detail and discuss our improved 2021 outlook.
nathan andrew winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, anders. let's start with the p&l on slide six. in q2, adjusted net sales increased 44.4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions and 39.8% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes. we realized particularly high growth from our run rate business through the channel, partially driven by pent-up demand, while continuing to see strong growth in direct sales to large customers. our asset intelligence and tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 51.2%, while enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales increased 35.1%, driven by exceptional growth across all major categories, including enterprise mobile computing and data capture.
note that we also realized double-digit growth in services and software, along with very strong growth in our rfid solutions, for which deployment activity has snapped back as customers recover from the pandemic. we recognized double-digit growth in all regions. in north america, sales increased 39% with all major categories growing double digits. in emea, sales increased 44% with solid growth across subregions and solutions offerings. apac again realized strong growth with sales up 20%, led by strength in china, australia, india and japan. latin america also continued its recovery with exceptionally strong growth in all subregions with sales increasing 79%. adjusted gross margin expanded 390 basis points to 48%, primarily driven by favorable business mix, a $12 million recovery of chinese import tariffs, higher support service margins and contribution from our recent high-margin acquisitions.
these benefits were partially offset by higher premium freight charges, which we'll discuss further in a moment. adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 180 basis points. we continue to scale opex while prioritizing high-return investments in the business. second quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 23.6%, a 530 basis point improvement from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. we drove non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $4.57, a $2.16 or 89.6% year-over-year increase. eps growth also benefited from lower interest expense, partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate.
turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide seven. we generated $514 million of free cash flow in the first half of 2021. this was $192 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. in q2, we acquired adaptive vision for $18 million to advance our machine vision solutions and made $4 million of venture investments. in addition, we also repurchased $25 million of zebra shares. our balance sheet remains strong. from a debt leverage perspective, we ended q2 at a modest 0.6 times net debt-to-adjusted ebitda leverage ratio, which affords flexibility to invest in attractive business acquisitions.
on slide eight, we show the multiyear impact of transitory costs, primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the global pandemic as well as tariffs on china imports. for the second half of the year, we now expect the year-on-year unfavorable impact from these items to be approximately $85 million, which translates to a three percentage point negative gross margin impact. our supply chain team has been taking extraordinary actions to satisfy customer demand in an exceptionally challenging global environment. global freight costs for virtually all modalities of delivery across our supply chain continue to escalate.
impacts include higher global shipping cost per kilo, a shift in modality from ocean to airfreight as well as increased cost to expedite component parts to our tier one manufacturers in order to meet customer commitments. we expect premium freight costs to abate once component supply and freight capacity improves. let's now turn to our outlook. the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving our business, including omnichannel shopping adoption, the desire for track and trace across the supply chain and the need for more digital healthcare experience. we entered q3 with a strong order backlog, and we continue to see broad-based robust demand across virtually every dimension of our business.
this momentum, along with our sales pipeline, gives us the confidence to provide a strong q3 guide and substantially raise our full year outlook. in q3, we expect adjusted net sales to increase between 21% and 25% year-over-year. this outlook assumes a three percentage point additive impact from the acquisitions and foreign currency changes. we anticipate q3 adjusted ebitda margin to be between 20% and 21%, which assumes gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage from the prior year. it also assumes approximately $45 million of premium freight expense, which is $37 million higher than last year. we are also experiencing higher product component costs, which we expect to largely offset with recently announced price increases. non-gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10.
for the full year 2021, we are raising our guide for adjusted net sales growth to be between 23% and 25%, which reflects our increasing optimism for strong growth in the second half of the year despite significant industry supply chain constraints for certain product components as well as transportation bottlenecks. this outlook assumes an approximately three percentage point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. despite our significantly increased expectation for transitory premium freight charges that we just highlighted, we are maintaining our expectation of full year 2021 adjusted ebitda margin to be between 22% and 23%, which assumes operating expense leverage and gross margin expansion from the prior year.
we now expect our free cash flow to be at least $900 million for the year due to increased profitability. please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide nine. note that our outlook does not include any projected results from the pending acquisition of fetch robotics. anders will discuss the strategic acquisition in a few moments. with that, i'll turn the call back to anders to discuss how we're advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision in new and existing markets.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, nathan. i am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business, which allows us to further increase our 2021 outlook. slide 11 illustrates how we are working with our customers and partners to advance our enterprise asset intelligence vision. by leveraging zebra's industry-leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services, our customers can overcome some of their most complex operational challenges and transform their frontline workflows to achieve higher levels of performance. we help businesses across industries implement tailored solutions that digitize and automate their operations, enabling them to compete more effectively.
with our innovative solutions, our customers' associates can now anticipate and react in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, prescriptive analytics and machine vision. now turning to slide 12. as a trusted strategic partner, businesses in a variety of end markets turn to zebra to help optimize end-to-end workflows. i would like to highlight several recent wins across our end markets, which demonstrate how zebra solutions are improving productivity, customer service and patient care. a large european postal service will be deploying approximately 80,000 tc57s to their carriers.
continuing a long-standing relationship, they are upgrading to the latest mobile computing solution, which will enable them to more effectively handle increased parcel volumes and a broad range of use cases. it's another proof point of successful collaboration with post and parcel services around the globe, including our current business with the united states postal service. we are also helping a large north american steel manufacturer to optimize and digitize its operations. this customer is adding more than 1,000 of our et56 tablets to their operations, which will allow them to eliminate manual paper processes by implementing electronic proof of delivery to automate and expedite the invoicing process.
this solution will also improve the customer experience by providing advanced notification of delivery. large public sector hospital system in the u.k. is utilizing our mobile computers, printers and wrist bands to enable real-time visibility into the entire patient journey and ensure safe and efficient care. this customer is using our solutions for specimen tracking, patient monitoring and blood transfusions in emergency and operating rooms. their employees also use our mobile computers for physical security access. a regional u.s. supermarket operator recently decided to implement our reflexis workforce management tool for labor scheduling and employee self-service to more efficiently manage their resources across more than 100 locations.
this solution also frees up their associates to focus more on customer service versus administrative tasks. more broadly in retail, the sharp increase in omnichannel and online shopping requires retailers to deliver goods in a timely manner and make them available for pickup when promised. to address this challenge, a wide range of retailers have been prioritizing investment in zebra solutions that provide higher inventory accuracy and utilize their labor more effectively. slide 13 highlights significant recent investments, we are making in advance -- to advance our enterprise asset intelligence vision in the warehouse and in manufacturing.
in may, we announced the launch of our fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions to increase efficiency and quality inspection in our customer's operations. we complemented this product launch with the acquisition of adaptive vision, whose software enables customers to easily build machine vision and deep learning applications. we are excited about our opportunity to penetrate this high-growth, fragmented market, and we are actively recruiting channel partners to scale the business. in july, we announced our intent to acquire fetch robotics, which has the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry, powered by a cloud software platform that can be deployed stand-alone or integrated with warehouse management systems.
our vision is to orchestrate both robots and technology-equipped frontline workers through software in the cloud to optimize material transport and order fulfillment workflows. as a venture investment, fetch has been a trusted partner to zebra, and we are excited about the prospects for our combined businesses. in closing, we are confident in our growth prospects given the momentum we are experiencing in the business and our heightened pace of innovation. we are energized by our vibrant core markets as well as the emerging prospects, we see in newer markets to digitize and automate workflows. now i'll hand the call back over to mike.
michael steele -- vice president of investor relations
thanks, anders. we'll now open the call to q&a.

[operator instructions]. the first question today comes from tommy moll with stephens. please go ahead.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
good morning.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
anders, i wanted to start on your antuit acquisition. wondered if you could highlight a couple of ways in which it might be synergistic with your portfolio. and i really -- i had two buckets in mind. first just in terms of scale, you've got more robust go-to-market capabilities, more robust r&d dollars you can put against it. so what would you highlight for us there? but also just in terms of the portfolio and fit, so if i'm a customer, what augmented capabilities will you be able to deliver with the software platform given you've got other software adjacencies and hardware opportunities to deliver a solution versus what the portfolio -- or rather what antuit would have done as a pure stand-alone business?
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
yes. i'll try to go through and give you some insights to each of those points. but the first, this helps us in our -- to augment our solutions around improving retail store execution for our customers as well as for consumer products companies. it is very synergistic with our enterprise asset intelligence vision. and we talked about our sense, analyze, act framework here, and this is very much around the analyze and act part of this, enabling our customers to sense what's happening in the real world, analyze this information and act on it in real time.
the solution that antuit offers is a demand-sensing solution, it's called, that's -- but that they take in lots of different data feeds, anything from in-store sales to weather, social media and use that to determine basically what demand trends will be. and they can be very quick and do this much better than, say, traditional models. if you take an example, like when covid happened, antuit's algorithms were able to better and quicker adjust to this new environment. and it's very, say, synergistic with our other offerings, particularly, say, on the software side, where say -- take reflexis, where antuit's insights will generate actions for our reflexis task management solution, so they can be to go and replenish something, move inventory from the back of store to the front of store or other parts of the supply chain.
so it is very much kind of works synergistically with our broader software solution as well as with our devices. so our mobile computers will generate insights that antuit can analyze and put into its ai algorithms to drive better insights from. and with this broader set of solutions, we position zebra to be more of a strategic solutions partner to our customers. and we have access to more executives or -- more customers and more executive level people at our customers than antuit would have individually. so therefore, we think that this fits very well with our broader strategy.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
thank you.
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
one other addition, this is joe heel. if you think about the customer set, you mentioned go-to-market, that antuit targets, it is primarily merchandising executives in retail and in packaged goods. of course, that retail is a very strong segment for us, so that should give us the ability to leverage our scale to the benefit of antuit's offering. and conversely, we have a position in packaged goods, but antuit will give us a stronger offering to further expand our offerings in general, not just antuit, but in the way anders described, into packaged goods.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
thank you, both. that's very helpful. i wanted to pivot for my follow-up to the margin. and again, we appreciate the transparency you've offered around the premium freight headwinds and the trajectory there. so we're looking at $55 million for q4. and my question really is the following. if you think about how the fourth quarter is progressing, both in terms of the realization of some of the pricing actions you've taken, then also you've got on the cost side, it's dynamic and presumably changing on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis. so if you think about where you likely end the quarter, once all that rolls through versus the full quarter outlook you gave, i think it was above 21% for the quarter. does it feel like the exit rate is probably a little better than that average? or how do you see things shaping up here in real-time?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
tommy, maybe just to start with the fourth quarter. as you mentioned, you are slightly above 21%. that is down from the prior year, a little over two points. so four points, that's the premium freight, but offset by favorable business mix as well as improved service margin as well as improvement just in the underlying product margin. and as you mentioned, we have raised prices to offset the component pricing, so the unit price. i think -- so that's something we're continuing to monitor and assess is how the transitory impacts play out. i would say from a logistics and freight perspective, we do expect that to moderate through the first half of 2022. but i'd say it's something we're managing day to day, week to week. and we'll see how the quarters play out in terms of when we start to see a meaningful benefit from where we're at today.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
nathan, just to make sure i'm tracking you here. it sounds like the pricing actions are really more targeting the product aspect of inflation rather than the freight. am i hearing you correctly?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
that's correct.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
okay.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
that's correct. we have not raised prices to offset the transitory premium freight expenses, but that's something we'll continue to assess as this plays out.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
great. i appreciate the insight. i will turn it back.
operator
our next question comes from andrew buscaglia with berenberg. please go ahead.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
hi, guys. just on that question around margins. how are you able to manage sort of the supply constraint issue in securing parts for your products? and it seems broadly across most of industrial customers and the customer companies in general, but these constraints will continue into next year. so i guess, what are you doing on that side of things to manage? you talked about the freight cost, but just wondering in terms of securitization of parts.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
yes. so i'll start kind of at the higher level here. and so if you look at the broader backdrop, demand has ramped very fast over the past year, and we have now prioritized meeting our customer needs and commitments. and while we are not always able to meet our traditional lead times due to these industrywide supply chain challenges, we have been working with our partners and customers to make sure that we can deliver very strong double-digit year-over-year growth. and i'd say based on feedback from our customers and partners, we've been managing this better than our competition.
specifically for how to secure parts, looking at the semiconductor industry shortages that has impacted the availability and pricing of some parts more than others, or some of our devices than more than others, this is a highly dynamic environment. and we get -- so we sort out and get good news on some parts. next day, we get some more challenging news on other parts. so it is kind of very much of a dynamic environment for us. but i'd say our teams have been working very well. done an exceptional job of working all angles to figure out how to mitigate these issues. starting with -- we've been built more resiliency in our supply chain by putting in new assembly plants across southeast asia, so we're less dependent on any particular plant.
and in q3, for instance, we had to move volume between plants based on covid outbreaks. so that was a great way for us to leverage that. we've also worked really hard to engage with our semiconductor suppliers to make sure that we get our fair share, so we get proper allocations of parts. and we're having a large part of our engineering team working on redesigning our devices to qualify new alternative components that are not as exposed to or limited with supply. so we're doing all of these things to ensure that we can meet our customer needs as well as possible here. but as i said, it's a dynamic environment. it's difficult to predict how exactly it's going to play out. but based on our conversations with our suppliers, i'd say, we expect a gradual improvement by mid-2022 on the component side.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
okay. yes, that's helpful. you do stand out as someone who's managed these constraints very well and you raise the line of fire of that issue. so i thought it does sound like you have the capabilities in place to keep that going. and i think -- on the demand side, i thought that your ait sales would be a little bit higher. how much of that is related to that supply constraint issue? or are you seeing any sort of moderating in demand?
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
first, i'd say, we continue to drive innovation across the entire portfolio of products and solutions. and we're helping our customers to digitize and automate their operations. and the core business is very vibrant. and we're very excited about the adjacent expansion opportunities that we have. now specifically for printing, we had a very solid -- we delivered a very solid growth across the regions in printing. printing was up across most of its portfolio. we have particular strength in manufacturing, which tends to deploy mostly tabletop printers. we also saw strong run rate or smaller business through our channel.
but it's fair to say that printing was disproportionately impacted by supply chain challenges. and that was -- that includes both component issues, but also that our main assembly plant in southeast asia had to almost shut down based on covid, and we had to shift a lot of the volume from vietnam to china. so that took some capacity out of the quarter. but it still was a very good quarter for printing. we could have done probably a little bit better, but we still believe that we continue to gain share. certainly, year-to-date, we gained a lot of share in printing. and also in the ait segment here, we had very strong growth in supplies across all regions, and that includes our temptime portfolio. and we -- in q2, we launched our new soho printer, very excited about that. that's off to a good start.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
got it. thanks, anders.

our next question comes from jim ricchiuti with needham & co. please go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & co. -- analyst
hi. good morning. i'm wondering if you could -- how you would characterize your large projects business, anders, you highlighted a few nice wins. and i'm also wondering to what extent that business is being impacted by the component constraints, the logistics challenges, whether customers are themselves being impacted by bottlenecks elsewhere in their supply chain, that's affecting the time lines for when these projects are going to go forward.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
yes. i'll start with our large customers, our larger projects are continuing to do well. we saw growth in that year-over-year. but the mix between kind of our run rate business and large customers has moderated, gone back to a little bit more what we would see as historically normal rates versus what we saw a year ago. i don't think we can say we've seen any impact on our customers' rollout schedules based on supply chain issues. and we clearly work really hard with our large customers as well as our channel partners to make sure that we understand what is true demand, what our customers truly need to have in order to run their business versus what they might want to have or think of as more risk buys. so we can satisfy all our customers, but particularly our larger customers here. but demand from them continues to be strong and as -- in line with what we've seen previously. and maybe joe heel, do you have any additional color here?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yes. i would echo what you said, we have not seen any delay in large businesses due to bottlenecks on our customers' parts elsewhere, and we have had some extraordinary wins even in this past quarter. as you know, the large projects are somewhat lumpy here and there, but we had double-digit growth nearly in the large projects business as well. including some extremely nice wins in multiple geographies. so we're very pleased with it.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & co. -- analyst
got it. and a follow-up, just i appreciate the color on your expectations looking out to the first half of next year as it relates to components and some of the unusual freight costs you're incurring, i'm wondering how we should be thinking about your operating expense levels over the next several quarters only because things are beginning to normalize. we have presumably trade shows starting to occur again and i'm just wondering if we need to be mindful of some temporary cost savings you might have benefited from this year being layered back in over the next several quarters?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
jim, i think it's fair to say that as we go into next year, we do expect some of the discretionary spend, particularly around travel and trade shows to pick up. but i'd say it's no different than any other variable we manage within the year in the pluses and minuses, and still expect to grow despite some of those incremental costs that we'll incur. and as usual, we'll find offsets and efficiencies to mitigate that impact as we go into next year.
jim ricchiuti -- needham & co. -- analyst
got it. thank you. i will jump back into the queue.
operator
the next question comes from meta marshall with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. i wanted to maybe first ask a question just on kind of seasonality. i know a lot of your retail customers don't tend to be as active in q4. but we're also kind of dealing with the labor shortage, so just any kind of perceptions of what you're seeing as far as seasonality into q4.
and then maybe a second question, clearly, you're highlighting success within healthcare and this has been a continued area of success for you guys. are you able to use kind of your traditional go-to-market or the partnerships that you think you could explore that would kind of further accelerate that opportunity? thanks.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
yes. thank you, meta. i'll start and then i'll ask joe heel to provide some extra color here also. but first on seasonality. i think seasonality this year has been similar to what we would normally have seen, but we had slight increases quarter-over-quarter in q3 and into q4. so not a huge difference from that perspective. obviously, demand has been strong and very broad-based. so that certainly helps on the overall demand profile. but i don't think that the -- seasonality has meaningfully changed and joe can comment on that in a second. on the other part, on healthcare.
health care has been our fastest-growing vertical if you look over the last several years and we would expect it to continue to be our fastest-growing vertical, not necessarily every quarter but over a longer period of time. and we have built up a -- we said, first, we're leveraging our traditional sales team, but we have a dedicated healthcare sales team within our sales organization and we have largely dedicated healthcare partners. if you take somebody who's an expert in manufacturing and send them to a hospital, the language is different, the solutions are different. so it really warrants to have more specialized partners, and we have a large number of specialized both regular resellers, but also isvs and other partners to help us make sure that we have a robust go-to-market organization and capability as we can. joe? all right.
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
this is joe heel. i would add to each of those points, respectively, the following. on the seasonality, the one additional thing we have seen is that retailers have been ordering further in advance, right? they're seeing, of course, the shortages that are -- that exist in the supply chain and are working with us to anticipate those. so that means that we can plan our supply to them further in advance. and so our reflection of their seasonality to sort of pull forward in that regard. in terms of healthcare and the go-to-market that we use there, as anders said, yes, we have specialized partners in those areas that we have been building out over the last few years.
two other things i think characterize our go-to-market and routes to market, in particular, one is we have a higher-than-average investment of our own resources. we have learned and determined that being present in those hospitals, which is, of course, a more fragmented customer seat -- customer set is important. and therefore, we have made more investments in our own resources in those areas, and we're more present together with our partners, of course.
and then the second is that we've also learned that we need to expand our partner set to more, let's say, nontraditional partners, which would include, in particular, isvs. they're very important isvs for electronic health records that we need to form partnerships with. and oems, there are important oems that participate in this -- in the healthcare segment and we have formed some very strong alliances with those as well. and that's helped us with our growth in healthcare.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
just one --
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
-- more points on this. we have -- as we work with our customers now, particularly joe mentioned retailers, we have greater visibility. the supply chain constraints have enabled us to get greater visibility into their requirements. and our pipeline is more robust and we entered the quarters with a greater backlog than we normally would, but it's not like they have been pulling forward demand. but as you look into the future, the more robust pipeline and backlog gives us better visibility as we look into next year.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from paul chung with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. so just a follow-up on margins. if we think about ebitda margins kind of ex freight costs, maybe you are kind of in that mid-20s percent range. you mentioned maybe some temporary costs come back, but is this kind of the more normalized margin profile we should expect maybe in, i don't know, second half of '22 when some of these costs fade a bit? and as your software product mix continues to accelerate, can we see further expansion there? and then i have a follow-up.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
yes, paul. so i think if you look back, our track record of driving -- we have a track record of driving profitable growth. i mean we'll exit the year around 23%, and that's a 150 basis-point improvement from where we exited 2019 despite the transitory cost increase. we do believe ebitda margin can go higher. we have many levers to achieve that. you mentioned one, scaling new markets that have traditionally richer gross margin, whether that be software or the fixed industrial machine vision markets we're entering. along with the team, continuing to driving higher margin and productivity through the operational efficiencies across the business, which we've always done. so again, we do expect margins -- ebitda margins to improve beyond this year, particularly as the transitory freight abates.
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thanks. and then your free cash flow in the quarter pretty much paid for fetch. so your flexibility to continue, kind of, inorganic expansion is really quite good. debt level is in a good place. where are you looking to kind of expand the portfolio and what leverage levels are you comfortable with? reflexis, antuit, those driving higher-margin software mix, should we continue to expect priority on software kind of moving forward as well? and then you mentioned adaptive vision as well, if you could provide an update on how that business is going. thank you.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
yes. so i'll -- yes, i'll start on the kind of the m&a side of this. m&a continues to be a priority for us. we are certainly very excited about the outlook for the business, and we do see m&a as a vector for growth. we're quite pleased with the recent acquisitions of fetch, antuit and adaptive vision as well. we look at m&a as a way for us to accelerate our strategy to advance our enterprise asset intelligence vision. and we're targeting select bolt-on acquisitions as well as some high-growth acquisitions that would truly advance our eai vision. we see opportunities in digitizing and automating supply chains and workflows more broadly.
and as you said, we have a strong balance sheet that can support our m&a opportunities. then on adaptive vision, that's part of our machine vision fixed industrial scanning solution set. we acquired them back in q2, and they provide software solutions that help our customers to design in machine vision or fix industrial scanning solutions in their workflows, and to be able to more easily extract useful information from there digital images that they take. and so it's an integral part of our machine vision solution and helps to make sure that it is -- our solutions are easier to implement than our competitors. so it's one of our value propositions. and so far, we're very excited about the overall entry into that market.
paul chung -- jpmorgan -- analyst
thank you.

brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
hey, good morning. such great momentum in a number of end markets. i'm wondering, anders, are there any end markets where the impact of covid-related sales and sales stimulated by the pandemic has been delayed? and end markets where it's not going to be really a headwind for like a tough comp in 2022 where maybe it's the rental car market or healthcare market that just kind of took a while to get going, do you see any end markets that just have yet to really drive growth as it relates to the pandemic where we'll see incremental growth in '22?
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
the pandemic has really accelerated a number of secular trends that's supporting our business and helping to drive enterprises to implement our type of solutions. the themes around how to digitize and automate our customers' businesses is a, let's say, a high priority across all our vertical markets, across all the end markets and geographies, how to improve frontline worker efficiency and to reduce frictions from those workflows. so i don't think there's any -- i can't think of any meaningful markets that would be hampered by this environment or kind of really lagging from this. this is a pretty broad-based picture. we did see early on during covid, would say that healthcare was hit hard because they the traditional acute care business was, for healthcare provider, largely shut down. and if it wasn't truly acute, they wouldn't admit patients, and it became only taking care of covid. but that has rebounded and we're now surpassing 2019 levels.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
i understand, joe. can i interject and just say -- i don't think i asked the question clearly as i wanted to. but do you see any end markets where you look at the end market right now and say, ok, that's starting to kick in where it hasn't to date, where you're excited about incremental growth going forward.
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
anders, would you like me to say something?
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
yes, i'll take just a couple of comments on this and see --
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
yes. thanks.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
-- there are certainly areas that -- and then joe heel, you can provide some extra color. i'll just highlight one market, i think that we can see that is starting to kick in, and that will be hospitality. hospitality was largely shut down for most part of covid and that's coming back. and we do see a number of pipeline for opportunities within the hospitality segment is recovering nicely. and then joe, you have some other ideas.
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yes, i was going to mention three, one perhaps that you might not expect. hospitality is one. another one that has sort of a longer curve where we expect benefits to continue is manufacturing, which has been recovering really nicely. you saw that already this quarter, but we expect that to continue. there's much to be recovered there. and a third one that you might not think of would be japan. japan has been a market that has been on the sidelines for a bit, in particular, during the pandemic. but many of the japanese customers have not yet migrated to android. and now that they are seeing the recovery from the pandemic, they're doing that. so there's a market opportunity there that is extending strongly, we believe, into the next year.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
and what percentage of revenues in japan roughly today?
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
it's a small part of our revenue stream today, but it's a nice upside opportunity for us.
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
right.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
okay. and then just the last question on software. are you able to give us an update since there's been so many acquisitions and growth in software and you're making the comments that the margins are being aided by higher -- the overall margin being aided by higher margin than software. where are you in terms of the size of that software business? i know you don't kind of shy away from same percentage of total revenue historically from software. but just curious if you could give any comment on that. or like what -- when do you envision software being 5% or 10% of sales down the road? any quantification or clarity on that would be helpful.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yes. so if you look at our software -- the saas portfolio of the business, it's still small, mid-single digit as a percent of the company. and we haven't stated a target or an aspiration in terms of what's the right mix. obviously, it's an area of the business we expect to grow organically faster than the core business over time. and it's a priority from an m&a perspective. but in terms of -- we haven't -- we don't have a set date in terms of what percentage of sales we want to get to by a particular year, except for, again, to continue to build out the suite of offerings we have and turn it into a driver of organic growth.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
thanks for taking my question.

our next question comes from keith housum with northcoast research. please go ahead.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning, guy. and, congratulations on the quarter. just want to revisit the supply chain challenges once again. is there a feeling that the supply chain challenges are kind of peaking now and perhaps are going to slow way to recovery? or we're not quite sure if they've peaked quite yet and we still have to work through it.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
there are different parts of supply chain challenges here now. i talked a little bit about the semiconductor issues. we also have more logistics issues around ocean freight and airfreight. i would think that on the freight side, i would expect a quicker recovery and i would expect that to moderate as we get into the first half of 2022. so i think we're probably at peak rates and capacity constraints, but not that there will be a kind of binary improvement in this area that it goes from whatever it is today to what it was prior to covid. it will be a gradual improvement, i think. on the component side, i think we're -- we wouldn't expect it to get any worse. but i think again, we -- as i mentioned earlier, we would expect kind of a gradual improvement by mid-2022. does that help?
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
it does. and on the component side, is it primarily with chips? or does it seem that the issues are popping up and is [indecipherable] and you got one issue here that you may resolve it, you go to a different issue?
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
i think it's largely on the semiconductor side, but it does move around. so we secure -- so backing up one step. so even before covid, even before this, every quarter when we started, we would have certain parts that were on allocation or that we needed to find more. but so that's a normal part. but the number of parts today is much higher. and we work on solving for one part, the next week some other part pops up. so the frequency and the number of parts are much -- that are on allocation or longer lead times is greater. but we try to make sure that we work very closely with our semiconductor suppliers to let them know what our true requirements are. and we've signed long-term supply agreements, price agreements and so forth to make sure that we get proper consideration when they do allocate parts. and -- but it's a complex process, but i think we've been managing it very well so far. great. i appreciate it. and then moving over to the software. you've got reflexis now probably for at least a part -- better part of the year. in terms of the approach to the sales, is it still direct -- primarily as a direct deal? and is it the same as your regular sales force? or do you have a different software sales force? and then how does antuit go to market and how do you envision signing these things together going forward?
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. i appreciate it. and then moving over to the software. you've got reflexis now probably for at least a part -- better part of the year. in terms of the approach to the sales, is it still direct -- primarily as a direct deal? and is it the same as your regular sales force? or do you have a different software sales force? and then how does antuit go to market and how do you envision signing these things together going forward?
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
so i'll start and then joe heel can provide some extra insights here also. but for reflexis or our broader software portfolio, we have set up a dedicated software sales teams within our broader go-to-market organization. so you can think of our traditional account management teams would be able to start the conversation, qualify an account to some degree and then bring in our software experts to do a lot of the more technical part of the selling activities. so we -- but with that is in a more dedicated part of the organization to make sure we have the right level of or depth of knowledge and insights.
we are doing this largely direct today, but we are also working with expanding our portfolio -- our partner portfolio here. and there's a number of other type of resellers and system integrators who are interested in working with us to be able to represent us and participate in doing implementation services. and antuit, we specifically -- with antuit here now, we are initially keeping the antuit sales team somewhat separate because we want to make sure we keep the focus and dedication to that. but leveraging again the account teams access to accounts as well as the broader expertise we have in our software go-to-market side. joe?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
i think you said it well, i have nothing to add.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
okay. very good.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. i appreciate it.

our next question comes from damian karas with ubs. please go ahead.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
good morning.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
i think you've covered a lot of ground. you did highlight particular strength in mobile computing, i think most notably in europe. maybe you could just elaborate on what you're seeing that's driving that. to some extent, is it a matter of europe just catching up? or are there any particular end markets, customers or outsized projects that are driving that mobile computing strength in europe?
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
yes, i'll start again and joe can also add some extra colors on europe. but first, i'd say we're very pleased with q3 overall. we've seen great demand and we've -- that has been able to drive our revenues to exceed the high end of our guidance range. and our customers are aggressively pursuing digital enterprise transformation strategies, which is causing us to basically exceed our expectations as far as revenue growth this year. we talked about the supply chain issues as being a moderator on this, but we've still been able to deliver double-digit growth across all the regions in each of our product segments. and we continue to see strong growth from both our smaller customers as well as our large strategic accounts.
and based on our performance, i clearly expect that we are continuing to take share in the industry. and we entered q4 with a strong backlog and we have a healthy pipeline, which i think provides good visibility into 2022. specifically for europe, i think we saw -- europe obviously had a fantastic quarter. so strength in nearly all the subregions of emea, and growth was across all our verticals with particular strength in transportation logistics, and that was driven by some very attractive large postal services' wins. and retail was also a very strong vertical for us. from a product perspective, mobile computing and services were particularly strong, while our printing business is more impacted by supply chains. joe, any further comments?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yes, i would say that the strength in europe was perhaps a little bit of an artifact of us trying to get the optimal mix of supply that's available to the customers that we have. if you look over more than one quarter, you'll see that the strength in north america and europe is pretty much exactly on par. so we're seeing equal strength in both over two or three quarters here. this is more of a one quarter artifact, i would say.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
understood. that's really helpful. and i guess we've all seen the headlines since last quarter on honeywell's actions taken against zebra investors. do you have some questions on this? anders, maybe you could just kind of give us an update on the itc case and that pending litigation? how would you expect these matters to play out?
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
first, we have a policy of not commenting on ongoing litigation. so it's hard for me to provide a lot of color, as much color as i'd like here. but clearly, we have -- we plan to vigorously defend our positions here. and i'd like to remind everybody that we have the broadest and deepest intellectual property portfolio of the industry. and we will remain laser focused on extending our lead and taking share in the market and to beat our competitions in the marketplace.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
okay. great. i appreciate it. best of luck, guys.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from -- or our last question comes from rob mason with baird. please go ahead.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
yes. good morning. and nice job on the quarter as well. a lot of ground has been covered. i was just -- i was curious, though, if you could delineate your growth by channel during the quarter. it sounds like both sides, both run rate business and large deal business were both strong, but i was curious how each one might have weighted out. and then maybe if you could comment as well just on how the backlog -- strong backlog that you mentioned as well, how that might be weighted between those channels?
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
yes. i'll -- joe, do you want to take the lead on this? joe?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
yes, sure. i can take the lead if you like. so in the past quarter, our direct channel mix was slightly higher than in the past. so we had a little bit more in our direct business than -- rather than our channel business. but our channel centricity, so the percentage of our business that goes to channel, remains extremely high, as is our strategy sort of in the over 80% range. and our backlog continues to be very strong. as we entered into the current quarter, we've had a very strong backlog again, and we're already building backlog for future quarters as you might not be surprised to hear.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
does the backlog favor large deal versus the channel? distinction on the -- draw a distinction.
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
generally, yes. generally more for large deals. yes.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
okay. okay. and then a number of nice wins that you commented on during the quarter, one in particular, the u.s. home improvement. when -- i'm just curious, was that -- were you the incumbent in that account? or was that a competitive takeaway?
joachim heel -- chief revenue officer
in this case, we're the incumbent.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
yes. we were the incumbent and there was a refresh of an earlier android implementation.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
yes. yes. maybe is where i was headed with the question because i recall that was one of your maybe larger -- or i think you had a large early win in android with home improvement retailer in the u.s. and i'm just curious, are you starting then now to see refreshes more broadly on your android installs? and if so, i'm just curious if you can make a stronger determination around how the life -- i guess the lifespan of those devices is faring versus legacy devices.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
yes. so we are definitely seeing a number of our customers that were early adopters of android now upgrading or refreshing to second-generation android. and the refresh cycle for android devices is a bit little faster than it was with microsoft. the level of innovation on the platform is higher. so you can think of the number of new android versions coming out is quite frequent and they tend to require more memory, faster processor speed to run properly. and that, combined with our customers putting more and more applications on the devices. so that also drives more memory as an example. so there's a number of things that are causing our customers to want to upgrade and refresh the portfolio at a faster pace than what they -- what we saw with older microsoft platforms.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
and you mentioned as well that's going to a broader set of users at that customer. i'm just curious if you could -- is there an order of magnitude that you could speak to?
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
yes. so definitely a much deeper penetration of devices into our customers' operations. the value of having every worker be digitally connected and aware is a priority, i would say, for virtually all our vertical end markets, but particularly in retail and healthcare. and we talked about how, today, roughly -- our estimate is that 1/3 of retail store associates have access to a mobile device. and when we talk to our retail customers, they certainly have an aspiration to get that to be much, much higher. and similarly, in healthcare, we did a vision study. i think it's a couple of years back now where the expectation there was to bring it from about 60% up to 95% over the next few years.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
great. great. thanks for taking the questions.

[operator instructions] good day, and welcome to the third quarter 2021 zebra technologies earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to mike steele, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead.
micheal steele -- vice president of investor relations
good morning, and welcome to zebra's third quarter conference call. this presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our sec filings.
during this call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures as we describe our business performance. you can find reconciliations at the end of this slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year-over-year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. this presentation will include prepared remarks from anders gustafsson, our chief executive officer; and nathan winters, our chief financial officer.
anders will begin with our third quarter results, then nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our fourth quarter outlook. anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision. following the prepared remarks, joe heel, our chief revenue officer, will join us as we take your questions.
now let's turn to slide four as i hand it over to anders.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
thank you, mike. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. our team delivered exceptional third quarter results that exceeded our outlook, supported by robust broad-based demand for our solutions. for the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of 27% or 23% on an organic basis, an adjusted ebitda margin of 21.7% and a 140 basis point year-over-year improvement. non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $4.55, a 39% increase from the prior year. and strong free cash flow. our customers are prioritizing investment in our solutions to digitize and automate their workflows in an increasingly on-demand global economy.
we realized double-digit sales growth across all four regions, with particularly strong growth in emea. favorable business mix and higher service and software margins enabled us to expand our gross profit margin despite escalating freight costs. our teams have been diligently leveraging alternative modalities of transport and expediting shipments to mitigate the impact of continued industrywide supply chain challenges. we also scaled operating expenses while continuing to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable, profitable growth.
with that, i will now turn the call over to nathan to review our q3 financial results in more detail and discuss our q4 outlook.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, anders. let's start with the p&l on slide six. in q3, adjusted net sales increased 26.6%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 23.2% on an organic basis reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions from customers of all sizes. our asset intelligence and tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 12.1%, while enterprise visibility & mobility segment sales increased 27.9%, driven by exceptional growth in mobile computing.
note that we also realized double-digit growth across services and software. all four regions grew double digits. north america sales increased 14%, with particular strength in mobile computing, supplies and services. emea sales increased 39% and with strong growth across all major solutions offerings, particularly mobile computing. apac sales grew 17%, with strength across most geographies, including china. and in latin america, sales increased 41%, continuing with strong recovery with double-digit growth in all major offerings. adjusted gross margin expanded 130 basis points to 45.1%, primarily driven by favorable business mix and higher service and software margins.
these benefits were partially offset by significant premium freight charges, which we will discuss further in a moment. adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 30 basis points as we continue to prioritize high-return investments in the business. third-quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 21.7%, a 140 basis point increase from the prior year period, reflecting higher gross margin and operating expense leverage. we drove non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $4.55, $1.28 or 39% year-over-year increase which benefited from lower interest expense and a favorable tax rate.
turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide seven. we generated $798 million of free cash flow through the first nine months of 2021. this was $316 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. our balance sheet remains strong. from a debt leverage perspective, we ended q3 at a modest 0.5 times net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio, which provides us ample flexibility. in the first nine months of 2021, we invested more than $300 million to acquire fetch robotics and adaptive vision to advance our intelligent automation solutions in manufacturing and the warehouse. we made $24 million of venture investments in four portfolio companies. in addition, we made $38 million of capital expenditures and $25 million of share repurchases.
on slide eight, we show the multiyear impact of transitory costs primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the pandemic, as well as tariffs on china imports. our supply chain team continues to take extraordinary measures to satisfy customer demand in an exceptionally challenging environment. global freight costs are elevated for all modalities of delivery across our supply chain. this includes higher shipping cost per kilo, a significant shift from ocean to airfreight as well as increased cost to expedite component parts to our tier one manufacturers to meet customer commitments. in q3 compared to pre-pandemic rates, we incurred incremental premium freight costs of $44 million, which was $36 million higher than the prior year.
for q4, we now expect approximately $55 million of premium freight costs based on the higher spot rates we are seeing in the market, which translates to a four percentage point negative gross margin impact. we expect premium freight costs to abate as component supply and freight capacity improves. let's now turn to our outlook. our robust sales pipeline and strong order backlog is supported by broad-based demand for our solutions as enterprises look to automate their operations to satisfy increasing consumer expectations. despite extended lead times and uneven inventory availability, we expect fourth-quarter adjusted net sales to increase between 8% and 12% year-over-year. this outlook assumes a two percentage point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. we anticipate q4 adjusted ebitda margin to be slightly higher than 21%, which assumes gross margin contraction from the prior year due to significantly higher premium freight expense, which i discussed earlier. we are also experiencing product component inflation, which we expect to largely offset with price increases that became effective in september. non-gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.50. we have increased our free cash flow outlook to be at least $950 million for the year due to higher-than-expected profitability.
please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide nine. with that, i will turn the call back to anders to discuss how we're advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision in new and existing markets with spotlights on our acquisition of antuit and our healthcare vertical.
anders gustafsson -- anders gustafsson-zebra technologies corporation-chief executive officer & director
thank you, nathan. i am encouraged by the strengthening demand across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to navigate supply chain challenges. slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, solutions, software and services. by transforming workflows zebra's customers can address complex operational challenges to achieve higher levels of performance. by closely collaborating with our partners and customers, we help businesses across a variety of end markets to implement solutions that maximize their return on investment.
human labor is a scarce resource. our innovative solutions empower their workforce to do their jobs more effectively by navigating constant change in near real time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as machine vision, prescriptive analytics and artificial intelligence. in october, we acquired antuit for approximately $145 million to further advance our enterprise asset intelligence vision. this high-margin software as a service business generated sales of approximately $27 million in 2020, nearly doubling over a three-year period.
slide 12 illustrates how the ai-powered demand forecasting solution ensures that its retail and consumer product customers have the right inventory at the right time at the optimal price, whether it's fulfilled through online ordering or in-store shopping. antuit's cutting-edge offering complements our suite of workflow software solutions, including reflexis, zebra prescriptive analytics, workforce connect and smartcount, which works together to increase the performance of labor and inventory across the integrated supply chain. our growing software suite will help our customers break down silos between planning and execution, giving them a competitive advantage that can increase revenue and margins as they navigate the increased demands of omnichannel fulfillment.
now turning to slide 13. businesses partner with zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows. i would like to highlight a few recent key wins across our end markets that demonstrate how zebra solutions are improving productivity and service levels. in retail, zebra is enabling improved execution of omnichannel fulfillment as more consumers shop online. we recently secured our largest win to date in india, providing tc21 mobile computers and printers to help a local retailer compete more effectively against its larger omnichannel and e-commerce global competitors. we are also enabling a japanese supermarket chain to provide an improved customer experience with our ec55 personal shopping mobile computing solution.
over the next several quarters, a leading home improvement retailer will be deploying 90,000 tc52 mobile computers to a broader number of associates in their stores. key use cases include item locationing, best-in-class long-range imaging, mobile point-of-sale and e-commerce functionality. competitive differentiators for this win included our seamless network connectivity, best-in-class noise cancellation and enterprise leading durability. our mobile computers will also have full desktop functionality when inserted into workstation cradles.
this retailer is also deploying our workforce connect software-as-a-service solution, which enables associate-to-associate instant collaboration as well as associated-to-group and's store-to-store communication. a leading north american transportation and logistics company is deploying 9,000 tc77 mobile computers to their truck drivers for loading and delivery use cases. this solution will increase productivity, improve inventory accuracy, log driving times and track regulatory compliance. turning to
slide 14, we highlight how healthcare providers are using zebra solutions to digitize and automate the patient journey and address labor challenges. our recently published vision study highlights that 95% of decision-makers expect to increase spending in healthcare it and clinical mobility in the next year. we have some exciting recent strategic wins that demonstrate our value proposition. we recently secured a takeaway win of a leading u.s. healthcare provider with more than 150 hospitals and approximately 2,000 sites of care.
this customer selected zebra to provide a multiyear rollout of 85,000 scanners for a wide range of use cases, including bedside nursing, surgery, pharmacy and inventory management. they also recognized our unique software tools that enable real-time event tracking to prioritize patient care. a large eastern european public hospital system recently placed in order to provide 19,000 tc25 mobile computers to nurses across 100 hospitals. hospitals are facing labor shortages made worse by the pandemic, which puts patient safety at risk. zebra's solutions, including printers and wrist bands, reduces the administrative burden on the nursing staff and allows for more efficient patient care. our value proposition to this customer also includes real-time tracking of costs of supplies, equipment and medicine.
additionally, zebra is growing our long-standing relationship with ge healthcare, whose solution, encompass, utilizes zebra's bluetooth beacon technology for medical equipment asset management. this solution improves asset utilization and prevents unnecessary equipment replacement purchases. caregivers also benefit by reduced time searching for medical equipments, which can increase time dedicated to patient care. in closing, the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving zebra's business, including omnichannel shopping adoption, the desire for track and trace across the supply chain and the need for a more digital healthcare experience. our core markets are vibrant and our prospects to scale newer expansion markets are bright. we are steadily navigating through significant transitory industrywide supply chain challenges. that said, we continue to be as excited as ever about our long-term profitable growth prospects.
now i'll hand the call back over to mike.

[operator instructions] and our first question this morning comes from tommy moll from stephens. please go ahead with your question.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
good morning.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
good morning.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
i wanted to start with your revenue outlook. so looking at your first quarter guidance and the full year, it looks like you're expecting a step down sequentially in the first quarter and then revenue builds through the quarters for the rest of 2022. can you walk us through the assumptions in that cadence across the quarters? and specifically, if you could provide detail on what assumptions you have for the deal business, that'd be helpful. thank you.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
thanks, tommy. so if you -- look, we entered the quarter, as we said in our prepared remarks, with a very strong backlog, good bookings momentum here early in the quarter. the guide of 1% to 3% really reflects constrained supply, not demand driven by very specific and certain component shortages within our printing in dcs business. without that, we would expect to be at least as high as our full year guide unconstrained.
but with that said, we do see improved visibility into those components later in the quarter and into the early part of the second. so we expect a solid rebound in q2 and then gives us line of sight to our full year guide. and on the full year guide of 3% to 7%, in which, as we said in the prepared remarks, that we're confident as ever about our business. we do anticipate improved supply chain constraints throughout the year.
it's obviously a dynamic environment, but we've secured commitment and we do see improved visibility here over the next few months. and that would also include increased growth in the last nine months of the year, again, due to strong backlog demand, along with the recent targeted price increases that go into effect here at the end of the month. [inaudible] while being somewhat cautious in our overall growth assumptions, given the supply chain challenges.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and nathan, would you be able to share any embedded assumptions on the deal business? i know sometimes you have more or less visibility there, so i'm just curious what you've embedded in the outlook today.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
overall, it does -- particularly if you look it from a ebitda rate, we do have some favorable deal mix, so a slightly higher percentage of run rate versus deal mix compared to 2021, but obviously that becomes a little bit harder to predict as we get into the second half of the year.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
i could add color as well, this is joe hill speaking. as you saw in q4, we had strong large deal flow. and if we look at our backlogs and pipelines, we also have continued strong, large deal flow. we have no shortage of demand.
tommy moll -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thank you, both. and if i could pivot to a higher level question here, anders, appreciate the update you provided on the long-term outlook around revenue. i'm curious for any additional context you could give us on the thought process there and what went in to that revised outlook and then specifically on the double digit expansion opportunities that you provided. i noticed that the ones on your slide or areas where you've already entered either organically or inorganically.
are there any other expansion opportunities that may not be on that slide where we could expect potential for continued m&a and/or organic investment? thank you.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
first, we've -- since we raised our longer term growth outlook to 5% to 7% over cycle versus the historical number, we had a 4% to 5% that we had in place since 2014 when we did the enterprise acquisition. over the last seven or eight years, we have overachieved that target and we've been more in line with 7% and we see our overall markets being very strong, to be served by some very strong secular trends that are helping to drive demand. and as we help to digitize and automate our customers operations and their workflows and our competitive position remains very, very strong and we think we have great opportunities in our core. the core continues to perform very well, but also in our adjacencies and in our expansion markets.
so you ask specifically about the expansion markets, we've -- we include in there only things that we have identified so far where we have plans or -- more than plans, where we have solutions that are in the markets. so could it expand? sure. absolutely, they can expand but we looked at slicing the market to these -- the solutions we have today and the type of applications that they address. so we're not going after we not including, say, the entire markets for the -- for these funds, but only the markets that we can address today.
so as we continue to add functionality that we'll possibly add new solutions that total market serve market can expand. we certainly see those as very attractive markets. we have a strong right to play and we have a differentiated value proposition like in fixed industrial scanning or in robotics. and those markets, we expect to have a materially higher strong double digit growth rates versus our core and they will then augment the overall growth rates we have for the company.
operator
and our next question comes from andrew buscaglia from berenberg. please go ahead with your question.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
morning, guys. i wanted to ask a little bit more on the margin outlook, near and long term. so on the price side, you said you raised prices. do you have capacity to potentially rise again? and then on the cost side, are you -- if need be, that is obviously.
and then on the cost side, are you assuming everything's being shipped by freight again for the most part of the year -- sorry, by air? are you assuming freighter ships by air, not land?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
so if you -- i'll start the last question there. our assumptions, particularly in q1, we are still assuming that we're almost shipping, particularly in printing, exclusively via air versus ocean, although we do expect that to shift as we move throughout the year. so getting back to more normalized levels in the second half. so that's assumed in the full year guide from a margin rate perspective.
and when you look at the the price increases, particularly the one we did here this month, that ranged from 0 to 8%. again, it was not a general increase similar to what we did in september. it was very specific to the product family region based on the competitive position, as well as the cost increases we're seeing in those respective product families. and that represents a little less than a point of sales growth contribution for the year.
and it is something we'll always continue to assess and look at. and if we need to increase prices again based on the competitive positioning and or the inflationary environment, we'll do so.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
yeah, ok. ok. and that under that long-term guidance slide, i was surprised to see that core -- first off, can you update us on what you think your market share is in that? i believe it's close to 50% last time you gave that update. and then i was surprised to see that that's still 4% to 5% cagr just given the world started to change in the last couple of years.
yeah, just wondering how you're thinking about that.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so our market share is very strong, we peg our overall market share at about mid-40% for our core where mobile computer would be a little bit higher, printing is thereabouts, so maybe a little higher and lower for scanning. but the overall market share, we peg around mid-40%. and the growth rate is based on independent market research for those markets, as well as an expectation that with the focus in investments we're doing, we will be able to continue to gain some share, although not quite at the same pace as we have for the last several years.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg -- analyst
ok. all right. thank you, guys.
operator
and our next question comes from jim ricchiuti from needham and company. please go ahead with your question.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
a question about rfid. there's been quite a bit of activity in that market, some fairly high profile use cases that have been publicized recently. and i'm wondering, does this represent an incremental growth opportunity or does it perhaps shift some revenues from some of the conventional business, your core business? and i'm wondering if you could, number one, talk about the opportunity and if you [inaudible] i'm not sure you've ever really sized that portion of the business. can you elaborate on that perhaps.
thank you.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, so we include rfid in the adjacent markets for us. it's -- we've been in the rfid space for a long time, so it is very much a close adjacency to our core where we have strong right to play and our solutions are very much tied together. i would think of it as not a -- it's not an either/or type thing that customer either buy rfid or they buy our regular solutions. they -- our rfid solution go on top of our traditional products.
so if you want to say print and encode an rfid label, it is one of our traditional label printers with an rfid encoder attached to it. and similarly, if you want to read it, the labels that is an attachment, the sled or something like that on our mobile computers. so it is an incremental part of our core business, but it's not a supplement, or it's a supplement, but not a substitute for our core. and the market continues to grow very nicely.
we've seen apparel retail probably be the main driver so far. we're looking at the in-store inventory back accuracy as one of the big drivers, but it's been spreading across more different categories within retail but also we see now moving into other industries. so manufacturing, being able to track components of subassemblies through a supply chain or in healthcare to be able to do a number of attractive use cases there also.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
maybe i'll add something. jim, i would say that there's definitely an incremental piece to it but there's also some substitution. i'll give you two quick examples. in apparel retail, most of the supply chain has replaced barcoding with rfid now, at least in the more advanced retailers.
and that's probably a substitution because they're using that now throughout their operations as they would have before barcodes. on the other hand, we see a lot of applications. for example, pallets. pallets have in the past hardly ever been tracked.
but with rfid, we can now track them. and so putting rfid labels on pallets is a great way to ensure much greater efficiency of pallet logistics, which is surprisingly a big problem. so that's an indication of the incremental nature that we see.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
so if -- we take some comments recently from ups where they talk about working some smart logistics centers where they're replacing -- i think they said something like 20 million, potentially just using rfid to replace 20 million annual scans simply with traditional bar code. it sounds like you still see a lot of opportunity even if there is some impact on the core business.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yes, well, we see that as a nice addition to the business because, one, they would have to augment, say, either printing or mobile computers with rfid capabilities or they could also, of course, use overhead rfid readers, which will be the new business for us with ups. so we see that as a very attractive adjacent growth opportunity for zebra.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from meta marshall from morgan stanley. please go ahead with your question.
unknown speaker
hi, team. this is eric on for meta. thanks for taking our questions and congrats on navigating through another tough quarter. in outperforming our expectations, i guess just maybe to start off on the high level growth target you put out, so you think every vertical has the potential to be a 5% to 7% growth vertical across your end markets or is that more skewed to certain customer bases?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
we expect that broad-based growth across these are all the entire business of verticals, geographies, and product lines, specific to verticals that highlight the healthcare and manufacturing as two high growth opportunities for us. they have high need for -- to digitize their operations and workflows and say today there's an under penetration relative under penetration of our type of technologies within those verticals.
unknown speaker
got it. that's helpful. and then maybe if i could also ask on and just some of the investments you're making and from time in operating leverage perspective, you've been pretty consistent in delivering operating leverage but if you were to more aggressively grow into some of your expansion areas, that could -- there'd be a situation where your top-line growth is higher but earnings growth more mirrors top-line growth? or do you still think even through those investments, you would be able to to kind of grow your profitability ahead of revenue?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
as you mentioned, we've had a long track record of driving profitable growth and at the ebitda level and ebitda margin, we believe that can't go higher, and we have many levers to do that. if you look at our full year guide here of 23% to 24% in the midpoint, that's two points higher than we were in 2019 while expanding into these new expansion markets. and those expansion markets come with higher gross margin and the team continues to focus on operational efficiency, by the way, growing that two points despite the transitory cost increases. so yeah, it's definitely still an objective for the company.
it's something we can continue to do over the long term.
unknown speaker
got it. thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from keith housum from northcoast research. please go ahead with your question.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning, guys. hey, joe. i'm just trying to unpack the information on the price increases between what you guys did in september here and in january and compare that to your annual growth rates. i mean as you think about that 3% to 7% annual growth, how much of that is coming from, i guess, new unit growth versus just the pricing increase that you guys have been able to roll forward?
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah, nathan, i think you have a good summary of that. i can add some to it.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. so keith i said earlier that the price increase that went into effect here in the end of this quarter is a little less than a point of growth contribution for the year. and in the remainder of that would be driven by the strong backlog in the demand for the products. so it's a relatively meaningful but a relatively small part of the overall growth for the year.
joe, anything you want to add?
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
did that answer the question, keith, or did i miss something?
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
i was -- i'm tracking the february increase you guys come through at the end of the month with the one that you passed through september. if you take both those combined, what does it do to you with that?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, maybe -- keith, there might be a little over a point. the one here in february is larger in size and you just have both those slightly impacted by timing in terms they went into effect in terms of their full year impact on 2022.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
ok. and a secondary question in terms of like the supply chain, we're hearing different comments in terms of the supply chain because you got the raw materials issue and then you have logistics. it sounds like from your guidance here, you expect both of those to improve quite a bit before the end of the year, if not totally abate. and i can appreciate the efforts you're doing in terms of the design and i guess getting secondary sources but is there one or two things you can point to that gives you the confidence that things will be improved before the end of the year for both these items?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
first, as context, i'd say that we provided record profitable results for the full year of 2021 and record q4. so we were able to do that in a very challenging supply chain environment. the situation is clearly very volatile, and omicron, as an example, has impacted the pace of recovery across all the verticals we served and globally. but the demand environment is very strong and has ramped very fast over the past year or so, and we've continued to put our customers first.
so we prioritized making sure we can meet our customer delivery times and customer commitments to the extent we can. now there are times when we have not been able to meet that traditional lead times the way we would like but that's all been supply chain related. but we are working very hard with our partners and customers to minimize any impact on our customer's business or our partners business in this area. and we do believe that the challenges are peaking and we anticipate both freight and component availability to improve as we go through the year here.
specifically, on the component side, i'd say that the impacts of -- on availability and pricing of all the components that we source varies. so it's some are much more impacted than others. so it's certainly a very dynamic environment in that way but we -- as we said, we've been working very -- all angles to make sure that we secure as much of supply as we can. we have worked on building more resiliency overall into our supply chain.
we have been negotiating long-term supply agreements with both new and existing suppliers. we are working with our suppliers to ensure we get our fair share of allocations, and we've dedicated a substantial part of our engineering organization to product redesign, to specifically design out long lead time ports. as we look into q2 and the rest of the year, though, we do have better visibility and better supply commitments to some of these critical components as we enter q2. so that's part of what gives us the confidence for the full year.
and so we do expect some gradual improvements as we go through the year.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
and keith, from a freight perspective, our air and ocean rates toward the end of the fourth quarter, we're five to x higher than what they were pre-pandemic. and as we said, we -- expediting both component parts, finished goods and shipping almost exclusively of our printing air versus ocean. but rates are beginning to recover from the peak in december, still significantly higher than even the first half last year and definitely from the beginning of the pre-pandemic. and we'll need some time to get print back on the ocean.
and i think we still believe that these are largely transitory, but the world has changed. we need to wait and see how the landscape settles to the extent that it will go all the way back down to zero. we'll have to wait and see how that plays out.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
and did you -- keith, get did you ask about non semiconductor shortages also?
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
i didn't, but you're welcome to answer that one as well.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. so the -- here i said there's some inflationary environment across all the commodities, but we would not have been -- not to the extent that we would make that a talking point in our earnings calls, if it weren't for the semiconductor side.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great, thanks. good luck, guys.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you.

our next questioner -- question comes from a question comes from damian karas from ubs. please go ahead with your question.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
good morning.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
good morning, anders. i want to ask you guys if you could maybe give us a sense on where you think you are for the core business in terms of the timing of the replacement cycle. i know that those devices are typically sort of recycled every five, six years or so. but just thinking about the really strong year you had last year.
it looks like you're expecting another positive year of growth in '22. how should we think about the 5% to 7% growth rate kind of when we get past this year thinking about the demand you've seen and whether you need to see a step down first or whether that 5% to 7% is kind of sustainable from here.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, so first, my the -- the 5% to 7% growth rate is meant to be through a cycle. so it will be some years will be stronger, some will be maybe a little weaker. it's certainly been that case, if you look at the past seven years since we had the 4% to 5% rate. but i don't see any reason why, from a demand perspective, there will be any kind of step down in the early part of this -- of the cycle here.
we see a very strong demand environment and the refreshes of our product lines that we -- that has -- that happens to mobile computing, to scanning, and to printing, they're all our products. we talk mostly about it from a mobile computing perspective where android has first driven an acceleration of refresh rates because there's so much innovation going into the android platform. so deployment -- products that are deployed, say, five years back, have a hard time now to support the most recent android versions or all the applications that our customers want to put on the devices. so we've seen a shorter refresh cycle for android versus the traditional microsoft devices that we had earlier.
and that's all baked into our assumptions for this year but it's -- we are certainly seeing many of our large deployments that happen in '15, '16 or even '17 that are now looking to refresh and or have already refreshed and in the process of refreshing. and i don't know, joe, if you had any further color for this.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah, i was going to give you one example, damian. so in 2015, we closed the largest deal at that time in zebra's history in mobile computing, which was a postal service in europe with the first purchase of tc70 at that time. and they have just refreshed their mobile computers last year, so it was about a six-year cycle for them. and you can see that others have followed suit.
and as anders said, the replacement cycles have gotten shorter. so going from five to six years closer to the three to four-year period in many cases.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
ok. great. that's really helpful. and appreciate all the detail around your addressable market and the long-term growth rates.
i'm just curious on the margin front what that means for your profile. i think the software side, obviously, higher gross margin relative to your business today but thinking about those expansion areas, what does it mean for your guys margin kind of near term as those businesses grow and longer term as well? thanks.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, damian, and i mentioned this a little bit earlier when it comes to the question from eric, but we didn't set an explicit target on an ebitda margin, although we do believe it can continue to scale and grow over the cycle. and as you pointed out, many, many levers to do that, including all these expansion markets, typically come with higher gross margin. and that will come through in ebitda as we scale those respective businesses, as well as churn through some of the transitory costs that are currently within the p&l. and i think ultimately our goal is to continue to drive double digit eps growth through all the levers we have available to us.
operator
and our next question comes from brian drab from william blair. please go ahead with your question.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my questions. i'm bouncing between two calls at the moment and i missed a little bit of the q&a. so sorry if i repeat something, but the post office project that you -- the larger post -- i know there's a lot of post office projects, but the large one that was, i guess, completed here at the end of '21, what sort of headwind is that on to your overall sales growth rate in '22? and i know you're replacing that with a lot of business, but i mean it would be great if you could make any comment on the large project.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, so the initial deployment for usps, we did complete in the -- late in the third quarter, early fourth quarter, but our teams have continued to remain highly engaged with the post office. we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities here for 2022, and our current assumption within our 2022 guide is that we will sell less to usps. so we are cycling through that, but again have many other opportunities, as joe mentioned earlier, around other large deals in the pipeline, just like we do any other year to offset that and continue to grow.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
ok, so it's not material enough that you would tell me that without this difficult comparison, that you would would have forecasted growth of a couple of points higher for '22, barring this one big project?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
that's right. again, every year we have a large deployment and rollouts, and again, we have new and other opportunities to offset that to reach the -- our full year guidance for '22.
brian drab -- william blair -- analyst
ok. ok. and then i'm just curious in the core part of your business that you're forecasting long-term growth of 4% to 5% for -- how does that break down these days between ait and evm?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
the growth between ait and evm is actually quite similar. it's not materially different. evm would likely have a slightly higher growth rate, but not materially so.
operator
our next question comes from rob mason from baird. please go ahead with your question.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
yes, good morning. a lot of grounds have been covered already, but my question, anders, just to go to some of these expanded areas in your introduction this year of the fixed industrial scanning and machine vision, i'm just curious if you could point to any kind of key progress points on those products. i know you only in the marketplace, maybe half the year, but key progress points around channel development, customer receptivity and what should be the expectations for that or those areas and specifically fixed industrial scanning and also the fetch business. how should we think about those in '22?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, no. happy to do that, and i'll ask joe to also provide some color after my comments here. but the expansion area services that we feel today that we can address, about $6 billion of opportunity there. the fix industrial scanning machine vision part is about $2 billion.
warehouse or autonomous mobile robots is approaching a billion and our software solutions are about $3 billion. so that gives you kind of the overall scope of that. we are very excited about all three of these. we have good, good traction, good customer receptivity on a fixed industrial scanning machine vision side.
we have some very attractive wins already and we continue to add functionality so we can address more and more of the market. but one particularly attractive win, i think for us last year or in -- i think it was q4 was in automotive where we could read -- it was a bake-off that we we showed very well our ability to read some dpm type of the markings, what was better than for the competition, and we were selected based on that. but i say here also the overall value proposition we have in fixed industrial scanning around the ease of use and the ease of upgrades using software to upgrade rather than having to change your cameras are very well received. and we are also working hard on a -- we have established a new fixed and definition image machine vision track in our partner connect program.
so we want to make sure we recruit partners to help us scale the business in a very cost effective way to get better reach than we can do ourselves in that timeframe. and we've always been very partner centric, so we think this is a great way to both provide new opportunities for our existing partners, as well as recruit new partners from that industry.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
so i can add a little bit, maybe just to underline that partner point. we've made excellent progress in recruiting partners. we've set ourselves a goal both in the u.s. and europe to recruit the premier partners that deploy these solutions.
and that's very important because these are complex solutions setup in these manufacturing and warehouse environments. we've made excellent progress in doing that. and the reason that we've been able to do that is what andrew's called ease of use. and that's particularly important for partners because they want to set up new solutions quickly and with few resources.
and that's where our solutions are different from the rest of the market is that you can do that much faster with our solutions, and that's what's attracting many partners. so we're very pleased with that. on the fetch business, i think we have -- the big milestone that i hope you've taken note of is that we've expanded from conveyance robots. so robots that move things from point a to point b in the warehouse to fulfillment robots, which are ones that are used to support pickers in e-commerce fulfillment activities.
that's a large and very fast growing part of the market, as you can easily imagine. and we've had an outstanding win here with one of the big e-commerce players here in the fourth quarter already, which of course, is going to be a very important reference for us. so we're very pleased with the progress in both machine vision and the autonomous mobile robots.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so i just want to add on the air side. we have a very differentiated value proposition for in the warehouse automation space where our robot competitors, they work very hard on optimizing the movement and the use of the robot and people who are more and equipment side would try to optimize the movement of workers. since we have both, we're trying to optimize the overall workflow and coordinate the movement of robots and frontline workers to drive the most productivity enhancements. and i think that value proposition resonates very well with customers.
rob mason -- baird -- analyst
i see. i see. and just as a follow up, joe, to go back to the progress you've made recruiting partners. i'm just curious if you have a percentage that are existing zebra partners that have added an expanded versus, i guess, entirely new partners.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
we do. so we have a good number of our existing partners have already been active in the machine vision space. i would tell you, though, that the majority of partners that we expect to have will be new partners that are specialized and highly proficient in this area as their exclusive or dominant focus but we do have a good number that we're starting with already.
operator
our next question comes from paul cheng from jpmorgan. please go ahead with your question.
paul chung -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. so nice record free cash flow for the year. you have some nice flexibility to kind of continue m&a. you got some low net leverage levels, so should we expect kind of a similar pace of acquisitions maybe more tilted toward on the software side? and then what kind of leverage levels are you comfortable with?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i'll start and then, nate, talk about the leverage levels here. but first on the -- on m&a, we view m&a as a top priority for us and we are very excited about the outlook for the business and we see m&a as a vector for growth. we're not looking to do m&a for the sake of m&a, say, but this is to help accelerate our enterprise asset intelligence vision. so think of -- fetch was a great example of how we could accelerate our outreach and expand our enterprise assets intelligence mission here into the warehouse automation space.
and so can you can expect that we can look be looking at some targeted bolt-on acquisitions as well as high growth acquisitions that truly advance our vision. and we do see opportunities in digitizing and automating workflows that is kind of the sweet spot for what we're looking for. and as you noted, our balance sheet is strong, so we can support a certain number of acquisitions.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
no, i think just to that, we ended at zero point five times net debt ratio and comfortable with the overall debt levels, and that gives a lot of opportunity and flexibility to address the m&a market, as anderson mentioned.
paul chung -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
and then your views on share buybacks, is this more to kind of offset some comp levels or what's your view there?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
that's right. obviously, the first priority is investment in the business both organically and inorganically, but we still believe share repurchases is a great way to return capital to shareholders. we were active in the fourth quarter and we've been active to date here in the first quarter with share repurchases.
operator
and ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from brian lau from wolfe research. please go ahead with your question.
brian lau -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, good morning, everybody, and thanks for squeezing me in here. anders, you gave a lot of good examples of some wins this quarter on both the hardware side and then the software offerings for reflexis and workforce management. just curious about the go-to-market strategy there, how you're bundling those when you're approaching customers. are there two or three sets of kind of sales teams or is it a more kind of holistic sales approach? thanks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i'll start in here. since joe -- this is joe's organization, i'll let joe provide some color here also. but yeah, we have we put a lot of thought into how we go to market and how we ramp these new solutions because we have two objectives here. one, we want to leverage the broader relationships that we have in our existing customers, but we also need to have a real focus on these newer solutions that are smaller today than our more established core solutions.
so we want the team that are very dedicated, very focused on them, and understand those use cases and those technologies very well. so if you take our software solutions as an example, we have a dedicated software sales team that are kind of owning the software opportunities, but they work very much through our traditional account managers to get introduced to the accounts to get help in navigating those and understanding what the issues are and so forth. so it is a sales overlay strategy for most of these opportunities, but very much leveraging the our traditional account manager. and joe, do you want to add anything to that?
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah, i would add. i mean, if you -- anders described the objective, well, right, we have a very strong presence, right? if you think about the fact that 94 of the fortune 100 in the u.s. are now zebra customers. we have account managers on those and we want to leverage those.
and then on the other hand, we have specialists that need to bring specialized expertise but also special understanding of the specific personas that are making the purchases, which would be, for example, human resources purchasers, a store operations purchasers. these are -- these overlay organizations, anders call them. we also refer to them as specialist sales organizations. these are meaningful organizations which have both salespeople.
they have application engineers or consultants, they have business development in them and they have channel management in them. so these are becoming large organizations that are dedicated to driving that particular offering in concert with the account managers that are now maintaining the overall relationship for us across the multitude of offerings that we have.
operator
and ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn the floor back over to mr. gustafsson for any closing remarks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you. so just to wrap up, our primary focus continues to be the health and safety of those on the frontline. and i would like to thank our employees and partners for their extraordinary efforts to serve customers and deliver record 2021 results in a challenging supply chain environment. we are optimistic that we are now seeing the peak of these challenges and we are working hard to minimize these impacts.
so thank you and have a great day, everyone.

good morning and welcome to zebra's fourth quarter conference call. this presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our sec filings.
during this call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures as we describe our business performance. you can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year over year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. this presentation will include prepared remarks from anders gustafsson, our chief executive officer; and nathan winters, our chief financial officer.
anders will begin with our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. then nathan will provide additional detail and financials, and discuss our 2020 two outlook. anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision, along with an updated view of our served market opportunity and revised long-term sales outlook. following the prepared remarks, joe heel, our chief revenue officer, will join us as we take your questions.
now, let's turn to slide 4 as i hand it over to anders. 
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. our team delivered solid fourth quarter results in an exceptionally challenging supply chain environment. for the quarter, we realized adjusted net sales growth of 12% or 10% on an organic basis; adjusted ebitda of $319 million, a 4% year-over-year increase; an adjusted ebitda margin of 21.7%, a 180-basis-point decrease; non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $4.54, a 2% increase from the prior year; and strong free cash flow.
customer demand is stronger than ever for our solutions that digitize and automate workflows. we realized sales growth across all four regions, supported by exceptional strength in mobile computing with particularly strong growth in asia pacific and latin america. supply chain constraints limited us from fully satisfying our customer demand, particularly for certain data capture and printing offerings. our teams have been aggressively working to mitigate the impact of the unprecedented industrywide supply chain challenges by securing new sources of supply, utilizing alternative modalities of transportation, and expediting customer shipments.
premium freight costs exceeded our expectations and significantly weighed on gross margin, which was partially offset by higher service and softer margin. we also scaled operating expenses while continuing to invest in initiatives to drive sustainable, profitable growth. our solid fourth quarter performance closed an outstanding full year 2021 in which we generated record sales, ebitda margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow. with that, i will now turn the call over to nathan to review our q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2022 outlook.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, anders. let's start with the p&l on slide 6. in q4, adjusted net sales increased 11.7%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions; and 10% on an organic basis, reflecting broad-based demand for our solutions. our asset intelligence and tracking segment, including printing and supplies, grew 3.1% despite significant supply constraints on our printer products and cycling very strong prior year results.enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales increased 13.2%, driven by exceptional growth in mobile computing.
we continue to drive solid growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and expansion of our software offerings. we recognize solid growth in all four regions. north america sales increased 4% with strength in mobile computing, supplies, and services. emea sales increased 9%, driven by strong growth in mobile computing.
asia-pacific sales grew 29% with strength across all major geographies, including china. and in latin america, sales increased 42%, continuing strong double-digit growth in all major offerings. adjusted gross margin declined 210 basis points to 45.7% due to unprecedented premium freight costs, partially offset by higher service and softer margins. we will discuss transitory costs, including premium freight, further in a moment.
adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 40 basis points as we scaled our cost structure while continuing to prioritize high return investment opportunities in the business. fourth quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 21.7% at 180-basis-point decrease from the prior year period, entirely attributable to lower gross margin from transitory impacts, partially offset by operating expense leverage. we drove non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $4.54, an $0.08 or 1.8% year-over-year increase, which also reflects lower interest expense and a slightly higher tax rate. turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide 7.
in 2021, we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow for the first time in our history. this was $115 million higher than the prior year, primarily due to increased profitable growth. our balance sheet remains strong. from a debt leverage perspective, we ended the year at a modest 0.5 times net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio, which provides us ample flexibility.
in 2021, we invested $452 million to acquire antuit, fetch robotics, and adaptive vision to advance our solutions offerings in retail, manufacturing in the warehouse. in addition, we made $34 million of venture investments in five portfolio companies, $59 million of capital expenditures, $257 million of net debt repayments, and $57 million of share repurchases. on slide 8, we showed a multi-year impact of transitory costs, primarily related to expedited freight due to supply chain bottlenecks caused by the pandemic, as well as tariffs on china imports. our team is making heroic efforts to satisfy customer demand.
this includes dedicating substantial engineering resources to product redesigns, negotiating long-term supply agreements with new and existing suppliers, shifting virtually all transport to air promotion, and expediting component parts and finished goods to meet customer commitments. global freight rates have reached record high cost per kilo for all modalities of delivery across our supply chain. in q4 compared to pre-pandemic rates, we incurred incremental premium freight costs of $67 million, which is higher than we had anticipated in our prior outlook and $58 million higher than the prior year. partially offsetting those impacts were $4 million of refunds of china import tariffs, which was $8 million less than received in the fourth quarter of 2020.
in total, these transitory items had a combined unfavorable gross margin impact of $66 million year over year. i'll discuss our assumptions regarding the 2022 impact of transitory costs in a moment. let's now turn to our outlook. we entered the year with a strong order backlog and healthy sales pipeline supported by broad-based demand for our solutions.
our expected sales growth of 1% to 3% for the first quarter has been capped by what we can deliver to our customers due to extended lead times and limited availability of component parts. our outlook assumes an approximately one percentage point additive impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes. we anticipate q1 adjusted ebitda margin to be approximately 20%, which assumes gross margin contraction from the prior year due to unfavorable sales mix and expected premium freight costs of $60 million, which translates to a 340-basis-point unfavorable impact to the prior year period. we also expect increased operating expenses as a percent of sales, primarily due to our entry into multiple expansion markets since last spring and resuming in-person events.
we believe total supply chain impacts, including transitory cost and product availability, are peaking in q1, with recent improvements in freight capacity and better visibility in supplier commitments to component supply into the second quarter. non-gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $4. for the full year 2022, we expect adjusted net sales to grow between 3% and 7% with the assumption that supply chain constraints steadily abate throughout the year. this outlook assumes a net neutral impact from acquisitions and foreign currency changes.
we anticipate full year 2022 adjusted ebitda margin between 23% and 24%, which assumes total transitory cost impacts, including premium freight expenses of approximately $140 million to $160 million. this is slightly higher than the impact we realized in 2021. we expect our free cash flow to be at least $900 million for the year. please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide 9.
with that, i will turn the call back to anders to discuss how we are advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision and to provide an update on our served market opportunity and long-term growth expectations.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, nathan. i'm encouraged by the strong demand across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to navigate the supply chain challenges. slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry leading portfolio products, software, and services. by transforming workflows with our proven solutions that generate an attractive return on investment, zebra's customers can effectively address their operational challenges, which have become increasingly complex through the pandemic.
are innovative solutions empower their workforce to do their jobs more efficiently by navigating constant change in near real-time, utilizing insights driven by advanced software capabilities such as prescriptive analytics, intelligent automation, and machine vision. we are raising our long-term organic sales growth expectations to 5% to 7% from our former expectation of 4% to 5%. on slide 12, we provide a refreshed view of our served markets totaling approximately $30 billion, which are supported by megatrends, including the on-demand economy, asset visibility, mobility and cloud computing, and automation. these trends have become increasingly important to our enterprise customers, and we remain well positioned to meet their needs with our comprehensive solutions.
today, the vast majority of zebra sales are in our core, which remains vibrant and is now expected to grow 4% to 5%. we have the broadest and deepest offering among the competition and believe that our continued focus in investment will advance our leadership position. our near adjacencies provide ample opportunity to expand and have a generally higher growth profile than our core. the most promising categories include rfid solutions for use cases that demand the highest level of workforce productivity and inventory accuracy.
smart supplies including dynamic temperature monitoring, as well as the opportunity to equip a broader set of frontline workers with our expanded offering of mobile computers. beyond our core and near adjacencies are rapid growth expansion opportunities that are transforming workflows across the supply chain. we have entered these areas through organic and inorganic investments over the past 18 months, and they represent a low to mid single digit percentage of zebra sales. in mid-2021, we launched several fixed industrial scanning and machine vision smart cameras.
we also acquired fetch robotics to give us the broadest portfolio of autonomous mobile robots in the industry. we have also been building a compelling software suite that optimizes retail execution and demand planning, which includes reflexis workforce and task management, zebra prescriptive analytics, workforce connect, smart count, and antuit.ai-powered demand forecasting. collectively, we are serving an approximately $6 billion market in this exciting expansion areas. we are early on our journey and have the opportunity to extend our capabilities deeper into the areas of machine vision, warehouse automation, and workflow optimization software over time.
now turning to slide 13. businesses partner with zebra to help optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of consumers. i would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets. a global apparel retailer is deploying a zebra solution of 32,000 tc52 mobile computers, along with workforce connect voice collaboration software and our software solution that transforms mobile computers into workstations on demand.
we are enabling this retailer to improve associate productivity and communication in both front of store and distribution center applications, eliminating the need for walkie talkies and full desktop computer workstations. our mobile computers will also provide the benefit of stable next network connectivity, improved security features, and battery management tools. this competitive takeaway win from a major consumer device provider demonstrates our superior value proposition versus the competition. in another recent win, zebra's reflexis workforce management solution has enabled a u.s.-based specialty retailer to optimize scheduling for more than 25,000 employees and provide enhanced self-service reporting and analytics to support accountability and performance.
we have extended our relationship with a leading international energy company to empower thousands of convenience store associates in the united kingdom with a workforce connect and reflexis workforce management applications on their zebra mobile computers and tablets. our solution enables the store associates to automate their daily responsibilities, maximizing productivity and streamlining task management and administration. we have expanded our relationship with a european auto manufacturer, augmenting thousands of their zebra mobile computers with rfid readers to enhance quality control in production lines and allow secure employee system access. we continue to collaborate with this customer to pilot promising new solutions to further optimize their operations.
in healthcare, a large hospital system in the southern united states purchased tc52 mobile computers and our workforce connect software application to enable mobile access to the medical record systems, as well as facilitate instant communication between nurses and other clinicians. zebra was selected over competing a consumer device providers because of our reputation for comprehensive enterprise solutions. in closing, we are working diligently to navigate through industrywide supply chain challenges, which limit our ability to fully satisfy strong customer demand in the near term. that said, the pandemic has accelerated trends that have been driving growth in zebra's vibrant markets, including e-commerce adoption, the need for real-time track-and-trace across the supply chain, and the shift to a more digital healthcare experience.
we continue to be very excited about our growth prospects. now, i'll hand the call back over to mike.

[operator instructions] our first question is from tommy moll of stephens. please go ahead.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my questions.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
good morning.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
good morning.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
anders, i wanted to start with the discussion of the omnichannel and e-commerce end markets. your underlying volumes, from what we can tell, seem to be pretty strong there still. at the same time, there's been some mixed headlines from some of the key players there. so i'm just curious, what can you tell us anecdotally from customers or across the business about the pace of that end market? does it continue to grow? does it feel healthy? are you seeing anything deteriorate in terms of the fundamentals? the extent you can confirm on the guidance that you provided, do you still see that those in markets growing in the second half.
thank you.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'll, i'll try to give as much color as i can here. i'll start with a bit more on current performance, what you saw in q2, and then try to give you a little bit of a sense of of how we look at the future here. but first, i'll just say that the trends to digitize and automate workflows and empower frontline workers, that continues to accelerate and in driving increased customer demand for our solutions across all our vertical markets. retail and e-commerce grew faster than the corporate average in q2 on a still very strong prior year comparisons.
we do continue to see strong momentum of omnichannel implementations, which are straining our customers resources and that's also driving investments in technology and automation that is necessary for retailers to continue to transform their businesses. if you look at the -- in the actual store, expanding buy online, pick up in store use cases and delivery use cases require retailers to equip more associates with mobile computers, along with also implementing more workflow software optimization solutions. and in the warehouse, we see investments in productivity and visibility as essential to that transformation. we've also expanded with some new attractive go-to-market partnerships like microsoft and google that helps to to elevate our strategic position within the retail vertical as well as other verticals.
and we have a very diversified retail and e-commerce customer base, and each of those customers are on their own refresh cycle, which helps to reduce volatility for us. and i'll also say that our pipeline has remained very strong. and although this is a quite a challenging environment, there are several retailers, who have recently publicly talked about their intent to maintain investments in technology as they try to continue to drive or execute on their visions and their strategies. so there are certainly a few customers that are ahead of their investment curves, but i would say most are playing catch-up with investments in solutions like ours, particularly in the labor-constrained environment, where they need to improve productivity inventory accuracy and customer service levels.
so i would say this feels more like a normal year for us in that most customers are investing and proceeding with healthy -- healthily with their plans but there are some that are pulling back a bit. but this is the value that we have of a diversified customer portfolio that allows us to not be overly dependent on any one customer. i'd say it's also noteworthy that we continue to grow despite the cyclicality of some of these large customers that we have and that it's a testament to our diversified customer base. i hope that helps.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
it does. thank you. and as a follow up, i wanted to pivot to the margin outlook that you gave. so this is on an adjusted ebitda basis.
you've reported 22% in the second quarter. guidance for third quarter is again at roughly the 22% level. and then if you look at what's implied for the fourth quarter, just based on the full year, it's a number well north of 22%. so a margin improvement from q3 to q4 would be implied by your outlook.
and i'm just curious what the the drivers there might be. is there incremental price you're assuming? is it just the supply chain -- elevated supply chain expenses you expect to get better or is it something else? thank you.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, if you look at our q3 guide of 22%, i'd say just if you look year on year, it's up 30 bps from the last year. and when you dig into that over two points increase from strong volume leverage, the pricing benefits, taking traction from what we've executed over the last nine months, as well as we're seeing solid improvement in the underlying gross margin across the portfolio, but that's offset by nearly two points of fx as we're forecasting slightly above parity. and in q3 is the first quarter where the premium supply chain costs have a neutral impact year on year. sequentially from the second quarter, it's flat as you get some improvement from -- improvement in overall premium supply chain cost, but that's offset by fx and -- in a slightly unfavorable deal mix.
so that's kind of your q2 to q3 dynamic. if you look at the fourth quarter, the rate increase is really driven by two dynamics. one would be a continued improvement in overall premium supply chain costs as we are taking actions here in the third quarter to reduce air freight, moving print to ocean that you'll see the benefit for in the fourth quarter, as well as you get nice volume leverage sequentially in terms of revenue -- increased in revenue on a relatively flat opex profile. so a bit -- almost half the driver is volume leverage with the other half being a continued improvement in overall cost position.

the next question is from andrew buscaglia of berenberg. please go ahead.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
good morning, guys.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
morning.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
so, i'd like to -- on the margin question, just wondering throughout the quarter what you saw in terms of the higher supply chain costs and freight costs. your guidance of $200 million stayed the same. so that imply things haven't really changed or how would you characterize how the quarter went relative to your expectations?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yes, with the supply chain costs in the second quarter, i think, first, we saw a 20% reduction in the cost profile from the first quarter on a 4% higher sequential revenue profile. so i think sequentially we're seeing the improvement that we had anticipated in our guidance and things relatively played out how we expected for the second quarter. if you look at it from a elevated shipping cost per kilo, we noted that those costs were continuing to trend down throughout the first quarter and they held relatively flat to what we saw in march throughout the first -- throughout the second quarter. and we expect those to hold through the second half of the year.
the real benefit was -- and we were able to reduce purchases of some of the critical components on the spot market at elevated prices. and again, that was the primary driver from the improvement in q2. and we expect that to continue to improve as we get to the second half of the year. and as i stated before, the key driver now is really managing as we increased our printer output, filling up the pipeline on ocean and start to get that benefit in the fourth quarter as it's a fraction of the cost to ship some of the larger printers on ocean versus air.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yeah. ok. ok. great.
and a question on the segment, so that -- sales there really surprised me positively. great margin performance. but as i understand it, that segment really follows gdp, if you look back to the pandemic and the great financial crisis. if gdp estimates are slowing broadly, what do you foresee in that segment going forward? are we seeing -- is there a lag here where that may deteriorate that growth?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
well, first, i'd say that to talk about all our product categories here that we drove nice growth across all the major product categories in q2 and we continue to drive innovation across the portfolio. that's all helping to digitize and automate our customer's workflows. and our solutions are that much more critical today as our customers are fighting labor shortages and inflationary pressure. for print specifically here, we did see very strong growth in q2.
we had a nice recovery from the challenging q1 supply situation and we had record revenues and -- in q2. and we manufacture and sold more printers than we've ever done in any quarter historically. and we do expect the backlog to continue to return to more normal levels or recover the delinquent backlog and also to start shipping more on ocean in q3 and q4. i'd say printing has maybe -- has grown faster than gdp by a couple of percentage points at least over the last many years.
we continue to see print as having an attractive growth profile. and we have -- we've been gaining share steadily over a long period of time. and i see no reason for why we shouldn't be able to continue to do that going forward also. so i feel good about our printing portfolio and the positioning and the growth we should be able to drive.
and i'll also ask joe to give some perspectives here.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah. andrew, i might also point toward opportunities that we have to continue to expand in areas beyond pure gdp growth. i'll give you two examples. one would be a use case expansion where we can continue -- track and trace is becoming increasingly important, for example, in pharmaceuticals.
and expanding in those use cases can help us grow beyond gdp. and another one would be segment expansion. for example, our entry into the soho printer market would be evidence of that. so i think we have opportunities to weather volatility in gdp.
operator
the next question is from erik lapinski of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
erik lapinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, team. thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. i'd like to ask for just a little bit more detail on some of the varying regional growth drivers you saw in the quarter. international growth was particularly strong and understand different regions are in different phases of their investment cycle.
so are you seeing similar trends driving growth in each region on a vertical basis, or are there certain verticals driving the strength and whether it's emea or asia-pacific that you saw in the quarter?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i'd say there's certainly some common themes across all. if you look at digital transformation, that is a strong driver for us. and the trends around digitizing, automating workflows are -- across all regions and across all verticals. so there's a lot of commonality, i'd say, in what's driving that.
each region has slightly different profiles as far as what verticals are strongest and so forth. but if you look at europe or india, which is particularly strong, a great quarter. we saw print, mobile computers and services were very strong from a product perspective. we secured a number of very attractive retail wins.
and i'd say the european or emea performance is particularly noteworthy considering that we also had low single digit percent global impact on revenues from suspending shipments to russia in march. asia-pac, i'd say also very strong performance, particularly if you think of the shutdown in china for a good part of the quarter. we did see double digit growth across mobile computing and scanning. we had record hardware and service revenues.
we did see very strong growth in india and quite pleased actually with china, which was down low single digits even though we were locked down for six to eight weeks. and now we're seeing very nice recovery in china as we move into the second half here. and maybe on north america, i'll just say that we saw a very solid, broad-based demand. we had strong wins across all our core verticals and we also saw attractive strength in our run rate business.
the results here were impacted by supply chain constraints and some of our allocations, some more on timing, but we recovered very nicely in printing and so strong growth in data capture on rfid. and for north america, the biggest impact has really recycled, some very strong prior year comparisons. usps was particularly strong in q2 of last year. i don't know, joe, would you have any --
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah, i would only emphasize that the regional distribution of growth that we saw in q2 is not reflective of the underlying demand situation, but much more reflective of how we allocated supply in times of shortage based on the shortest path that we have to get supply into a market.
erik lapinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thanks, joe. that was actually going to be my follow up. but maybe if i could also ask just on capital allocation, as we think about the honeywell settlement, obviously, that's a modest drag on cash flow, but you've -- your share repurchases in the quarter were maybe a little bit higher than expected.
m&a has been successful. is there any change in -- over the last quarter or how you're thinking about allocating capital in cash flow or should we think similar priorities to normal?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
i would think similar priorities as normal. we're comfortable with the overall debt levels and cash position that gives us a lot of flexibility as we enter the second half and into next year to continue to prioritize investment in the business, both inorganic, organic. we have exciting opportunities in both of those. and share repurchases will remain a nice, flexible way to return capital to shareholders.
so i'd say no, no change in the overall capital allocation approach as we go into the second half of the year.
erik lapinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from brian drab of william blair. please go ahead.
brian drab -- william blair and company -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. and they might seem to lean a little bit cautious, but that's just because that's what we're hearing from investors right now across the board. but first question just on your visibility, can you remind us in general, what is the lead time for the different product lines and maybe for large orders versus the run rate business? just trying to get a sense for how soon will you know if there really are challenges in some of these end markets?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
well, so our -- if you're looking at our visibility into kind of our pipeline, it certainly varies to some degree based on on customer and so forth. but for our larger customers and a large part of the market, we start the year by going through and having detailed reviews about their outlook, their investment profile already in november, december of the prior year. so we have a good perspective of what they expect to do for the year, and we stay close to them to see if there are changes. obviously, that can -- they can always change, but we tend to have a good, good visibility from those.
and we work very closely with our reseller partners to develop a pipeline for -- that is more than 12 months out. and we qualify that around -- we are in the sales pipeline of those deals. so also they're something we feel we can commit to or they are more in the exploratory pace. so we tend to have a pretty good handle on that.
we also have such a large volume of transactions that we get statistically some differentiation or diversity from that, which helps. so we're not overly -- we don't -- we wouldn't necessarily over-read any one signal here. i don't know, joe, do you want to comment on that, add anymore?
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah. i mean, first, i would just remind that we still have a record backlog, right? and so in terms of what's driving our demand for the next quarters. that is still a very dominant force. for visibility to new orders, one good thing about the pandemic is that it has driven our customers to be much more forthcoming with their expectations of their business.
we now have much better visibility than we had before with some customers giving us up to a year's worth of at least visibility, in some cases even orders. so that's -- whether that will relax again a little bit as supply becomes more available, we'll see. but at the moment, we're enjoying much better visibility quarters ahead in many cases.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
and i'd say the bookings velocity has remained pretty stable this year. so very strong. we haven't seen evidence of a recession or predict a slowdown.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yes.
brian drab -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. thanks. that's all very helpful. and then can i just ask if you could -- and i know this is sensitive because it's a legal issue, but around the settlement.
it's seems like a pretty big deal and it's a very large settlement. and can you make any comments as to what happened there? i guess it's primarily with the related to the scanner product line. and just wondering, if can you comment at all, does that change the competitive dynamics going forward for that product line?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
so first, you're right. we can't say very much on that. it's a confidential agreement. but we did settle a number of competing lawsuits with honeywell regarding alleged patent infringement.
we agreed to pay $360 million, paid over eight quarterly installments, started in q2 of this year, so last quarter. and going forward, we have a royalty-free -- both of us enjoy a royalty-free cross license. that means there's no future impact or payments. and as you should just remember then from the slice of the payments here that this is reflecting to the relative size of our business.
we are that much bigger and our market share is that much larger. so that has a direct impact on that. from a competitive perspective, but -- i don't see that having an impact. we feel very, very good about our portfolio, competitive positioning, and our innovation.
our customers certainly resonate with our vision and our direction. so we feel good about where we are.
operator
the next question is from paul chang of j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
paul chang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. so just on your ebitda guide, it's at the low end guide, though. your free cash flow kind of adjusting for the settlement was unchanged.
so if you could talk about the execution on free cash flow and kind of your expectations of how working cap levels kind of trend as we move into '23.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. so if you look at our free cash flow, again the -- for the first half decrease and relative to what we expect in the second half was really around the higher use of working capital and the timing of sales. particularly in the second quarter, with the china lockdown, i mean, june was one of our -- i think our highest revenue quarters in history, just given the delay of getting products out of china and to ship. and that, obviously, has a drag on from a collections timing.
we expect that to normalize as we go into the second half of the year. so that's -- that'll be a big driver of the increase in cash flow as we go to the second half of the year. and i'd say, overall, we target 100% free cash flow conversion over a cycle. we've been over 100% the last several years.
if you go back to 2020, over 130. last year, over 100. this year, if you normalize for the settlement, around 80%. so i think again, we'd expect next year to recover back closer to that 100% range as that's what we target.
but obviously, you can't stay above 100% forever. so this is a little bit of a year of catching up for the outperformance the past couple of years.
paul chang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
gotcha. and then another question on guidance for both q3 in the year. can you help us kind of understand the gross margin versus kind of opex dynamic? should we expect kind of a more modest progression here from 2q on gross margins? you mentioned some lapping of high freight costs from q4 of last year, but you have some fx impact here. so how do we think about gross margins for the year? is it down maybe 100 basis points for the full year then opex pace, maybe similar to the last quarter? i think you said flat.
was that quarter on quarter? thank you.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yes. i'd say, if you look at it from a gross margin perspective, i think -- actually look at total q3, both gross margin and opex from a scaling and rate perspective will be similar to q2. and thus, similar in terms of ebitda rate of around 22%. and as we go into the fourth quarter, you'd expect both to improve as the -- as we're able to lower some of the supply chain costs.
that'll be a improvement on gross margin. and then we'll get some nice opex scaling as we head to the fourth quarter as we expect costs to remain -- relatively opex to remain relatively flat from a dollar perspective as we go through the second half of the year. so would be some of the dynamics as we play through the third and fourth quarter.
operator
the next question is from keith housum of northcoast research. please go ahead.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning, guys. i was hoping to unpack your third quarter guidance with more of a 2% to 4%. i think, nathan, you referenced that you guys were limiting growth to that, so you guys can move more toward the ocean freight. i guess how much of the of that movement actually is impacting your guidance there in terms of your top-line guidance?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
keith, if you look again, just -- we said q3, 2% to 4% -- again, we said we're entering the quarter with a strong backlog bookings. it's around 4% organic growth. so nice results considering the loss of russia, about one or two points as well as a strong prior year compare for q3. and again, the actions we're taking are really around late in the quarter to avoid some of the premium air costs that are sometimes necessary to get product over and delivered before the end of the quarter, as well as the shift in moving print to ocean.
so obviously that takes a few extra weeks from a timing perspective. so this is really around what will be delivered late in september versus into october. and we think that's the right trade-off for the business long term as at some point you have to rebuild that funnel. and that value and benefit will, obviously, impact q4 and be a big driver as we head into next year as well.
so tough to quantify what that is. and we're still working those plans out here over the next month in terms of exactly how much we anticipate to get on to the ocean. but again, that's what we're really limiting that sales growth to push some of that volume to the fourth quarter to take advantage of the lower freight costs.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
we do have the -- we have the order coverage for this. this is more looking at supply chain and optimizing our cost profile.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. so are you saying then, anders, that it's not impacting? your growth would have been higher in the third quarter for your guide if not for this move -- or this does impact the growth.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
that's right. that's right. yeah, it's a conscious decision to limit q3 growth in order to improve the cost profiles of going to the fourth quarter. it's also a driver for why you see the relative strength of q4 versus q3 and a top-line growth.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
right. so with the entire move to the ocean be complete then by the end of the third quarter.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
no. i think by the end of the fourth quarter. it'll be building the pipeline in the third quarter so that as we go into next year, we're in a healthy position.
operator
the next question is from jim ricchiuti of needham and company. please go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
hi. thank you. i know it's early days with the matrox acquisition, but i wonder how you would characterize the progress you're making in the machine vision market. and that tends to be -- industrial machine vision tends to be a little bit more sensitive to economic cycles.
and i wonder how you're viewing the demand trends in that part of the business. thank you.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
now, we closed on matrox in early june. and so we're two months into this, and it helps to create a very comprehensive portfolio of both fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions for us. i'd say we're very encouraged by the first two months. the integration is going well.
the feedback from our customers have been very positive and we are continuing to build out the partner network. i'd say from -- that's a great story really around how the partners we had started to sign up for our fixed industrial scanning portfolio. we see great value of being able to add machine vision to their portfolio so they can address many more of the opportunities they see from customers with our solutions. and equally from matrox perspective that they would have the same opportunity to add fixed industrial scanning to their fixed industrial machine vision portfolio.
so i feel very good about where we are and i think the culture had -- are meshing very well. and joe, any further?
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah, i would i would perhaps add the following sort of from the outlook perspective. matrox is very focused on the manufacturing sector and has a good strength there. and we complement them very well because we are now able to introduce them to customers in the tnl sector in particular. and the cyclicality of those two is again different and therefore, provides us with some opportunity to continue growth through diversification between the two companies.
so that's a strength we're building on.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
and it's also matrox has similarly a strong backlog as we have on the on a relative basis, of course.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
thank you. just a follow-up question on rfid, which you called out and have been calling out is strong over the last several quarters. i know you don't break out the size of that business. it straddles both areas of the -- both parts of the business.
but in general, can you give us, i wonder, a growth rate for that business? and are you seeing the profile change in terms of the types of applications?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, rfid has -- we've had -- seen great momentum around rfid for several years now with a little pause in q2 2020, i think, when we couldn't really go in and do work directly with customers, but it's been a very strong part of our portfolio and market. we -- growth has been double digits and solidly in the double digits for us for quite a while. and so it's still a relatively small part of our portfolio, but it is a growing part of it. you've seen some large companies publicly announced plans around rfid, just like walmart and ups, which is helping to drive greater momentum also around it.
so retail has been the primary or the first vertical to really deploy rfid around inventory visibility, some around the checkout area as well. so -- but we are seeing rfid expand into healthcare, transportation, logistics, manufacturing, and also globally. it's not a -- this is not a u.s. phenomenon.
so this is something we're seeing across the world. and joe, any more color?
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
i think you've covered all of the areas.
operator
the next question is from rob mason of baird. please go ahead.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes. good morning. just one quick question on matrox. the -- in the reference around full year ebitda margins and how you're guiding there, you did reference fx, but as well as the recent matrox acquisition.
how long should we think about that matrox acquisition being a headwind on ebitda margin? to the extent that's the case, should we start to see that not be so as we move into next year? is it -- you're going to continue to invest there?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yes, so i think if you look at the guidance for the second half, matrox accretive to our overall ebitda margins. so that's -- but it was more than offset with the impact of fx just given the relative size of impact. so it's not a headwind from an ebitda rated, but it's neutral from an eps perspective, particularly with -- as we -- until we pay down the debt from a debt cost. so -- but from an ebitda guide, it was partially accretive from the last outlook, but again that was more than offset with the headwind from fx.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
ok. ok. thanks for clarifying that. the -- and then just -- i'll stay on maybe the cost side.
just as the logistics or the premium logistics costs come down, it looks like they will continue to trend down into the fourth quarter. and again, as you maybe referenced, realigning your print transportation mode, should we expect that those logistics costs would continue to decline into 2023, as -- just based on what you're seeing right now, nathan?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yes. i think if you look at the -- if we break into three components, one of those is -- one of the things we can control, which is limiting the amount of buy we do on the spot market as we work with our direct suppliers. and that's one of the benefits you saw from q1 to q2 in the second half. so that, we will expect to continue to decline.
moving print to ocean, again, is another thing that we can control that we'd expect to improve. i'd say we're not expecting at least anytime in the near future the kind of the underlying rate or cost per kilo to improve. i don't think you'd see a -- until there's a significant increase in -- global air capacity, will you see that rate improve? and that's part of the reason we did the price increase in july was to begin to offset that with the pricing increase. so that's the other benefit driving some of the margin as we get into q3 and q4 is the overlays of the pricing action.
so again, two of the three variables we can control and expect to continue to improve. the one around kind of that underlying air rate. i don't expect to see a material improvement in that until you see something change in capacity. and that's the reason for the price increase on our side.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
very good. thank you.
operator
the next question is from damian karas of ubs. please go ahead.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone. just want to ask a follow up on the changes to how you ship product because, nathan, i know you've mentioned in the past how for your business increasing passenger travel was a key to getting that improved cost and margin profile. and it does seem consumer travel is picking up a bit.
so just curious, this decision around the ocean shipment is -- would you be that's more transient kind of a tactical change or are you really making a more permanent structural change to the business?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
the move of our -- moving our printing -- you can think the large tabletop desktop printer to ocean, that's how we've historically shipped it before the third quarter of last year. so 80%, 90% of that we shipped on ocean just given its relative weight. so irregardless of the rates, it's cheaper to put on ocean versus air, given the size and density of those products. the rest of the portfolio has always primarily been shipped on air -- via air.
and so that's again where those air rates play a part. so if the -- i'd say we're going back to our normal modes of normal modes of transportation with this shift here as we go to the second half of the year.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
just one more comment than that. the reason we started putting 3d printers on air was basically the long lead times. so that was to make sure we could prioritize meeting customer expectations, customer demand. but the intent was always to move it back to ocean as soon as supply chain constraints started to ease up a bit.
and on the air capacity so certainly in, say, in the u.s. and i think part of europe, you're seeing passenger travel increase. in and out of china, i don't think we've seen a big increase and that's where the biggest bottleneck is but we do hear that say hong kong is looking to add more air capacity. so there will be a slight benefit to us.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
got it. got it. and just to clarify, so you haven't taken any further pricing actions or plan to take any further pricing actions is still kind of the three rounds of increases that you previously spoke to?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
that's right. the last one just went into effect at the beginning of this month. and again, we'll continue to monitor if any are additional necessary. and joe, if you want to --
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
i was just saying it was last month, beginning of july.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
beginning of july, excuse me. beginning of july.
operator
this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to mr. gustafsson for closing remarks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
it's a wrap up. i would just like to thank our employees and partners for their extraordinary efforts to serve customers and deliver better-than-expected q2 results. we continue to focus on prioritizing our customers mission-critical needs and scaling our vibrant expansion markets. and we would also like to wish a warm welcome to the matrox imaging team.
thank you, everyone.

good day and welcome to the second quarter 2022 zebra technologies earnings conference call. all participants will be in listen-only mode. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. please note, this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to mike steele, vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
mike steele -- vice president, investor relations
good morning and welcome to zebra's second quarter conference call. this presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our sec filings.
during this call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures as we describe our business performance. you can find reconciliations at the end of this slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year over year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. this presentation will include prepared remarks from anders gustafsson, our chief executive officer; and nathan winters, our chief financial officer.
anders will begin with our second quarter results. then nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our revised 2022 outlook. anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision. following the prepared remarks, joe heel, our chief revenue officer, will join us as we take your questions.
now let's turn to slide 4 as i hand it over to anders. 
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. our team delivered solid second quarter results in a challenging macro environment. for the quarter, we realized sales growth of nearly 7% and adjusted ebitda margin of 21.9%, a 170-basis-point decrease, and non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $4.61 a 1% increase from the prior year.
customer demand remains strong for our solutions, which digitize and automate workflows. we realized double-digit sales growth in emea, asia pacific, and latin america, and a slight decline in north america on strong prior year comparisons. we realized growth across all major offerings, including printing, where we recovered at nicely from a challenging q1. our healthcare, manufacturing, and retail and e-commerce end markets each grew faster than the corporate average.
our team successfully navigated the china covid lockdowns, and our actions to redesign certain products and secure long-term purchase agreements enabled us to generate more supply, particularly for printers. we also scaled adjusted operating expenses to drive profitability while continuing to prudently invest in our growth initiatives. overall, we are pleased that our second quarter sales performance was near the high end of our expectations and eps exceeded our guidance range as our team executed well on our efforts to mitigate supply chain challenges. with that, i will now turn the call over to nathan to review our q2 financial results in more detail and discuss our revised 2022 outlook.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, anders. let's start with the p&l on slide 6. in q2, adjusted net sales increased 6.4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and 6.9% on an organic basis as we secured a greater supply of certain products than we had anticipated. our asset intelligence and tracking segment, including printing and supplies, increased 9.7%, driven by a strong recovery in printing as we secured critical components to better satisfy record levels of customer demand.
enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales increased 5.6%, with solid growth in both data capture and mobile computing solutions. we realized particularly strong growth in rfid solutions as well as ruggedized tablets in q2. we also continue to drive solid growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and attractive software offerings. we realized strong growth in three of our four regions.
emea sales increased 17%, driven by particularly strong growth in mobile computing and printing, inclusive of the impact of exiting russia in march. asia pacific sales grew 14%, with particular strength in india. latin america sales increased 16% with exceptional growth in mexico. and in north america, sales decreased 2% due to supply constraints.
we also cycled particularly strong mobile computing sales volumes in q2 of last year. adjusted gross margin declined 200 basis points to 46% due to higher premium supply chain costs and china import tariff recovery in the prior year period, partially offset by higher service and software margin. adjusted operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 60 basis points. second quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 21.9%, a 170-basis-point decrease from the prior year period.
non-gaap earnings per diluted share was $4.61, 0.9% year-over-year increase, helped by lower share count and lower taxes. note that in the quarter we entered into a settlement agreement resulting in a $372 million one time non-gaap charge, which will be paid out over eight quarterly installments. turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide 7. for the first half of 2022, we generated $123 million of free cash flow, which is lower than the last year, primarily due to a higher use of working capital as sales volumes shifted to later in the period due to the china lockdowns; higher incentive compensation payments, given our exceptional 2021 performance; and the initial $45 million quarterly installment payment related to the settlement i just mentioned.
from a balance sheet perspective. as previously announced, we have significantly increased our available borrowing capacity to align with our growing business to optimize our capital structure. our new credit facility provides us ample flexibility for organic and inorganic investment, including the recent acquisition of matrox imaging, as well as share repurchases through our recently announced $1 billion incremental authorization. we made $300 million of share repurchases in q2.
and from a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter at a comfortable 1.7 times net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio. on slide 8, we highlight the premium supply chain costs have sequentially improved from peak levels. our team has been successfully working all avenues, including product redesigns and negotiating long-term supply agreements for critical components, which has enabled us to reduce our purchases in the spot market. we've been seeing steady improvement in the supply chain environment, which we continue to closely monitor.
in q2, we incurred incremental premiums, supply chain costs of $56 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, which was favorable to what we had anticipated in our prior outlook. in total, q2, transitory items had a combined unfavorable gross margin impact of $35 million year over year and in q3 are expected to be approximately $45 million, which is a neutral year-on-year impact net of pricing. let's now turn to our outlook. we entered the second half of the year with a strong order backlog and healthy sales pipeline supported by broad-based demand for our solutions.
we have been experiencing a steady improvement in manufacturing output. however, our sales growth continues to be limited by extended lead times and availability of certain component parts. our organic growth has also been impacted by approximately 1 to 2 points after stopping shipments to russia in march. for q3, we are limiting our sales growth to a range of 2% to 4% due to actions to reduce expedited airfreight costs and shift our printer products to ocean shipments, which will improve both q4 growth and profitability.
we are also assuming a two point additive impact from recently acquired businesses and a three point negative impact from foreign currency translation. as a reminder, approximately 25% of our global sales are denominated in euros. we anticipate q3 adjusted ebitda margin to be approximately 22%, which is an increase from both prior year and prior quarter. non-gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.65.
for the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our outlook with a sales growth range between 4% and 6% inclusive of the impact of exiting russia. we are also assuming a 150-basis-point additive impact from recently acquired businesses and a 225-basis-point negative impact from foreign currency translation. we now anticipate full year 2022 adjusted ebitda margin of approximately 22%, the low end of our prior guide, primarily due to the significantly stronger u.s. dollar.
profit margins are expected to improve in the second half of the year as we continue to shift to lower cost freight options and prudently manage operating expenses and investments. we now expect our free cash flow to be at least $650 million for the year, which we have reduced primarily due to the approximately $150 million of settlement-related payments. please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide 9. with that, i will turn the call back to anders to discuss how we are advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, nathan. we are entering the second half of the year in a position of strength as we closely monitor the volatile global macro environment. we have a track record of protecting profitability and cash flow in any environment while preserving investments that drive sustainable, profitable growth. i am encouraged by the continued strong demand we are seeing across our business and the bold actions our teams are taking to mitigate the supply chain impacts.
slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the frontline of business by leveraging our industry leading portfolio of products, software, and services. by transforming workflows with our proven solutions, zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, which have been magnified since the pandemic. as we have extended our lead in the industry and expanded our portfolio with compelling solutions, we have elevated our strategic position with our customers. our trusted relationships with our 10,000-plus partners across the globe augment our capabilities, enabling us to serve more customers worldwide.
and we are always excited to engage with partners to drive the value. we are excited about our new global strategic alliance with accenture, which focuses on solving complex operational challenges in retail and other end markets with zebra solutions. we are collaborating to advance our customers strategies to drive productivity, inventory accuracy, and customer service levels among a variety of other benefits that can be realized by digitizing and automating workflows throughout the enterprise. now turning to slide 12.
businesses partner with zebra to help optimize their end to end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of consumers. i would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets. a major global transportation and logistics company is expanding its relationship with zebra across multiple product lines to ensure a more accurate package loading using rfid technology across many sites. zebra's rfid printers and scanners are integral to flagging packages loaded into the wrong truck in real time using rfid technology before the vehicle leaves the location.
zebra also supplied more than 3,000 tablets to assist associates in moving trailers around the yard, ensuring the most efficient placement of trucks, trailers, and packages. a large supermarket operator in europe will more than double its fleet of zebra enterprise mobile computers in a multi-year rollout, covering warehouse front and back of store, and curbside pickup use cases displacing consumers cellphones. the customer expects improved productivity benefits through better product availability, faster execution on click-and-collect use cases, and real time price checking as they drive toward a zero food waste goal. this expansion win results from the exceptional service and trust established over our long-standing relationship and throughout the rfp process.
in another recent win, a major u.s. convenience store chain added additional mobile computers in each of its more than 2,000 stores to augment its inventory management and merchandizing use cases. this customer has a deep penetration of zebra solutions, including our printers, mobile computers, and scanners to digitize and automate its workflows. several years ago, this customer had implemented other zebra solutions in its warehouses and has subsequently selected zebra for additional use cases as it addressed other business challenges.
additionally, a significant u.s. healthcare product distributor expanded their use of zebra solutions, equipping their warehouse staff with wrist and ring scanners to improve efficiency in their pick-and-pack use cases for their warehouse associates. zebra collaborated with a customer and a partner to ensure ease of porting of their applications through the android operating system. we're also very pleased to be making progress in our most recent expansion markets, fixed industrial scanning, machine vision, and autonomous mobile robots.
we closed on the purchase of matrox imaging in early june, and we joined them at the automated warehouse trade show in detroit. we are excited to add matrox imaging's leading a comprehensive portfolio of machine vision solutions, along with many specialized channel partners to help us scale our combined business. at automate, we also highlighted our fetch autonomous mobile robot fulfillment solution, which we have been deploying at third-party logistics provider rakuten, and we are excited about another recent key win with maersk, an integrated logistics company. additionally, fetch amr campaigns a material movement solutions continue strong traction in use cases for healthcare, supply delivery, automotive, spare parts campaigns, and waste removal.
in closing, our actions have enabled us to begin to recover from industrywide supply chain challenges, and we continue to be very excited about our growth prospects as we monitor the volatile macro environment. the global labor deficit and supply chain challenges have escalated the need for enterprises to digitize and automate their operations. with our solutions, we have the broadest portfolio of tailored solutions to help our customers advance their strategies. now i will hand the call back over to mike.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from tommy moll with stephens. you may now go ahead.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
morning, tommy.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
anders, i wanted to start on the comments you made regarding some deferred projects from large north american customers. any context you can share there on end-market type of project visibility to picking back up on some of this work going forward would be much appreciated. and as a related point, would you say that these projects are all the majority of or a smaller part of the demand softening that you called out late q3? i'm sure it's part of what you described there with the softening, but order of magnitude would be helpful. thank you.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. first, i'd say the -- we're getting some mixed signals from the market on on-demand pictures and that's, to some degree, clouded by the supply chain challenges we're seeing. but most signals -- most demand signals we are seeing are constructive. our backlog is healthy.
our pipeline is building nicely. the -- our run rate business is strong and we continue to see some nice areas of strength in each region. and our retail vertical grew even though we had a very large customer pulling back into this year and particularly the quarter. but we have also seen some elongated sales cycles and a bit of softening in demand where some customers have pushed out some orders from q3 into 2023.
so the -- i think most -- i'll ask joe for some extra color here also, as most of those push outs have come from the retail segment. that's also our largest segment, so it wouldn't be surprising and they tend to have more of the year end spend that they're working on. so the overall environment is still quite healthy, but we have seen some selective push-outs. joe?
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah. to put it in perspective, perhaps in terms of the miss to the outlook, the deferral of project was a minor contributor to that. among these, the deferral of projects, these late in the quarter deferments were a relatively small number of larger projects that, as anders said, deferred primarily into 2023. that's probably as much as we can say.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you. as a follow up, i wanted to pivot to supply chain. and you gave us quite a bit there on the north american distribution center transition.
can you give us anymore? just on the ground context in terms of the transition that's underway, some of the changes that you've made as a consequence of some of the challenges that you called out. and then i think, anders, i heard you reference that there have been some personnel changes on this front. anything you could highlight there would also be helpful. thank you.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
tommy, this is nathan. i'll start with the first part. just giving you a little bit of background, we selected a new d.c. location midway through last year.
and as we said through the call, we had some issues with the transition impacting shipment volumes late in the quarter. and we've implemented corrective actions in particular on ramping back our texas facility that give us some additional time to work through the transition both from a people and process perspective. so again, i'd say although we didn't deliver the shipment volumes necessary to meet the q3 forecasts, we are now operating at levels required to deliver q4, still not where we want to be. but again, the texas facility is nearly staff to full capacity and we've had a really nice recovery here in deliveries in october.
just as context, we've shipped out nearly $200 million more in october than we did in the month of july, which is giving us both confidence in the performance of the d.c., as well as confidence in the q4 guidance. pass over to anders.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, from an organization perspective, we have made some changes. we have promoted a new supply chain leader, who leads our global operations and supply chain team. so -- and we have also streamlined organization a bit and moved some functions or responsibilities out of our supply chain to other areas to make sure we can get greater focus and better accountability around those. we've also worked closely with our supply chain partners to make sure we take some actions with them to help improve the operations.
one that nathan talked about was ramping up our dallas fort worth facilities. so they're back at the close to full capacity. they're almost fully staffed and operating very well at the moment. and we're working with our chicago area, d.c.
partner also to see how we can best help them scale their operations there.
operator
our next question will come from andrew buscaglia with berenberg. you may now go ahead.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
morning.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
so just trying to get a sense of how much of this sales change that that you've seen is related to, like, i guess, the nature of the deferrals and the confidence that you're going to get these orders in 2023. and i guess, i'm going to phrase it another way, how much of this is kind of the beginning of a more to come? or based on the visibility you have with these customers, do you have confidence this is like a short-term issue?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, it's -- i don't think we want to get into too much of 2023 outlook yet. but i think these have been more select customers. there's not a broad-based, say, pushout or deferrals. it's much more select on certain customers.
and some tougher -- predicting q3, we also have some very difficult comp from two large customers that were particularly strong in the third quarter. but as i said, most of our demand signals are still the very strong and encouraging and we see -- and it's been -- this was really very narrowly focused in north america.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
i'll add two things, perhaps for perspective. one is an example of what we're seeing is a large customer who will take an order that they would have perhaps placed in q3 or early in q4 and now telling us we're going to split that order and we're going to take 80% of it now and 20% of it later in 2023. that's an example of the type of thing we're getting. so it feels like there's real demand behind the order.
the other thing that we're hearing from customers quite consistently is while some customers in particular retailers, are being cautious about their business, about their revenue expectations, and those are obviously visible to you in what they say on their earnings calls. they are telling us that their investments in i.t. and in the types of solutions that we provide them are important to them even in more uncertain times because they need to improve their productivity and we help them do that with our solutions. so that's certainly something i hear pretty consistently.
andrew buscaglia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and you talked about last quarter and i guess this quarter, again, being able to ship by -- mostly by ocean exiting q4. i guess where do you stand with that? and then and then it's tailwind wise into '23, i know you don't want to give guidance for next year, but like what how do you expect the cost environment to shape up for next year? and hopefully, maybe do you think that offset some of this volatility around the sales you'll see over the next six months or so?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yes. so, andrew, maybe just context for the broader premium supply chain costs, i think what we saw in q3 was a positive momentum, a 50% reduction from what we experienced in q2, decreasing from nearly 4% of revenue to just over 2%. that was primarily driven by the declining shipping cost per kilo, which we're experiencing, as well as benefiting from the pricing actions beginning to take effect with the price increase we did in july. q3 shipping cost did come in below estimate.
we also benefited, if you look at the mix, in the $30 million for the quarter from lower north american revenue. and that's the reason for it ticking back up in the fourth quarter in terms of overall transitory. and our q4 guide assumes no improvement in freight rates. so that's something we're continuing to monitor.
but if you look at the overall reduction from 200 million to 190 million in premium supply chain costs. some of that is volume driven just over half, but also 4 million of that or so was due to the lower rates we're experiencing. and i think our expectation is that we will see steady reduction into 2023 around these costs as long as the freight rates hold where they're at today. and we're going to continue the transition from air to ocean really late here in the fourth quarter.
we did some ocean shipments into europe in the third quarter, but we really don't expect ocean shipments to pick up until late here in the fourth quarter and into 2023. and we've also seen a nice reduction in what we've had to buy in critical components on the spot market. so we're starting to see that loosen up as well. so again, we feel confident that we'll see a steady decrease and ebitda benefit as we go into next year.

our next question will come from jim ricchiuti with needham and company. you may now go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
hi. thank you. first question just again, on the on the deferral that you're seeing among a few of these north american customers. when you talk about it, some of this business slipping into 2023, is there a presumption that this would be slipping further into '23 into the second half, just given the seasonal investments that these types of customers may make?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i think it's -- probably don't want to give too much color on that also at this stage, but the expectation is they won't -- they're slipping from this year into the beginning of next year, not the end of next year.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
i would i would agree with that, yeah.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and, anders, i wonder if you could talk to what you're seeing in the smb market. it sounds like you're seeing relatively good demand there.
i don't want to put words in your mouth, but if you could comment on that. and also in an economic cycle, which part of the business would you see impacted more immediately, the larger customer business or the smb business?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yep. starting with smb business, we did see strong growth globally for our small and medium-sized customers. i think that's a good indication of kind of the confidence the broader market has in the outlook and the value that our solutions offer. the secular trends that we talked about to digitize and automate workflows and to empower the frontline workers are, i would say, much more important today in a labor-constrained environment as that drives a greater increase for our type of solutions across all verticals and all sizes of customers.
and i think the -- our run rate business performed particularly well globally this quarter, which i think is -- gives us confidence around the health of the business. if you talk about kind of which verticals would be more or less impacted, i'd say we probably get the -- gotten the most questions around a retail customer base historically in this. and here, i mentioned earlier, our retail and e-commerce business grew in q3 despite very challenging comps from a very large, particularly large retailer that has been pulling back. and i think that highlights the value of having a very diversified retail e-commerce customer base where the timing of the refresh cycles is spread out and that helps to reduce volatility risks.
but i think the -- in retail specifically, the focus on -- or the importance of our type of solutions to enable our customers to execute on their omnichannel and e-commerce strategies is very important. i've talked about how we believe that our solutions are now more like, say, an erp implementation. it's harder to dial them up and down. and i think the results from q3 indicate -- give some credence to that expectation.
i'd say our healthcare business, which performed very well in q2 -- in q3, sorry, was up double digits. that is probably the vertical we expect to be the least sensitive to kind of recessionary forces. and here, we're also very, very focused on helping to transform that industry to be able to improve the patient journey and drive greater productivity for healthcare providers. the p&l vertical is -- that was one the hardest hit.
it was the only vertical that was down for us in q3. but e-commerce volumes are expected to continue to to increase and that drives a greater need for real time visibility into their overall supply chain. and it's a key driver for customer investments. and we enabled the last mile fulfillment for those customers, which is an important factor as consumers are expecting faster and faster deliveries.
and lastly, around manufacturing. that also tends to be -- it's a market that is more, say, largest in asia for us, but it is global and it's done very well for us over the last year or so and had good double-digit growth this quarter. here we've we've made some in both the some of the new acquisitions around from matrox and fetch are expanding our offering and we're getting a lot of interest and early orders from manufacturing those areas and we have also made some quite significant and very deliberate investments in our go-to-market resources to help to grow our share in manufacturing. and joe can provide some more color on that.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah, maybe i'll just amplify some of anders' points. number one, the growth in the medium-sized customers and also the run rate has been particularly encouraging for us because that's where our supply constraints are particularly important. right? if you have supply, you get run rate. when we had supply return, our run rate rebounded.
and that was a really good sign of the resilience of our run rate. that's very encouraging for us. you asked about which size of customer goes into the cycle first. and what we saw is that as we entered into the pandemic, the largest customers were the first to accelerate their purchases and they were followed nine, 12 months later by medium-sized and smaller customers then also accelerating their purchases.
now, as we're seeing some caution in the market, it's again, the largest customers that are being cautious first. some of the deferrals that we've referred to and that you asked about were larger customers with large orders, while the medium-sized and small customers continue to go very strong with even double-digit growth. so that's the dynamic that we're seeing in the cycle. hopefully that's helpful.
operator
our next question will come from erik lapinski with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
erik lapinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, team. thanks. if i could go back to kind of the commentary on the run business you just made, i guess just trying to get a better sense on the strength there. do you think that's an element of customers being further behind on investments versus larger customers then? and then maybe also on that point, like when we think about deferrals from the larger customers, is that related to a refresh or a new device deployment? any kind of color you can give us that would be helpful.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, first on the strength of the run rate business here. i think that the -- i would say we don't see our customers large or small having, say, pulled forward demand and invested ahead of their capacity utilization curve with probably one exception, one large exception. so and specifically for our large -- for our small and mid-sized customers, they tend not to have the kind of financial capacity to invest for in an advance. so that tend to be much more as their project roll outs to address more urgent business needs for them.
so that will be one point of that. and i think -- joe?
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah. when it comes to the run rate, it really matters what's on the shelf. right? you have small customers that are calling in to distributor and what's on the shelf count. and once we had product on the shelf, again, as our supply chain ramped up again over the course of the quarter, we saw that run rate rebounding.
so i think that's the dynamic that there's no pull forward or that dynamic doesn't exist to that same extent in the run rate. when it comes to the larger customers, to the deferrals, we are talking about large customers that are typically doing deployments of mobile computers. you see it's pretty concentrated in the mobile computing segment. you have certain deployments that they have been planning and in some cases, but again, they were very few and they were a minor reason for the miss in the quarter.
but in those few cases, we're talking about deployments of mobile computers, which are stretched out over a slightly longer time period, we think, into the first quarter of next year.
erik lapinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. ok. that's really helpful. thank you.
and then maybe just another one on kind of some of your opex flexibility. you did take down kind of expenses in the quarter and proved to be pretty nimble there. i guess just like where did you find those efficiencies in context of maybe some of the supply chain changes you're making? and how should we think about your ability to control opex in future quarters kind of sensitive to revenue?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yes, there's a couple of drivers behind the opex flexibility. i mean, the first is based on our variable cost structure. there's an element of variability in there relative to how we're performing for the year. the other one is we did a hard look at where we're hiring and what roles and what positions around the world to ensure that where we're adding heads and investing is in our growth areas that that we would kind of look at and say there's no regrets in that in terms of those hiring.
so it's a combination of those two along with again, continuing looking at discretionary spending where it makes sense. i think those are the three main drivers here in the short term. and as we go into next year we're continuing to look at where we can drive efficiencies, looking at our real estate portfolio. but all the things you would expect us to do, particularly as we go into a more challenging macro environment.
operator
our next question will come from damian karas with ubs. you may now go ahead.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
morning.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
good morning.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
morning. morning. not to beat a dead horse here on the project deferrals, but could you just clarify, one, you haven't seen any order cancellations? and two, just thinking about these customers that have pushed out orders, it sounds like you do have visibility in terms of timing of delivery in 2023. and it's not that the conversations have been, hey, let's just put this on pause until later determined date.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. so first on the cancellation, we have not seen any large order cancellations. i think the cancellations have been very modest. and to the extent we've had any, and -- within what we would consider to be normal.
every quarter we have some people who cancel an order or something like that, but it's been a factor in the results or in the outlook here. and the deferrals have -- they have -- they're not paused, they're just deferred. so they're we expecting them to come back in the first part of next year. and the -- it's not like -- they are deploying in the meantime, not just at the same pace as they had otherwise expected.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah, but there are some indications, damian, that give us confidence that the deployment will occur. one of them is that they're taking an order and splitting it into two, right, as i described to you. the other is that they're already working with us on deployment plans. we do see those stop signs, not in every case, but in the majority of cases.
so that's why we're describing it as we are.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
ok. got it. that's really helpful. and then, nathan, i think you suggested earlier that the ocean freight transition is happening late this year.
correct me if i'm wrong, i thought that was supposed to kind of play out in the third quarter. so is there any sort of delay there or am i missing something?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
so that's -- this was per our plan. we expected in q3 to start the modest shipments into europe, which we did from an ocean perspective. but the plan in the guide around our premium costs had always assumed we wouldn't really feel any financial benefit to the move until we get into next year, as the priority for this year was to ensure we've delivered enough printer volume to take care of our backlog as well as ensure we had the right products on the shelf to support our run rate business.
operator
our next question will come from brian drab with william blair. you may now go ahead.
brian drab -- william blair and company -- analyst
morning. i think most of the details come out here already. but i'm just wondering if you could give us a more specific update maybe on how matrox and fetch have been performing relative to your expectations? and again, in this difficult environment, i know matrox came in about a hundred million revenue run rate and fetch about 10 million. i don't know if you could update those numbers, directionally even.
thanks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
we closed matrox in early june and certainly very pleased with how it -- how that's going. it creates a very comprehensive portfolio, both fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions for us as it kind of fills out our offering very nicely. i'd say we're very encouraged by progress. matrox is performing very well and the integration is proceeding as per our plans.
i think there's a very good culture fit between our organizations. we are also building out our partners. and that's going well. these are very specialized partners who provide these types of implementation and design services.
and we've been seeing good traction and being able to recruit those partners to our program. so we're certainly very excited about what's going on with matrox. and similarly on fetch, i'd say there's a lot of interest from warehouse operators across all our other vertical markets as well as in manufacturing for our fetch robotic solutions. and our ability to really combine the frontline worker -- or the automation or the frontline worker and the fetch robots to automate -- orchestrate and automate the broader workflows has been resonating very well.
and we're seeing -- yes, we're seeing a lot of a lot of interest. and it's obviously a smaller business, but it's ramping quite nicely.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
and maybe a little bit of additional color, with the business being in sort of the early stages of development, what you look for primarily are pilot deployments, right, and we're seeing a very good stream of these pilot deployments. we were also very pleased to have two larger deployments already that we mentioned, i think, in the earlier and the previous earnings call already that are anchor tenants, i guess now for our fetch robotics business going forward.
brian drab -- william blair and company -- analyst
great. and then i guess just as a follow up, when you think about matrox and some of the incumbents in that space, what have you found has been successful for you in going up against some of these incumbents and bidding on projects? what differentiates matrox from a company like cognex and others in the industry?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah. first, i'd say that we don't see this as a zero sum game. there's a lot of white space for us to go after without having to go up and seek out opportunities where we compete with any specific competitor. there's also a very fragmented market.
i think that the market leader has probably about 20% or no more than 20% market share. so there's plenty, plenty of opportunities to pursue without having to do that. that being said, i think we feel good about the value propositions that we have with matrox. it is known for having a very high quality, high performance solutions that can solve some very complicated problems for our customers.
we have worked hard on -- across our fixed industrial scanning machine vision portfolio to drive ease of use as a differentiator to make it as easy for our customers to deploy and get time to revenue for these solutions. and that's been, i think, resonating very well. also, the software upgradeability of our products is a differentiator and we've had some very nice wins against a variety of different competitors with some large marquee customers. so we feel quite excited about it.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
one other strength, brian, to add perhaps is this is a business that's conducted predominantly through the channel and we have used our strength in the channel to recruit a strong number of channel partners, many of which are somewhat disillusioned with other incumbents in the market. and that's been a great attraction for people to come to us because they know us as a very good channel partner for them. so that's helped us also.
operator
our next question will come from keith housum with northcoast research. you may now go ahead.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys. how can i understand a little bit more the north american warehouse issue? it looks at the side that north america was down 9%. would you say a vast majority of that decline was due to that north american warehouse issue or what would have the number been without that issue?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
the -- miss to outlook was predominantly explained by the supply chain challenges related to the persistent component shortages for certain products and the disruption in the transition to our new north america warehouse. and there's probably about 45% -- 45 million on each of those. and the smallest part was the deferral of projects was about 10% of the miss to our outlook. so clearly, the supply, the d.c.-ish move was the largest part of this.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
i appreciate that. it sounds like you're going to be forced to operate both the texas facility and the wisconsin facility, i guess, in parallel for the next several quarters. what's the -- what will the impact on profitability this quarter and what do you think it's going to be going forward?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
keith, i would say it's relatively modest in terms of the cost structure we have with both of those facilities in terms of the typical typically pay on a cost per unit with each of the facilities. so it's -- i think it's relatively modest in the -- from an overall profitability of managing both. we had a little bit of extra costs here in the third quarter. we had to ship some products between the facilities to get the inventory right size moving forward.
but now that that's corrected, it's a relatively modest impact on overall profitability to manage both sites.
operator
our next question will come from rob mason with baird. you may not. go ahead.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes, good morning. maybe just to follow up on the last question. when will this north american distribution center transition be complete and i guess consolidated into one facility?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
so we don't -- we do not have a timeframe lined up of when we'll completely exit. we've signed an agreement to stay down in texas for the foreseeable future to ensure that we properly ramp the new facility in the right way and make sure it's -- we fully mitigate any potential risk to the future operations. and so once that's once that's clear and we're in shape, that's when we'll start to work on whether that -- how to complete the transition, but there's no timeline set to date.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
sure. sure. there was also a mention that you will be taking some pricing actions in europe outside the u.s. to address currency.
when will those price actions be realized, will start to show up? and then i'm just curious as well, what was the actual fx impact on your gross margin in the quarter?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah. so if you look at the two latest price increases we announced, they really have no impact until we get into two next year, just based on the timing of the agreements we have with our distributors. and i would say it's relatively modest compared to the previously announced price increases that's focused around latin america business as well as in europe, where we've already made several other pricing actions. so it's modest compared to the three we've done up to this point.
if you look at it from an fx perspective, in the third quarter, it was about a one point negative impact on ebitda margin. and as we go into the fourth quarter, fx has about a two point negative impact year on year on ebitda margin.
operator
our next question will come from paul cheng with j.p. morgan. you may now go ahead.
paul cheng -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. so you mentioned kind of a steady reduction in 2023 on supply chain costs here and nice execution here in the second half. but can that cost move down materially in '23 on a quarterly run rate from that 30 million to 35 million, especially as you move more products to see -- i assume there'll be some lingering costs moving forward.
but just any comments there would be helpful.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yes, i'd say as we look at it going into next year, obviously, we think there's -- just based on the second half run rate, there will be a meaningful improvement from a year-on-year perspective. and i would say at this point, steady is probably the right word in terms of how we're looking at it. and a lot of this has to do with how freight rates hold up. so i think based on what we've seen, they've held steady just slightly down since kind of middle of the second quarter, which is which is really positive.
but at any moment they could swing another way if there's any other type of supply chain shocks in the system. but yeah, we would expect, again, steady improvement from the second half run rate as we go into next year.
paul cheng -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then on inventories, i know there's a lot of moving pieces, but can you give us a sense for kind of timing of more accelerated harvesting? i mean, do you see any risk to kind of discounting or given the elevated levels here, or is this more about converting on some of the larger deferred products? and then as we look to '23, when can we expect to see kind of more normalized free cash flow conversion or is this more of a second half '23 kind of excluding that honeywell payment? thank you.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yeah, so -- maybe just -- i'll start with the second part of that. as we look at our inventory, we'd expect us to draw down through the first half and get to the normalized levels as we enter the second half of next year, which we think is somewhere between 600 million and 650 million of inventory. that's based on the size of the company today, plus the acquisitions as well as intentionally holding more strategic component inventory than we have in the past to improve resiliency. we have a team dedicated and working on this, a big driver of that is finishing, getting the d.c.
move stabilized, and we've also made several moves within our supplies business in terms of a manufacturing, where we've had to build some buffer stock and working through that. and for the product categories or components that that have recovered, we are planning to draw down our safety stock at our manufacturing partners over the next several quarters, and that's really the big driver of where we'll see the reduction in working capital. but as you as you mentioned, we expect all these actions to enable us to significantly reduce working capital and deliver free cash flow conversion above 100% if you exclude the settlement payments. and then to your first question we have no concerns at the inventory levels creating the type of risk from an excess obsolescence perspective.
we have strong demand for what we have in both finished goods as well as component parts. and then there's no intention of reducing pricing beyond what's normally required in the competitive environment. i'd say alternatively, we're pushing that we have stock available for customers who may have been waiting on certainty of supply before placing an order. so using it as an opportunity.
operator
this concludes our question-and-answer session. i'd like to turn the call back over to mr. gustafsson for any closing remarks.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you. so to wrap up, i would like to thank our partners, customers, and employees for their continued support. our top priority is to meet our customer's mission critical needs as we take bold actions to address our supply chain challenges, and we look forward to a strong finish to the year. thank you, everyone.

good day and welcome to the third quarter 2022 zebra technologies earnings conference call. all participants will be in listen-only mode. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i now like to turn the call over to mike steele, vice president of investor relations.
please go ahead.
mike steele -- vice president, investor relations
good morning and welcome to zebra's third quarter conference call. this presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our sec filings.
during this call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures as we describe our business performance. you can find reconciliations at the end of the slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year over year on a constant currency basis and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. this presentation will include prepared remarks from anders gustafsson, our chief executive officer; and nathan winters, our chief financial officer.
anders will begin with our third quarter results. then nathan will provide additional detail on the financials and discuss our fourth quarter outlook. anders will conclude with progress made on advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision. following the prepared remarks, joe heel, our chief revenue officer, will join us as we take your questions.
now let's turn to slide 4, as i hand it over to anders. 
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. for the quarter, we realized a sales decline of 3%, an adjusted ebitda margin of 21.1%, a 60-basis-point decrease, and non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $4.12, a 9% decrease from the prior year. we were unable to fulfill all orders due to supply chain challenges related to persistent component shortages for certain products, as well as disruption in the transition to our new north american distribution center in the chicago area.
these challenges led to lower throughput than planned late in the quarter. this, along with orders from some large customers being deferred, contributed to the lower than expected results. in north america and emea, cycling two prior year large mobile computing app deployments and suspension of sales in russia resulted in the sales declines. our asia pacific and latin america regions were bright spots in the quarter with double-digit sales growth.
globally, we realized sales growth with our small and medium-sized customers, which was more than offset by decline from our large customers. from a solutions offering perspective, we drove growth across data capture, printing supplies, services, and software. these helped to partially offset the sales decline in mobile computing. we expanded gross margin over the prior year despite significant fx pressure, yet ebitda margin contracted and eps declined due to the deleveraging of operating expenses from the sales decline.
we have initiated meaningful actions to address the supply chain challenges, which was the primary driver for our results. these include organizational changes and the reallocation of resources to drive improved focus and execution in our supply chain. initiating specific actions with our supply chain partners to improve operations and extending the planned transition of our north america distribution center to mitigate the execution risk. customer demand and our order pipeline generally remains healthy, yet has slowed since late q3.
given the macroeconomic uncertainty, we see elongated sales cycles and certain projects being deferred. as a result, we are taking a cautious approach to our q4 sales outlook and expense management while working to right size our working capital levels in the coming quarters to improve free cash flow conversion. at the same time, we continue to prudently invest in initiatives that advance our solutions offerings. with that, i will now turn the call over to nathan to review our q3 financial results in more detail and discuss our fourth quarter outlook.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, anders. let's start with the p&l on slide 6. in q3, adjusted net sales declined 4%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions, and down 3.2% on an organic basis, primarily due to supply chain challenges and lower sales to large customers. our asset intelligence and tracking segment increased 12.4%, driven by double-digit growth in both printing and supplies, as product availability has continued to generally improve.
enterprise visibility & mobility segment sales declined 8.8% due to supply chain bottlenecks, including component shortages. we realized particularly strong growth in data capture solutions, including rfid, as well as rugged tablets. we also drove growth across services and software with strong service attach rates and attractive software offerings. performance was mixed across all regions.
asia-pacific sales grew 20% with broad-based strength across the region, including china. latin america, sales increased 10% with exceptional growth in mexico. and in north america and emea, sales decreased 9% and 2%, respectively, due to supply chain challenges, lower sales to large customers, and the suspension of sales in russia. adjusted gross margin increased 80 basis points to 45.8% due to favorable business mix and lower premium supply chain costs, partially offset by unfavorable fx.
adjusted operating expenses increased due to acquisitions and delevered by 60 basis points due to the sales decline. third quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 21.1%, a 60-basis-point decrease from the prior year period due to expense deleveraging and lower sales. non-gaap earnings per diluted share was $4.12, a 9.5% year-over-year decrease. turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide 7.
for the first nine months of 2022, we generated $170 million of free cash flow, which was significantly lower than last year, primarily due to a higher use of working capital due to elevated inventory and sales volume shifting to later in the quarter. higher incentive compensation payments, given our exceptional 2021 performance, and $90 million of previously announced settlement payments. we made $50 million of share repurchases and invested $6 million in venture investments in the third quarter. we ended the quarter at a comfortable 1.7 times net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio and with more than $1.2 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility.
on slide 8, we highlight the premiums supply chain costs have improved from peak levels. the actions we have taken to redesign products, targeted price increases as well as the improving freight capacity, have enabled us to reduce purchases on the spot market and reduce the freight cost impact. we are on plan to move printer shipments to ocean from air late this year and into early 2023. for the full year 2022, we now expect approximately $190 million of premium supply chain costs over pre-pandemic 2019 levels, a $10 million reduction from our prior outlook.
in q3, we incurred premium supply chain costs of $30 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, which is favorable to what we had anticipated in our prior outlook. in total, q3 transitory items had a combined favorable gross margin impact of $14 million year over year, and in q4, are expected to be approximately $35 million, which is a nearly $30 million reduction year on year. let's now turn to our outlook. q4 sales are expected to be approximately flat from the prior year period with a range of negative 2% to one -- to positive 1% growth.
as compared to our prior outlook. the lower sales growth is driven by softening demand, continued supply chain challenges and currency headwinds. we are confident in this guide, given our relatively strong order backlog, improved quarter-to-date shipment activity, and actions taken to stabilize north american distribution. we estimate a two point additive impact from recently acquired businesses and a four point negative impact from foreign currency changes.
as a reminder, approximately 25% of our global sales are denominated in euros. we anticipate q4 adjusted ebitda margin to be between 22% and 23%, which is an increase from both the prior year and the prior quarter. given our tempered view of the demand environment, we are taking a conservative approach to managing operating expenses while preserving strategic growth investments. non-gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.80.
we now expect our free cash flow to be at least $400 million for the year, which we have significantly reduced from our prior outlook due to lower profits and elevated inventory levels that we will be working down into 2023 as we rationalize safety stock and execute on our north american distribution transition. sales seasonality has improved to more normalized levels in q4, which should drive the peak cash flow quarter for 2022. please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide 9. with that, i will turn the call back to anders to discuss how we are advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision with our customers.

thank you, nathan. the long-term fundamental drivers of our business remain strong. slide 11 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry leading portfolio products, software, and services. by transforming workflows with our proven solutions, zebra's customers can effectively address their complex operational challenges, which have been magnified through the pandemic.
this value proposition resonates with customers in any macroeconomic environment as it improves productivity and inventory accuracy among an extensive list of other operational benefits. as we have expanded our portfolio with compelling solutions, we have elevated our strategic position with our customers. our trusted relationships with our partners across the globe augment our capabilities, enabling us to serve more customers worldwide. our new fixed industrial scanning and machine vision solutions resonated well with customers and partners at recent trade shows in stuttgart, germany, and boston, massachusetts.
our booths featured advanced optical character recognition, supported by deep learning capabilities gained through our 2021 adaptive vision acquisition. our comprehensive offering has put us in a strong competitive position. now turning to slide 12. businesses partner with zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet the increasing demands of consumers.
zebra solutions continue to represent a necessary investment, and i would like to highlight several recent key wins across our end markets. a large north american retailer recently selected zebra's tc52 mobile computers for their stable network connection, durability, and camera performance. this customer maximizes value from zebra solutions by combining our mobile computers with our reflexis workforce and task management, zebra prescriptive analytics, and antuit software. this combination enables the retailer to improve inventory accuracy and the omnichannel shopping experience for their customers.
a north american based fast food chain has chosen zebra's handheld rfid solution to enhance inventory management. this solution will enable each restaurant to reap the benefits of a more digitized supply chain by streamlining their process to track and trace inventory from its suppliers to the restaurant. adoption of this technology will assist the customer to comply with the food safety modernization act. a transportation company in europe, has begun rolling out approximately 20,000 mobile tablets to streamline their vehicle rental process.
zebra's exceptional service and integrated product offerings displace the competitor and will enable associates to complete vehicle walkarounds inspections and the reservation process more efficiently. a convenience store chain in latin america is expanding their use of zebra solutions from the distribution center to the front of store with more than 50,000 zebra mobile computers, printers, and tablets. deployment of these zebra solutions is expected to significantly increase productivity, inventory accuracy, and improve shopper satisfaction. zebra's mobility dna software, which enables intuitive device management and our compelling customer value proposition were key differentiators in this competitive win.
apparel manufacturer, bmc, recently selected zebra's autonomous mobile robots and fixed industrial scanners for their new 50,000 square foot north american facility. zebra collaborated with a major partner to develop a solution that will enable a flexible workflow and enhance visibility along each step of the production line. by combining our autonomous mobile robots and fixed industrial scanners, bmc will realize powerful synergies with scanners tracking each step of production and directing the robots along the workflow. the robots streamline associate's movements, enabling faster fulfillment.
this flexible and scalable solution was preferred to a traditional fixed conveyance system because it saves vital warehouse space and adjusts to demand. additionally, we recently secured a large win with a major european retailer, who selected zebra's fixed industrial scanners to significantly reduce scan time, increasing throughput at several thousand packing stations, resulting in a faster than one year payback on investment. zebra's collaboration with the customer and a valued partner was integral to this competitive win. as we turn to slide 13, i want to reiterate the actions we have taken to address our challenges with north american distribution, elevated inventory levels, and increased macroeconomic headwinds.
we have executed key organizational changes and have initiated specific actions with our supply chain partners to stabilize operations and reallocate resources to address immediate challenges. we are also taking decisive steps to rationalize inventory while maintaining optimal levels of strategic components. additionally, we are taking prudent cost actions as we realize softening demand and implementing additional pricing actions to address fx and inflation. in closing, we continue to be very optimistic about the prospects and opportunities for our business.
we have the broadest portfolio of tailored solutions to enable our customers to improve their operations in any environment. the global labor deficit and on-demand economy have escalated the need for enterprises to digitize and automate their operations with our solutions. now i will hand the call back over to mike.

operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from damian karas with ubs. please go ahead.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
hey, good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
so, my first question is related to your sales outlook. and, you know, in particular, we've heard some of your competitors and even one of your major distribution partners recently talking about inventory channel destocking taking place. i'm just curious, you know, if you guys are seeing the negative impact from that at all, and to what extent that's factored into your guidance for the year?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, starting on the channel inventory side, you know, our -- the global channel inventory levels are healthy for us, and we see solid sell-through signals. and, you know, particularly, that's true for our run rate business. you know, inventory levels have rebounded in 2022 for our -- in our channel. but you got to remember that in -- at the end of 2021, the industry was going through some very substantial supply chain constraints, and this -- the channel was nearly stocked out.
so, in 2022, that rebounded to some degree, but more back to normal levels. but, you know, inventory levels in absolute dollar terms in our channel compared to, say, pre-pandemic is up. but if you normalize that around based on hand inventory, which is how we really measure the health of the inventory in the channel, that is actually about only up by a couple of days compared to pre-pandemic.
damian karas -- ubs -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. and then switching gears to the margin trajectory here. you know, if we kind of look at the low end of that adjusted ebitda guidance, you know, it doesn't suggest much improvement, especially when you kind of look at the notable step down you guys are expecting in this premium supply chain costs.
so, i was wondering if you could maybe just give a sense on how you're thinking about that, you know, margin guidance range. and, you know, as it relates to that 50 million premium cost, are you basically assuming that that's more or less eliminated by the third quarter?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
so, damian, this is nathan. if you look at our guide for the year, an ebitda of 22% to 23%, it's a point higher than we were in 2022. and as you mentioned, the primary driver is the supply chain improvements, which is about two points of improvement. but that's being offset by a point of fx for the year, particularly here in the first half on the comps from where the fx was -- the rate was a year ago in the euro.
and we also have pricing actions we've taken throughout the year that are flowing through, and that's largely offsetting material labor costs predicted for the year. so, that's how i'd frame it up. we're definitely seeing the flow-through from the improvement in premium supply chain costs and lower freight rates. but fx is the real headwind that's offsetting it.
operator
thank you. and our next question today comes from jim ricchiuti of needham and company. please go ahead.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
yeah, hi. thank you. i wonder if you could provide us with your general outlook for the projects business in '23. are you seeing any changes? you've expressed some caution that you're seeing from some customers.
but what's your outlook for that part of the business?
bill burns -- chief product and solutions officer
yeah, jim, i'd say -- this is bill. i'd say overall that, you know, from a macroenvironment, we're seeing really mixed signals. as you said, we're seeing, on one hand, really elongated sales cycles and some softening of demand, especially from, you know, some select large customers. that's resulting in some delays and push-outs.
we saw that first quarter -- or sorry, in fourth quarter. and, you know, it's reflected in our first quarter and 2023 outlook. on the other hand, we're really seeing that, you know, we've got strong backlog and the pipeline is healthy for projects for 2023. our run rate sales in fourth quarter were strong, and we're continuing to see that in q1.
and as we just talked about, our global -- you know, just the inventory levels are healthy. so, it's really mixed signals out there that's, you know, keeping us cautious, you know, overall. and i think that -- you know, our view of that is that we're going to continue to monitor the environment in 2023. we're going to take an agile approach to really managing expenses and focus on, you know, profit margin expansion and -- but at the same time really preserving the, you know, strategic investments we're making, you know, throughout the year.
so, i think, overall, we're, you know, highly confident in our solutions offering and in our ability to continue to take share in 2023, but it just makes sense for us to be cautious given the macro uncertainty that's out there today.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
this is joe heel. maybe one or two additional data points on this. as we entered the year, our pipeline of large projects was about the same as it was the year before. so, quite strong and we're quite satisfied with how solid that pipeline of large deals was.
when we are talking about caution and softness, i would say it's the best possible thing you can hope for if you're in sales, which is customers are keeping the projects. in some cases, they are delaying the start time of them. in some cases, they are rolling them out over a longer period of time. but i would say those are few and far between at this point.
and that's really the nature of what's driving some caution on our part.
jim ricchiuti -- needham and company -- analyst
it's helpful color. the follow-up question i have is as you went through q4 and thus far this year, have you seen any changes in demand, meaningful changes either in some of your major geographic regions or major market verticals? thank you.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
i can also speak to that. i think we have a few anomalies that you're aware of, right? you know about our exit from russia a prior year. so, that revenue's obviously not there. you probably expected that in the chinese market, we would have less revenue this quarter than we had in the quarter -- same quarter prior year because of the covid situation.
by the way, that is very quickly recovering. we're seeing a quick recovery of that. so, those are perhaps some of the changes. but other than that, i couldn't say that there's a major shift in region or vertical makeup of our revenue structure.
operator
thank you. and our next question today comes from paul chung with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
paul chung -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. so, just on the ebitda margin guide up this year, can you expand on kind of the gross margin versus opex dynamic driving that outlook? you know, freight is coming down materially. but i just want to get a sense for, you know, gross margin expansion expected throughout the year with 1q most likely being a trough.
and then i have a follow-up.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
yes, paul. if you look at the full year guide on ebitda, i mean, both the supply chain improvements and fx, both will flow through and from a margin perspective. so, i think we expect margins to -- gross margin to increase throughout the year because of those two dynamics. i think from an opex scaling, we'd say roughly, you know, flat to in line with prior year just as we work through some of the increase in compensation and incentive compensation year on year.
but again, i think largely the benefit in ebitda would flow through mostly in gross margin.
paul chung -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
gotcha. thanks for that. and then just on the rfid opportunity, how large is the contribution to the business today? i mean, you guys have been in the market for a long time. so, where are you seeing accelerating growth in some use cases across retail and other vertical? thank you.
bill burns -- chief product and solutions officer
yeah, i would say that -- this is bill, paul. the, you know, low single digits is the, you know, the size we think about. we're excited about the rfid opportunity. you know, as we mentioned in the remarks that we've just won our largest rfid opportunity, you know, ever really in the t&l space.
and we've seen, you know, rfid move from just really retail into retail supply chain, now into the broader supply chain and opportunities within transportation and logistics, which is, you know, really around, you know, parcel and others that create really an opportunity of a wider serve use cases. and in retail, we're seeing, you know, large retailers mandate the tagging of items within retail. we're seeing new opportunities there around loss prevention. as i mentioned, you know, t&l opportunities.
we're seeing quick-service restaurants deploy rfid. in the nfl, you know, we're doing both active and passive rfid, so we just renewed the contract there within -- in our relationship within the nfl. so, you know, we're excited about the rfid market. we've got the broadest and deepest set of rfid solutions today in the market, you know, ranging and covering all those use cases i talked about.
so, the expansion of use cases beyond retail is what's exciting to us. and we've got the portfolio really to go address it, and we're excited about it.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
let me add one other thing, paul, to that, which is, i think tipping points in the rfid market has been claimed several times in history, and i don't think we want to say that today, but there are some very exciting developments in this market that, you know, we're certainly bullish on. but one of them is last year, one of our largest retailers announced that they were converting significant portions of their operation to rfid, and the win that bill mentioned earlier in his remarks that we just -- which was the record rfid deal, the largest in certainly our business and we believe in the industry, is in t&l. and so, with two large -- a retailer and a large t&l company adopting rfid, what this will do, we think, is that it will drive economies of scale in the market and also be a lighthouse for other competitors in the segment to adopt this technology, which provides significant improvements in throughput time and productivity, in addition to the economies of scale it delivers for the broader market. so, we're pretty excited about this and foresee some strong growth for it.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from keith housum with northcoast research. please go ahead.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
good morning. joe, just unpacking some of the guidance a little bit. when you're seeing deals that are being delayed or kind of spread out, perhaps, can you give us a little bit of color about the momentum or the motivation of the companies have in doing so? is it business-specific issues? are they worried about the economy? perhaps further your guidance there.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
yeah. and, keith, this is joe heel again. what we're hearing from those customers is mostly that they are looking to adapt their spending to their budgets. and, you know, if we think about the retailers, which probably make up a meaningful portion of some of those situations where we're seeing that, they are adapting their budgets to what they see as demand for their business.
and as they're doing that, they're asking to spread. they still need our technology. i think that's the important piece that we see and why we're seeing a push-out or maybe a delay in the deployment schedule. so, they're trying to fit it in because they know they need this technology, but they're trying to adapt when they're spending the money to when they think it will be available in their business.
i think that's the best description.
keith housum -- northcoast research -- analyst
great. i appreciate it. and then, bill, just trying to unpack a little bit more about the supply chain issues as my follow-up here. do you guys see still the middle of the year when supply chain issues really become alleviated and you're all back to pre-pandemic levels?
bill burns -- chief product and solutions officer
yeah, i think that, you know -- i mean, from an availability perspective, i think we're pretty much there. i mean, we're seeing, you know, components move, you know, into reasonable -- much more reasonable lead times. it's not all, but many. the majority of our items have come back to normal delivery time frames, you know, overall.
so, i think that we feel good about our supply chain, and the recovery of that really -- almost the majority of almost everything really in first quarter is what i'd say from our supply chain perspective.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
you know, keith, the only thing -- this is nathan, i'd add is, it's obviously a dynamic environment, and we're monitoring it in terms of, you know, events and shutdowns and things like that that could disrupt that. and i'd also say it's also relative. if you look at our freight rates as a great example, it's meaningfully better than where they were a year ago or even six months ago. but still, you know, we're still paying 2 to 3x what we paid pre-pandemic.
so, i think it's also relative in terms of where we -- you know, maybe where we were historically to where we've been a year ago in terms of how we feel about the overall supply chain.
operator
thank you. and our next question today comes from meta marshall with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks. just a couple of questions for me. one, you know, you mentioned longer deal cycles, but i guess i was just wondering, is there any change to kind of the deal sizing that they're putting together of maybe looking at some lower-cost skus or outfitting kind of fewer reps, just any change to kind of the overall deal size that's worth noting.
and then maybe second, you know, now that you've had matrox just a couple of quarters, you know, you did mention some kind of machine vision type wins. just wondering kind of where you're seeing -- you know, where you are on that integration, where you see kind of the best opportunities going forward there. thanks.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
meta, joe heel here. in terms of the longer -- in terms of the nature of these longer deal size -- cycles, generally, we have not seen downsizing of deals or down-tiering of devices. i could think of maybe one or two instances. it's more what i was describing earlier to keith, where the deal is being elongated in terms of either the deployment schedule over instead of taking it all in q1, they're going to take it over three quarters for the rest of the year, or they might say, i don't want to take any q1, i want to take it in q2.
that's the most common one. downsizing, i would say not so much. all right. we're not seeing that as much.
bill burns -- chief product and solutions officer
yeah. from a matrox perspective, i can take that, joe. you know, i think, overall, we're encouraged certainly by the progress of matrox. it performed well in 2022 with -- actually a record year.
you know, the integration is moving as planned. as a, you know, kind of a quick reminder, the -- you know, matrox is really complementary to our organic investment that we made in the fixed industrial scanning and smart camera market. it really brought to us the breadth and depth of the portfolio that our partners were encouraging us to have in that marketplace. so, it brought vision controllers and frame grabbers and 3d sensors, along with a portfolio of software solutions and a software library to meet, you know, many use cases in that marketplace overall.
so, you know, i'd say we're happy with the progress so far. as you know, there's lots of opportunities for us out there in machine vision across manufacturing and transportation logistics as the primary markets that we're focused on. and things are going well so far.
meta marshall -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
operator
and our next question today comes from guy hardwick of credit suisse. please go ahead.
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning. particularly as it pertains to your q1 guidance, can you give us some sort of trends as to the difference between zebra sales into the channel and then the distributor sales out of the channel? and maybe also how that differs from direct business?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
so, maybe just to frame the q1 guide of minus 4% to minus 1%, again, as we mentioned before, we have, again, backlog and pipeline to support the outlook. we've actually had a solid start to the quarter, both in shipments into the channel, as well as we're seeing nice momentum from a sales out, particularly around the run rate business. we're also realizing some nice price realization, which is about a point of benefit in the quarter. so, i'd say early on, again, seeing nice momentum both from a sales in and sales out.
i'd say that -- but the guide also reflects, as we've talked about before, more, you know, the uncertainty in the environment and that cautious behavior, particularly as a lot of our customers are finalizing their capital budgets for the year. and the other thing important to note is that q1 takes the full effect of the russia headwind for the year, which is about a point for the first quarter. but there's no meaningful difference between what we're seeing within our own activity with the channel, as well as from a sales out perspective that's noteworthy.
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
and just as a follow-up, is it correct that the gross margin benefit from supply chain -- declining supply chain headwinds should be the most significant in q1?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
true. from a year-on-year perspective, if you look at the ebitda guide of approximately 21%, the supply chain benefit -- or the previous supply chain benefit is about three points, but that's offset by two points of fx. so, that's -- those are the kind of main drivers from a year on year. but yes, you're right, from a year-on-year perspective, q1 last year was about the peak in terms of premium supply chain costs.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from rob mason of baird. please go ahead.
rob mason -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
yes. good morning. i just wanted to circle back again to your commentary around the run rate business. several times, you've commented on healthy sales there, sell out.
i'm just curious, how much visibility do you have into the bookings trends in that part of the business? and is it seeing any of the elongated deal cycles or any sense of that?
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
joe heel here. on the run rate, it has been very strong, i would say, for q4, in particular. and we're seeing that continue into q1. we -- in terms of visibility, this is the type of business where, you know, people obviously don't book big deals with us.
they go to distributors and buy what they have on their shelves. so, the visibility is typically based on our conversations with distributors, and what they're telling us they're seeing as their order intake. and so, it's much less of a visibility. but what we have so far, even in the first weeks of this quarter, has been very strong.
so, we've been pleasantly surprised, in particular, for printing and scanning, which were areas of our business that we didn't have as much stock over the course of the last year. and as a result, we're very pleased to see that that run rate in printing and scanning, in particular, is so resilient, right, that customers are staying loyal to us and continuing to buy again from the distributors.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
and maybe as two further points in that. one will be that, you know, we don't necessarily have the same visibility into each and in every deal, but this is one where you have a large number of orders. you get kind of a more statistical confidence from that. and if you look at -- historically, our run rate business tends to be more of a longer cycle of business for us.
and if you have a strong quarter, it tends not to be kind of one strong quarter, then it drops down. it tends to be that we have four to six quarters of strength in those -- in that cycle, followed by maybe one or two quarters of softer demand. so, we would expect this to continue for a few more quarters.
guy hardwick -- credit suisse -- analyst
understood. understood. then i wanted to go back to your geographic commentary. i think when you mentioned asia, you called out japan was strong.
you know, i think, historically, japan has not necessarily been a large market for you. could you just outline maybe what you're seeing in japan, what your expectations might be there, if anything is changing on that front?
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
first, i'd say we're very pleased with the performance of the quarters. we had record sales. we came in above the high end of our outlook. we executed very well, i think, and recovered from the distribution network challenges that we had in q3, and we drove double-digit sales in north america.
we talked earlier about the strength we've seen in kind of run rate business, and we see that certainly in small and midsized customers. and we had particularly strong growth from a solutions perspective with print, data capture, rfid, tablets, but partially offset by lower mobile computing sales in europe, due in part to the exit from russia in q1 of last year. now, asia-pac was -- had a good performance, particularly when you consider covid in china. you know, we have very broad-based growth, and we saw nice growth in china, australia, and new zealand.
but japan, as you mentioned, is kind of the standout here. they have -- we had exceptional growth in japan. we have invested in driving penetration in the japanese market over the last several years, both from a go-to-market perspective but also from a product perspective. and this large postal carrier win that we mentioned is going to -- the latest evidence of that.
so, we now have a very strong position in japan in mobile computing, which is one of the largest markets in the world that we really didn't have much of a presence before.
joe heel -- chief revenue officer
and i'll add one thing to that. so, japan is the third largest market that we operate in. and it's one, as you say correctly, where our share in the past had been relatively low. but two important things have changed that i think have given us some really good momentum here.
anders mentioned it. the first thing that's changed is that the market has begun to embrace android. and this may seem like it's out of pace and it is much later than many other markets in the world that that market has made the mobile computing shift from windows to android. and that has given us a big opportunity, right, because many of the local japanese competitors who have dominated that market have not been as quick with android as we have, and that has given us an opportunity.
and that's a great example as this postal carrier deal, which anders mentioned. that's what we did. the second thing that we've done is we have shifted our go-to-market strategy to focus more heavily on partners. and so, we're working with some of the largest systems integrators now in the japanese market.
that's how we won this postal carrier deal. that's how we've won several other large deals, in particular, in retail, around mobile computing. and the combination of those two are really giving us some momentum we hadn't seen in any of the years before.
operator
thank you. and the next question today comes from brian drab of william blair. please go ahead.
brian drab -- william blair and company -- analyst
good morning. i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the different verticals. i'm not sure you've really filled that out this morning in terms of manufacturing, retail, transportation and logistics, healthcare. i assume you don't want to give the expected growth rates for those verticals in 2023, but if you could even, you know, give ranges or rank order where you're expecting the most strength or the weakest performance.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
yeah, that could be a long answer. so, i'll give you -- i'll start a little bit high, and then we can pick up a couple of the verticals maybe here. but, you know, across all our verticals, as i said, we are seeing very strong secular trends to digitize and automate workflows and empower front-line workers in our much more labor-constrained environment. and these trends continue to drive an increased need for our type of solutions across a wide range of vertical end markets.
you specifically mentioned manufacturing. we had a very strong performance in q4 in manufacturing. we had a number of very significant wins that we were very proud of. you know, i mentioned one in the automotive side in my prepared remarks.
there are some attractive trends in manufacturing that are helping to drive our business here. one is around that businesses must invest in traceability tools to create more sustainable supply chains. another one is around industrial automation, investment trends in productivity and visibility, and those present opportunities for our solutions, including machine vision and our autonomous mobile robots and/or fetch solutions. we've certainly seen very strong traction with machine vision in manufacturing and have some attractive early wins here.
we're very excited about what we -- what matox and our adaptive vision acquisitions can bring to our customers and partners here. i can dig into other verticals also, but see if you have any other questions here.
brian drab -- william blair and company -- analyst
well, thanks, anders. i mean, i was just wondering if you could comment if even just briefly or just a bullet point on each one, transportation and logistics, up or down in 2023, healthcare up or down, retail up or down, you know, just directionally even and anything on all the four major verticals you play.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
i think that we probably will leave kind of the outlook around the overall corporate level, but maybe on just say that the four -- you know, in retail in 2022, we had approximately flat sales in retail vertical with some very broad-based growth that offset the pullback of one very large customers -- customer. so, you can see the strong momentum we have across the industry where we could offset a very large customer pulling back in a pretty big way. so, the diversification we have across all of these verticals is definitely helping us to mitigate kind of volatility and drive more consistent results.
operator
thank you. and our next question today comes from tommy moll with stephens. please go ahead.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to start on the revenue outlook you've provided for 2023, which you've described as embedding a cautious approach. when you use that word cautious, are you primarily referring to some of the spending patterns among the large customers that you referenced or is this more a philosophical adjustment you've made where you look at your opportunities and maybe you discount the probability of conversion on some of these deals higher than you typically would just given the macro uncertainty?
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
hey, tommy. this is nathan. i think if you look at the full year guide, which is about, from an organic perspective, slightly down at the midpoint. as you mentioned before, i think it's a combination of the two, right, both kind of cautious in the overall assumptions due to the macroenvironment and how that's going to play out through the rest of the year, as well as to your other point of how we can look at each -- look at some of those large opportunities and probability weigh those for the year.
and we think -- you know, we believe the range we provided is appropriate given that overall uncertainty.
bill burns -- chief product and solutions officer
and i'd just add that i think we feel good about our business. i think this is really all about macro uncertainty. i mean, i think we think that, you know, we're going to continue to take share in 2023. that's how we see it.
we're the leader across the core markets we serve. we've got attractive opportunities across the adjacencies and the expansion businesses we've invested in. so, i think we feel good about our business. i think the uncertainty really is around what's happening around macro, and we're clearly seeing some of that come through in, you know, our results in q4 and in our guide for q1 in '23.
tommy moll -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
and if the macro were to deteriorate, could you rank order or maybe just identify one or two of the key verticals where you would expect to see that pressure first versus maybe some of the verticals where you would expect more of a secular growth trend through the year? is that possible?
bill burns -- chief product and solutions officer
i'm not sure we'd see it as, you know, separate verticals. what i'd say is that, you know, the -- across the diversification of our solutions and our verticals actually give us kind of resiliency in a downturn, which would dampen some of the cyclicality. so, i think this diverse solutions base that we have and product portfolio and the new investments we're making has dampened cyclicality across that customer base. so, i'm not sure we'd see it as one worse than the other.
i mean, joe, you may want to add to it. but i think that, you know, we think overall that we're going to take a disciplined approach to, you know, opex during the year and focus on our investments. you know, i think that -- you know, from that perspective, i don't think we see one vertical over another.
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
you could think of maybe as healthcare as one that would be more resilient. i think that -- you know, economic cycles would probably not impact healthcare as much. so, it's been our fastest-growing vertical over quite a while, and we would expect that to continue to do well, more irrespective of the economic outlook.
operator

please go ahead.
mike steele -- vice president, investor relations
good morning and welcome to zebra's fourth quarter conference call. this presentation is being simulcast on our website at investors.zebra.com and will be archived there for at least one year. our forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual results could differ materially due to factors discussed in our sec filings.
during this call, we will reference non-gaap financial measures as we describe our business performance. you can find reconciliations at the end of this slide presentation and in today's earnings press release. throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, our references to sales growth are year over year, on a constant currency basis, and exclude results from recently acquired businesses for the 12 months following each acquisition. this presentation will include prepared remarks from anders gustafsson, our chief executive officer; bill burns, our chief product and solutions officer; and nathan winters, our chief financial officer.
anders will begin with our fourth quarter highlights and an update on the previously announced ceo transition. then nathan will provide additional detail on the q4 results and discuss our 2023 outlook. bill will conclude with progress made on advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision. following the prepared remarks, joe heel, our chief revenue officer, will join us as we take your questions.
now, let's turn to slide 4 as i hand it over to anders. 
anders gustafsson -- chief executive officer
thank you, mike. good morning and thank you for joining us. it was a strong finish to a challenging year with sales and profitability near the high end of our outlook. for the quarter, we realized sales growth of approximately 4%; an adjusted ebitda margin of 22.5%, an 80-basis-point increase year over year; non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $4.75, a 5% increase from the prior year; and strong free cash flow.
our team recovered from distribution challenges in north america to drive record sales volumes, which more than offset softer sales in our emea region. from a solution-offering perspective, printing, data capture, tablets, and rfid were bright spots, more than offsetting lower sales of mobile computers. although we continue to see cautious spending behavior with certain large customers, demand was -- has generally remained solid with strength in small to midsize orders. we secured a number of exciting wins, helping to drive a strong year-end and momentum into 2023.
these wins included a large postal customer in asia who expects to improve productivity and efficiency by equipping 70,000 mail carriers with our mobile computing solutions, a british grocer who expects to improve their shopper experience and drive store efficiencies by deploying 80,000 personal shopper devices, and a european-based auto manufacturer who plans to enable process improvement and quality assurance along all stages of the production line with 30,000 zebra mobile computers. from a profitability perspective, we expanded ebitda margin and increased eps by scaling operating expenses and drove our strongest cash flow quarter of the year. as you are aware, in december, we announced that bill burns will succeed me as ceo effective march 1st. bill is the ideal leader to continue to advance our strategy and has the full support of our board and executive team.
throughout his career, bill has maintained a strong focus on culture, talent, and innovation. he has been a key member of zebra's executive leadership team since joining us more than seven years ago to lead and integrate the enterprise business, which we had just acquired at the time. since the announcement, bill and i have been busy meeting with stakeholders, discussing the transition and zebra's bright future. i've also been taking this opportunity to thank our employees, suppliers, and partners for their support and collaboration through the years as we transformed our business.
i look forward to continuing to ensure a smooth transition as i assume the role of executive chair. i will now turn the call over to nathan to review our q4 financial results in more detail and discuss our 2023 outlook.
nathan winters -- chief financial officer
thank you, anders. let's start with the p&l on slide 7. in q4, net sales increased 2.5%, including the impact of currency and acquisitions; and 3.9% on an organic basis. our asset intelligence and tracking segment increased 13.5%, driven by double-digit growth in printing.
enterprise visibility and mobility segment sales were approximately flat, with mixed performance among our offerings. we realize particularly strong growth in data capture solutions, including rfid, as well as rugged tablets. mobile computing sales declined, primarily due to challenging prior-year compares, particularly in emea. we also drove growth across services and software with strong service attach rates.
performance was mixed across our regions. north america sales increased 11%, helped by the recovery from supply chain challenges and strength in data capture and printing. emea sales declined 7%, primarily due to the five-point impact of our suspension of sales into russia in march, as well as lower sales to large customers in northern europe. asia-pacific sales grew 3%, with strength in japan and growth in china despite covid challenges late in the quarter.
and latin america sales increased 7%, with strong growth in brazil and mexico. adjusted gross margin decreased 10 basis points to 45.6% due to fx, offset by lower premium supply chain costs. adjusted operating expenses were lower, improving by 100 basis points as a percent of sales, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and effective cost management. fourth quarter adjusted ebitda margin was 22.5%, an 80-basis-point increase, driven by operating expense scaling.
non-gaap earnings per diluted share was $4.75, a 4.6% year-over-year increase. turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow highlights on slide 8. in 2022, we generated $413 million of free cash flow. although q4 was strong, the full year was significantly lower than last year, primarily due to a higher use of working capital due to elevated inventory, higher incentive compensation payments given our exceptional 2021 performance, and $135 million of previously announced settlement payments, which are scheduled to conclude in q1 of 2024.
in 2022, we invested approximately $880 million in the matrox imaging acquisition to expand our machine vision solutions offering. we made $751 million of share repurchases and invested $12 million in venture investments. we ended the year at a comfortable 1.6 times net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio and with more than $1.4 billion of capacity on our revolving credit facility. on slide 9, we highlight premium supply chain costs, which have continued to improve from peak levels.
the actions we have taken to redesign products, targeted price increases, as well as improving freight rates and capacity, have enabled us to reduce component purchases on the spot market and reduce the freight costs impact. additionally, we've increased the volume of printer shipments on ocean from air, which will contribute to reduced freight costs through 2023. in q4, we incurred premium supply chain costs of $25 million as compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, which was favorable to what we had anticipated in our prior outlook and $38 million lower than the prior year. we are expecting these premium supply chain costs to steadily decline in 2023.
let's now turn to our outlook. customer demand and our order pipeline remain healthy, yet we continue to see some softening of demand and elongated sales cycles that we referenced last quarter due the uncertain macroenvironment. we are taking a cautious approach to our sales outlook and expense management while working to right-size our inventory levels. for the first quarter, our sales are expected to decline between 4% and 1% compared to the prior year.
our outlook assumes a three-point negative impact from foreign currency changes and a 150-basis-point additive impact from recent acquisitions. this translates to expectations of negative 1% organic growth, which includes a one-point headwind from sales into russia last year. we anticipate q1 adjusted ebitda margin to be approximately 21%, driven by higher gross margin from improving supply chain costs despite the significant fx headwinds. we expect premium supply chain costs to be approximately $20 million in q1, a nearly $50 million year-over-year reduction.
non-gaap diluted eps is expected to be in the range of $3.70 to $4. for the full year 2023, we anticipate net sales to be in the range of a 3% decline and 1% growth. this outlook assumes a 50-basis-point net negative impact from foreign currency changes and acquisitions as fx headwinds moderate throughout the year. we anticipate full year adjusted ebitda margins between 22% and 23%.
we expect premium supply chain costs of approximately $50 million for the year, with continued improvement in product availability. we have also proactively managed operating expenses as evidenced by opex scaling in q4 and recent targeted restructuring actions as we enter 2023, which enables us to preserve strategic investments in the business. we expect our free cash flow to be at least $650 million for the year, which reflects the benefit of working down elevated inventory levels through the year, higher cash taxes, and $180 million of previously announced settlement payments. please reference additional modeling assumptions shown on slide 10.
note that the cost of borrowing is expected to be approximately 5% to 6% this year, and our non-gaap tax rate is expected to be approximately 19% due to the united kingdom corporate tax rate increase. with that, i will turn the call to bill to discuss how we are advancing our enterprise asset intelligence vision.
bill burns -- chief product and solutions officer
thank you, nathan. before i talk about the progress we are making on our vision, i'd like to take a moment to thank anders for his exceptional leadership of zebra over the last 15 years. through disciplined organic investment and strategic acquisitions, he's led the transformation of zebra. he has fostered an innovative and authentic culture that has received many awards, recognizing zebra as a great place to work.
also, under his leadership, shareholder value creation has significantly exceeded broader market benchmarks. i'm excited to build upon anders' legacy by continuing to advance our enterprise asset intelligence vision. slide 12 illustrates how we digitize and automate the front line of business by leveraging our industry-leading portfolio of products, software, and services. by transforming workflows with our proven solutions that generate an attractive return on investment, zebra's customers can effectively address the increasingly complex operational challenges.
our innovative solutions empower the workforce to do their jobs more effectively by navigating constant change in a near-real-time, utilizing insights driven by our advanced software capabilities such as prescriptive analytics and intelligent automation. as i focus on moving zebra forward, we will collaborate closely with customers and partners to continue to elevate zebra as a premier solutions provider and work to attract, develop, and retain top global talent to drive innovation. slide 13 summarizes our served market opportunities and long-term growth profile. the fundamental drivers of our business remain intact.
megatrends, including the on-demand economy, asset visibility, mobility and cloud computing, and intelligent automation, provide secular tailwinds for our business. i am proud of the progress we're making in elevating our strategic relationship with our customers. we continue to extend our leadership position in our core business and are gaining traction in adjacent and expansion markets, which have higher growth profiles. anders and nathan highlighted rfid as a bright spot where we have a comprehensive solutions offering for a wide range of use cases.
our momentum continues as we were just awarded a record rfid win last week. another highlight is our market share gains in rugged tablets as a result of our focused investment. overall, i believe we are well positioned to deliver 5% to 7% organic growth over a cycle, with an increasing attractive margin profile as we drive continued traction across our core, adjacent, and expansion markets. now, we turn to slide 14.
businesses partner with zebra to optimize their end-to-end workflows as they strive to meet an increasing demands of consumers across a variety of vertical end markets. as you can see on the slide, we address a wide range of workflows and use cases across retail and e-commerce, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and other markets. anders highlighted a few recent wins across these markets. the breadth of business challenges we were addressing has been expanding through our investment in new offerings and markets, enabling us to further penetrate customer accounts.
for example, leveraging our existing relationships enabled us to secure autonomous mobile robot and machine vision wins with our customers in manufacturing and warehouse use cases. we see a tremendous opportunity to continue to elevate and grow our customer relationships through our expanded solutions offerings. on slide 15, we highlight how zebra was able to showcase how our solutions positively impact retail store operations to more than 1,300 customers at the national retail federation's trade show last month. at the event, we brought the modern store concept to life by demonstrating how our portfolio of solutions empower retailers to better engage associates, optimize inventory, and elevate the customer experience.
our booth featured representatives from two prominent retailers who share how our solutions have improved their operational challenges. lowe's home improvement has realized the synergies of combining zebra's mobile printers, mobile computers, and our workflow optimization software solutions that improve the customer experience, increase efficiency, and reduce friction in their workflows. zebra's solutions have resulted in increased customer satisfaction by improving inventory accuracy and streamlining the buy online, pick up in-store experience, as well as over 1 million hours of annualized labor savings and reduced label waste. vera bradley has improved associate engagement and retention by prioritizing workloads through our task and workforce management software solutions.
by leveraging zebra's mobile devices and software solutions, they can now align the right tasks to the right associate in real time and increase employee satisfaction by reducing friction in scheduling. additionally, insights in our software solutions elevate the customer's experience for vera bradley by empowering front-line associates with better information, including visibility of product inventory and pricing. in closing, i look forward to working with our team to advance our enterprise asset intelligence vision by fostering an innovative culture, collaborating with our customers and partners, and delivering profitable growth across our core, adjacent, and expansion markets. now, we'll hand it back to mike.
mike steele -- vice president, investor relations
