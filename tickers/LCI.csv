welcome to the lannett company fiscal 2021 first quarter financial results conference call. my name is karen. i'll be your operator for today's call. at this time, participants are in a listen-only mode. later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] please note that this conference is being recorded.
i will now turn the call over to robert jaffe. robert, you may begin.
robert jaffe -- president, robert jaffe co., llc
good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss lannett company's fiscal 2021 first quarter financial results. on the call today are tim crew, chief executive officer; and john kozlowski, the company's chief financial officer. this call is being broadcast live at www.lannett.com. a playback will be available for at least three months on lannett's website.
i would like to make the cautionary statement and remind everyone that all of the information discussed on today's call is covered under the safe harbor provisions of the litigation reform act. the company's discussion will include forward-looking information, reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of the company's future, and actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied.
in addition, during the course of this call, we refer to non-gaap financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies. investors are encouraged to review lannett's press release announcing its fiscal 2021 first quarter financial results for the company's reasons for including non-gaap financial measures in its earnings announcement. the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is also contained in the company's earnings press release issued earlier today.
in a moment, tim will provide brief remarks on the company's financial results as well as recent developments and associated initiatives. then john will discuss the financial results in more detail, including the company's fiscal 2021 guidance. we will then open the call for questions.
with that said, i will now turn the call over to tim crew. tim?
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
thanks, robert, and good afternoon everyone. we hope you all remain well. at lannett, we continue to manage through the pandemic and are grateful for the dedication of our teams standing behind our essential services. i'll begin with a brief review of our financial results. for the quarter, net sales were $126 million, which we view as a solid achievement given the reduced contribution from our largest product, fluphenazine, after a new competitor entered the market early in the quarter.
our gross margin was slightly lower than anticipated, largely due to more than expected competitive pricing pressures on some key products and associated customer inventory price protection. on the other hand, operating expenses were substantially lower during the quarter anchored by cost reductions. you may recall, that in july we announced a restructuring and cost reduction plan which will generate approximately $15 million in annual cost savings. that plan was initiated on the expectations of fiscal 2021 headwinds and i'm pleased to report that the plan has been fully implemented. adjusted ebitda came in at $33 million and benefited from the aforementioned restructuring.
turning to our balance sheet. we ended the quarter with approximately $109 million in cash. now at the end of this month, we expect to use a portion of that cash to pay down in full our term a loans. this pay off will be an important and long sort accomplishment, and a moment that we will celebrate because paying off our term loan a has multiple benefits. first, it will reduce interest expense going forward, a cost savings equal to approximately $3 million annually. second, it will reduce principal payments by $27 million annually. and third, it will provide us with financial flexibility as our remaining debt the term loan b and convertible notes have no financial covenant ratios.
of course, once the term loan a are paid off, we will increase our attention on addressing our remaining debt. our term loan b mature in just over two years, which gives us runway to continue to evaluate a number of forward financing options. john will discuss our financials in more details later, including efforts to further enhance liquidity.
turning to our commercial highlights. we launched four new products during the quarter, namely lidocaine 2% topical solution, loxapine, levorphanol, and levothyroxine tablets. of course, these products contributed only a partial quarter of sales, so we expect to see quarterly sales from these products to increase going forward. for example, sales of levothyroxine tablets during the quarter was just north of $3 million. we anticipate additional quarterly sales and market share as our customers have now largely worked through their previous inventory of this product from their previous suppliers.
and earlier this week we announced, we commenced the marketing of all 12 dosage strengths of the authorized generic of tirosint or levothyroxine sodium capsules. the iqvia market for levothyroxine capsules is approximately $111 million, although end market generic sales will be lower. levothyroxine capsules complements and is addition to our levothyroxine tablets product. we expect another supplier will enter this market in due course with a subset of strengths. currently, the other expected supplier has approvals on the strengths that represent around 25% of the market, which based on litigation records perhaps another 35% of other strengths filed, but not yet approved. thereafter, given the intellectual property landscape, we believe we will remain one of only two suppliers of the generic product for an extended period of time. and the only generic supplier with all dosage strengths. thus we think this product could be a sustained contributor to our business for some period of time.
during our current quarter, we have also launched azithromycin ir tablets 250 milligram and 500 milligram, but in 30 count bottle sizes only.
now looking to the cadence of future launches. in addition to the 12 products launched in the last seven months, which includes the six products launch fiscal year-to-date, our plan is to launch about another seven products over the balance of fiscal 2021, including possibly a first to market generic sumatriptan nasal spray toward the end of the fiscal year. we are pleased to note that the average value of our products continues to increase, that's suggesting more value on the investments we make.
turning to our pipeline. we now have more than 20 products in development, another 14 andas pending at the fda, including partner products plus a couple of other products that are approved and pending launch.
next, regarding a biosimilar product, as often noted, we have partnered with hec to develop a biosimilar insulin glargine for the us market. and as we said on our last conference call, a team from lannett and hec met with the fda in june to review the so-called cmc data, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and to discuss the clinical advancement of a biosimilar insulin glargine. the fda provided encouraging guidance that leads us to believe that we remain on track to file a bla in calendar year 2022.
more recently, hec has now substantially completed construction of a large new plant that will include eight 12500 liter reactors creating substantial product capacity for insulin with us demand as measured in many metric tons. and he stands ready to build more plants as needed. for our part, as requested by the fda, we are in the process of developing the healthy volunteer protocol along with a statistical analysis plan for the fda for their feedback. their positive feedback will allow us to commence the required study as soon as the clinical trial material from the new plant is available. and we will be looking to show once again our product to be highly similar to us lantus. we expect to initiate the clinical trial next year.
note, given the investment required to build a dedicated insulin facility and the need to conduct clinical trials, we are able to track other potential competitive efforts over time. at this time, we continue to believe that there will be no more than four other competitors to lannett and hec's insulin by the time we expect to launch our product. as a result of all this context, we continue to believe us launch of the product is quite possible in calendar year 2023, based on standard assumptions and given reported end market realized sales of around $3 billion, just a 10% market share at affordable prices well below prevailing rates could be worth more than $200 million annually.
turning to generic advair, another potentially durable product for us. the pivotal pk trials for two 50/50 and 550 strengths had been completed by our partner respirent. the data is currently being analyzed. assuming the data is acceptable, we plan to submit the anda around the end of this calendar year or early next calendar year. depending on the quality of our submission and the fda review time, we believe a us launch of the product as possible next fiscal year. based on standard assumptions, we anticipate some sales at the end of the fiscal year 2022 and substantial net sales for fiscal year 2023.
as discussed in our last call, we believe drug and device respiratory markets are generally large durable and growing. we expect to continue to in-license additional pipeline opportunities over the course of this fiscal year.
stepping back to the broader market. as we have all seen, the duration of covid-19 has been associated with a modest decrease in the total number of prescriptions written compared to previous periods. and that decline is in contrast to a longer-term trend of increasing prescriptions. the net of these effects does have a marginally negative effect on overall business. also due to the pandemic, fewer elective medical procedures are being performed. this has negatively impacted sales of our numbrino product, which carries a higher than average gross margin. last quarter, we sold less than $1 million. we'd hope to at least double our volume once the pandemic subsides.
moreover, the average number of existing competitors at fda approval of a product has continued to trend upwards, resulting in increased product pricing pressure on less durable marketed products. of course, our plan to navigate this market remains focused on launching new products and managing our costs all while building and advancing a valuable diversified and durable portfolio of future drug candidates.
to sum up, we reported a solid quarter of net sales and ebitda of $33 million, despite a new competitor for fluphenazine. fluphenazine was our largest and most profitable product last year. we launched four new products in the first quarter of this fiscal year. and earlier this week, we initiated marketing of an authorized generic of levothyroxine capsules. we believe this product will be a sustained contributor to our business.
we fully implemented a cost reduction plan that we expect to generate approximately $15 million of annual cost savings. as a result, we are affirming our previous fiscal 2021 full-year guidance. our outlook assumes no additional competition for fluphenazine or posaconazole, a partnered product, until late this fiscal year along with the continuing launch of new products and lower operating expenses. later this month, we plan to pay off in full our remaining term a loan balance. once paid off, our annual interest expense and principal payments will be $30 million lower annually. further, our remaining debt has no financial covenant ratios.
the development for biosimilar insulin glargine continues to progress. hec's new dedicated insulin production facility is nearing operational readiness. and we will soon be seeking fda feedback on the healthy volunteer protocol, so that we can commence what we expect to be the sole remaining clinical trial. we believe we remain track on following the anda for generic advair, around the end of the current calendar year or early next calendar year. most importantly, we will continue to manage our expenses and look to optimize our product offering while growing our portfolio. thus, we still expect to be $1 billion company by 2005, with gross margin percentage in the low 30s.
with all of that, i turn the call over to john. john?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
thanks, tim, and good afternoon everyone. as was mentioned earlier, i will be referring to non-gaap financial measures. the reconciliation of the gaap to non-gaap numbers can be found in today's press release.
now for the financial results on a non-gaap adjusted basis. for the 2021 first quarter, net sales were $126.5 million compared with $127.3 million for the first quarter of last year. gross profit was $34.4 million, or 27% of net sales compared with $52.6 million, or 41% of net sales for the prior year first quarter. the decline in gross margin was largely related to the recent new competitor and associated competitive pricing pressure on fluphenazine. sg&a expense declined sharply to $12.7 million from $17.9 million, largely due to the restructuring and cost reduction initiatives announced and implemented in the first quarter.
interest expense decreased to $11.2 million from $15.3 million in last year's first quarter, due to repayments of term a and term b loans as well as lower interest rates and lower fixed interest rate on our senior convertible notes. for the quarter, the effective income tax rate was 43%. the calculation of the tax rate included a discrete item related to stock compensation, which we expect to be less impactful in subsequent quarters.
net income was $2.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share. eps was below expectations, largely due to the competitive pricing environment tim mentioned earlier. net income for last year's first quarter was $8.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share. adjusted ebitda was $33 million. per our credit agreement, the calculation for adjusted ebitda included full cost savings benefit of the recent restructuring less expenses such as severance incurred in the quarter. adjusted ebitda, excluding the impact of the restructuring was approximately $26 million.
turning to our balance sheet. at september 30, 2020, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $109 million. our outstanding debt at quarter end was as follows. total debt was approximately $691 million, debt net of cash was $582 million, and net secured debt was $496 million. as tim mentioned, our term a loans mature later this month. on maturity, the outstanding balance will be approximately $42 million, which we plan to pay off in full with our existing cash on hand. we continue to monitor the capital markets for opportunities to enhance our capital structure. we intend to refinance our remaining term b loans well in advance of maturity. in addition, we are evaluating alternatives and have had preliminary discussions with lenders about a new smaller revolving credit facility. the new revolver will enhance liquidity and provide financial flexibility for business development during the period between the expiration of our current revolver and the comprehensive refinancing of our term b loans.
turning to our outlook. as tim mentioned, we are affirming our previous guidance for the fiscal 2021 full-year as follows. net sales in the range of $520 million to $545 million, adjusted gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, of approximately 29% to 31%, adjusted r&d expense in the range of $29 million to $32 million, adjusted sg&a expense ranging from $55 million to $58 million, adjusted interest expense in the range of $41 million to $42 million. the full-year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%. adjusted ebitda in the range of $100 million to $110 million. and lastly, capital expenditures to be approximately $15 million to $20 million.
regarding the phasing of the quarters. we expect net sales in q2 to increase slightly compared with q1 and continue to grow over the balance of the year. gross margin and eps in q2 to be comparable to q1 and increase in q3 and q4. and operating expenses to increase slightly, remaining in line with our annual guidance.
with that overview, we would now like to address any questions you may have. operator?
",":
operator
yes, thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] we do have our first question from matt hewitt from craig hallum capital group.
matt hewitt -- craig hallum -- analyst
good afternoon, gentlemen. thank you for taking the questions. maybe the first one, but i think you addressed this a little bit, i'm just hoping we can get little more colors, the prescription volume trends, obviously back in the spring with the lockdown, those were severely impacted. it seems like things were recovering this summer, but now with the spike in covid cases, i think there is the potential for things to reverse a little bit. and i'm just curious, what you're seeing? and is it geographically spread out as far as where we're seeing these spikes? and maybe some areas -- your scripts are faring a little bit better. so, any color there would be helpful.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
good evening, matt. the prescription decline that we were referencing in our prepared remarks really relates to the little less visiting physician offices that you would see on the sort of ongoing basis given the pandemic. we're not seeing significant changes, we're talking low single digits, 1%, 2%, 3% on a given period. we do contrast that of course the fact that typically you'd see an increase on prescriptions over time. so the net swing is a little bit more noticeable, but mid-single digit swing is not as much, for example as trade inventories might move as people are worried about stocking up for particular products. so we don't see this is a major headwind at this point. the various products that we provide, that the industry provides is essential medicine that is holding up pretty well, but it does create some marginal pressure on our returns as we think we're losing mid-single digit volume opportunity and the margin associated with it.
matt hewitt -- craig hallum -- analyst
understood. and then maybe one separate question. tim, when you came on board, one of the things that you talked about was, you were going -- or willing to sacrifice some of the gross margin in return that was going to -- and in doing so, you're going to grow volumes. and particularly do so with some of these new partnerships that you signed over the last couple of years, but the plan was for gross profit dollars to be relatively flat and we're seeing that in the ebitda where that's been relatively flat at least over the last five quarters. but the gross profit dollars have been trending down with those gross margins, is that a function of mix? is that a function of -- the fluphenazine headwinds? maybe explain what's going on there a little bit and help us understand how that will kind of recover over the course of this year? thank you.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
sure. you got to be sure, i'm clear we're not looking to sacrifice any gross margin percentage, but we are focused on gross margin dollars. and we think the work we have done this past several quarters, past few years with plethora of product launches, 18, 19, 20 product launches a year has done just that. it's helped create increased gross margin dollars for our business albeit, at gross margin percentages lower than our historical trends. it is indeed a mix issue that results in the lower total gross margin dollar perspective, but that mix issue really is under belied by the fact that we had competitive pressure, competitive loss to levothyroxine some years ago and more recently fluphenazine. so it's really more about the competitive context that creates the mix issue that you referenced and -- but for the ongoing launch parade that has generated significant incremental margin dollars for us, we would not be in a position to be paying off our term loan a later this month. so we're proud of how we've executed, we think we're executing very well. but there is pressure on any given portfolio, any given time, and we've had a couple of specific notes this last couple of years on a couple of our largest products which have therefore belied our underlying success on our product launch efforts.
operator
the next question is from gary nachman from bmo capital markets.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi guys, good afternoon. first tim, do you still think [indecipherable] levo product will contribute about $25 million this year? how are the competitive dynamics in that market? and how do you layer the [indecipherable] into the mix, will that cannibalize the [technical issues].
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
good evening, gary. i think, we discussed that our therapy category that the levos fall into to be something around $40 million that might be roughly evenly split today. we see upside on it, but fundamentally that's the range that we're thinking about as we sit here today. there are obviously numerous new competitors over the past several quarters into this market. so, it's smaller than it used to be from the headier days when i first had joined. but it's still a significant volume product, a significant therapy for our patients, and we're still looking to expand upon the share of positions we have in the market today and have more contributions. but as a whole the number for now and projections, we think we have a conservative 40ish or so million dollars in the thyroid category, you'll see in our tables that we published. as it relates to levothyroxine capsules, the price point here is obviously quite a bit higher than a multi-competitor market. the volume here is substantially smaller. i think, levothyroxine capsules is approximately one half of one percent of the total volume of the levothyroxine market. so while we may see some access gains for the levothyroxine capsules product as that pricing becomes more accessible to managed care plans and patients, it's really the value that product is driven by the fact. it will be just us for a period of time and then another competitor entering into the market. so a much, much lower volume, but a significantly higher price point, although i might press a significant discount to the current brand option on the market today.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and are you still thinking that new product launches should contribute about $75 million a year for the next few years? and you mentioned you're still confident in the $1 billion target for fiscal '25 [phonetic]. how much of that is going to come from products like generic advair and the insulin glargine? so is it going to be really more back-end loaded when we think of the progress to get there?
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
sure. we're very pleased with our product launches of late being front-end loaded. so, many years in our lives, we have to wait to that launch late in the fourth quarter to achieve our objectives. going back to last year with posaconazole, creating a big component of our product launches, and this year, launching levothyroxine tabs, levothyroxine capsules, levorphanol, all in the first several weeks of the quarter and we feel very good about that sort of annualized contribution of $75 million. we certainly see that coming into our p&l from last year's launches, and we certainly see ourselves annualizing that again from this year's launches. so, we feel good about that goal. it's just in context to again the competitive environment and new competitors and a couple of our key products that otherwise is slowing down our march to $1 billion. that $1 billion goal is indeed dependent upon at some level the success of the more durable assets in our portfolio, respiratory assets like advair, insulin assets from our partner hec. but, i'd also note, those sales might represent this is very roughly half of the total figure. we are equally dependent upon the success of our internal development program and the in line products remain today to get to the larger number, right. so, the upside of our growth probably comes disproportionately from those durable assets, which are in the mid to later parts of our strategic plan. i mean, we're not talking five years away, we're talking calendar year '22, '23, '24 for some of these products to come into our portfolio. and they do create the opportunity to the larger aspirations of our growth expectation, but there's also of course this much larger, what i call, the more probable, less large everyday workhorse generics that we are developing from our internal development portfolio that create the other half of the value of our future, moving forward.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just a couple of more. the 27% gross margin in the first quarter is lower than we expected. are you still confident in the 29% to 31% guidance, especially if 2q similar? and then the ebitda guidance, is that factoring the higher ebitda 1q that included the restructuring or is it excluding that? thank you.
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
hi, gary. this is john. so i'll address the margin piece first. so we do expect q2 to be similar, slightly higher, but similar with us coming up in the back half of the year in q3 and q4 on a margin percent. some of that's going to be due to overall launches in our product mix. some of that those through efficiencies in the plant and higher volume. and so we believe that's why we're holding our guidance there to the 29% to 31%. in terms of the ebitda, we held ebitda in the range of $100 million to $110 million. the $33 million was basically a reflection of accelerating some of the restructuring benefits into the first quarter and by providing the $26 million, it essentially smooth that out. so it's -- moving forward we would expect to remove the lumpiness of our acceleration, which was per our credit agreement. so we're still holding that $100 million to $110 million of ebitda.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah, well, i just wanted to clarify that. that $100 million to $110 million includes $33 million from 1q [indecipherable] when we think about the remainder of the year?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
correct. as we calculated per our credit agreement, correct. correct, it would include that $33 million, but that would -- but in that regard that would mean that the q2 through q4 would not had the benefits of restructuring. by including the $26 million, which we provided and by removing that acceleration, you would still have a $100 million to $110 million of ebitda for the year. but you would have the benefit, the savings in every -- smoothed out through every quarter. the reason why we provided the 26 is it is a better number to be using as our first quarter ebitda and run rate.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. right. that's helpful.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
and gary, and i'm just going to add to john's comments there that he referenced increased expectations on manufacturing efficiencies. unlike our sales, which are not back loaded, there is some back loading of our margin expectations. he mentions mix, but to put some color on that, right, we'd expect some normalization in numbrino to the back half of this year as hopefully the pandemic subsides, and we referenced some important products from our internal development efforts fluphenazine and sumatriptan, which are in the back half of the year, which also had good margin contributions. and last but not least, we are never ending in our drive on portfolio optimization. as you look at the margin percentages, not the margin dollars, but simply believing some very low-margin products that aren't absorbing much capacity, we need to increase margin percentages. and then, there's ongoing issues around sales mix and reducing the discounts and allowances that we provide in certain products that we think we don't have to provide that level of discounting anymore as we move forward. so, there's a lot of moving parts in the back half of the year that we think will improve our margin percentages and keep us on track to our growth for the outer years.
gary nachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
and we have a next question from scott henry from roth capital.
scott henry -- roth capital partners -- analyst
thank you, and good afternoon. and i apologize. i had to jump in and out of the call. so, some of my questions may have already been answered. but first, in the release, i noticed you reiterated guidance, but you didn't provide the specific line items, like we're used to seeing in prior quarters. is that simply because none of that changed, or are you perhaps not going to be giving that detail going forward?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
hi scott, this is john. that's because none of the items -- none of the line items have changed. so, we did not provide the table because they all -- we affirm them.
scott henry -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay, great. and then, did you -- i thought i heard you gave the levo number for the quarter?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
i believe we did. it was $3 million for the quarter.
scott henry -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay. and in the past, you've talked about that levo franchise and the potential for growth there. should we think of the tirosint anda or generic as additive to that franchise or how should we think about that in totality?
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
good evening, scott. yes, it's completely additive. we've mentioned a little earlier that while the volume of this product is substantially lower, less than one half of one percent of the total levothyroxine volume, it's obviously at a higher price point, we discounted substantially versus the existing brand asset, but quite a bit higher than the other levo tab assets that are out there. so, we've talked about our levothyroxine category, or i should say, our thyroid deficiency category, being in the $40 million range over the course of year, as we forward. we think there's upside, but that's where we put the number in for now.
scott henry -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay, great. final questions. first, did you give -- you typically kind of give the revenue trend for the following sequential quarter. did you talk about how we think about 2q total revenues relative to q1?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
yes. we did say that they should be up slightly and then grow through the remainder of the year.
scott henry -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay. sorry to have missed that. and final question, just on the shares outstanding, when we look at the non-gaap shares, the kind of 40.7 million, i think that was a little lower than i expected. how should i think about that shares outstanding number going forward?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
i would use that for the full year. i know there is the piece associated with our convertible notes, but based on our calculations you should continue to use that number.
scott henry -- roth capital partners -- analyst
okay, great. thank you for taking the questions.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
thank you. good night.
operator
and we have no further questions at this time. and i will now turn the call over to tim for final remarks.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
all right. it's tim again. i call with our customary shout out to our employees, customers and partners working extra hard in extra challenging times to provide high quality, low cost medicine for our patients. we look forward to sharing our progress on our next call. have a good night.

operator
welcome to the lannett company's fiscal 2021 second quarter financial results conference call. my name is adrian. i will be your operator for today's call. [operator instructions] please note that this conference is being recorded.
i will now turn the call over to robert jaffe. robert jaffe, you may begin.
robert jaffe
good afternoon, everyone. and thank you for joining us today to discuss lannett company's fiscal 2021 second quarter financial results. on the call today are tim crew, chief executive officer; and john kozlowski, the company's chief financial officer; and maureen cavanaugh, our chief commercial operations officer. this call is being broadcast live at www.lannett.com. a playback will be available for at least three months on lannett's website.
i would like to make the cautionary statement and remind everyone that all of the information discussed on today's call is covered under the safe harbor provisions of the litigation reform act. the company's discussion will include forward-looking information reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of the company's future, and actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied. in addition, during the course of this call, we refer to non-gaap financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies.
investors are encouraged to review lannett's press release announcing its fiscal 2021 second quarter financial results for the company's reasons for including non-gaap financial measures in its earnings announcement. the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is also contained in the company's earnings press release issued earlier today.
this afternoon, tim will provide brief remarks on the company's financial results, as well as recent developments and associated initiatives. then john will discuss the financial results in more detail, including the company's revised fiscal 2021 guidance. we will then open the call for questions.
with that said, i will now turn the call over to tim crew. tim?
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
thanks, robert, and good afternoon, everyone. we trust you all remain safe and well. i'll begin with a brief review of our financial results. for fiscal 2021 second quarter, net sales were $134 million and adjusted ebitda was $24 million, which exceeded and met our expectations respectively.
we overcame several challenges in the quarter driven by a strong performance of certain key line products, such as posaconazole and fluphenazine, as well as the launch of levothyroxine capsules, and a full quarter sales of the new products we launched in q1. this was partially offset by lower than expected sales of sumatriptan and metoprolol er, which i will review further in a moment.
our gross margin was lower than anticipated largely due to more than expected competitive pricing pressure and associated customer inventory price adjustments, along with a few out of the ordinary item. we expect some of these pressures to continue and others to abate. an example of new competitive pricing pressures involved sumatriptan nasal spray. our anda was approved in 2016, but late last year a second anda was approved from 4.5 years after our approval. this approval of course, was on the heels of a new fluphenazine competitive approval at the start of the fiscal year, the first such new approval in over a decade. the back half of 2020 was certainly not fortuitous for us.
an example of an out of the ordinary item last quarter is that we discontinued 23 products at the end of the year as part of a portfolio rationalization of unprofitable products. we obviously look to be thoughtful about the returns of the products in our portfolio, when now such discontinued product is metoprolol er. this product experienced several new competitors in the recent past and as burdened with higher than average government rebate claims as an authorized generic. this product alone had a negative gross margin of over $2.5 million for the quarter.
another out of the ordinary item related to our product portfolio rationalization was a small number of products that had some net upward market adjustments. we all expect future benefits for these adjustments. we recorded $1.5 million expenses in the second quarter associated with certain customer agreements related to such adjustments. while there are always many moving parts in the generic company income statement, these atypical items obviously reduced our gross margin percentage for the quarter. as noted, some will continue while others will abate.
turning our balance sheet. in late november, we used a portion of our cash to pay off in full at long last our term loan a note, this payoff will reduce interest expense and principal payments going forward by $3 million and $27 million annually. further our remaining debt instruments have no financial leverage covenants offering us increased financial flexibility. also in the second quarter, we established a new $30 million revolving credit facility, which further enhances our liquidity. john will discuss our financials and more details later, including context around the liquidity and addressing our remaining debt.
meanwhile, our near term competitive environment remains challenging in part due to reduce sales from particularly profitable products. for example, numbrino is affected by fewer elective surgeries during the pandemic. and we experienced an api disruption on the product called metaxalone. we expect both products to contribute significantly more in each quarters than they will have the balance of this fiscal year. more significantly, we now also expect the new competitive for both posaconazole and fluphenazine to occur in this third quarter.
however, we remain quite optimistic about our future $1 billion sales potential by 2025 for the following. first, the product experiencing accelerated declines were always expected to decline over the planning period. and second, we continue to drive the value in our core business by carefully managing all facets across. seeking new share on existing lines of business and continuing our launch parade. all well building out our pipeline, while we have an expanding array of what we believe are durable, mid and longer term pipeline assets.
regarding our launch parade, we launched seven new products fiscal year-to-date with four products in the first quarter, including levorphanol and levothyroxine tablets, as well as three products in the second quarter, including levothyroxine capsules and azithromycin ir tablets. we expect to launch another five new products over the balance of current fiscal year, three of which are already approved, including chlorpromazine, which is in process as we speak.
collectively, these new products are expected to achieve our continuing yearly goal of around $70 million of annualized sales from new product launches. with respect to our pipeline, we have more than 20 products in development, another 11 and is pending at the fda, including partner products, plus four products that are approved and pending launch.
i will now turn into larger and more durable opportunities in our pipeline, starting with our generic advair development programs with respirent. while we have lost a few weeks in our international development efforts across the u.s., europe and asia related to the covid pandemic, we are delighted to share that we are now finalizing the preparation of the pk/pd study data and assembling the anda for submission. our expectation is that the anda will be filed around the end of march.
we continue to believe a u.s. launch of the product is possible in calendar year 2022. and based on standards assumptions, we anticipate substantial net sales in fairly short order following the launch. well to some of you that may seem optimistic. please note the speed of this programs development has been exemplary, perhaps even extraordinary compared with historical programs. we entered this agreement less than 18 months ago, but now find ourselves only a few weeks from filing this highly specialized, durable and exciting opportunity.
and as we've said, we're evaluating in the late stage negotiation for additional product opportunities and the drug device in relation to respiratory space for dry powder and metered dose inhalers. these markets are of course, generally quite large, growing and durable. similarly, our progression with the insulin glargine asset in partnership with hec, we also see as exemplary. over the last two years, we had significantly progressed in various manufacturing, clinical and regulatory milestones. and i'm going to go through them all briefly with you now.
first, we have successfully produced product, conducted a pilot healthy human volunteer clinical trial, developed related analytical data and received supportive fda feedback. that feedback suggests essentially that we can repeat the same albeit slightly larger healthy human volunteer study at the same clinical site used previously with new product produced at the new facility that hec has constructed. such feedback significantly accelerates the development timeline and lowers expected development costs.
second, the new state-of-the-art dedicated insulin manufacturing facility has been built expressed with usa standards and it stocks with the finest european equipment. it has been commissioned at a cost well north of $100 million. that plant has the capacity adequate to supply double-digit market share in the multiple metric ton u.s. insulin market, which is what is needed to compete in the u.s. market. and if we are successful, hec stands ready by contract to build even more capacity.
third, from a commercial opportunity perspective, insulin glargine is a very large, multi-billion dollar market and only a small number of pharmaceutical firms has requisite technology and have committed with the requisite resources, particularly related to the scale of manufacturing needed to compete in this market. and finally, working with well-qualified counsel, we believe we will have freedom to operate with respect to related products and device ip.
moreover, we expect to have an attractive cost position to support an affordable alternative and still maintain attractive gross margins. such efficiency is especially important at this very high volume market for formulary switches between various forms of glargine occurs more regularly than other far more expensive so-called biologics. and yet, even with such relative affordability and assuming future price erosion, you see each 10% share of the glargine only market worth around $200 million annually.
moving forward, we are now working with our partners to scale up the product processes in the new plant to produce clinical batches, while the fda reviews our healthy human volunteer study protocol, which we submitted at the end of last year. we expect to produce clinical material in the first half of this calendar year and then file an ind later this calendar year. for us, we expect to be running the clinical trial early next calendar year. so after our plant anticipates a filing of the bla later in calendar year 2022 and a product launch in 2023. while there are operational logistical challenges of plenty, we are delighted to have already ameliorated so much of the program risk and we are excited to see the culmination of our efforts, propel us toward a relatively near term file.
now stepping back to broader market dynamics, i've few comments to share. first, starting with covid-19, although we see a slow recovery to the pandemic, we encouraged as we all are by the progress on the vaccine front. we look forward to better days and expanding volume for generic business soon ahead. meanwhile, our team remains laser focused on launching new products and managing our costs.
second, by new recently signed an executive order that says in part that the u.s. government should whenever possible procured goods and services from sources that will help american businesses compete in strategic industries and help america's workers thrive. as a company with its headquarters and all of its own r&d and finished dose manufacturing base in the u.s., we are encouraged by the president's executive order. while we believe it will take some time, we hope to become an even more important supplier of the medications we produce to the federal government.
one interesting optic around made in america is that we see it as being aligned with emerging shareholder expectations and possible future sec guidance around climate risk. lannett is one of the few scale american generic pharmaceutical companies that is producing the vast majority of its finished products in the u.s., as well as acquiring a significant majority of its api for those products from the u.s. or so-called taa trade agreement act compliant countries. by contrast, much of american consumed generic products are being made in or an api from non-taa-compliant countries.
as a primarily made an american firm, lannett is subject to and meets or exceeds america's high osha and epa standards. while it all comes at a cost, our relatively tighter u.s. oriented supply chain likely lessens our covering footprint and perhaps reduces our contribution to and exposure from climate risk events, especially when compared with so many competitors who operate in and ship to america from the far side of the globe. as do by american, and ask your pharmacist to buy lannett products, in doing so you can help out some of your fellow citizens and perhaps help out our planet.
to sum up my remarks today. for the quarter, we reported better than expected net sales and our adjusted eps was in line with our estimates. our gross margin was impacted by ongoing competitive pricing pressure and some out of the ordinary events. our launch parade continues. we have launched seven new products thus far in fiscal 2021, and expect to launch approximately five more in the coming months. we have revised our fiscal 2021 full year guidance down due to ongoing pricing pressure in our portfolio, and to a lesser extent, our decision to discontinue a range of lower margin products.
our outlook assumes additional market entrance for both fluphenazine and posaconazole, essentially now, in our current fiscal third quarter. in november, we paid off in full a remaining term a loan balance, and as a result, we reduced our annual interest expense and principal payments moving forward. finally, the development of our durable high value pipeline continues to expand and progress, giving this optimism for our growth over the midterm and beyond.
we believe we are on track for filing the anda for generic advair in the current quarter. and we believe we remain on track for filing the bla for insulin glargine just next year in calendar year 2022.
with all of that, i turn the call over to john. john?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance & chief financial officer
thanks, tim, and good afternoon, everyone. as was mentioned earlier, i will be referring to non-gap financial measures. the reconciliation of the gaap to non-gaap numbers can be found in today's press release. now for the financial results on a non-gaap adjusted basis.
for the 2021 second quarter, net sales were $133.9 million compared with $136.1 million for the second quarter of last year. gross profit was $31.1 million or 23% of net sales compared with $50.2 million or 37% of net sales for the prior year second quarter. the decline in gross margin was largely related to competitive pricing pressure and associated customer inventory price adjustments and sales mix.
research and development expenses declined to $5.6 million from $6.8 million, largely due to timing of project spend and cost reductions related to the restructuring we implemented in july 2020. sg&a expenses declined to $12.1 million from $16.1 million largely due to the restructuring and cost reduction initiatives announced and implemented in the first quarter and lower incentive compensation. interest expense decreased to $10.5 million from $13.1 million in last year second quarter, due to repayments of term a and term b loans as well as lower interest rates.
net income was $3.2 million or $0.08 per diluted share. net income for last year second quarter was $11.7 million or $0.27 per diluted share. as previously stated in q1, our q1 adjusted ebitda excluding the full cost saving benefit of the recent restructuring, less expenses, such as severance incurred in the quarter was $26 million. our comparable adjusted ebitda for q2 was $24 million.
turning to our balance sheet. at december 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $34 million. we expect our cash balance to increase in the second half of the fiscal year and to be around $50 million at the end of both q3 and q4, primarily due to improvement in our working capital, as well as from already received and expected future income tax refunds. additionally, we have $5 million of cash not included above and a restricted account based on our amended agreement with our term loan b holders.
our outstanding debt at the quarter end was as follows: total debt was approximately $639.4 million. debt net of cash was $600.2 million, and net secured debt was $514 million. as tim mentioned, in november, we used a portion of our existing cash to pay off in full our term a loans. we are actively pursuing opportunities to enhance our capital structure and intend to refinance our remaining term b loans well in advance of maturity.
in december, we established a new $30 million revolving credit facility, which provides enhanced liquidity. our q2 gaap financial results included a non-cash asset impairment charge of $198 million, primarily related to the writedown of intangible assets, specifically product rights associated with the acquisition of kremers urban pharmaceuticals. the impairment analysis was partially triggered by our decision to discontinue certain product line. sales of which have declined over a fairly lengthy period of time. product lines generated net sales of $29.9 million for the fiscal 2020 full year and $3.6 million and $0.8 million for q1 and q2 of the current fiscal year respectively.
turning to our outlook. we are revising our guidance for the fiscal 2021 full year as follows: net sales in the range of $480 million to $500 million, down from $520 million to $545 million; adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales of approximately 24% to 26%, down from 29% to 31%; adjusted r&d expense in the range of $26 million to $28 million, down from $29 million to $32 million. i like to point out that our total r&d for the year has come down because of lower than anticipated project spend in the first half related to timing. we expect r&d to ramp up in q3 and q4, which is largely related to our investment and our durable product pipeline.
adjusted sg&a expense ranging from $52 million to $54 million, down from $55 million to $58 million; adjusted interest expense in the range of $41 million to $42 million unchanged. the full year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 26% to 27%; adjusted ebitda in the range of $75 million to $85 million, down from $100 million to $110 million; and lastly, capital expenditures to be approximately $10 million to $15 million, down from $15 million to $20 million. regarding the phasing of the quarters, we expect net sales and profitability in q3 and q4 to be similar but lower than q2.
with that overview, we would now like to address any questions you may have. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] and the first question comes from gary nachman from bmo. your line is open.
rafay sardar -- bmo capital markets equity research -- analyst
good evening, it's rafay sardar on for gary. could you help us better appreciate the magnitude of the various components that drove the reduction and guidance? how much is due to greater competition on the base portfolio versus pressure on newer products? and could you also comment on the cadence for gross margin for the balance of the year?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance & chief financial officer
rafay, this is john. i can take that one. we'll start by saying that, there was a few components on the revised guidance. the first part is really the acceleration of competition as we saw with or as we're modeling with both posaconazole and with fluphenazine, if you recall from q1, we had in our guidance competition toward the end of the fiscal year. in our new guidance, we have that now in the current quarter. so where we had some strong sales in both those categories, both infectious diseases and in anti-psychosis, our expectations now in q3 and q4 is that they will come down. on top of that though, we also had the discontinued products that had a run rate in q1 of about $3.6 million. that was a bit less than q2, but some of that was due the fact that we had a large government rebate to pay for metoprolol. but overall it's mostly a reflection of our new sales forecast.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
and rafay, i just add, it's tim here. i think the decline in margin percentage coming from the new competitors on our higher value products, largely offset by the very low margin to negative margin on the discontinued products. so we expect gross margin percentage on a lower sales base to be maintained.
rafay sardar -- bmo capital markets equity research -- analyst
okay, thanks. and could you also comment on what you're seeing with respect to potential business development opportunities? how confident are you in completing a few transactions in 2021?
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
regarding the business development, we still find ourselves very well positioned relative to our commitment to the space. the quality of the team, the degree of benefit and services we offer beyond commercialization to the full range of what those partners are looking for. we do expect to be announcing more transactions, particularly, around more durable elements of the course of this fiscal year. and look forward to getting those words out to you when they get transacted.
rafay sardar -- bmo capital markets equity research -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and your next question from gregg gilbert from truist securities. your line is open.
gregg gilbert -- truist securities -- analyst
thank you. first for john, can you help us understand what the cats and dogs were in gross margin percentage in the quarter? i believe tim characterized some of them as not sounded like one time or but don't want to put words in your mouth. and tim, as the slippery slope that has been gross margin percentage content, you sort of soured your view on continuing down the path of the same kinds of products going forward, clearly, you're looking to get into higher value, larger opportunities like you've discussed in the out years. but i have to imagine it's been frustrating to -- it's have to deal with the melting ice cube aspects of the business in some cases melt faster than you expect them to?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance & chief financial officer
so gregg, this is john, i'll take the first part. some of the one-offs in the period that we were referring to is specifically with metoprolol. i mentioned that we had a large government rebate. metoprolol was one of the products that were in our discontinued list. so it was a significant reduction to the quarter that we will not see in q3 or q4. we also had some inefficiencies with our operations, some of them covid related with absenteeism that we're expecting to increase as we go into the back half of this year. as a matter of fact, we're just looking at some of our results from january versus december, we're seeing a significant increase in our overall output.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
and regarding to the slippery slope on a gross margin, yes, i do think the fact that we've been seeing fewer new generics being approved and more approvals on existing generics has accelerated the erosion on what we might call some of the base products in our portfolio that more than we may have thought a few years ago. however, we have been focused on building out this sort of durable portfolio for quite some time. and i think it's important to note that we're in process with some of those durable up portfolio items. we tend to speak to the very large ones like insulin and advair. but we're pretty darn proud of getting products like posaconazole and vardenafil and levo caps out in the market, as examples of products which have, some pretty decent sustainable value, while posaconazole is going to be coming down now. it's the first second anda approval that will exist, that is in the market now. and it's still a pretty valuable product for us, those sorts of products that we have been working on building out for awhile. and it gives us hope for our expectations of our longer-term growth, particularly as the much more sizable and much more technology intensive ones that we talk about in the respiratory space, in the insulin space, draw near to our gross margin delivery in our strategic plan.
gregg gilbert -- truist securities -- analyst
great. i have two more. on numbrino, clearly, a lot of elective surgeries are rebounding as noted by other companies that make widgets that are tied to such activity. are you noticing any rebound there relative to...
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
we've not seeing any significant movement in our numbrino sales. we think that is still under a fair amount of pressure from a lack of those sorts of surgeries. our sales last quarter were sub $1 million as they were the year before. it is certainly an area where we expect to see recovery and significantly more sales. and like the other, i should have mentioned it as a durable product. it is a high margin and not expected to have a whole lot of other people in it for some period of time.
gregg gilbert -- truist securities -- analyst
and then lastly, early in the pandemic, it was remarkable how few supply chain disruptions we saw across pharma, branded and generic. and i don't know how much of that was due to safety stock on hand or other things. but is there a reason to be concerned that there could be more sort of hangover effects from that in this calendar year versus the prior calendar year as many companies have worked through their apis and materials and other things that might have been stockpiled at the beginning? or really good about all things supply chain related to the pandemic and how it's affected movement around the globe? thanks.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
well, as you just noted. i think the industry to its credit and to the benefit of patients is, has been remarkably resilient during the pandemic and ensuring adequate supply of our medicines. lannett has always prided itself as being particularly strong on a reliable supply and a less complex supply chain and should the disruptions of the last year continue in a way that starts creating a fewer safety stocks. we feel we're well positioned to supply those customers products that we needed is a strength of the organization, but not one of which we've gotten much benefit from in the recent quarters, given the resiliency of the overall supply chains. but if that changes, we stand ready.
gregg gilbert -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks.
operator
and your next question comes from matt hewitt from craig-hallum and capital. your line is open.
matt hewitt -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
good afternoon, and thank you for taking the questions. just a couple for me. first off, and i don't know if it's possible, but is there any way to quantify what the covid headwinds have been over the past year? and you've talked about numbrino, but you think about the adhd drugs have been in decline because of the pandemic and i'm sure, there's others. how much of a headwind is that? does that 10%, 15% over the past, call it 12 months and as we see the vacation increasing, infection rates declining, is that a potential tailwind for you later in this calendar year?
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
good evening, matt. we have noted in other calls and the number of you when your compatriots have observed the sort of volume declines across industry which have been in the sort of low single digits. i always try to make the counterpoint. it's not just the client. it's also the fact that it wasn't a game. over most of the decades, i have now spent in this industry, what we've always seen single-digit growth in generic pharmaceuticals. over the last year, you've seen single-digit negative growth in pharmaceutical. so that net swing can be maybe 10%. we shall see. we certainly hope to see that as part of our lift as we get into our next fiscal year. and then of course, beyond of the numbrino curtailment, which you just referenced, we have other areas like you don't see as much cough and cold utilization, which is a disproportionate part of folks that are not getting cough cold as people stay in, right? so those particular products in our portfolio are certainly down more than 10%. so we do see lift on the balance of the portfolio, as life pertains, a degree of normalization and new patient starts on existing generics goes up again, and then we see a specific sectors of opportunity in cough cold, in numbrino for those pieces of our portfolio that have been disproportionately reduced more than the single digits you see for the macro effects.
matt hewitt -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
got it. okay. and then one other one from me, as far as the pipeline is concerned. thank you for providing the update as far as, number in development, pending approval and pending launch. as we look at, call it, the next 12 to 18 months, the 11 pending approval by the end of the fiscal year, is it safe to assume somewhere between a quarter and maybe half of the ones that are in development could also reach the goal line over the next 12 to 18 months. i'm just trying to think how areas where you could drive some incremental ebitda to help with that current balance sheets situation. thank you.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
so we tend to think of it, again, to that annual goal, we've spoken to a $70 million of annualized sales from each bucket of years product launches. we certainly accomplished that last year with the posaconazole anchor. this year, it will certainly be accomplished, we believe with the levo caps and levo tabs anchors as well as potential nasal spray opportunities late in the year on zolmitriptan. and as we look forward to next year, we expect to be able to continue that. we are focused a little bit more on the sort of product quality, where we're willing to back off from the 20 product launches we started with to getting to that same sort of dollar range on fewer products. we are pleased to share that it looks like the api issue that held up our limited approval for some period of time as resolving itself. we do not have an approval yet, but the api issue, which is a pull that off of our commentary is looking better for the course of the calendar year. and then it's getting the next year, of course, there's all sorts of things that may occur but we feel good about that $70 million of annual new value.
matt hewitt -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- analyst
understood. thank you.
operator
and your next question comes from elliot wilbur from raymond james. your line is open.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. first question for tim, i guess, with respect to additional competitive entries on posaconazole and fluphenazine. are those additional entrants pricing at points that coincide with historical experience, historical models, sounded like from your commentary? that may not be the case, but just wanted to verify if in fact, that's true.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
yes. so we try to avoid any commentary on individual pricing expectations on any particular product for our portfolio. we will note that in aggregate we are increasing our expectation of declines across the portfolio to go from the mid to higher single digits to the highest single digits across our portfolio, which is a reflection i think of more entry on more products in our portfolio over the course of this year and beyond.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. maybe a question for john coming to back some of the earlier conversation around gross margin levels, could you disclose what the government rebate was related to metoprolol? and i guess, the reason i asked the question is, is looking at the margin performance this quarter certainly can understand the factors that led to lower than expected numbers and the change of guidance going forward. but if i look at your revenue performance, i mean, generally across the board, and certainly in kind of your key high margin categories certainly seem to be better than external expectation. so it seems like there's a little bit of disconnect there. i'm not sure if i understand what's maybe fully behind that.
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance & chief financial officer
yes. there is so -- i mean, there's a few different government rebate programs, but the large one referring to is one that has the doughnut hole, the medicare part d. so toward the end of a calendar year, we tend to see some higher amounts and this was a bit over what we had originally anticipated. so it had a significant impact to the overall quarter. again, though, for a product, that is part of our discontinuation list. so moving forward, we will not have that type of exposure.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. and then just perhaps last question for tim, just coming back to numbrino, just maybe a status update in terms of some of the non-commercial issues taken around the product, litigation update there?
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
all right. well, we have our general counsel with us, sam israel. so i'll ask him to maybe respond.
samuel h. israel -- chief legal officer and general counsel
yes. just update that most recently in a case that the competitor filed against the fda, we are working with the fda. the court has basically asked the fda to go back and look at our application in light of the issues that the competitor raised. we're working with the fda on addressing any issues the court has. and they're fairly competent that we'll be able to continue to as we have been to date market that product.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. then maybe one last question, sorry. just maybe tim and maureen, if you guys could just comment on the deal environment in general, obviously a lot of products out there potentially for sale, not a lot of buyers, but more thinking about just the opportunities around licensing deals and partnerships, just the degree of flow that you're seeing and how competitive some of these opportunities are versus what you were looking at maybe 12 to 18 months ago?
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
well, i think we're seeing a continuing bifurcation of more interesting assets against a lot of less interesting assets. so this sort of onesies and twosies of multiple competitor oral products are certainly available out there. but we don't see them generating the value in terms of being able to step into supply disruptions or securing share against the cost structure to the same extent, we saw in the past. on the flip side of that, the more durable assets, the one that take a little bit more time, it take a little more support across our functional activities in our organization. those continue to show excellent deal flow for us. and as i said, i think you'll be hearing more from us soon on those sorts of products. we have quite a large range of things that are in the hopper. not all of them will obviously be transacted, but we feel pretty confident that you'll see some increasing contributions of those sorts of assets into our portfolio. i do think there is also as an industry and lots of duplication out there, right? there's lots of duplicate r&d. there's a lot of duplicate sg&a. there's a lot of duplicate manufacturing. so whether or not those sorts of transactions derive some value at some point we shall see. there is a gap between what buyers are willing to pay and sellers are looking to receive. but on the product side, we see good deal flow and the things that we talk most about in terms of driving our returns in the midterm and beyond.
maureen cavanaugh -- senior vp & chief commercial operations officer
i would just add to that. i'm sorry, i would just add that. we are seeing lots of deals coming across our desk and lannett is considered a very good partner and we've showed that success. and so we're always getting new opportunities every day to look at it. as tim said, sometimes they just don't add the value that we're looking for. but when we find them, we act quickly on them.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james & associates, inc. -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
and the next question comes from scott henry from roth capital. your line is open.
scott henry -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
thank you, and good afternoon. i do have a couple of questions. i guess, first, did you quantify the annual revenues of the discontinued products?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance & chief financial officer
scott, yes, this is john. so as we had said that for last fiscal year the revenues were about $30 million and for q1, they were about $3.6 million. they did come down significantly in q2 to about $800,000 but a good portion of that was due to the difference in metoprolol. so i think an average run rate was -- go ahead.
scott henry -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
okay. thank you. that's helpful. i apologize for missing that. and question -- for the generic industry is often about opportunity. and the question is, once you discontinue a product, if an opportunity, whether a supplier falls off or whatnot, how hard is it to restart up that product?
maureen cavanaugh -- senior vp & chief commercial operations officer
this is maureen. i'd say, it really depends on how long it has been since you discontinued a product. so obviously, if you discontinue a product, just because of the value that it gets with having no operational issues, it's easy to bring back. it's quick to buy some api and produce the product. the longer it gets, the longer timeline from when you discontinue a product to consider bringing it back in the market that takes a lot longer to bring the product back to market things change. and so...
scott henry -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
and when do you think a product goes stale, if at what point is it you're almost starting from scratch, is it a year? is it two years? just curious.
maureen cavanaugh -- senior vp & chief commercial operations officer
yes. i mean, there's lots of theories about that i think it's product by product specific. one rule of thumb, people say five years and greater, but it really is very, very product specific. it depends. so we're constantly looking at that. we look at our old andas that we've not solved for awhile and consider it all the time or constantly looking for opportunities in the market. so we can jump on them.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
i know that the fda support of prior approval supplements and their speed of which they are acting on them certainly shortens the time horizon that historically we have seen to bring those products back in the market. so i assure you, should those markets become more valuable. they remain in our portfolio by and large, and we'll be able to act upon them. i also think pragmatically that's not what our expectation is, or we would not discontinue them from where we stand here today. certain products, their structural concerns, we mentioned on metoprolol and it's government rebate requirements as an nda, as opposed to an anda which made it uncompetitive vis-a-vis numerous competitors in the market today.
scott henry -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. i appreciate the color on that topic. a second question on gross margin, if we look at the adjusted gross margin and use the midpoint, it basically dropped from 30% to 25%. when we think about next year now there'll be new products and there'll be some other products that are worse. i mean, is it reasonable to think that perhaps the margins are down to 25% in 2022? is that a rational way to think about it?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance & chief financial officer
so i mean, we typically give some color for our fiscal 2022 toward the end of our year. we'll expect to give something on our q3 call in may. so in a few months, we'll be able to provide a bit more color in terms of our margins that from a run rate.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
and i'll add that we have previously said, we still believe that as we look out over time with the more durable items in our portfolio, recognizing that most of those durable items will have a partnership. we've always talked to a $1 billion dollar goal and happy to be in a 30% gross margin arrangement, that net margin to ourselves. i think that remains in place. so the portfolio itself of any given year will affect, obviously, what our gross margin will target for that year. but over time, i think something in this sort of low-30s is what we would see as expected or targeted as these more valuable products come into our portfolio.
scott henry -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
okay. and perhaps, having covered this company for about 10 years, i've seen the cycle on the high side to low side. do you, tim, and obviously, it's an opinion, but do you get the sense that we are kind of approaching the bottom of the generic cycle here? is there a level in your opinion where margins typically bottom out before you have less competition and then they start the upward trend, again?
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
well, i'll simply say that we're not satisfied with where we are. but the market does indeed have lots of ups and downs, and we're fighting hard to do the best we can with the hand that we've been dealt and we try to keep our eye on the prize. so from our company perspective, we're quite proud of what we've done. i want to stress this, right. we created a launch parade out of kind of ethos in the last few years with $70 million of annualized value. we brought to market first launch products like posaconazole, levo caps and vardenafil, on and on. we're paying down our debt, reducing our costs and now building this really rather durable portfolio. so our main optic is what we can do with our team to deliver more value to that marketplace. and i do think the fact that we're talking more and more about these durable products that takes significant infrastructure investment, likely to partner for a company of our size, remarkable at some level that a company of our size, and to be able to latch onto these sorts of opportunities.
it is a reflection that there are components of this industry, which i think are under duress and likely to stay there for awhile. as we've always said about supply and demand, if you can point to lots of supply i will show you a lower pricing. if you can point to less supply, i will show you higher pricing and we're working like heck to find those durable, valuable, fewer supplier markets that you've needed for us. and we're pretty excited about what we've done. we think it'd be transformational value when we get there. and we're moving as hard as we can to get there, be darned, what the rest of the market is doing.
scott henry -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
okay. great. i appreciate that feedback. final question, it's just a multiple part one. on the insulin glargine, i just wanted to make sure i had this correct. you're going to start the trial in early calendar year 2022, about how long does that trial take from starting to read out?
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
well, we have on the line with us, steve lehrer, who also leads our biologic efforts, particularly around insulin online. steve, if you're there, could you please respond?
steve lehrer -- biologics leader
yes. good afternoon. the clinical phase of that trial takes about four to five months. so we start in early '22 by mid '22 we have a trial basically wrapped up.
scott henry -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
okay. so then would we expect that, as it's going to take a little time to prepare for anda, maybe you file that by the end of '22 and then in, and that leads to the launch kind of mid '23, perhaps second half '23 sense calendar year that is.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
steve, do you want to continue?
steve lehrer -- biologics leader
yes. we'll be filing biosimilar application bla. and that will be in the back half of calendar year '22, as tim mentioned earlier and given the approval timelines. so we expect approval on the back half of calendar year '23.
scott henry -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
yes. and i guess on that, how should we think about a biosimilar application and the turnaround, are they trying to stick to a certain time horizon there, or just any color you could give?
steve lehrer -- biologics leader
yes. so there's a specific biosimilar program fee and the agency has managed to keep within their timelines. and that's where we come up with about the year estimate right now, between filing the bla and approval. and of course, lannett is having ongoing discussions with the agency and making sure that we'll be able to file the bla with all the appropriate information.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
and scott, if i can add, just to reinforce the comments we made in the prepared remarks, it often gets lost in the information we try to share. and because it's a little bit different than things we normally talk about. but we talk about conducting a pilot healthy human volunteer clinical trial that is significantly faster and abbreviated in that lower cost than what people have seen in the past, right? so we are very encouraged by that guidance, and it is significant that the fda has been supportive of that approach. and it really has accelerated our timelines to the point that we're talking about this filing as we get into next year.
scott henry -- roth capital partners, llc -- analyst
okay. thank you for that as well. and thank you for taking the multiple questions.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
thank you, scott.
operator
and this concludes the question-and-answer session. i'll now turn to call back over for management for final remarks.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
all right. it's tim again. i'll close out with our customary shutout to all of our employees, customers and partners working extra hard in extra challenging times to provide high-quality, low-cost medicine for our patients. we look forward to sharing our progress on our next call. have a good evening.

operator
welcome to the lannett company fiscal 2021 fourth quarter and full year financial results conference call. my name is adrianne, and i will be your operator for today's call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] please note this conference call is being recorded.
i'll now turn the call over to robert jaffe, investor relations for lannett company. robert jaffe, you may begin.
robert jaffe -- owner
good afternoon, everyone. and thank you for joining us today to discuss lannett company's fiscal 2021 fourth quarter and full year financial results. on the call today are tim crew, chief executive officer; john kozlowski, the company's chief financial officer, maureen cavanaugh, our chief commercial operations officer; and steve lehrer, who leads our insulin biosimilar initiatives.
this call is being broadcast live at www.lannett.com. a playback will be available for at least three months on lannett's website.
i would like to make the cautionary statement and remind everyone that all of the information discussed on today's call is covered under the safe harbor provisions of the litigation reform act. the company's discussion will include forward-looking information, reflecting management's current forecast of certain aspects of the company's future and actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied. in addition, during the course of this call, we will refer to non-gaap financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and maybe different from non-gaap financial measures used by other companies.
investors are encouraged to review lannett's press release announcing its fiscal 2021 fourth quarter and full year financial results for the company's reasons for including non-gaap financial measures in its earnings announcement. the reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is also contained in the company's earnings press release issued earlier today.
in a moment, tim will provide brief remarks on the company's financial results, as well as recent developments and initiatives. then john will discuss the financial results in more detail. we will then open the call for questions.
with that said, i will now turn the call over to tim crew. tim?
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
thanks, robert, and good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining the call. we hope you remain safe and well as we all manage through the persistency of the pandemic. i'll start today reviewing some of the highlights of the past year that are relevant to our future before turning to the key elements we see in that future.
first and foremost, in 2021, we continued to launch products and build our future portfolio. we launched about a dozen new products, highlighted by a few significant contributors, including levothyroxine tablets, levothyroxine capsules and clarithromycin. the products we launched last year added new revenue streams and further diversified offerings, reducing our exposure and reliance on key products. we also grew our base product pipeline with continued investment in a robust internal product development program. for example, our recent mycophenolate approval was achieved in just under 10 months, the third such product we developed to achieve so called first cycle approval in the past few years.
we have made great strides in our internal efforts including significant changes to our portfolio selection. such changes take time to be fully reflected in our financials, but we believe meaningful value is being built. further, we are working on our existing strategic alliance partners to expand our agreements to include new products. for example, this past year insulin aspart was added to our hec agreement, and more recently, generic spiriva, handihaler was added to our respirent agreements. together these products represent multi-billion dollar markets with relatively few competitors expected. we also formed a new strategic alliance partnership to launch sevoflurane, a product with relatively few competitors and a market size of about $190 million based on iqvia data. we look to launch sevoflurane in the back half of the fiscal year.
the second key accomplishment last year was even while we launched new products and grew our pipeline, we also maintained firm control over expenses and exhibited operating discipline. we implemented and completed the cost reduction plan that included consolidating our r&d functions to a single location and lowered operating costs by approximately $15 million annually.
the third key accomplishment was that we significantly improved our capital structure. this last year, we paid off our term a loans with cash on hand and later successfully completed a full refinancing transaction of the term b loans.
the refinancing transaction as we have often highlighted was significant for several reasons. first, we extended the maturity of our debt to 2026 from 2022, which is now after several of our larger and more meaningful pipeline assets are expected to launch and contributed to a reduction in our debt. second, we upsize our credit facility and substantially freed up cash flow, primarily due to the elimination of mandatory principal payments until maturity. third, the new debt does not have any leverage covenants. fourth, as a result of this refinancing, in combination with working capital initiatives, we have improved our cash position. thus, we now have more ready resources to invest in growth opportunities.
of course, another accomplishment to note was in our teams, particularly in our plants and labs, showed up to work every day throughout the pandemic and maintained a reliable supply of our affordable medicines. this, of course, despite all the extra challenges we have been doing so this past year. we are quite proud of all of these accomplishments. of course, there are also real challenges. well, competition is a fact of life in the generic industry. the competitive environment we encountered last year was particularly impactful because it involved some of our most profitable products. we offset some of these pressures with the aforementioned new product launches and cost reductions, but the decline significantly exceeded the offsets.
on top of a particularly competitive environment, covid-19 continued to impact our financial performance with more downstream influences. for example, as we have said, the pandemic resulted in fewer elective medical procedures being performed, this reduction in limited sales and use of our cocaine-based product. as a branded product, our numbrino nda carries a higher than average gross margin for us, so changes up or down in sales have a disproportionate impact on our bottom line. fortunately, we believe many of the negative past year are beginning to attenuate while the positive factors continue to foretell meaningful opportunities.
with that as a background and leaving john to note the specific financial results, i will turn to our outlook for the upcoming years. we expect our overall net sales and gross margin to continue to face pressure by recent and anticipated competitive pricing of certain key products, partially offset again by the benefit of new product launches. we also expect sales of our numbrino nda to be impacted by a continuation of further elective surgeries being performed. once the pandemic subsides, we would expect to see an increase in these types of procedures and along with that, an increase in sales.
while we are forecasting a down year in sales and profits, we see fiscal '22 as a trough year. our key products have already been impacted by notable competitive pricing pressure, thus, those products have less further downside. at the same time, the relative future potential of our pipeline continues to increase.
i also want to note that while we believe our generic advair diskus product has the potential to launch in calendar year 2022, we did not include any sales of the product in our fy '22 guidance. similarly, zolmitriptan is also not contemplated in our fy 2022 forecast, as a result of ongoing delays from our api supplier. nevertheless, we do expect both products to be meaningful contributors in fiscal 2023.
so now let's turn to our pipeline. we continue to launch products [indecipherable] approximately 13 andas pending at the fda including partner products, plus four additional products that are approved and pending launch. we also have more than 20 products in development and expect to add more from both external and internal efforts. we continue to target more valuable products than has been our historical average.
with regard to our large durable product pipeline, we currently have five disclosed assets. first, with our partner hec, we have two insulin assets, insulin aspart, a fast acting insulin product and insulin glargine, a long-acting insulin product. combined, the two products participate in a double-digit billion dollar us market as reported by iqvia. second, our drug device respiratory portfolio with their partner respirent now has three assets, generic advair diskus, which is filed with the fda, along with generic flovent diskus, and most recently, generic spiriva handihaler. combined sales of these products also represent a multi-billion dollar us market as reported by iqvia. as we have said, all of these products are differentiated from traditional generic products because of the significant technical expertise required for development and substantial plant investments made by our partners that needed to manufacture them. so for all of these products, we expect only a handful of competitors.
i will discuss next the significant progress we are making advancing these large durable product opportunities. with regard to generic advair diskus, we have been in regular contact with the fda regarding this priority application since it was accepted in may of this year. we are encouraged by their level of engagement. we anticipate a mid-cycle review update from the fda sometime in the next few months. thus, we expect to provide a better sense of how the application is progressing on our next investor call in november. currently, we continue to participate more than one fda cycle and believe, as just noted, an approval in us launch of the product is possible in calendar year 2022. for those new to lannett story, generic advair diskus is one of the larger assets in our filed pipeline. it is also currently the closest to expected commercialization in our partnered respiratory portfolio.
the second most advanced product in our respiratory portfolio is generic flovent diskus. the last patient for the pivotal clinical trial for this product has been dosed and we anticipate the analysis of the trial to be completed within a few months. we are currently planning for an anda submission before the end of the current fiscal year and a possible launch in calendar year 2023.
next, as noted, we recently expanded our opportunities with respirent to include generic spiriva handihaler. the development arc for this product should be approximately 12 months to 18 months behind the generic flovent diskus product. however, as there were various ip matters involved, we're not commenting today on the specific launch timing expectations.
finally, as we have previously said, we're evaluating and in negotiations for additional product opportunities in inhalation respiratory space, particularly dry powder inhalers, and metered dose inhalers. there continues to be additional multi-billion dollar market opportunities to pursue with both current and future partners.
now turning to our two biologic insulin products, starting with biosimilar insulin glargine. clinical material for the drug product has now been manufactured in the new dedicated manufacturing site, which is a very significant milestone. we still expect to submit an ind around the end of the calendar year and commence the pivotal clinical trial early next calendar year. however, we have recently added a few months to the clinical timeline, due to current covid-19 restrictions at the study site in south africa. we have also added a few more months to our timelines to address interchangeability with the fda, which i'll discuss in a moment. thus, we currently think the biologics license application will be filed in the first half of calendar year 2023 and we would expect to launch in the first half of calendar year 2024.
also note, china's version of the fda, the nmpa has approved hec's insulin glargine for china. that product is made in the same new plant, where we have now just made our insulin glargine for clinical trials. [indecipherable] we have added to the development plan to address the interchangeability with the fda is related to an important recent fda approval of the first biosimilar and interchangeable insulin glargine, the [indecipherable]. we believe that interchangeability approval is good news for lannett and hec's insulin. it demonstrates the fda will approve interchangeable insulin products, which over-time should improve affordable access to these important medications.
regarding biosimilar insulin aspart, the development of the product continues and we currently anticipate a potential launch of the product about 15 months following insulin glargine. again, insulin aspart was produced in the same facilities, working with the same teams and technologies as insulin glargine, so we are able to leverage may be earlier glargine investments in development and manufacturing that have been made by both lannett and hec.
like our respiratory portfolio, we see several opportunities to leverage our insulin assets. there are other dosage forms of both glargine and aspart, such as vials and other distinct insulin products. these opportunities again represent multi-billion dollar markets, as reported by iqvia. we also see opportunities to leverage our usa clinical data, 10 development and related ip, along with the manufacturing capacity at hec to form a strategic alliance with third parties looking to accelerate their access to insulin products in international markets such as europe. well, discussions on such opportunities are very preliminary, such relationships could yield meaningful value for both ourselves and our partners.
finally, a few brief comments on made in america [phonetic] and esg. while we see a future that includes several high technology products from overseas sources, today, we are mainly a us domiciled generic medicines company. lannett adheres to strict us laws and us environmental guidelines with regard to development and manufacturing compliance for our us made products. most of our large generic competitors are already based overseas and don't face the same set of regulations and ship most of their products from the far side of the globe. we are proud that today, we serve the us market from the us market and do so with an enviable track record and reputation for being a high quality and reliable manufacturer. we point out these characteristics that make lannett increasingly unique as a generic supplier so that our investors and customers think of lannett when they consider made in america in various esg related initiatives.
to sum-up today's remarks, our accomplishments in fiscal 2021 were significant. we faced head on a highly competitive market environment. we launched new products and made important advances in the development of key products in our pipeline. we expanded existing agreements that added three large durable assets to our respiratory and insulin franchises. we refinanced our debt, improving free cash flow and extended our maturities beyond the expected launch dates of our large pipeline assets. we continue to believe that the exciting products in our advancing and expanding pipeline still have the potential to transform our firm into $1 billion company by 2025.
with all of that, i will turn the call over to john. john?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
thanks, tim, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll begin with our financial results on a non-gaap adjusted basis.
for the 2021 fourth quarter, net sales were $106.0 million, compared with $137.9 million for the fourth quarter of last year. gross profit was $26.4 million or 25% of net sales, compared with $48.9 million or 35% of net sales for the prior year fourth quarter. r&d expenses declined to $6.0 million from $6.6 million. sg&a expenses declined to $15.5 million from $15.6 million. operating income was $4.9 million, compared with $26.7 million. interest expense increased to $12.1 million from $11.3 million in last year's fourth quarter. net loss was $7.4 million or $0.19 per share versus net income of $13.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share. adjusted ebitda was $12.1 million.
turning to our balance sheet. at june 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $93 million, up from $81 million at march 31. cash increased during the fourth quarter due to a few factors. first, as a result of the refinancing, we did not have a principal payment on our debt. second, relates to working capital improvements that continued from the third quarter. and the third, was the receipt of income tax refunds.
looking ahead, we expect to receive additional income tax refunds continue to benefit from initiatives to improve our working capital and we have no mandatory principal payments on our debt until maturity. accordingly, we expect to maintain a healthy cash position throughout the year and end fiscal 2022 with approximately $80 plus million. as for our liquidity, we also have access to our $45 million credit facility, which today we have not drawn upon.
turning to our guidance, which as tim mentioned earlier, does not include sales of generic advair diskus or zolmitriptan. for fiscal 2022, we expect net sales in the range of $400 million to $440 million, adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales of approximately 23% to 25%, adjusted r&d expense in the range of $26 million to $29 million, adjusted sg&a expense ranging from $58 million to $61 million, adjusted interest expense of approximately $52 million, the full year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%, adjusted ebitda in the range of $40 million to $55 million, and lastly, capital expenditures to be approximately $12 million to $18 million.
regarding the phasing of the quarters, we expect net sales and adjusted ebitda in q1 to be lower than q4, ramping up slightly in q2 and continue to ramp-up more in the second half of fiscal 2022. the increase is related to expected new product launches. gross margin in the first half of the fiscal year to be in the lower range of our outlook, ramping up to the upper end of the range in the second half of fiscal 2022 and operating expenses to remain relatively consistent throughout the year, though, we expect q1 to be slightly higher than the other quarters, as they include certain compensation related expenses that are only recorded at the beginning of our fiscal year.
with that overview, we would now like to address any questions you may have. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from elliot wilbur from raymond james. your line is open.
michael parolari -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, guys. this is actually michael parolari in for elliot. thanks for taking my questions. so first one to get started, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about price and volume pressures on the base business in light of the fda slowdown of approvals and then the limited dollars go into new launches.
and then my second question is just, i saw that you guys were guiding to an adjusted gross margin of 23% to 25%, wondering if the aspirational gross margin target given the expected contribution of the respiratory drugs and insulin is expected to be meaningfully higher moving forward. i know that prior target was low, mid or low-to-mid 30%s on a three-year to five-year basis. so just wondering if that's how we should still be thinking about it? thank you.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
good evening, michael. it's tim. i'll start and then i'll have john fill in for some of the questions in the back end there. first of all, as related to price and volume, volume is pretty consistent in the market over many years, generic prescriptions, although, there's been a bit of a dip relative to some of the covid-19 elements. overall, the vast volume is larger in place. however there has been price pressures, as noted in some of our organization's analytics. there has been increasing number of approvals, particularly older products that has put some pressure on our prices of the older portions of our portfolio. on top, of course, the pressures we felt on our major products which really impacted this most notably this past year.
going forward, we do expect to have significantly improved margins, more in the out-years as those more bespoke larger volume, larger value products. we've talked about expecting net of our partnership royalties to be north of 30% gross margin, that is unchanged and unaffected by the turbulence as it relates to the older products in the portfolio.
robert jaffe -- owner
michael, anything else you want to follow up on that?
michael parolari -- raymond james -- analyst
no. that's it from me. thanks for taking the questions.
robert jaffe -- owner
thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from matt hewitt from craig-hallum. your line is open.
matthew hewitt -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions and for providing the update on the pipeline. kind of following up on the price pressures in particular, it appears that your guidance implies that things have kind of stabilized here. as we look out over the next 12 months, what are you anticipating from a competitive standpoint? i mean, given that you're seeing some competition enter some of these older markets, are you still anticipating more of that, in which case, we should be looking at the lower-end of your range for this upcoming year or is the midpoint considering that you didn't include advair in the guidance range, is that kind of the right starting point? thank you.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
good afternoon, matt. it's tim. the stabilization that you reflect is more structure related to the fact that the very largest products in our portfolio have already experienced significant price pressures, some volume decline and share relinquishment. so the relative declines of those products as it relates to the ongoing launch parade as well as other cost measures that we take in our ongoing production activities results in a little bit more stability. i think that's the first part of your question.
on the second part of the question, advair is not in this year's guidance. and again, as i just noted, when those products do come in our portfolio, we expect them to net after partnership royalties in the 30% or more gross margin range.
matthew hewitt -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
understood. all right. thank you.
operator
and we have no further questions. i will turn the call back over to management for final remarks.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
all right. it's tim again. i'll close out with our customary shout-out to our employees, customers and partners working extra hard in these continuing challenging times, provide high quality, low cost medicines for patients. we look forward to sharing our progress on the next call. good evening.

timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
thanks, robert, and good afternoon, everyone. thank you for joining the call. we have a couple of items of news to report today. in addition to issuing our fiscal 2022 first quarter financial results, we also announced a substantial restructuring and cost reduction plan. i'll discuss both matters in turn. overall, first quarter results were on track. our top line and bottom line were respectively, above and at our expectations, largely due to solid sales of several key products. our gross margin, however, was lower than anticipated, primarily due to growing competitive pressures on our base portfolio. turning to our balance sheet. our cash position increased to more than $105 million as of september 30, 2021, up from approximately $93 million at june 30, 2021. we continue to emphasize the importance of our cash position as we believe it affords a strategic flexibility in how we run our business, maintaining adequate cash levels to support our operational needs, the launch of our durable product pipeline remains a key focus. meanwhile, as often mentioned across the industry, we are operating in a particularly competitive environment, especially for oral generics. the market generally and some of our products such as probenecid, esomeprazole, levothyroxine tablets and chlorpromazine specifically, have been deteriorating more quickly than the declines we had anticipated.
this environment certainly reverses our pivot toward expanding our portfolio to include more durable assets, such as the three respiratory and two insulin products in our pipeline. however, we do not expect the current competitive environment to abate in the near term. while we are disappointed in the accelerating declines, we are taking actions to address the current competitive environment: first, we have revised down our fiscal 2022 guidance; and second, while preserving our core portfolio strategies, we are taking immediate and proactive steps to make lannett a leaner and more focused organization. so with that, let's turn to the restructuring and cost reduction plan we announced earlier today. again, our plan retains our core strategies while further optimizing our operations, improving efficiencies and reducing costs. the plan will be implemented in phases, and we expect we will be completed in about 18 months. key elements of the plan include, first, consolidating our manufacturing footprint from two facilities to 1. this includes transferring liquid drug production to our main plant in seymour, indiana from our facility in carmel, new york. and closing the carmel plant once relevant products are transferred and pursuing its sale. we are already in active discussions with several potential parties.
our seymour plant will be strengthened in this process by increasing the technologies it supports and expanded its portfolio with smaller volume but decent margin liquid products, thus further optimizing our overall network. the second element of the restructuring plan involves the r&d function. this includes reducing headcount and eliminating development formerly dedicated to the carmel site and discontinuing future development programs targeting liquid generic medications as we no longer see adequately scaled returns in that sector. we will also raise product threshold requirements and start internally developed products and api selection earlier. the goal of which is to focus on fewer, potentially larger market opportunity products and come to market as part of the so-called first wave of generics. we will continue to be a targeted generic manufacturer focused on attractive, select internal development areas where we believe we can successfully compete. but we will scale those investments to what the business can support today and continue to augment our pipeline with durable partnered assets like generic advair and insulin. and the third element of the restructuring plan is further rationalizing over time as we have in the past, certain lower-margin products.
this particular exercise primarily involves scaling back or phasing out some low-margin and low-volume otc products that were made at carmel and two very low-margin prescription products. ultimately, the plan is expected to result in a workforce reduction of approximately 11% from current levels. another 3% or so of the workforce, mainly at the plant, we expect not to replace as attrition occurs. other existing vacancies will also not be filled. in total, we anticipate cost savings approximately $20 million annually. so now let's turn to our pipeline. while we tend to focus on the potentially transformational value of our durable pipeline, there are a number of interesting pipeline assets that could be launched before the end of next fiscal year, including subflooring, sulfate oral solution, sumatriptan and flutamide. and our business development team is hard at work to secure more. we currently have approximately 12 andas pending at the fda, including partner products, plus three additional products that are approved and pending launch. we also have more than 20 products in development and expect to add more from both external and internal efforts. with regard to our large, durable partnered product pipeline, i'll provide an update on two of the 5, starting with our generic advair diskus product.
the fda provided mid-cycle disciplined review comments on the pending anda. and we are working to address the fda's helpful comments and intend to respond to as many of the agency's request as possible before the fda due dates. we expect to receive additional comments from the fda on the fda assigned goal date of january 31, 2022. as previously disclosed, we expect the product to undergo more than one review cycle. we believe and we're planning for a launch that is possible next fiscal year. i'd note the application approval is also contingent on a successful fda inspection of the overseas facilities involved. the cro site that conducted the bioequivalence and clinical studies has already been inspected by the fda and the observations they shared, we believe are addressable. given inspection backlogs due to covid-19, we appreciate the parent -- priority fda has assigned to these inspections. we have formally asked the fda to schedule an inspection of the manufacturing site and look forward to their visit in the near future. regarding our biosimilar insulin glargine product. we remain on track for submitting the investigational new drug ind application next month and commencing the pivotal trial around march 2022.
while there are always execution risks, we expect to launch this product in fiscal year 2024. in terms of our expectations for next year's clinical trial, we are not aware of a u.s. trial failure of a well-characterized biosimilar. and at this point, we believe our product is well characterized and highly similar based on the results of our structural and functional assays. those assays have been early reviewed by the fda. we are also seeing positive trends in formulary decisions for 2022, demonstrating payers continued effort to pursue affordable insulin. express scripts has added viatris' biosimilar and interchangeable insulin glargine, semglee as a preferred product for 2022 on one of their formularies. in addition, florida, illinois and texas have included walmart's relion insulin as a preferred product on their 2022 state medicaid formularies. we will continue to monitor how payers adopt biosimilar and interchangeable insulins as we develop our go-to-market plans. all five of the durable products in our pipeline are differentiated from the average oral generic product that are under the aforementioned industry pressures because of the significant technical expertise required for development and the substantial and largely dedicated plant investments needed to manufacture them.
so for all of these products, we expect only a handful of competitors and thus more durable value. also, as noted on the last call, we are evaluating and in negotiations for additional market and product opportunities for insulin and drug device inhalation products. there continues to be additional multibillion dollar markets to pursue in these areas with both current and future partners. when combined with our targeted internal development efforts, we believe we have built and continue to expand an exciting pipeline of opportunities. one brief comment on legal matters. we have earlier reached a settlement agreement with genus lifesciences related to our numbrino product. while the terms of the settlement are confidential, the various court challenges levied by genus related to the product and our right to market it have all been dismissed. to sum up today's remarks, we have reported better-than-expected top line for the quarter. we have revised down our fiscal 2022 guidance to reflect the increasingly competitive environment for a base oral generics portfolio. however, our cash levels remain substantial. our core strategies remain in place, and we have begun implementing restructuring plans to become a leaner, more focused organization. the plan is expected to be completed in approximately 18 months and generate annual cost savings of approximately $20 million.
our pending generic advair diskus anda continues to make its way through the fda review process. we expect to submit an ind application for biosimilar insulin glargine next month and commenced the pivotal trial around march of 2022. we anticipate both these and our other durable assets can contribute significantly to our future sales. and one final comment. we appreciate the frustrations our investors may have over the pressures we are now forecasting in our near-term results. we are keenly aware of our current stock and bond valuations. however, our optimism on future expectations remains quite high. our durable pipeline of exciting opportunities are steadily progressing, and we believe we have the capabilities, discipline and resources to get them to market over the next few years. with that in mind, our management and our board will continue to carefully consider various options looking to enhance investor value across the near, immediate and longer term.
with all of that, i'll turn the call over to john. john?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
thanks, tim, and good afternoon, everyone. i'll begin with our financial results on a non-gaap adjusted basis. for the 2022 first quarter, net sales were $101.5 million compared with $126.5 million for the first quarter of last year. gross profit was $20.6 million or 20% of net sales compared with $34.4 million or 27% of net sales for the prior year first quarter. interest expense increased to $12.8 million from $11.2 million. net loss was $10.6 million or $0.27 per share versus net income of $2.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share. adjusted ebitda was $10.0 million. turning to our balance sheet. at september 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $105 million, up from $93 million at june 30. cash increased during the first quarter due to a few factors: first, as a result of our refinancing earlier this year, we did not have any required debt interest or principal payments in q1; the second relates to timing of certain inflows and outflows of cash; and the third was the receipt of a prescription drug fee refund. looking ahead, we expect to receive additional income tax refunds, continue to benefit from initiatives to improve our working capital, and we have no mandatory principal payments on our debt until maturity. accordingly, we expect to maintain a healthy cash position of $80 million plus through the end of fiscal 2022.
as for our liquidity, we also have access to our $45 million credit facility, which to date, we have not drawn upon. turning to our revised guidance. for fiscal 2022, we now expect net sales in the range of $370 million to $400 million, down from $400 million to $440 million. adjusted gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, of approximately 19% to 21%, down from approximately 23% to 25%. adjusted r&d expense in the range of $25 million to $28 million, down from $26 million to $29 million. adjusted sg&a expense ranging from $55 million to $58 million, down from $58 million to $61 million. adjusted interest expense of approximately $52 million, unchanged. the full year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%, up from 21% to 22%. adjusted ebitda in the range of $22 million to $32 million, down from $40 million to $55 million. and lastly, capital expenditures to be approximately $10 million to $14 million, down from $12 million to $18 million. regarding the phasing of the quarters, we expect net sales and adjusted ebitda in q2 to be lower than q1, ramping up slightly in the second half of fiscal 2022, with q4 net sales and adjusted ebitda to approximate q1. this reflects the new product launches we've previously discussed combined with the initial benefits from the cost restructuring. gross margin to decline slightly in q2 and q3 from q1. we expect q4 gross margin to be higher than q1 as the restructuring plan begins to take effect. and r&d expected to increase from q1 and sg&a to decrease from q1.
with that overview, we would now like to address any questions you may have. operator?

[operator instructions] we have a question from scott henry from roth capital.
scott henry -- roth capital -- analyst
just a couple of questions. first, i think you might have hit on this a little bit. but obviously, there was some revenue upside in q1 and some downside the rest of the year. can you talk about what products drove the upside and where the weakness is coming from going forward?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
hi, scott, this is john. so the upside for the quarter was the strength in infectious diseases, specifically posaconazole. we had talked about that category coming down in q1, and we saw it relatively even actually ticking up a little bit. and that is still though being forecast to come down now in q2 significantly and hold that for the remainder of the year. so that was the majority of the difference.
scott henry -- roth capital -- analyst
okay. and then the downside, the rest of the year?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
again, the downside rest of the year would be the posaconazole competition and infectious disease is coming down again significantly. but across the categories, we're still seeing strong competition, which are bringing down each category down by a bit. you're seeing that in antipsychosis, which came down to a little below $4 million, which is a continuous decline from q4. other also came down a little bit. some of that was around probenecid, which was discussed a little bit earlier. and numbrino is still seeing sales that are less than what we were -- what we would call a more normalized number, which is -- and it's running about a little bit less than half of that.
scott henry -- roth capital -- analyst
okay. and then contract manufacturing, not that particularly relevant, but we do have to model it. way down, should we expect that to stay down? are you prioritizing away from that?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
again, it's not a matter of prioritization and there's some ebbs and flows in there. it's -- the run rate may come up a little bit with some increases toward the back end of the year.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
i would note, scott, it's tim here, that toward the end of last year, one of our contract manufacturing opportunities concluded, and that was part of the step down. we still are open for business and appreciate those sort of opportunities, but they're smaller this year than last year.
scott henry -- roth capital -- analyst
okay. and then if i could shift to the pipeline. you talked about the advair diskus fda meeting. we know that it was going to take multiple cycles, but that specific meeting, if you can, can you characterize whether it went about as planned? did it go better than expected or worse than expected? just so we can get a sense of how it's moving along relative to expectations.
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
all right. just to be clear, it wasn't an fda meeting, we noted in the script that there was disciplined review letters that come back from the various parts of the fda that reviewed those applications. there is quite a few comments that come from a file of this complexity. and we have been working on those responses. i don't think there was too much in those disciplined reviews that were surprising to us. we believe we can respond to most of them shortly. some of them take a bit longer and thus will reappear in a -- in what we call the crl, complete response letter, that we'd expect in january. all in all, i think we are where we want to be and need to continue to work with the fda, including the overseas inspection of the facility to get this product into next fiscal year.
scott henry -- roth capital -- analyst
okay. and question on thalidomide. i haven't heard about that in a little while. where exactly does that r&d program stand currently?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
so, scott, we have earlier disclosed that but for an api, we believe we are in an approvable state. there has been some progression at that suppliers situation in their facility, suggesting that they will have resolution of the fda concern with the api. and therefore, we noted in our script that this product could come back into our forecasting for next fiscal year.
scott henry -- roth capital -- analyst
okay. and then just a final question. the ebitda guidance certainly down for the rest of the year, particularly if i pull out the stronger first quarter, that ebitda number is pretty significantly below the interest expense number, even if not cash interest expense. what are your thoughts on that in terms of kind of bridging that gap? and is there any risk to any covenants? i know you're sitting on a lot of cash, but sometimes the debt covenants can be cumbersome. anything, anywhere that you would comment on?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
well, scott, we'll start with the debt covenants as part of our refinancing from last year. the financial covenants was removed. it's not included in our new agreements. so that's not a concern, provide us the flexibility that we needed. and to bridge for this year, there's one large item that's included in our overall cash flow expectations. that's the significant tax refund that we're expecting to receive sometime in the third quarter. that's currently on our balance sheet for a little bit more than $30 million. that helps bridge some of the cash flows with the declining ebitda.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
scott, just to add, as john noted in the script, we are forecasting a cash balance in excess of $80 million at the end of this fiscal year. and of course, the restructuring itself will start improving our cash flows as it comes into full effect later this year.
operator
our next question comes from elliot wilbur from raymond james.
tim smith -- raymond james -- analyst
this is tim smith [phonetic] calling on behalf of elliott wilbur. and i'd like to ask a few questions. first, are you facing any potential delays to reaching target gross margin above 30% within your previous target within the next three to five years?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
so the gross margin that we have talked about toward the end of our strategic plan in 2025 are clearly driven by the emergence into our in line from our current pipeline, the bespoke and larger durable assets. to the extent those products are successfully launched, their in-market margins are quite a bit higher than 30s, but we, of course, have -- were expected to be higher -- well higher than the 30s. but we, of course, have margin sharing agreements with those partners, which brings it back down into that sort of range. so while the pressures on our near-term portfolio are being reflected in our near-term results, most of those products would have had lower margin and significantly lower margins by the time we launch. so our overall expectations for 2025 have not changed a great deal from last quarter. it's the near-term results that we're facing those pressures, and we remain optimistic about our pipeline in the out years.
tim smith -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. great. also, can you please talk about the trends in base generics erosion both volume and price? and how does that trend in this most recent quarter?
john kozlowski -- vice president of finance and chief financial officer
so the market, as we've said, has been competitive. we clearly don't talk to pricing specifically on any sort of public forum or private when outside of our own company. but the competitive environment is fundamentally reflecting more supply out there and not a lot of new generics and both of those trends has been putting the pressures into the -- to our results. and i think you're seeing those same comments across most of the industry for the generic portfolios that are being discussed in the quarterly results.
operator
and now i would like to hand the call back to management for final remarks.
timothy c. crew -- chief executive officer
all right. it's tim again. thanks again for joining the call, and thanks to our employees, customers and partners still working hard in challenging times to provide high-quality, low-cost medicines for our patients. we look forward to sharing our progress on our next call and some of you perhaps at the upcoming investor conferences, which we'll be at this quarter and into next. have a good night.
