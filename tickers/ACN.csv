thank you. (operator instructions) your first question comes from the line of ashwin shirvaikar from citi. please go ahead.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
thank you. good morning, david. good morning, kc.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
good morning, ashwin. thank you.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
i wanted to start with a question on bookings, which seem to, with the book-to-bill lower than 1 seem to have decelerated a bit, particularly when i looked at the comment that says 65% of bookings are in the new implies a third is from legacy services. is this what sort of where you have a need to provide clients with higher productivity requirements? is this a trend we should be looking at more carefully in the future because that's what affects bookings growth? and in the new, as that grows, is there a visibility question we should be asking with regards to a higher cloud component or a higher agile development component? does that also bring with it lower visibility?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
okay. thanks, ashwin. let me just cover a lot of the questions there you had on bookings. so maybe i'll first start with -- as i mentioned, bookings really were in the range that we expected, and they were quite well balanced and we like that they are about 65% in the new. and so just as a reminder, you know this well for covering our so long, bookings can be lumpy by quarter. so you see that in our results this year where we have really strong bookings -- record bookings in q2. but there are historical patterns. we've always had some lumpiness and variability quarter-to-quarter in bookings. so, as it relates to what we're seeing, the second half is really playing out largely as expected. we like our position where we are year-to-date. it really is where we anticipated that we would be this time of the year. and so then looking forward and talking about your visibility question, based on the strength of our pipeline and the visibility that we do have, we do see stronger bookings in q4. there is not really an element of the new that impacts that visibility. we like that we have the majority of our bookings in the new, and we feel that we're really well positioned based on where we are to-date with what we can see for q4 bookings to be well positioned for next year. and i think that really just points to, as you were talking about, our offerings, the relevance of our offerings and our capabilities in the marketplace.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
got it. and then with the anticipated improvement in financial services, that's good to see that come through. looking forward, is it -- should we assume that that continues to step up?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, as you said, we were also pleased with the uptick in financial services that we saw this quarter. and that did come in as expected, and i did note, and i will say again that we are particularly pleased with our strong growth in north america and the continued double-digit growth that we have in the growth markets. and -- while europe did contract, it is -- we did see improvement in banking, capital markets. and as it relates to what we think for the rest of the year, we still see the second half of the year and financial services being stronger than the first half of the year, which is what we had anticipated. and you see the first part of that happening in q3.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
got it. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of tien-tsin huang from jp morgan. please go ahead.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys. how are you?
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
good morning, tien-tsin. how are you?
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan -- analyst
i'm good. i'm good. i'm good. i'll -- let me ask on the margin side. it looks like gross margin drove the raise in margin guidance. is that correct? and what would you attribute that to? is it favorable mix, pricing, contracts execution? it looks like you did bump it up overall.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
so -- hi, tien-tsin. as you know, we really do run our business first of all to operating margins. so that's really how we manage the business. and the first thing that we do look at though within gross margin is how our contract profitability is performing. and overall, for both the quarter and for the year, we're happy with our improvement in contract profitability. and that really does also (ph) with pricing, right? so, as we have more and more of our work in the new and in the -- and in the areas where we see strong demand and where we have highly differentiated skills, we do see that we're able to price at a better rate than in other areas. so you'll see that that is part of what's driving our gross margin, which is in fact a part -- a big part of driving operating margin. it's also important to note, though, even within gross margin, we do have our investments, and that's really key for what we're doing. so, again, that's why we run our business in operating margin, but from quarter to quarter, you also -- we are also absorbing investments in our people, in our business, in our gross margin as well.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. that's healthy. then on -- just to follow up on ashwin's question on bookings, just the lumpiness there. is it -- not to simplify it, but is it a -- can we attribute that to just normalization given the outperformance you saw in the prior quarter and the time required to refill the pipeline, but then obviously bookings came by quite strong last quarter?
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
yeah, it's -- tien-tsin, let me just jump in because this -- you will remember -- some may remember. this became a little bit of an -- maybe even an unnecessary distraction in quarter one. and just to make sure that maybe we're even more clear on our messaging, so let me just say that we are very, very pleased with the demand environment. so let's be clear on that. that's reflected in our revenue growth year-to-date. it's reflected in the revenue growth that we see in the new. it's reflected in what we feel is a very strong pipeline position as we closed out the third quarter. and it's reflected in our statement and our confidence that we will have strong bookings in the fourth quarter. so, to be clear, we're not concerned about bookings. bookings do vary by quarter. very often, it can be influenced by the timing of when large deals close, and in the scheme of our big business, if we have deals that close in the month of june, let's say, as opposed to a few weeks early in the month of may, obviously, that don't make any difference in the health of our business and what we see from a demand standpoint. so we're very encouraged by the demand environment. and as kc said, the bookings are lumpy as they have always been in our business, and i would focus more on the confidence that we have in the fourth quarter than i would the fact that quarter three, it was at $10.6 billion.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. message delivered. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of bryan keane from deutsche bank. please go ahead.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi guys. good morning.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
hi bryan.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
hi bryan.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
and congrats on the solid results. i just wanted to ask about strategy and consulting. i know in the past it hovered around mid single digits. then it bumped up a little bit, went as high as double digits, and then now, i think it decelerated a tad in mid single digit. so could you just talk a little bit about maybe the ups and downs of that business and the slight deceleration we saw in the quarter?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, bryan. so, overall, as you mentioned, we do feel good about our business in strategy and consulting and we do feel good about mid-single-digit growth. and we did have very solid bookings this quarter as well. and as you mentioned, growth will ebb and flow from quarter to quarter. and really, as we look at our strategy and consulting business, just a reminder that there is really kind of a dual-purpose of what we're trying to accomplish there. first of all is just the main objective of the role of delivering strategy and consulting work to our clients. but then, also it's really to bring, as you know, the full scope of our end-to-end services. a lot of the overall transformation work and any of the larger-scale deals in the pipeline that we may have are also led by and brought by our strategy and consulting business. so, in that context, as we stated before, we see strategy and combined, if it's in the mid to high single digits and that will ebb and flow by quarter, we think that's in the right zone for us.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. helpful. and as a follow-up, wanted to ask about the acquisition. it sounds like it's been about $1.1 billion capital deployed in acquisitions. can you just talk about how much you plan to spend in acquisitions? and as we go into next year, are we still thinking 1 point or 2 of acquisitions kind of as a revenue contribution -- is kind of the right metric to think about?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. so maybe i'll just give some of the financial data and david can talk a little bit more on that. so overall for this fiscal year, we think that we will probably spend based on where we are to-date, probably closer to $1.3 billion in acquisitions -- for acquisitions. and overall for this year, then, we believe based on what we've seen in the pipeline that we have in front of us and the deals we've already closed, we think the revenue -- the inorganic revenue contribution this year will be closer to 2% from the closer to 1.5% that we had previously mentioned.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
yeah. and i would say just in terms of how to think about this going forward, our inorganic strategy, or our acquisition strategy, as we've said through the year, is really using inorganic as an engine for organic growth. that continues to be a focus area for us and that will -- that is a strategic objective will -- is really unchanged as we look forward. and really, if you look at what we've done year-to-date, it's -- i'm really pleased with how we've executed that. over -- i think over about 80% of what we've done is focused on the new. we've done of course several deals in interactive, as i called out, but we've also done deals in both industry x.0 and applied intelligence. we've also done several deals in accenture technology, in both our intelligent platform services where we were strengthening our skills and differentiation in a few of the platforms. and then we've also done deals to acquire high-end software engineering capabilities, again, in our intelligent software engineering services. and then to round it out, as will always be the case, we have a handful of deals in the mix that are vertical specific. and it's interesting, then, just as an illustration of the importance of banking and capital markets to us over the long haul as an important industry, we've made several investments in banking during this period of time. so this will be an important part of our strategy, and you should really expect more of the same as we look forward.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, helpful. thanks for taking the questions.

your next question comes from the line of lisa ellis from moffettnathanson. please go ahead.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
good morning, lisa.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
good morning. so i think a question actually on the non-new. i guess i'd say looking at performance of some of your peers over the last few months, one of the notable, sort of striking observations is that some of the traditional services appear to be deteriorating. and so i'm just hoping you could unpack for us a little bit in the accenture's non-new, so meaning the other 35% or so. just remind us a little bit what exactly is in there and sort of what trends are you seeing in that -- in those traditional services. thank you.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
yeah. first of all, from a business trend standpoint, we haven't -- we really haven't seen a change in the pattern at all. if you were to -- even -- if you just took the information that we provide, you could extrapolate that -- the 35% is declining, let's say in the single-digit range, and that's a pattern that we've seen now for some time. and so to be clear, all of our growth -- and this is by design -- comes from our rotation to the new and the success that we've had in driving those services. in many ways, we are -- in some instances, we are actually accelerating that because we are, in the interest of our clients, for example, we're taking some legacy services, think legacy application maintenance type services, and we are introducing new technology to do that work in a more innovative way. and in doing so, you see those legacy services and application maintenance, as an example, decline, but that is by design. you might say we're cannibalizing ourselves, which is in support of our strategy, but we also do it in delivering value to our clients. the other thing that you have in the new, and that -- and this is not to say that this is -- this is not to comment on market demand, but you do have a lot of, let's say, more traditional classic consulting services would be in the new. and while there is still demand for some of those classic consulting services, where our real opportunity is and where we're really focusing on our skills, capabilities and serving our clients is the strategy and consulting services tied to work that we do in the new. and so the classic services are less -- have less focus, therefore less growth because we're doing everything rotated to the new. so hopefully that -- but we really -- the bottom line is we really haven't seen any change in the dynamic of the growth rate in the non-new versus the growth in the new, and it's really happening exactly as we intend per our strategy.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
got it. okay, terrific. thank you. that's helpful. and maybe a quick one for kc. it looks like attrition ticks back up a little bit this quarter. can you just comment on what you're seeing on the labor front? thank you. thanks, guys.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, it is at 80%. it is -- it's in a range, though, that we have been before, lisa. so overall, 80% is not something that we're concerned about. but i would like to say that within that, if i peel back a little bit, i do feel really good -- and we feel really good about the strong retention rates that we have in the areas that david just talked, a lot of the strategic and high growth areas of our business, including strategy and consulting as well as many other components of the new. and just to -- maybe just to close out, as a reminder, we really have no issues in getting the talent that we need. we are really quite a magnet for talent. we -- based on the strategy that we have, our financial performance is attractive, and overall, our talent strategy and the experience that we provide to our people, the right workplace and our culture of culture strategy, it's really an environment where innovation is at the heart of everything that we do, and that's very attractive to many people in the workplace.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
terrific. thanks. thanks, guys. good to talk to you.

your next question comes from the line of dave koning from baird. please go ahead.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
oh, yeah. hey guys. thank you. and i guess my first question -- i know in the details you sent out, the new has been over 60% now for four quarters. the prior seven quarters, it's stepped up every single quarter. and i think you did call out on this call, it's more like 60% now. but is there any reason that that pace of like change into the new seems to maybe be slowing? i know the growth is really good, but is there anything changing at all there?
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
i don't think there's anything changing. i mean, i think you're going to see as we -- as we continue to talk about the new in the quarters ahead, i think you're going to see the same type of trend line in terms of what -- how it increases as a percentage of our revenue. so, i think as we get to the fourth quarter, we're -- we typically round the number that we quote externally. and so i think you'll see the typical pattern continue to evolve.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
okay. that's great. and the other thing, just -- i know it sounds like the environment remains strong. it hasn't changed a lot. but the last seven, eight quarters or so have been kind of in the 8% to 11% constant currency. and i think you're kind of guiding 5% to 8% or so in q4. is that kind of the typical, set the bar to somewhere that's pretty easy to hit and if you execute well you kind of beat that? or is there something a little different maybe related to the bookings this quarter that you're just trying to be a little more conservative?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey dave. i don't -- i would say that i wouldn't characterize our guidance range is any different in terms of our practice. i mean, as you know, so the 5% to 8% for q4 we always tend to aim. we aim toward the upper end of that range. that's no different than what we have historically done and what we always try to do. and there is not really any difference within -- because of the bookings in q3 or what we see in q4, i mean, i think it's pretty much our standard way of looking at the quarter and giving the right balance that we believe, the revenue expectation we would want to set with all of you.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
got you. all right. well, thank you. good job.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of edward caso from wells fargo. please go ahead.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
good morning, ed.
edward caso -- wells fargo -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my call here. i wanted to ask about non-linear growth with your headcount now at 481,000. and it seems like a lot more of the digital world is sort of platforms and non-people-based solutions. and could you talk about your investments in that area and where you see it maybe going as a percent of revenue? thank you.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
we have talked about that before and, ed, at the level that i guess is appropriate for us to talk about in this forum, i'll say again that certainly, we believe that non-linear growth over time will be more in the mix. you are right that platform-based solutions, bringing ip to the table, solution aids, et cetera, of which i referenced several in my script are increasingly a bigger part of the services industry and increasingly a bigger part of our differentiation. and so -- over time, we will be focused even more, and i'm sure will become even better at capturing the value of the ip and the solution aids, et cetera, that we bring to our clients to deliver services and deliver value to our clients. the pace at which it happens is harder to predict. we are quite comfortable as we look forward in terms of our ability to manage the saas talent organization we have. and as we look out, as you would expect we do, over a multiyear horizon, there is not anything about the progression of our headcount that concerns us in terms of executing our business strategy. so non-linear growth i think will be more in the mix in the industry, and i would expect accenture would lead the way. but the timing and the slope of the curve i think is still yet to be defined and we'll see how that plays out.
edward caso -- wells fargo -- analyst
right. the other question, i think in the past you might have given us a view on the fx for the coming fiscal year, f '20. i wonder if you could help us out in that department (inaudible) your initial views on the fx headwind or benefit in f '20.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. hi ed. we won't provide any fy '20 guidance including fx until we get the full fy '20 guidance that we typically do at the end of our fourth quarter.

your next question comes from the line of rod bourgeois from deepdive equity. please go ahead.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
hi rod.
rod bourgeois -- deepdive equity research -- analyst
hey there.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
hi rod.
rod bourgeois -- deepdive equity research -- analyst
hey there. good to talk to you guys. i wanted to ask how you're feeling about the trends in valuations that you're paying for acquisitions. maybe you can talk about how you're performing against your roi targets for your average acquisition that you've completed in recent history.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
as we've said before, we are very rigorous in tracking our return on our investment for our acquisitions. we -- as a management team, we do it very rigorously, and we actually review that with the finance committee of the board every quarter, and so it is a big focus. and as i've said before, we are really pleased with the performance of our portfolio and really have been for the last several years as we really started to ramp up our game in this area. as it relates to valuations, in certain areas of the market which you know well, valuations have gotten pretty frothy, and we consider that as we do the analysis of buy versus build. we're not going to be -- we will never be irrational and overpaying for an asset in the market. but on the other hand, if -- we also look at things through a strategic lens and we understand that if something has significant strategic value and there is a scarcity of the skill in the marketplace, then we make the judgment about paying a little bit more in those instances, and there's been instances where we've done that. so, as you would expect of us, rod, we are extremely thoughtful. there are areas like applied intelligence -- in the analytics space, for example, where --and you know this -- where the valuations are super-high. industry x and in some areas there, the valuations are super high. and so we -- we navigate that within our financial objectives. again, we have a willingness where it's -- where it is the right strategic play. but by and large -- we focus on valuation because we're very return focused in the way we execute our strategy.
rod bourgeois -- deepdive equity research -- analyst
got it. that makes sense. hey, just to follow up on the outlook in consulting growth versus outsourcing growth. i was impressed last quarter with the strength in outsourcing growth, and it upticked again this quarter, while consulting slowed a little bit. so is your outlook for growth in consulting versus outsourcing at a similar clip? or do you expect one to look stronger than the other in the next few quarters as you look at what's happening in the pipeline?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. so, rod, i'll -- let me give you a little bit of color on how we see that playing out in fy '19. so, for the fourth quarter, we think consulting and outsourcing are both going to be about mid to high single digits growth. and that would put for the full year, both consulting and outsourcing, at a high-single-digit growth range.
rod bourgeois -- deepdive equity research -- analyst
all right. great. thank you, guys.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
okay. thanks, rod.

your next question comes from the line of james friedman from susquehanna. please go ahead.
james friedman -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
hi. thank you, guys.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
jamie.
james friedman -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
hi. it's jamie, susquehanna. david, thanks for the deep dive on accenture technology. you articulated dimensions of intelligent platform, intelligence software, engineering and cloud and infrastructure. i was wondering can you help us -- i know you said that intelligent platforms is 40% of revenue, big number. i was wondering -- can you give us some sense of the sizes of the other two?
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
i don't think -- we've not communicated that externally. and i don't think i want to do that on this particular call. but we will -- we take that point. and we have anticipated that we will start to introduce some quantitative numbers behind those parts of our business. but right now, it's a little bit premature to do that. but expect that we'll do that as we move forward.
james friedman -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
so, maybe a different direction then. kc, you commented in your observations about the operating groups that the platforms which david had described in his prepared remarks is populated very well in cmt. or you said it was like a driver of growth -- software and platform is still the driver growth in cmt. is -- could you give us an idea of how we would -- the presence of, say, platforms in the other operating groups, do they over-index in any other operating groups?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
jamie, thanks for that question because that provides a good opportunity to make sure that we're clear with the use of the word platform maybe. so, platforms as david was talking about -- that we talk about quite a bit, they are pervasive in all parts of our business, all operating groups, all geographies, in all parts of our business dimension. so that's what we talk about when we discuss platforms.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
and by the way, again, in that case, when we talk about the platforms, that's the work that we do around sap, microsoft, oracle, salesforce and workday, as this -- and we refer to that as our intelligent platform services business. it's the work we do around those platforms, platform in that context.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
right. so that's all five of those, and that is pervasive everywhere. what i commented specifically, jamie, on cmt, cmt has three industry groups that make up the operating group of cmt, one of which is called software and platforms. so i know that -- it's a use of the platform's name twice, but that's why i specifically called that out within cmt. but most importantly, the ips that david talked about, the five platforms that we quantify in ips, intelligent platform services, are pervasive everywhere.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
yeah. so in cmt, it was the industry segment reference she was making as a driver of growth.
james friedman -- susquehanna financial group -- analyst
i got you. i got what i was (inaudible). okay. thanks for the clarification, guys. appreciate the context.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of jason kupferberg from bank of america. please go ahead.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
hey jason.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. so just to clarify on the comment about bookings improving in q4. do you mean in absolute terms? do you mean the book-to-bill? do you mean acceleration in year-over-year growth? would it be all of the above?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. it's pretty much all of the above. i mean, mainly i'm focusing on -- in absolute terms, but it would generally be all the above.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, ok. got it. and just on accenture interactive, obviously you mentioned all the deal activity there, which is quite interesting. wanted to see if we can just get an update on how fast that business is growing organically or the annualized revenue run rate of it. i know you've talked about it in some investor days in the past. i know you've been getting a little bit bigger on the agency record side there. so i was just hoping to get a general update qualitatively and quantitatively on that part of the new.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
yeah. so, we -- the last time we sized it, it was for fy '18 and it was $8.5 billion. and when you look at this business this year, it has continued to grow strong double-digit growth. and if i pare it the way pierre would have said it, i mean, very strong double-digit growth. so you can think of it as -- as not in the teens but higher than that. and that growth continues. and of course, within that, as important as the acquisitions are and how we've executed our growth strategy and the context of a $8.5-plus billion business, the vast, vast, vast majority of that growth of course is organic. and so it is fundamentally an organic driven business, where we have used these strategic acquisitions as really an igniter, if you will, of the organic growth, and what -- which ultimately led to the scale of $8.5 plus billion.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. i appreciate the comments.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
sure.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
greg, we have time for one more question, and then david will wrap up the call.
operator
okay. that question comes from the line of bryan bergin from cowen. please go ahead.
bryan bergin -- cowen & co. -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you. i wanted to follow up on the margin question from earlier (ph). so, you've had solid performance this year. can you comment on what's being done differently this year to yield that margin expansion really getting back on track with your model versus last year? kc, i think you called out contract profitability earlier, but any other particular factors that are standing out?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
i think -- thanks for the question, bryan. we're really focused, as i mentioned before, on pricing, right. so we're always focused on pricing. and i talked about this a little bit last quarter. we -- that's nothing new. but we continue to really be taking a look at our business in terms of getting the right value for the offerings that we're bringing and pricing as the right way in the marketplace to benefit both us but also as well as to make sure that we're doing the right arrangements for our clients. so i think that's really what i would say is, the difference that is yielding probably most of the power within our margins is what we're able to do in pricing.
bryan bergin -- cowen & co. -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then just to close out here on industry x.0. it seems like peers are also emphasizing connected products and iot here with a pickup in recent deals. can you give us an update just on that business? how you see the space, how you feel about the outlook and then any metrics you can share yet on that business?
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
i mean, it is a -- it is central to our strategy. we are super-excited about the potential in industry x. we've said that many times before. it is -- relative to accenture interactive, which still has a big growth proposition in front of it, x is lower on the maturity curve, if you will, and so there is a lot of runway front of industry x.0. it's a -- in many ways, it's still relatively immature. but we are working hard to be positioned right at the heart of that wave, and we've -- and we're well positioned now to be a leader in that wave. so we are very focused on it. it is a top shortlist strategic objective, and we're excited about the market potential.
bryan bergin -- cowen & co. -- analyst
thank you.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
all right. thank you. okay. so, thanks again for joining us on today's call. and as you can tell, we feel very good about where we are and confident in our ability to finish the year strong. with our highly differentiated capabilities, continued investments across accenture and disciplined execution of our growth strategy, we're very well positioned to continue delivering profitable growth and significant value to all of our stakeholders. we look forward to talking with you again next quarter, and in the meantime, if you have any questions, as always, please feel free to call angie and her team, and hope all of you have a great day. thanks.

david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
thank you, angie, and thanks so much to all of you for joining us on today's call.
accenture delivered another strong quarter, and i couldn't be more pleased with our overall performance as we continue to execute our growth strategy and create significant value for all of our stakeholders, our clients, employees and shareholders. we again delivered revenue growth well ahead of the market as well as strong profitability and free cash flow, while continuing to make substantial investments for long-term market leadership.
here are a few of the highlights for the quarter. we delivered new bookings of $10.6 billion, which was in the range we expected. we generated record revenues of $11.1 billion, at the top of our guided range, with 8.4% growth in local currency. we delivered earnings per share of $1.93, an 8% increase compared to adjusted earnings per share last year. operating margin was 15.5%, an expansion of 20 basis points. our free cash flow was very strong at $2 billion, and we returned $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through our share repurchases and the payment of our semi-annual dividend. so all in all, it was another strong quarter by any measure.
looking forward, i feel very good about our business and our ability to deliver a strong fourth quarter, and in doing so, to complete what will be another truly outstanding year for accenture.
now let me hand it over to kc, who will review the numbers in greater detail. kc?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thank you, david, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call.
let me start by saying we were very pleased with our third quarter results, which were aligned to our expectations and were strong across many dimensions of our business.
once again, our results demonstrate the power of our highly differentiated growth strategy. as we have often stated, a key intent of our growth strategy is to create durability and our revenue growth at a level that is consistently above the market, taking share and strengthening our position as a leader. against this objective, we have created a unique footprint that includes scale and leadership in the world's largest and most critical geographic markets in the industry. this footprint, along with our highly relevant offerings, delivered within our end-to-end service model, is key to being a market leader and helping our clients rotate to the new.
our third quarter and year-to-date results are an illustration of our growth model in action. and based on the strength of our results and the confidence and the visibility we have in our fourth quarter, we are increasing key elements of our full year outlook, which i will cover in more detail later in the call. importantly, our results and updated guidance reflect very strong execution against our three financial imperatives for driving superior shareholder value.
revenue growth of 8.4% in local currency in the third quarter continued to be driven by strong double-digit growth in all three areas of the new, including digital, cloud and security-related services. this strong top line growth was broad-based with several areas growing double digits or high single digits. revenues landed in the range we expected, and importantly, we did see the anticipated improvement in financial services and the us federal business.
operating margin of 15.5% expanded 20 basis points for the quarter and reflects strong underlying profitability, allowing us to invest at scale in our people and in our business. and we delivered very strong eps of $1.93, which represents 8% growth compared to adjusted eps last year, even with an fx headwind of over 4%.
and we had record free cash flow for both the quarter of $2 billion and year-to-date of $4.2 billion, which reflect both our strong profitability and our excellent dso management. we are well positioned to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for the full year. we continue to execute against our strategic capital allocation objectives with year-to-date investments and acquisitions of approximately $1.1 billion and over $4.1 billion returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.
now let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. new bookings were $10.6 billion for the quarter. consulting bookings were $6 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1. outsourcing bookings were $4.6 billion, with a book-to-bill of 0.9. this quarter, our bookings continued to be well balanced across the dimensions of our business and the dominant driver of our bookings in the quarter continued to be high demand for digital, cloud and security-related services, which we estimated approximated 65% of our new bookings.
overall, q3 bookings landed in the range we expected. as you know, quarterly bookings can be lumpy, which you've seen in our year-to-date results, and that is consistent with our historical pattern. looking forward, we have a very strong pipeline, and we expect strong bookings in q4.
turning now to revenues. revenues for the quarter were $11.1 billion, a 4% increase in us dollars and 8.4% in local currency, and we're at the top of our previously guided range. consulting revenues for the quarter were $6.2 billion, up 3% in us dollars and 7% in local currency. outsourcing revenues were $4.9 billion, up 5% in us dollars and 10% in local currency. looking at the trends in estimated revenue growth across our business dimensions, technology services posted strong high-single digit growth, strategy and consulting services grew mid single digit and operations continued its trend of double-digit growth.
taking a closer look at our operating groups, resources grew 19% in local currency, delivering its seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. continued momentum was driven by double-digit growth across all three industries and all three geographies.
products grew 8%, reflecting continued strength in our largest operating group. demand continued to be broad-based across all three industries and all three geographies.
communications, media and technology grew 7%, reflecting continued strong double-digit growth in software and platforms, and we have strong, balanced growth across all three geographies.
h&ps delivered 6% growth, in line with our expectations. europe led with double-digit growth, and we were very pleased with the strong growth in north america, which reflected strong growth in our us federal business.
finally, as expected, we saw an uptick in financial services this quarter, with 4% growth. insurance again grew double digits across all geographies, and we saw some improvement in banking and capital markets globally, including in europe. overall, financial services delivered double-digit growth in growth markets, strong growth in north america, partially offset by contraction in europe.
turning to the geographic dimensions of our business, i'm very pleased with the continued demand across all three of our geographic regions. in north america, we delivered 9% revenue growth in local currency, driven by continued strong growth in the united states. in europe, revenues grew 5% in local currency, with double-digit growth in italy and ireland as well as mid-single-digit growth in the uk. and we delivered another very strong quarter in growth markets, with 13% growth in local currency, led by japan which again had very strong double-digit growth. we had double-digit growth in -- excuse me, in china and brazil as well.
moving down the income statement. gross margin for the quarter was 3.1 -- 31.8% compared with 31.2% for the same period last year. sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.7% compared with 10.3% for the third quarter last year. general and administrative expenses was 5.6% compared to 5.5% for q3 of last year.
operating income was $1.7 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 15.5% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with q3 last year. as a reminder, in q3 of last year, we recognized a charge related to tax law changes. the following comparisons exclude the impact and reflect adjusted results.
our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.6% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.8% for the third quarter last year. diluted earnings per share were $1.93 compared with adjusted eps of $1.79 in q3 of last year. dso was 39 days compared to 40 days last quarter and 39 days in the third quarter of last year.
free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion net of property and equipment additions of $140 million.
our cash balance at may 31 was $4.8 billion compared with $5.1 billion at august 31. and with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.8 million shares for $488 million at an average price of $173.95 per share. at may 31, we had approximately $4.1 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
finally, as david mentioned, on may 15, 2019, we made our second semi-annual dividend payment for fiscal '19 in the amount of $1.46 per share, bringing total dividend payments for the fiscal year to approximately $1.9 billion.
so, in summary, we are very pleased with our third quarter results and are now focused on q4 and closing out another strong year.
with that, let me turn it back to david.
david p. rowland -- interim chief executive officer
thank you, kc.
our strong results for the third quarter and year-to-date demonstrate that we continue to execute our growth strategy extremely well. in particular, we continue to benefit from our leadership position in the new, where revenues again grew at a double-digit rate with broad-based growth across all components of the new, including accenture interactive, applied intelligence, industry x.0, cloud and security.
and as kc mentioned, our third quarter and year-to-date performance is powered by our unique leadership footprint in the marketplace, with breadth and scale across the most strategic geographies, industries and capabilities, and this provides for durability and consistency in our performance and uniquely positions us to deliver seamless outstanding service to our global clients.
while there are many positive aspects of our third quarter results, today i want to focus on accenture technology, which is the largest part of our business overall and also accounts for the majority of our revenues in the new. so in many ways, accenture technology is really the engine of our strong leadership position in the new. we believe accenture has the strongest and most innovative technology capability in our industry, with scale and leadership in all the areas that are most relevant to our clients. today, all companies are digital businesses, and certainly accenture is a digital technology company at our core, with advanced capabilities such as data and analytics, automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning.
last quarter, i highlighted three key focus areas in accenture technology that power growth in our business. and today, i'd like to dig a little deeper. first, in intelligent platform services, we apply our digital capabilities, innovation and industry expertise on top of the leading core platforms, sap, microsoft, oracle, salesforce and workday to help clients drive large-scale enterprise wide transformation. we are proud to be a leading partner of all the key players, and we see continued strong demand for intelligent platform services which again grew at a double-digit rate in quarter three and accounts for about 40% of our total revenues.
as one example, we're helping a leading fashion retailer with a global implementation of sap s4 hana that leverages myconcerto, our proprietary ai powered development platform. myconcerto brings together our deep industry knowledge and differentiated tools and methodologies to help clients innovate and accelerate platform implementation. our work is driving greater synergies across the retailers' global brands and building a strong foundation for future growth.
the second area, intelligent software engineering services, is focused on developing and delivering the custom systems that our clients are increasingly demanding. with more than 30,000 people, we have one of the largest teams of specialized software engineers and architects solving the most challenging problems in agile and creative ways using data, the cloud, artificial intelligence and other new technologies. as an example, we're helping swisscom, switzerland's leading telecom company, transform into a digital service provider. by leveraging our proprietary digital omnichannel platform with ai machine learning and analytics, we are increasing the precision and personalization of the customer experience across all their channels.
and third, in intelligent cloud and infrastructure services, we provide clients with powerful differentiated solutions from cloud strategy and migration to managed services and cloud security. we are the leading partner of microsoft azure, amazon web services and google cloud platform, which are often at the heart of our clients' agendas to adopt new and leading technologies and rotate their own businesses to the new.
to-date, accenture has worked on more than 25,000 cloud computing projects for clients, including 80% of the fortune global 100, and we have more than 77,000 people trained in cloud technology. a good example is our work with del monte foods to unlock innovation and streamline their operations by migrating hundreds of servers and critical sap enterprisewide applications to the cloud in less than four months. they are benefiting from a more agile operating environment, real-time customer insights and a 35% reduction in it cost, freeing up resources to grow the core business.
there are three common threads that run through all of these areas in technology. one is innovation, and in fact technology is at the heart of our innovation agenda. a great illustration is our ai powered microsoft mywizard platform, which you've heard us mention many times previously, which differentiates our service delivery by improving clients' business performance with superior productivity and predictability. and we continue to leverage our unique innovation architecture which integrates our capabilities from research, ventures, labs, innovation centers and delivery centers.
second is our powerful ecosystem relationships as the largest independent provider of technology services. while scale is certainly a factor, it's also our ability to co-innovate with our partners, delivering outcomes and value at speed in the new and looking to the next new that differentiates us in the marketplace.
and the final piece that underpins our technology leadership and is pervasive across everything we do is our unmatched industrialized global delivery capability which uniquely positions accenture to deliver large-scale complex programs.
let me now switch gears and comment on our continued commitment to invest for long-term market leadership, including operating investments related to assets and solutions, talent and innovation as well as capital investments to acquire critical skills and capabilities in strategic high growth markets. so far this year, we have deployed approximately $1.1 billion in capital on acquisitions, with the majority focused in the new and especially accenture interactive, where we've completed nine deals so far this year. i'm particularly pleased with the acquisition of droga5, by far our biggest of the year, which has a large new york-based creative agency that significantly strengthens our capabilities to design, build and run customer experiences that grow brands and businesses.
but before i hand it back to kc, i want to take a moment to acknowledge some of the external recognition we've received. accenture rose to number 28 on brandz's list of top 100 most valuable brands and we also achieved our highest ranking ever on forbes' list of the top global brands, and we had our highest ever double-digit increases in brand value on both list. i'm also very pleased that we were named for the first time in two fast company rankings for innovation: first, in the category of world's most innovative companies, and second, for world changing ideas. and finally, accenture was ranked number one on barron's new list of the most sustainable international companies.
before i close, i want to briefly mention that our ceo succession process is going very well, and as i said last quarter, we expect to complete the process by the end of this fiscal year.
with that, i'll turn it over to kc to provide our updated business outlook. kc?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thanks, david.
let me now turn to our business outlook. for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we expect revenues to be in the range of $10.85 billion to $11.15 billion. this assumes the impact of fx will be about negative 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency.
for the full fiscal year '19, based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of fx on our results in us dollars will be approximately negative 3% compared to fiscal '18. for the full fiscal '19, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 8% to 9% growth in local currency over fiscal '18. for operating margin, we now expect fiscal '19 to be 14.6%, a 20 basis point expansion over fiscal '18 results.
we continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%. this compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23% in fiscal '18. for earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted eps for fiscal '19 to be in the range of $7.28 to $7.35 or 8% to 9% growth over adjusted fiscal '18 results.
for the full fiscal '19, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $5.85 billion to $6.25 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion. our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. and we continue to expect to return at least $4.5 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.
with that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. angie?
angie park -- head of investor relations
thanks, kc.
i would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. greg, would you provide instructions for those on the call.
",2019-Q3,ACN
,,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] first question is from the line of tien-tsin huang, jpmorgan. please go ahead.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hi. thanks. good morning. no surprise on the outlook. but i do want to ask on the bookings here. so outsourcing bookings were strong. you said that large deals did come through. you suggested that it would, which is great. but on the consulting booking side, that was flattish for the -- i guess i'm looking at the second half of the year. so can we expect a rotation here perhaps into more outsourcing revenue and maybe bookings looking at the fiscal '20? can you give us maybe your views on outsourcing versus consulting growth in fiscal '20?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. sure. so thanks tien-tsin for the question. maybe i'll start with the last part of your question. in terms of how we're thinking about growth in fiscal '20 for consulting and outsourcing, we expect for the full year that growth for consulting and outsourcing, they'll both be in the mid to high single digit range, and that's baked within our 5% to 8% guidance for the year.
and taking your booking question, as you mentioned, we had record bookings for this quarter, $12.9 billion, and if you peel that back and look at our consulting bookings, we also had bookings at $6.1 billion in consulting type of work and that's one of our highest booking quarters ever, and it was at our book to bill target of 1.0 or higher. and i think, importantly, tien-tsin, as well, we feel really good about the pipeline that we have as we enter in the beginning parts of fiscal '20 and we say that on an overall broad base, in terms of all aspects of our business.
and so when you peel that back and you look at overall what we've done in terms of our bookings for the fourth quarter in consulting, our overall bookings at $12.9 billion, a record as well as our strong pipeline as we head into fiscal '20, we still see -- we see balanced growth across both types of work.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of bryan bergin of cowen. please go ahead.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
hi. thank you. i wanted to follow up just on that booking question. it seems like the variability quarter-to-quarter has become more volatile. can you just talk about the major drivers of that? and is that something that we should expect to continue in fiscal '20?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
in terms of our bookings, i think if you take a look at how we position bookings and think of it from a quarterly basis -- and we've said this kind of historically -- they can be lumpy from quarter to quarter. and really what we're looking at in terms of our overall booking is that we meet on a prolonged period our bookings targets, which for consulting or anything, from 1.0 and above, which we did this year in this quarter, and for outsourcing, which tends to be 1.1 and above over a prolonged period. in this quarter we did 1.4.
so we expect that there will be some variability. you saw that certainly this year where we had really strong bookings in quarter two. we had a little bit lighter as it relates to the rest of the full year in quarter three and we signaled that based on our pipeline, we thought that we would have very strong bookings in q4, and indeed we did. so that's something that we're very used to as we think about fy '20. we tend sometimes to have -- q1 might be a little bit of a lighter bookings in relation to the rest of the quarter. but again for this -- coming off a particularly very strong year and quarter four, that may be the case as well for this year. but we feel very strong -- very well -- we feel very good about our strong pipeline as we enter into '20.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
okay. thanks. and then just a follow-up here on your talent and resourcing model as you approach 500,000 employees. can you talk about what you're doing to reduce the manual effort around work? i think in the past you've disclosed automated fte or efforts within your operations group. so any update you can provide there? and it's in the context of just the uptick that we saw in attrition to 19% and your comfort levels there. thanks.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
well, i'll let kc address the specific uptick around the attrition. but let me give you a broader perspective on how we look at talent. so we -- one of our greatest strengths, right, is how we manage talent and people. and so if you look at it at any given time, we are always adjusting the use of technology in our business and the talent that we then need to hire. and so we have talked about it in the context of our operations business.
but when you think about the work that we do in technology with our mywizard platform where we're using the latest in artificial intelligence and analytics to help our clients, that was work that five years ago we used people. and so we don't think about this as a particular sort of strategy to do x, but that at any given time we are continuously innovating how we are giving services and then adjusting what that means for our talent, and we do that really seamlessly quarter to quarter and year to year.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. and bryan, just to answer your question on the actual attrition number, we did have a slight uptick this quarter by about 1%. but we feel good about the strong retention rates that we have in key strategic areas of our business, and that includes areas such as our digital practice as well as strategy and consulting.
and just as you know, we really have no issues in attracting the people that we need. people choose accenture because of our strategy, our strong financial performance and the experience that we provide to our people, continuous learning, the amount of investments we make in training and innovation, and it really does make accenture one of the best places to build a career.
operator
and next we have david togut, evercore. please go ahead.
david togut -- evercore partners -- analyst
thank you. good to see the bookings strength. i'd like to ask about any changes you're seeing in average contract length, especially given the ongoing strength in outsourcing bookings and possibly in the evolution of your shift to the new, are you in more of an operating and run stage with a lot of bigger clients?
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
thank you, david. yes, there is really no change to the duration of our contracts and our bookings. no change. and david, i would think about -- really think about what we're seeing in the business because really our clients are focusing on enterprisewide transformation and what that requires is that we bring all of our capabilities together really from strategy to operations. and you saw that in the bookings we had this last quarter of 16 clients with over $100 million.
and just to give you an example there, we're working in products with -- one of those was a products company, fortune global 100 who is transforming hr using everything from our strategy capabilities to our operations capabilities to transform the experience from hiring to retirement and at the same time drive down costs. and our competitive advantage in this market is that we are able to bring all of those capabilities, and what we're seeing is that boards and ceos are really focusing on the enterprisewide transformation which means large and strategic programs which is what we are very uniquely positioned to deliver.
david togut -- evercore partners -- analyst
understood. just as a quick follow-up, you announced a leadership change tuesday at the head of your products group, your largest operating group. what changes should we expect with simon eaves taking over products' leadership?
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
that's going to be a very seamless transition to simon. he's been working in products for most of its career and brings the deep -- both industry, operational and sales expertise. so that should be very seamless.
operator
and next we have questions from the line of bryan keane, deutsche bank. please go ahead.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, guys. i wanted to ask about digital. if i look inside the new, digital appeared to be slowing a little bit more than cloud and security, off its high growth rate in fiscal year '18. so, just thinking about as digital getting more penetrated or more competitive inside there -- i know it's still growing robustly at -- looks like high teens, maybe low 20%, but it is off of the growth rate that it was growing at previously. so we always get questions about penetration there. thanks.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes, sure, bryan. now, i'll answer the questions on the growth rate and i hand it over to julie to talk about what's happening within the digital business. but -- so digital -- in terms of what we estimate for the full year, we estimate digital to be about a $21 billion business. so it's very significant in terms of scale. it's about 50% -- almost pushing 50% of our overall revenue base. so, with that scale -- as you mentioned in terms of growth, i mean, we are at the very high teens in terms of growth rates. so we're really pleased with what we're seeing, the continued very strong high teen double-digit growth that we have in digital. and we expect that as we look into next year, that overall we will have -- and the new will continue -- which includes digital -- to have double-digit growth overall in fy '20.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
i think, bryan, it is important to look at, again, what our clients are doing when we think about where we are in our growth strategy. as i said earlier, we do see our clients at the very early stages of their transformation and so really think about what is happening in three buckets.
the first is, they are building out their digital core, right, which is establishing the technology foundation. and so in the scale parts of our business, intelligent platform services, which is all about the next-gen platform, that's 40% of our business today, growing double digits, because they need -- our clients need to establish that new foundation that's going to fuel the enterprise transformation.
at the same time in the digital core, we have -- we're still in the early stages of scaling areas like data, right, how our clients are going to be able to find and curate that data, which is just really beginning to think about how much data there is; security which is only at $2.5 billion, and then the move to the cloud. so within building the digital core, we have scale plays like intelligent platform services growing double digit and then we have the next-scale plays which are also growing double digit.
then the second big area our clients are focused on is driving the growth agenda, which is all about creating better customer experiences which is fueling accenture interactive, which hit $10 billion this year. but it's also fueling the focus on new products and services, which is what x.o is about. that's a very early stages, right, having connected products and services. and so that will be the next area that we are really focused on scaling in the growth agenda.
and then the third area is in optimizing their operations. and again, scale part of our business, operations, which is growing double digit, right, and that's because it helps our clients reduce costs, to increase their investment capacity, but it also enables our clients to do the transformation because we have invested in operations to use machine learning and other forms of emerging technologies, and so they are accessing those technologies through our platform in operations.
but then at the same time, right, you have, again, x.o where we're seeing the early stages of digitizing manufacturing and creating the connected plant, which will be the next play that we are scaling, right? and then of course at any given time, we're in the innovation space and we're looking at the emerging technologies that will fuel growth. but in each of the areas of what our clients are doing, we have scale today growing double digits and then we have the next plays that we're scaling.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
that's helpful. i just had one follow-up for kc on tax rate. i see tax rates going up, it looks like about 100 to 200 basis points, and i know there are some moving pieces inside the tax rate. so, can you just talk about the factors we should be considering there for tax this fiscal year?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes, sure, bryan. so our range -- this may be the anchor to where we're starting with -- so our range for fiscal '20 is up about 0.5 point compared to where we started last year for fiscal '19. and the increase from fiscal '19 to fiscal '20 is primarily due to the us tax reform provision that phase in over two years.
and as a reminder, there are four factors that i think you probably know well but just may bear repeating that can influence our tax rate in any given year. and the first one is our geographic mix of our income; second is the changes in the prior-year tax liability; the third is our final determinations; and the fourth is the tax impacts on our equity compensation.
operator
thanks. our next question is from the line of harshita rawat of bernstein. please go ahead.
harshita rawat -- bernstein -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you for taking my question. my question is for you, julie. given your background in m&a and what's happening in the marketplace, should we expect accenture to potentially look at larger deals now versus the tuck-ins you've done historically? and then as a follow-up to that question, over the last couple of years, you've done a lot of acquisitions in accenture interactive. so going forward, what should we expect as the focus of your m&a activity?
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
sure. well, let me -- thanks for the question, harshita. let me start with the overall strategy around acquisitions, which is what has served us extremely well. and we think about acquisitions to do three things.
to scale hot areas in the market. so for example, this year we did about six acquisitions in technology, three of them in particular around the intelligent platform services where i've already talked about we're seeing double-digit growth and we need to -- we wanted to help scale our capabilities.
the second is to add new capabilities, and this has been a lot of our acquisitions in the new, which has been about 20 of the acquisitions have been in digital and security, particularly as you pointed out in accenture interactive. and so that is about all about adding new capabilities.
and then the third is really getting deeper industry and functional expertise. and so this year, we did four in the area of financial services where we really expanded our expertise in that industry through these acquisitions.
so you should expect that our strategy is always going to be around those three areas and that it is meant to fuel our organic growth. now, with respect to whether we would do a larger acquisition, we've always said that we could do a larger acquisition, but it would really need to make sense for us in the context of what we look to acquisitions to do. so there's certainly no plans to do that. but obviously we have the capability if that ever made sense.
and then finally, as we think about going forward, well, certainly accenture interactive is an important focus point, and we've done a lot of acquisitions there. as you think about where we're scaling, right, so the next scale plays like x.o, you should expect to see that we're going to focus in that area as well. and so at each year, we're going to look at where we need to either scale, add new capabilities or add industry expertise, and it will really change based on what we're seeing in the market and what's available.

that's very helpful. thank you very much.
operator
and next question is from the line of keith bachman, bank of montreal. please go ahead.
keith bachman -- bank of montreal -- analyst
hi. thank you very much. julie, i'd like to direct this first one to you, and that's, how do you think about accenture's business line related to more challenging economic cycles? and to put a little more context on the question, it would seem to me that operations is pretty resilient if in fact the economy got tougher. the question is strategy and consulting revenue. if i look back to 2009 when the economy got really tough, the strategy and consulting element declined double digits. and so if we look out the next year or two, if we hit more difficult economic times, how is strategy and consulting different today that it might be more or less immune from economic cycles? and i have a quick follow-up for kc.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
sure. well, we sort of take a step back and think about what have we been trying to achieve over the last five years, and that has been our rotation to the new, meaning focusing on the most relevant services that our clients need to transform their businesses. so our strategy and consulting business today, right, is focused on these new services, how do you take blockchain and apply it to financial services, how do you use data and combine it with deep customer insights and use the skills of an accenture interactive to create a different customer experience. and we believe that in a downturn scenario, our relevance to our clients comes in the fact that they are still going to need -- and in fact we think during that time even more so, right, to use these capabilities that we have in order to drive their growth agenda, optimize their operations and of course, still build the digital core, and so that's where we see the resilience of our current business model.
keith bachman -- bank of montreal -- analyst
okay. all right. thank you. and kc, just a quick one for you on the cash flow, particularly operating cash flow. it looks like capex is up a little bit. but if i focus on operating cash flow, you're guiding it to be more or less flattish year-over-year. and while i understand that your cash flow metrics on guidance are almost an output, but is there anything you want to call out as being unusual that would make the year-over-year comparisons on operating cash flow a little more challenging or either pluses or minuses on the operating cash flow? and that's it for me. thank you.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thanks, keith. in terms of operating cash flow in our overall free cash flow, there is just -- there is a minor uptick -- $50 million in capital expenditures. so that's not really very different. but really the way we look at our free cash flow is -- the goal that we have is for it to be over 1 -- at 1 or better, right, in terms of percentages -- net income -- the ratio to net income.
and so, with our guidance this year, we're actually at 1.1 to 1.2. so that's outstanding -- another year of outstanding free cash flow. now, this year, in fy '19 we did above 1.2. and why did we do even better? and what are the influences that can put us from one place to the other? it really has to do with a couple of items that i would point out. and this year in particular, we had significant outstanding performance continuing in our dso. and so for every day of dso, it's about 130 [phonetic], give or take, to our free cash flow.
so, we always assume at the beginning of the year that -- we give ourselves a little bit of room to stay in the low 40s because that would still be outstanding within our business. and i'll just point out maybe a couple other things that influenced the fourth quarter, for example. the timing of things such as cash tax payments and just overall timing of accounts payable. those are things that can really change the timing of our free cash flow. but for next year, we have just another stellar free cash flow performance baked into our guidance at 1.1 to 1.2 and we continue to be very proud of how we operate our business in that regard.
keith bachman -- bank of montreal -- analyst
many thanks.

the next question is from the line of rod bourgeois, deepdive equity. please go ahead.
rod bourgeois -- deepdive equity -- analyst
hi there. and welcome, julie. julie, i just wanted to ask a big picture question here. do you have any strategic changes or major priorities that you plan to implement as you take the helm?
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
rod, our strategy starts with our clients and so we are going to continue to stay focused on our clients. and so there is no change -- no major change in our strategy because a new ceo doesn't change our clients, so.
rod bourgeois -- deepdive equity -- analyst
got it. and is there anything significant happening in any of the verticals that may change the vertical mix as you move into next year? it looks like the range of growth outcomes that you're getting across your verticals has narrowed some. some of the really high performers have slowed and some of the weaker performers have improved. so are the vertical performances next year prone to be more parity or could the spread widen?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thanks, rod. this is kc. i would say that in terms of our verticals, and if you're obviously talking about our operating groups, within our range of 5% to 8% we see that all of them have the ability to be within that range. and certainly the opportunity exists also for some of them, and i think of resources in particular to perform above that range.
operator
thank you. next question is from the line of james friedman, susquehanna. please go ahead.
james friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
first, thank you for all of these incremental disclosures. they are very helpful. the observation about the diamond clients, the $100 million, the decomposition of the growth, it's all appreciated. i just wanted to ask you briefly about the business dimension of strategy and consulting. so that dimension -- i'm looking at the bottom-left corner of the q4 [indecipherable] the purple grid. yes, so the mid-single digit growth for the q4 did trend just below the flip side which was high-single digit growth for that dimension for the year. and i know each quarter can be lumpy, but any expectation about that staying here or potentially accelerating that's contemplated in the guidance would be helpful.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes, sure. hey, jamie. thanks for the questions. in terms of our overall strategy and consulting business, as you mentioned -- it's $14 billion is what we estimate that business has been in the fiscal year that we just closed, 2019. it's a little bit less than -- its right around a third of our business. and at that scale, we're really pleased when we have growth in mid to high single digits range. and so for the year, we see that it was high-single digits. for this quarter, in q4, we saw that it was mid. but we're happy when it's in the mid to high single digit range. and as you mentioned, it will lap from quarter to quarter.
but i think it's important -- and as julie -- picking up on some of the things that julie talked about, as you know, the consulting and strategy, it's a really important capability because that helps us drive value across the c-suite, not only in the role of delivering pure strategy advisory work to clients to shape their transformation agenda, but also to bring the entire full scope of accenture's transformation capabilities, including technology, industry, all at a global scale. and as julie put it on examples as well as with our 16 clients at over $100 million we saw that really in evidence this quarter as well.
so it's a bit of a dual-purpose that we have in strategy and consulting advisory work. and we're really pleased with, overall, our performance in the year, our performance in the quarter, and we feel with the bookings that we had in q4, $6.1 billion, which is in consulting type of work overall, but a portion of that obviously within consolidating and strategy, we feel well positioned in this regard for fiscal '20.
james friedman -- susquehanna -- analyst
okay. thanks, kc. and then i just wanted to ask about operations, so incredible double-digit growth again, above company average, above the industry. so any -- i know you shared some already, but any texture there would be helpful. can we keep that up? and is that contemplated in the guidance? thank you.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. so, jamie, yes, we're really proud of what we -- what debbie and the team have been able to do in operations over the last years where they continue to have double-digit growth. and for next year for operations, we do see that that will continue probably maybe in the high single to the low double digit growth range is what we see in operations.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
yes, and just maybe take a minute to expand on why operations is so strategic for us and for our clients. it really is for two reasons, right. so first of all, operations is a great and proven way to create value for our clients because it helps them reduce costs, create more investment capacity.
but the operations business today is very different than say even five years ago because we have invested to bring these great technologies to the platform, which we call synapse, and if you're a ceo and you think about, where do i want to build my own capabilities around artificial intelligence and emerging technologies, do i want to do that in order to transform finance or hr or the marketing backbone or do i want to do that in places that are going to truly differentiate me in terms of my products, for example.
and the equation is often, well, why don't we go to accenture that has built that platform, that's doing it across hundreds of clients with deep and long expertise in the enterprise and access that technology to transform how we're doing those functions so that i can put my investment into these other areas that are going to differentiate us in the market. and that is really helping drive the next wave of growth for operations, and we think that's going to be even more important as we see this enterprisewide transformation.
operator
and our next question is from the line of jason kupferberg of bank of america. please go ahead.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. can you just tell us how much m&a contribution you're expecting in the fiscal '20 revenue growth? and can we also just get a follow-up comment on the tax rate with the increase in '20? is that the new normal we should be thinking about, call it medium term, just based on the phasing of the tax law changes?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes, thanks, jason. in terms of the contribution that we have assumed for fy '20 in our 5% to 8% guidance range, it's about 2% inorganic which is around the same as we landed in fy '19. in terms of our tax rate, maybe, again, i will just answer that. we -- our range is only up 50 basis points from where we started the year, right, and there are various things that can impact our tax rate throughout the year. so we're not really in a very different space from where we started last year.
but you're right that this is -- in fy '20, we have phased in the us tax reform provision that phase in over two years. so we do think that that's really where our rate will be for this year. i'm not going to guide to -- we don't guide to out years on our tax rate. but now we're -- we will then work our four other factors that can influence our tax rate overall. but we do have in '19 to '20, the second year phase-in of the us tax reform.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america -- analyst
i'm just curious, on attrition, just to come back to that. i know you guys aren't having any issue attracting the talent that you want and need. but should we expect just in light of the generally tight labor market, especially for digital talent that this kind of high teens zip code is just sort of a new normal?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes, so, jason, i don't think there's anything that you should expect that's different than what you've seen -- and you've followed us for a long time -- than we've had in the past. we are in the higher teens to mid teens in attrition. that's the level that historically we feel we can manage, and that's how we build our business. so there is nothing you should expect as very different and nothing that we're concerned about.
angie park -- investor relations
okay. great. kevin, we have time for one more question and then julie will wrap up the call.
operator
thank you. and that question is from the line of lisa ellis of moffettnathanson. please go ahead.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys. a question on outsourcing bookings, again just in follow-up i think from tien-tsin's question opening the call. i know -- accenture -- although we'd always think of accenture's outsourcing business being heavily things like erp management and whatnot, but that is clearly not what it is now. can you decompose a little bit when you -- what makes up outsourcing at this point? like, is this like cloud -- managing clouds on behalf of clients? is this a lot of like digital marketing, ongoing management? just give a sense for like what's underneath there. thank you.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
well, lisa, it's interesting is that the breadth of what we do there is actually not different. it's just how we're doing it. so for example, we're still doing application outsourcing, but we're doing it using devops and agile and it's something we call living systems because it's a different way of doing application outsourcing that's allowing the application outsourcing that we do for our clients to help drive their business transformations. we have, of course, a $6 billion business in operations. and again, the kinds of functions that now we're doing are similar, although we've added marketing and scaled marketing over the last couple of years. but again, it's how we're doing it, right?
it used to be about labor arbitrage 10 years ago. it's very, very different now, right. and so the breadth in terms of the activities that we're going after has not changed. what makes it so successful for us is that we have evolved how we do it. and so you can see application outsourcing, because of the techniques we're using, is now helping our clients get to things like agile and devops at scale and be able to help drive their business differently.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
terrific. thanks. and then quick follow-up for kc on the -- one more guidance question. can you articulate what macro outlook for 2020 is embedded in the guidance? and then, realizing it's still september, are you seeing enough visibility into budget outlooks and stuff for next year that you have -- that you're feeling? what's your confidence level around that macro outlook? thank you.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks, lisa. and as you mentioned, this is obviously, at this point, at the beginning of the year. this is our longest range of time that we're giving an outlook. but with that, as you know, we guided to 5% to 8% growth for next year, and that contemplates a market that we see growing about the same as it has done in '19. so for us, for our addressable market, we think it's probably somewhere in the 3% to 4% range overall for next year.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
so, thanks again for joining us on today's call. kc and i and the entire team are extremely pleased with our excellent performance for fiscal '19. we see significant opportunity ahead and we are laser focused on delivering value for all of our stakeholders.
and let me end by thanking our stakeholders, thanking our clients for placing their trust in us, our investors for their continued confidence, our ecosystem partners for their shared commitment to our clients, our exceptional leadership team and finally, all of our people around the world, you are what makes accenture so special. i'll see everyone on the road. thanks.

julie sweet -- chief executive officer
thank you, angie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us.
as a company and a leadership team, we focus every day on delivering on our commitments and creating value for our clients. and today we are proud to announce that we have delivered another year of outstanding financial results, meeting or exceeding each of the objectives we laid out in our initial fiscal '19 business outlook. and i know that pierre, our chairman and ceo, who passed away in january, would have been very proud of the accomplishments this year of our nearly 500,000 people, including more than 7,000 outstanding managing directors. i would like to add a special thank you to david rowland for his inspiring and exceptional leadership during these past several months and to our entire global management committee who came together under david's leadership to ensure that we delivered on our commitments and which also was the ultimate way to honor pierre and his incredible contribution to accenture.
let me share a few highlights for the year. we generated record new bookings of $45.5 billion, including our highest ever quarterly bookings of $12.9 billion in q4. revenues for the year were $43.2 billion, an 8.5% increase in local currency. we delivered earnings per share of $7.36, a 9% increase on an adjusted basis. operating margin was 14.6%, an expansion of 20 basis points.
we generated outstanding free cash flow of $6 billion. we returned $4.6 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. and we just announced our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share, which reflects a 10% increase over the equivalent quarterly rate last year. we have demonstrated once again the durability and resilience of our business, and the strong demand for our services positions us very well for fiscal '20.
now let me hand over to kc who will review the numbers in greater detail. kc?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thank you, julie, and thanks to all of you for taking time to join us on today's call.
we were very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter which completes another outstanding year for accenture. our results continue to provide strong validation of our leadership position in the marketplace, our relevance to clients and our ability to manage our business in a dynamic environment, all to deliver significant value to our clients, our people and our shareholders. once again, our fourth quarter results reflect our constant focus to deliver strong and consistent financial results across our three key imperatives for driving superior shareholder value.
so, let me summarize a few important highlights before i get into the details. revenue growth of 7.2% in local currency continue to be highlighted by strong double-digit growth in all three areas of the new, including digital, cloud and security-related services. growth continued to be broad based with the vast majority of our industries at high-single to double-digit growth levels. we continue to extend our leadership position with growth at about 2 times the market.
operating margin was 14.2% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points, resulting in 20 basis points expansion for the full year. importantly, we delivered this expansion while investing at record levels in our business and in our people to position us for long-term market leadership.
we delivered very strong eps of $1.74, which represents 10% growth even with an fx headwind of about 2%. and finally, we delivered free cash flow of $1.9 billion, which surpassed our expectations, driven by our strong growth and profitability and continued superior dso management.
now let me turn to some of the details. new bookings were a record $12.9 billion for the quarter and surpassed our previous all-time high by over $1 billion. we had very strong overall book to bill of 1.2. consulting bookings were $6.1 billion, with a book to bill of 1.0. outsourcing bookings were $6.8 billion, with a book to bill of 1.4. we were extremely pleased with our bookings this quarter, which were broad-based and strong across many dimensions of our business. they continue to be dominated by high demand for digital, cloud and security-related services which we estimate represented more than 65% of our new bookings.
for the full fiscal year, we delivered $45.5 billion in new bookings. these record bookings reflect the relevance of our services and the high level of trust our clients place in us as their partner.
turning now to revenues. revenues for the quarter were $11.1 billion, a 5% increase in us dollars and 7.2% in local currency. consulting revenues for the quarter were $6.2 billion, up 5% in us dollars and 7% in local currency. outsourcing revenues were $4.9 billion, up 6% in us dollars and 8% in local currency.
looking at the trends in estimated revenue growth across our business dimensions, technology services posted strong high single digit growth, strategy and consulting services grew mid single digit and operations continued its trend of double-digit growth.
taking a closer look at our operating groups.
resources delivered its eight consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth at 12% in local currency. growth continued to be strong across all three industries and all three geographies. products grew 8%, reflecting continued strength in our largest operating group. we had strong growth across all three geographies and very strong double-digit growth in life sciences. h&ps grew 8% this quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in health and strong growth in public service. we were especially pleased with the strong growth in both growth markets and north america, with north america benefiting from continued strong growth in our us federal business.
communications, media & technology grew 5%, reflecting double-digit growth in software and platforms. and overall, we saw double-digit growth in europe and strong growth in growth markets. finally, financial services delivered 4% growth, in line with our expectations. insurance again grew double digits and we saw continued improvement in banking and capital markets globally. overall, financial services delivered double-digit growth in growth markets, strong growth in north america, partially offset by contraction in europe.
turning to the geographic dimensions of our business. i am very pleased with the continued demand across all three of our geographic regions which illustrates the diversity of the business that continues to serve us well. in north america, we delivered 8% revenue growth in local currency, driven by continued strong growth in the united states. in europe, revenues grew 4% in local currency, with double-digit growth in italy and ireland and high single digit growth in the netherlands. and we delivered another very strong quarter in growth markets, with 12% growth in local currency, led by japan which again had very strong double-digit growth. we had double-digit growth in china and singapore, as well as high single digit growth in brazil.
moving down the income statement. gross margin for the quarter was 31.1% compared with 30.8% for the same period last year. sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.6% compared with 10.4% for the fourth quarter last year. general and administrative expense was 6.2% compared to 6.5% for the same quarter last year.
operating income was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.2% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter four last year. our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 28% for the fourth quarter last year. diluted earnings per share were $1.74 compared with eps of $1.58 in the fourth quarter last year.
days service outstanding were 40 days compared to 39 days last quarter and 39 days in the fourth quarter of last year.
free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $241 million. our cash balance at august 31 was $6.1 billion compared with $5.1 billion at august 31 last year.
with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.1 million shares for $407 million at an average price of $189.78 per share. and our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share to be paid on november 15, a 10% increase over the equivalent quarterly rate last year.
now i would like to take a few minutes to summarize our outstanding year. and as julie mentioned, we were extremely pleased that we successfully executed our business to meet or exceed all aspects of our original outlook that we provided last september.
revenue growth of 8.5% in local currency for the full year was above the top end of the guided range that we provided at the beginning of our fiscal year. this result is a strong indication of the durability and resilience of our growth model, which is underpinned by our focus on achieving market leading scale across key industries, geographic markets and services. this includes our strategic focus to lead in the new which represents approximately 65% of revenues for the year.
operating margin of 14.6% reflected a 20 basis point expansion over fy '18 and was aligned with our original outlook. the diluted earnings per share was $7.36, reflecting 9% growth over adjusted fy '18 eps and was above our original guided range. as a reminder, in fiscal year '18, eps was adjusted to exclude the impacts of tax law changes.
free cash flow of $6.0 billion was well above our original guided range, reflecting a free cash flow to net income ratio of more than 2.1 -- excuse me, 1.2, driven by strong profitability and continued industry-leading dsos.
and finally, we exceeded our objectives for capital allocation by returning $4.6 billion of cash to shareholders, while investing roughly $1.2 billion across 33 acquisitions to acquire critical skills and capabilities in strategic, high-growth areas of the market.
so again, we had a truly outstanding year and we feel really good about our positioning as we head into fiscal '20.
now let me turn it back to julie.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
thank you, kc.
our strong results reflect the power of our growth strategy. our strategy starts with what our clients need, and our clients need to transform their entire enterprise. what we see is that most of our clients are still in the very early stages of their transformation journeys. the starting points and speed are different by industry and by company, but the scope of the ambition is consistently broad.
our fiscal '19 results reflect the strong demand for our services and the significant growth opportunities in front of us. i am extremely pleased that we finished the year with 200 diamond clients which represent our largest relationships with many of the world's most iconic companies. i'm also proud to share with you that in fiscal year '19, accenture interactive achieved a significant milestone, reaching over $10 billion in revenue. and finally, this quarter we had 16 clients with new bookings over $100 million.
clients choose accenture for their largest and most complex transformation programs because they know we are uniquely positioned to create value by combining our unparalleled technology expertise, our privileged ecosystem relationships, our focus on innovation and our broad industry depth. our proven track record of global implementations at scale, coupled with our capabilities from strategy to operations, creates significant value for our clients.
let me double click on a few of these important elements of our business, starting with our deep technology expertise and our privileged ecosystem relationships. transformation for our clients begins with their understanding that technology is core to their business. and they turn to us because technology is core to our business. the depth, breadth and scale of our technology expertise, combined with the power of our deep ecosystem relationships, where we are a leading partner with all the key players, is critical to being our clients' partner of choice.
another element i want to highlight is our deep and broad industry expertise across our 13 diverse industry groups. this has all -- this breadth has always provided us durability and resilience in our business. and today, it has created another competitive advantage. ceos are increasingly looking to benchmark themselves against the best companies regardless of industry, and they are turning to us for our cross-industry expertise. because we bring both deep industry expertise in their industry as well as across other industries we can help drive even more value at speed for our clients.
let me bring this to life with an example of a solution that we originally developed for the communication industry and are now using to accelerate value in other industries. for comms companies, building out their networks and providing excellent customer service across all channels are the biggest imperatives. we helped verizon use artificial intelligence, coupled with our deep understanding of the industry, to create digital assistant experiences at scale that can now address more than 70% of verizon's calls. in many cases, a 20 minute call with an agent has been reduced to a three to four minute digital interaction, significantly improving the customer experience. verizon's agents have enhanced their skills and now have more time to handle the most complex calls, which is also the most interesting work.
as you can imagine, call centers represent a significant opportunity to drive value in many industries. recognizing this, we were able to tailor our solution to the unique needs of our clients in both utilities and public service. at enbridge, the global energy company, we implemented a solution in their gas utility operations to address inquiries similar to verizon's such as billing questions and service changes to improve their customer experience. now callers are able to complete many transactions digitally and customer satisfaction is up significantly. and the new mexico human services department is using our solution to help employees answer questions about medicaid faster and more accurately. for example, the state has reduced the time it takes to complete the process of providing medicaid coverage to newborn babies by up to 75% and our solution has freed up employees to focus on more complex tasks, enhancing their experience as well.
let me wrap up by talking a bit more about our people and the inclusiveness of our culture. our people and culture are our biggest competitive advantage, and our unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity enables us to recruit the most talented people in our markets. this creates an environment which unleashes innovation and allows our people to perform at their very best.
today, i'm announcing yet another milestone on our path to gender equality by 2025. with nearly 500,000 people around the world and as a technology powerhouse, we are now 44% women. in addition to gender, we are focused on leading in all areas of inclusion and diversity, and i am proud to announce that for the second year in a row, we have been ranked number one on refinitiv's diversity & inclusion index, which was previously produced by thomson reuters and identifies the 100 publicly traded companies around the world with the most diverse and inclusive workplaces based on environmental, social and governance data for more than 7,000 companies.
with that, i'll turn it over to kc to provide our fiscal '20 business outlook. kc?

thanks, julie.
now let me turn to our business outlook. for the first quarter of fiscal '20, we expect revenues to be in the range of $10.9 billion to $11.2 billion. this assumes the impact of fx will be about negative 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '19 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency.
for the full fiscal year '20, based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of fx on our results in us dollars will be approximately negative 1% compared to fiscal '19. for the full fiscal year '20, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 5% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '19.
for operating margin, we expect fiscal year '20 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '19 results. we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. this compares to an effective tax rate of 22.5% in fiscal '19.
for earnings per share, we expect full year diluted eps for fiscal '20 to be in the range of $7.62 to $7.84, or 4% to 7% growth over fiscal '19 results.
for the full fiscal '20, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $6.34 billion to $6.75 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million and our free cash flow to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion. our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2.
finally, we expect to return at least $4.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.
and with that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. angie?

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of lisa ellis from moffettnathanson. please go ahead.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson llc -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys, and happy holidays. i just wanted to ask a question on acquisitions. i think, kc, you mentioned you're expecting to spend up to about $1.6 billion on acquisitions this year. can you just give a little bit more color on the expected contribution to revenue growth this year from acquisitions and then also what your focus areas are for m&a? thank you.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes, sure. so, happy holidays to you too, lisa. in terms of our expected contribution to revenue in full fiscal year '20 from inorganic, we continue to expect it to be about 2%, which was in line with what we also had last year. and in terms of focus areas, i'm going to hand it over to julie.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
great. let me give you a color. so, happy holidays to you too, lisa, and thanks for joining us. so, our acquisition strategy continues to be centered really around three focus sales -- focus areas. the first is scaling in the hot skill areas where we see a big market opportunity, the second is continuing to add skills and capabilities in the new, and then the third is deepening our industry and functional expertise. and as you might imagine, acquisitions don't always fit exactly into one of those three; they often cross those. so, let me just give you like a little bit a sense of just the three that we just announced in the last few months. so if you start in the us, we announced that we're buying -- we're acquiring clarity insights, which is a leading provider of data science and applied intelligence capabilities. they're very focused on three industries; healthcare, financial -- banking and capital markets, and insurance; which are priority areas for us globally and in particular in the us.
and at the same time, they bring with them accelerators that will help us bring more speed to value for our clients. and they're focused on one of our most important markets so they're helping us scale where we already have scale, but it's a very hot area in applied intelligence because it really crosses our services. then if you move around the world and go to europe, silveo, which we announced and expect to close actually just in a couple of days, which is headquartered in london. they're a company that's focused on supply chain and manufacturing and particularly solutions on sap and dassault systemes, which are both important partners. and so, they are very much a part of our industry x.0 strategy and at the same time providing scale and functional expertise in core areas for us; sap, dassault systemes, and supply chain. and then if you move again around the world to china where i was just there a few weeks ago, we're really excited about futuremove automotive.
i actually spent a few hours there myself really touching and feeling the work that they're doing. and they're a digital and mobility service provider for the automotive industry in china; incredibly advanced, right, working with leading automakers there. and what's so exciting is not only does this acquisition help us really partner with our clients in china, but their advanced services and what they're doing with the connected car is something we'll be able to leverage and bring as innovation all around the world because we have important clients who are not only operating in china, but in the us and europe. and so, that just sort of gives you a flavor and as you can probably tell, i'm so enthusiastic about what our team is delivering here because it's very much targeted on making an impact close to clients in our markets around the world, but also bringing us skills that we can leverage around the world.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson llc -- analyst
terrific. thank you. and then maybe just for my follow-up, i know this is the time of year you're in a lot of discussions with clients around your 2020 programs with them. what are you seeing that's going to be different about 2020 in terms of the types of work you're doing with clients compared to 2019? thanks.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
it's very much more of the same in the sense of enterprisewide transformation and then a focus on innovation, particularly around the growth agenda and then continuing to optimize operations and that really -- that's been the theme and it continues to be the theme. in fact i think since september 1st, i've met with over 100 c-suite executives and i'm very confident of -- that we have a pulse on the demand and that we have the capabilities they need.

your next question comes from the line of joseph foresi from cantor fitzgerald. please go ahead.
joseph foresi -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hi. i wondered if we could talk about the cadence on bookings. i know that we've -- and you said many times in the past that it can be lumpy. we saw it a little bit late ending i guess this quarter. so, maybe you could talk about how you see the cadence and what we should expect from a seasonality perspective?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes, sure. hey, joe. thanks for joining. so, you're right. you've heard us talk about -- and you know us very well, you know that our history of bookings you do see lumpiness. and i think really the most important thing that's within that is that we are very pleased with the demand for our services in the marketplace and if you think about that in the backdrop of bookings. so we're coming off a quarter q4, which was our record bookings quarter and that was a record by more than $1 billion. we had strong bookings that came in the range that we expected in quarter one, right, and we talked about that last quarter. we tend to have a seasonally lower quarter in q1. so, again this met our expectations. and very importantly, we have a strong pipeline and we see strong bookings in quarter two.
and i think the other part of demand that's important and you saw this in our results in the first quarter as well is that we have broad-based demand in our revenue, right, and we far exceeded the upper end of our guidance by more than $160 million. so, you'll see that bookings demand -- you see the demand in the market coming through our bookings both in terms of what we've done last quarter, bookings coming in the range that we expected this quarter, a strong pipeline with strong bookings expected in quarter two, as well as broad-based over-delivery of our expected range in the first quarter in revenue which allowed us to increase our revenue range for the year.
joseph foresi -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
got it. and then maybe you could talk a little bit about your expectations from a demand perspective across the verticals and the geographies. i'm particularly interested in financial services and what's going on with the european banks. but any color from a very high level across those geos and verticals will be very helpful. and happy holidays as well.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
hi, joe. this is julie. happy holidays. so maybe just kind of going across, let me just start with financial services, right. so on the financial services side, as you say, europe continues to be a challenging market in the industry and for us. and so, we expect that we're going to continue to face challenges there particularly in the uk, right. but overall our financial services business, if you look at north america and the growth markets, remains robust, right, but we continue to expect challenges in europe. if you just look at -- take it up a little across the dimensions of our business and our industries. north america delivered very strong results, we are seeing continued momentum there. we have a very strong business in europe and so while we've got pockets of pressure in financial services -- and the other area i would call out in europe is we have seen pressure in industry and automotive, but otherwise europe remains a strong business and in fact 12 out of 13 of our industries this quarter had positive growth. and then the growth markets keep being strong really across the board. and the only other place of pressure that i would call out was in north america, we did also see not surprisingly some pressure in industry and automotive.

your next question comes from the line of tien-tsin huang from jpmorgan. please go ahead.
tien-tsin huang -- jp morgan chase & co. -- analyst
thanks. good morning. good revenue acceleration here. i wanted to first ask on gross margin expansion. actually it's one of the largest increases we've seen in some time looking at the model here. what do you attribute that large expansion to? and then same thing on sg&a, that spend was up. can we assume that that's driving some prospecting and deal pursue costs given your positive comments on bookings?
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
yes. so, thanks for the question and hello, tien-tsin. in terms of how we look at our business, as you well know, we -- first off we start with looking at operating margin. and because the way our payroll costs work, as you well know tien-tsin, based on the activities that we have people doing from quarter-to-quarter and the demand that we see in the marketplace, you can see differences in the different segments of our income statement. so as it relates to the gross margin increase this quarter, it is tied to the sales and market -- what's happening in sales and marketing where we have more people out working our pipelines. so, that will help our gross margin and then you'll see the offsetting impact in sales and marketing. and you're right, that does tie in to the statements we've made of having -- of continuing to have a very strong pipeline.
tien-tsin huang -- jp morgan chase & co. -- analyst
okay. no, that's helpful. kc, real quick if don't mind, just on the consulting revenue growth. that has been improving here and i guess widening the gap to your consulting bookings growth or pattern. what explains the faster conversion? thanks for the second question, appreciate it.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. so we really haven't seen any change in conversion, tien-tsin, of our overall bookings just overall to revenue. that can be within a range and that can vary. so as we look at what we've done in consulting bookings, we feel very good with our bookings for the quarter as well as our pipeline and see also strong bookings in quarter two as well in consulting. and if you look at our production of our bookings in relation to revenue, we look at that over a prolonged period of time and so we're still in the zone that we like, which is a book-to-bill ratio of about 1.0.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
yes. and tien-tsin, hi. nice to talk to you. i would say as we talked about last quarter, from the revenue side we are very pleased with mid to high single-digit growth and you're going to have some quarters you're in mid, you have some quarters you're in the high growth. that's the zone we want to be in because the context for our strategy in consulting business, you need to look at it in the context of our overall business. big drivers of growth are the fact that we can bring together these multi-disciplinary teams to drive enterprisewide transformation, right? that is our huge competitive advantage. it's the demand that we see in the market, right, and it's our ability to actually go from strategy to operations to field these teams that really is what drives big growth in our business. and of course at the core, we've got the digital and technology. so we look at our strategy and consulting business in the context of the needs we are trying to fulfill for our clients, which are very much around these multi-disciplinary teams that span our services, which frankly nobody else can do, right, at our scale.

your next question comes from the line of darrin peller from wolfe research. please go ahead.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks, guys. it's amazing to see the headcount where it is right now. and so if you could just quickly comment on your thoughts on talent management and going forward from this kind of a level, your ability to hire what you need which you've always been obviously extremely strong at. and then maybe just comment on the linearity of the model now maybe looking forward given where you are around the new and the type of revenue?
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
sure. maybe just to start with our philosophy, right, around people and size because every time we hit a milestone, it's always can you keep doing it, are you able to keep the people? and so first of all, our philosophy is that we can continue to grow in size as long as what our people are doing is the high value work that drives our financial objectives, right? and so, we are very focused on what our people are doing versus how many people we have because the size part of it is about our ability to manage and we're really good at that, right? like over the years we've made the adjustments, we've done the things we need to do to focus on our clients and our people. and so the big focus for us is on what our people are doing, which ties to the demand that we see in the market, right? we are early innings of digital transformation, enterprisewide transformation.
we are constantly seeing new emerging tech. for example, we're doing some great work with fukuoka japan where we're putting in one of the most significant early examples of using blockchain to drive their business. they're creating a platform that allows their customers to access other financial products. that's very new cutting-edge, right, we're still at the beginning. so, we see the demand for these new high value services still quite early.
then you look at the model itself, we don't see the model today as being linear. i mean one of the things that people often talk about is well, you're continuing to grow. but underneath that is we've been automating, we've been using people and their talents differently. i mean we often talk about the automation in our operations business where there we actually didn't let people go, we automated and then upskilled them to do the higher value work. but just not just in operations.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
right.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
if you look at our other assets. so, we are constantly -- we don't have a linear model today because we are constantly doing what we're doing for our clients is leveraging technology to change the mixture of how we are using tech and our people to again continue to focus on the higher value services. and so, we are -- hopefully that gives you kind of the color for how we think about our model.
darrin peller -- wolfe research -- analyst
yes. no, that is helpful. just quick follow-ups on pricing. i mean again it seems like as you've trained your people to do the higher part of the food chain, you're able to pass that through. any changes on that pattern or has pricing held up just given competition has also picked up for digital? thanks, guys.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. so, pricing -- the environment for pricing remains competitive, right, and that's always the nature of the work that we do. now within that, we are able to see pricing differentiation in areas where we're differentiated where we've invested. and we do continue to see that we have pricing improvement in some areas of our business continuing in this quarter. it's a constant focus for us and that really is the key part of -- the key first lever to really driving our margin expansion is pricing. so, we are always -- we always have been and will always continue to be focused on driving pricing that's the right value for the clients and for accenture.

your next question comes from the line of harshita rawat from bernstein. please go ahead.
harshita rawat -- sanford c. bernstein & co. -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you for taking my question. i want to ask about industry x.0. it's a relatively new business for you and somewhat early innings. so can you talk about the journey in interactive, which was a new business for you many, many years ago and now a huge revenue contributor? so, can you talk about that journey, the lessons there, and how you plan to go about scaling industry x.0? thank you.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
thanks, harshita. that's a great question and we often internally talk about the analogies because as you'll remember with accenture interactive, that was a -- that growth came from a mixture of both inorganic and organic and very much fueled though by the power of accenture. so even as we were bringing in -- as we've been bringing in skills and capabilities that we didn't have traditionally like droga5 and before them monkeys and kalorama, these creative agencies. the value proposition for our clients is to take these other capabilities and pair them with the traditional strength of accenture for example in building digital platforms and that is what has been able to drive the growth in accenture interactive. and as we look at industry x.0, this is an opportunity for us to serve areas of the company that we serve today but not as much at scale. just like with accenture interactive, we weren't as relevant to the cmo as we are today once we've built accenture interactive as well as new business creation in accenture -- in industry x.0.
while of course we have served and we have practiced -- still significant practices in manufacturing and supply chain, industry x.0 is really about the digitization of manufacturing, the creation of connected products, and then also these digital platforms and engineering around the software. and while again we're in -- just like accenture interactive when we began, we're in parts of these, what we're doing is we're adding the complementary skills that will allow us to take the power of accenture and really scale and bring all of that to our clients who themselves are going through a whole change because manufacturing is now being digitizing and it's the convergence of it with operating technology. and we expect to grow industry x.0 as we have with accenture interactive through a combination of organic and inorganic.
so you saw us last year buy companies like mindtribe and pillar in the us, which are all about connected products. we saw the futuremove acquisition i just mentioned in china, which is about automotive and connected services. silveo in london, which is just the recent and that's really about digitizing manufacturing, leveraging our ecosystems. but at the same time, we're building on the scaled digital and technology capabilities, which is what our clients need to do as we all go through with we see this transformation to digitize these areas of the company that haven't been digitized in the same way that you have the customer front end.
harshita rawat -- sanford c. bernstein & co. -- analyst
thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of david koning from baird. please go ahead.
david koning -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
maybe my first question. just when we look back at some of the metrics you've given around the new in the percent of total revenue and we go back a couple of years, it looks like that was growing 20% to 30% and some of the legacy was declining maybe low double. today it looks like the new might be growing low to mid-teens and legacy has actually kind of improved to maybe slightly declining. i'm just wondering that pace of change, what might be driving that and if that's even the right way to think about it?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. hey, dave. so in terms of looking at the new, i think really what you're touching on is the growth rates that we've had over the last few years and we continue to have very strong growth rates in the new. and as you look at that scale of our business where you would anticipate that even very strong growth rates would slow a bit, but again be very strong just based on scale. and if you look at the other portion of our business, let's call it the non-new or the core, we continue to see that that is stabilizing. it's been decreasing at about a mid single-digit rate and that's by design, that's our strategy, and -- but it's been pretty consistent over the last few quarters.
david koning -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
great. thanks. and just one quick follow-up just on accounting. there was an other income line in q1 that was about $11 million positive this quarter. last year that line was about $25 million to $35 million negative all through the year. was there a one-time item in q1 and does that more normalize the rest of the year?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. so, we did have this quarter a small benefit below operating income where we had -- we indeed do have non-operating income this quarter as opposed to what you saw in quarter one of last year, which was non-income -- non-operating income -- non-operating expense. so as a reminder, last year we adopted a new revenue -- a new accounting standard that required that we marked our investments to fair market value. and while we don't have a large investment portfolio, what you will see, dave, is from time to time that may cause a little bit more variability in what we have in non-operating income and non-operating expense. and this quarter we did have a gain in non-operating income on some of our investments and that was offset by some fx losses as well. but it was a net gain this quarter in non-operating areas and it will fluctuate probably slightly more than it has in the past really just because of that accounting change.
operator
your next question comes from the line of bryan keane from deutsche bank. please go ahead.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning. i just want to ask about the beat and the upside surprise for you guys. was it in consulting in particular? because i know a lot of investors were concerned consulting was weakening and actually it strengthened. so, just trying to figure out if that also surprised you guys or was there something else that created the upside?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. so, we were really pleased overall with our revenue growth rate for this quarter, bryan, and obviously at 9% growth, which was as you mentioned, a beat $160 million higher than we expected. but the other thing that we were very pleased with is the fact that it was also a broad-based over-delivery. now if i had to point out two areas in particular, i'd point to health and public service particularly in north america, which was strong both in the health industry as well as in the public sector industry and that's a statement overall for north america including our federal practice. and then also products that continue to have very (technical difficulty) in life sciences as well as consumer goods, retail, and travel. and so what you'll see is that we do -- and we continue to expect, bryan, that we will have for the full year consulting in the mid to high single-digits growth and outsourcing also in the mid to high single growth rate.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
and bryan, i would just add, this is julie, that again as i talked about earlier although obviously we look at strategy and consulting, tech services, and operations separately and report on that; remember that our focus really has been because of the demand we see in the market on our unique business model that brings these services together and so, it's not so much. you can't really -- for us the way we manage our business, it's not that wait, there's a big surprise in strategy and consulting because kc is giving the answer around industries and clients because a lot of our work is actually bringing all of these services together to meet the needs we're seeing in the market. and so while we do report this to give you that insight into the types of work, when we are thinking about what's happening, it's much more focused. it is only focused on clients, what are their needs and how are we bringing these services together.
and that really is the power of accenture is that we're able to bring these services together. and if you think about what our clients need right now, i mean as i said, i literally in the last four months -- almost four months spent time with over 100 c-suite executives and top of mind for them is the importance of making sure they're going to get value. and that's why they want to partner with us is because we're bringing the team and we're able to really give them confidence in outcomes and we're able to point to the execution we've done with other clients and demonstrate the value and that we're bringing that learning. and i think particularly as we see this inflection in the marketplace moving from pilots and use cases to this enterprisewide transformation multiyear programs, it's more important than ever that we're able to bring these services together for our clients.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
that's helpful. and just as a follow-up. on europe, it was up 7% in constant currency, i think that's up from 4% last quarter. again a lot of investor concern around europe and you guys are showing an acceleration there. you talked about i think 12 of 13 industries showed improvement. so, i guess i'm a little surprised to hear about that improvement. can you just talk about broadly what's going on in europe and why you are seeing that improvement?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. i will maybe just reiterate a couple of the points and some that you also mentioned. so, we were pleased with our business in europe this quarter and we did have broad-based growth and it was in 12 of the 13 industries. and importantly, it was high single to double-digit growth in nine out of 13. and so, that's really important to us and that's something that we're very focused on and we're very proud of the overall broad-based nature of our business in europe and the diversity that we have that i think you'll see has been and continues to provide some durability in that market. now as we've mentioned, we do continue to have a focus on banking and capital markets in europe and that's particularly in the uk. so, we do have some more work to do in that area. and also as julie mentioned, we do have some pressure in industrials and the automotives as well in europe. but i just would point back to the double-digit growth that we had in italy, germany, and ireland as well. and so, we're very focused on continuing in that market to drive the transformation that julie was talking about that she sees and talks with all the c-suite about it in her travels throughout the world.
operator
your next question comes from the line of ashwin shirvaikar from citi. please go ahead.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citigroup -- analyst
julie, you mentioned droga5 so i'm going to take you up on that one. obviously accenture spent many years growing the various parts of that business, steadily expanding from the technology part creative. droga5 recently won the kimberly clark child care account. and based on our checks, you're increasingly going head-on with the traditional agencies for what i'd call the whole shooting match. can you speak to what you're seeing there specifically and where you think you're missing any pieces so you could go in full accounts end-to-end what the attraction you currently have there is?
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
sure. well, kimberly clark is a great example of what we see as the demand in the market, which is for a company to bring together not only world-class creative, but the digital capabilities as well as the advisory capabilities to truly transform the customer experience, right. and you hear that term now a lot. we believe we're the only company today that actually has all of the capabilities that are needed in order to deliver a very different customer experience. and so while i know you think of it as going up straight against the agencies, we think -- what we think about it is what the clients are looking for is not just the creative agency. and you see that in the industry as the industry -- the broader creative industry is also expanding into these capabilities. the fact of the matter is it's very difficult to have creative, it's equally difficult to have depth and breadth in the digital and technology capabilities that our clients need.
and so, we believe that our competitive advantage here is to have such strong creative capabilities coupled with like just unparalleled digital and technology capabilities at a huge scale in every major market. because remember accenture interactive, we have built around the world, right, and we've got it -- i was in the studios in china, we have it in australia, across europe, as well as the us. so, we're extremely proud of the work that accenture interactive under the leadership of brian whipple, what his entire team have done that is powered by the rest of accenture, right, all of these skills and capabilities. that is very hard for anyone to replicate in our view.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citigroup -- analyst
got it, makes sense. the second question is you mentioned the incremental elements of non-linearity in the model in the prior question on headcount and revenue growth. what's the longer-term impact on margins and cash flows if i can extend that question to those metrics?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. so ashwin, in terms of how we think about those two elements, right. in terms of margin, i think it's important to just point out that we always continue to look for modest margin expansion, but more importantly to us is that we're doing more than just the modest margin expansion as you well know, that we -- that goes to our bottom line. we are doing more underlying margin expansion so that we can invest at scale in our people and in our business for long-term market leadership. so, that's the key part. and on free cash flow, that continues to be -- there's no change there. i mean this year you'll see that we've managed that part of our business by looking at free cash flow to net income ratio, right, and this year again it's 1.1 to 1.2. and as you think about that while i won't guide for that long term, strong free cash flow will continue to be an anchor of how we run accenture.
angie park -- managing director & head of investor relations
okay. operator, we have time for one more question and then julie will wrap up the call.
operator
okay. your final question comes from the line of bryan bergin from cowen. please go ahead.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you. i wanted to ask a question on how the mix of your client counterparts have changed. so if we think about enterprise budgets, can you give me a sense how your revenue stream currently maps across an organization whether it's a cio wallet, a cmo budget, or 4-level initiatives? and the reason i ask is you've diversified the business so much over the last several years, i'm just really curious how this has evolved and how you really are mapping across the various budgets now today.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
well, i guess, what i'd say is if you think about what we're doing with respect to for example accenture interactive, that work is almost always a combination of marketing plus cio often plus the business units, right, because the work is not -- really is around customer experience. and so, where the budget sits really varies by company. in some companies, you'll have budgets sit with the chief digital officer, right. so, what we -- our focus is less on the specific budgets and more how are we serving the different needs of the enterprise. so if you just -- and remember, we go back to really we think about it in three things. building the digital core so 40% of our business growing double-digit today is in our intelligent platform services, our five big platforms because that's all about next-gen platforms, right? similarly, our cloud business is there.
then we have the optimizing operations so you've got a $6 billion scaled business growing high single digit to double digits, right, which is all about optimizing and making sure that within the functions as well as industries, they've got access to the best technologies in a most efficient way. and then on top of that, you have the growth agenda like accenture interactive, which is $10 billion we announced last quarter with strong growth as well as the new areas like connected products and services. and so, we continue to focus. so, our big next focus area is industry x.0, which is growing on our historic work in manufacturing and supply chain to the new and really going after that part of the enterprise along with the market because that's not digitized as fast as, say, customer experience. and that's really how we think about the business.
bryan bergin -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then just lastly, i heard you were inorganic 2% you expect for fiscal '20. was it close for that in 1q as well? happy holidays.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. happy holidays to you too, bryan. i mean, we look at that over a full year. so, i would say 2% inorganic for the full year is the number that i would continue to focus on.

thank you, angie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. today we are very pleased to announce strong financial results for the first quarter continuing our momentum from fiscal year '19. we are especially pleased with our revenue growth of 9% in local currency, well ahead of the market which is broad-based across all dimensions of our business. we also delivered strong profitability and again returned substantial cash to our shareholders. our strong results across industries and geographic markets reflect the diversity and scale of accenture's business around the world. we are very well positioned to continue creating value for all our stakeholders. we're off to a great start in q1 and we feel confident in our ability to deliver another strong year in fiscal '20.
now let me hand it over to kc, who will review the numbers in detail.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thank you, julie. happy holidays to all of you and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. we were very pleased with our q1 results, which were strong across all dimensions of our business and position us well to achieve our full-year business outlook. once again, the broad-based strength of our results demonstrates the durability of our business, the relevance of our services in the marketplace, and our scale and leadership in the world's largest and key geographic markets. our results reflect very strong execution against our three financial imperatives for driving superior shareholder value. revenue growth of 9% in local currency was well above the top end of our guided range for the quarter. growth was broad-based across all dimensions of our business with the majority of industries growing at a single -- high single or double-digit rate. results continue to be driven by strong double-digit growth in digital, cloud, and security-related services.
and our 9% growth represents continued market share gains as we extend our leadership position. operating margin was 15.6% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points. importantly, we delivered this expansion while investing significantly in our people and in our business to position us for long-term market leadership. we delivered very strong eps of $2.09, which represents 7% growth, which includes an fx headwind of about 2%. and finally, we delivered free cash flow of $692 million and returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. we also invested $110 million in acquisitions in the quarter to bolster our skills and capabilities in strategic high growth areas of our business and we expect to invest up to $1.6 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. now, let me turn to some details for the quarter. new bookings were $10.3 billion. consulting bookings were $6 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9.
outsourcing bookings were $4.3 billion with a book-to-bill of 0.9. this quarter, our bookings continue to be well-balanced across the dimensions of our business and continue to be dominated by high demand for digital, cloud, and security-related services; which we estimate represented more than 65% of our new bookings. overall, q1 bookings landed in the range that we expected and followed our historical pattern of lower bookings in the first quarter. as you know, quarterly bookings can be lumpy and looking forward, we have a strong pipeline and expect strong bookings in q2. turning now to revenues. revenues for the quarter were $11.4 billion, a 7% increase in us dollars and 9% in local currency. consulting revenues for the quarter were $6.4 billion, up 7% in us dollars and 9% in local currency. outsourcing revenues were $4.0 billion -- excuse me, $5.0 billion, up 7% in us dollars and 9% in local currency.
looking at the trends of estimated revenue growth across our dimensions. technology services and strategy and consulting services, both posted strong high single-digit growth and operations continued its trend of double-digit growth for the 24th consecutive quarter. taking a closer look at our operating groups. h&ps grew 13% in local currency driven by double-digit growth in both health and public service, including double-digit growth in north america in growth markets and strong growth in europe. products grew 12% reflecting continued strength in our largest operating group with double-digit growth in life sciences and consumer goods, retail, and travel services. we continue to see strong demand for our services across all three geographies. resources grew 7% in the quarter with double-digit growth in energy and strong growth in utilities. overall, we saw double-digit growth in both europe and growth markets.
communications, media & technology delivered 7% growth reflecting continued double-digit growth in software and platforms with double-digit growth in europe and strong growth in growth markets. finally, financial services grew 6% this quarter. insurance again grew double digits and we saw continued improvement in banking and capital markets globally. overall, financial services delivered double-digit growth in growth markets and strong growth in north america, partially offset by contraction in europe. we expect to see continued challenges in banking and capital markets in europe in the near term. turning to the geographic dimension of our business. i am very pleased with the continued demand across all three of our geographic markets, which illustrates the diversity of our business which continues to serve us well. in north america, we delivered 9% revenue growth in local currency driven by double-digit growth in the united states.
in europe, revenue grew 7% in local currency with double-digit growth in italy, germany, and ireland and high single-digit growth in france. and we delivered another very strong quarter in growth markets with 13% growth in local currency led by japan, which again had very strong double-digit growth. we also had double-digit growth in brazil and singapore. moving down the income statement. gross margin for the quarter was 32.1% compared with 31.1% for the same period last year. sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 10.1% for the first quarter last year. general and administrative expenses were 6.1% compared to 5.6% for the same quarter last year. operating income was $1.8 billion for the first quarter reflecting a 15.6% operating margin, up 20 basis points compared with quarter one last year. our effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 19.8% for the first quarter last year.
diluted earnings per share were $2.09 compared with eps of $1.96 in the first quarter last year. days service outstanding were 43 days compared to 40 days last quarter and 42 days in the first quarter of last year. free cash flow for the quarter was $692 million resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $787 million net of property and equipment additions of $95 million. and our cash balance at november 30th was $5.8 billion compared with $6.1 billion at august 31st. with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3.8 million shares for $729 million at an average price of $189.65 per share. at november 30th, we had approximately $3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.
also in november, we paid our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share for a total of $508 million. this represents a 10% increase over the equivalent quarterly rate last year. and our board of directors declared our second quarterly cash dividend of $0.80 per share to be paid on february 14th, also a 10% increase over the equivalent quarterly rate last year. so in summary, we were very pleased with our q1 results and we are off to a good start in fiscal '20.
now let me turn it back to julie.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
thank you, kc. our first quarter performance reflects continued strong demand for our services as well as the disciplined execution of our growth strategy. accenture is uniquely positioned to partner with our clients to successfully achieve transformation across the enterprise. we have unparalleled technology capabilities and ecosystem partnerships, deep industry and function expertise, a focus on continuous innovation, digital at scale, and incredibly talented people. we create value for our clients from building out their digital core to helping them innovate across their growth agenda and realize significant value from optimizing their operations. the new digital, cloud, and security is now our core, accounting for about 65% of total revenues and we are focused on continuous innovation across these services. in cloud, for example, we have more than 300 patents and pending patent applications.
we have 90,000 cloud professionals and are the leading global partner of amazon web services, google cloud platform, and microsoft azure. and i am very pleased that we just launched mynav, a groundbreaking new platform to help clients accelerate their cloud transformation. identifying the right cloud solutions can be complicated so the key is simulating and testing a scaled-up model to quantify value and build the business case giving clients confidence in the potential benefits so they can move forward quickly. this is just another great example of our continuous innovation mindset and how we drive speed to value for our clients. over the past few months i have been spending time in many of our key geographic markets around the world meeting with our clients, our people, and our ecosystem partners. we have scale in every major market and we are the leader number 1 in both north america and europe and number 3 in growth markets where we continue to rapidly gain market share.
as an example, we have reached scale in china with more than 17,000 people and this is a key strategic market for us and our global clients. let me double click on our major markets. our eight largest countries as we move around the world, the us; the uk, italy, germany, france, and spain in europe; and japan and australia in the growth markets. these countries account for nearly 80% of our revenues and they all generate $1 billion or more in annual revenues. they also are home to more than 85% of our 200 diamond clients, our largest relationships with the world's leading companies. our extensive global presence has always positioned us uniquely in the market to deliver best-in-class global programs for the largest multinational companies. and today it has created yet another competitive advantage, which is the ability to create value at speed and scale by leveraging our global expertise tailored to the local context.
leveraging our global network of more than 100 innovation hubs that we have built over the last few years, we can bring innovation from every corner of the world to our clients. and while the scene of transformation is common across the globe, it plays out at the intersection of industry, technology, and geography. we see growing and significant differences by country while at the same time our global footprint gives us the opportunity to leverage our learnings and our talent from around the world to accelerate outcomes for our clients. let me bring this to life with a few examples from our resources business. the ways in which energy is produced, consumed, and distributed are changing dramatically; but the shape and pace of the change and the opportunities for accenture are different around the world. in europe, we are working with clients in france and italy to help them succeed in the transition to a low carbon economy.
for engie, the french multinational utility company, we are teaming with salesforce and vlocity in which we have a minority investment on a global unified crm platform for more than 15,000 employees. the new platform gives engie a common intelligent view of its customers across more than 70 countries and empowers employees to strengthen customer relationships and provide personalized recommendations to support engie's new zero carbon transition strategy for the fortune global 500. in italy we are collaborating with snam, which operates the largest gas transmission network in europe, to identify internet of things technologies on the microsoft azure platform leveraging connected devices as well as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and advanced analytics to optimize the monitoring and maintenance of energy infrastructure to make it smarter and more sustainable as well as more efficient.
in the united states we are working with southern company, the gas and electric utility, which is building the first new nuclear reactor in the us in 30 years. partnering with southern company, accenture built a new cloud-based construction work management system on the amazon gub cloud platform from scratch in just six months. this enabled southern company to expand and accelerate plant construction as it strives to bring this clean carbon-free energy production online for 500,000 homes and businesses. let me pause for a moment and take a step back. each of these examples demonstrates the power of our unique business model, which spans services from strategy to operations with digital and technology at the core. this enables us to create the multi-disciplinary teams that are needed to not just create a vision of transformation, but to execute and scale and give our clients the confidence that they will achieve real value.
if you think about the environment our clients are navigating; unprecedented change, the need for speed, and major investments to drive their enterprise transformation; our unique model and capabilities give us an incredible competitive advantage to be the partner of choice for the world's leading companies. now let me turn to accenture's greatest and undeniable strength, which is our people. during the first quarter, the number of accenture people surpassed 500,000, a significant milestone. i want to thank each and every one of them for their incredible commitment and dedication to serving our clients. as always, we continue to strengthen our leadership team, which now includes more than 8,000 managing directors. i was delighted that earlier this month we promoted 787 new managing directors and senior managing directors, including a record 260 new women managing directors, accounting for 36% of the promotions to this level.
and before i turn it back to kc, i just want to mention some of the great recognition we have recently received for our long-term success and cutting-edge capabilities. we are especially proud that droga5, which joined accenture interactive last april, was named agency of the decade by adweek, which characterized droga5 as a dominating creative force. interbrand ranked accenture number 31 on its list of top global brands, our highest ranking ever. our brand value increased 14% for the second year in a row. and i want to recognize amy fuller, our chief marketing officer, her team and all our people for this great work to continually strengthen the accenture brand.
with that, i'll turn it over to kc to provide our updated fiscal '20 business outlook. kc?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thanks, julie. now let me turn to our business outlook. for the second quarter of fiscal '20, we expect revenues to be in the range of $10.85 billion to $11.15 billion. this assumes the impact of fx will be about negative 1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '19 and reflects an estimated 5% to 8% growth in local currency. for the full fiscal year '20 based on how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of fx on our results in us dollars will be approximately negative 1% compared to fiscal '19. for the full fiscal '20, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 6% to 8% growth in local currency over fiscal '19. for operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year '20 to be 14.7% to 14.9%, a 10 basis point to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '19 results. we continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. this compares to an effective tax rate of 22.5% in fiscal '19.
for earnings per share, we now expect full-year diluted eps for fiscal '20 to be in the range of $7.66 to $7.84 for 4% to 7% growth over fiscal '19 results. for full fiscal '20, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $6.35 billion to $6.75 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $5.7 billion to $6.1 billion. finally, we continue to expect to return at least $4.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.
with that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. angie?
angie park -- managing director & head of investor relations
thanks, kc. i would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?

operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of tien-tsin huang from jpmorgan. please go ahead.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, thanks. terrific results here. i can't remember -- i was thinking the last time you guys raised your margin outlook, especially against such strong bookings and investments like cloud first you talked about plus this one-time bonus to employees, etc. so what's different this time to allow you to do that, to raise margins modestly against some good momentum here? and i'll ask my follow-up just together with this, which is, given the big bookings, thinking about contract execution, do you feel good about sort of the level of expectations you need to deliver here to keep this momentum going? because i know you've put a lot of hard work into driving up the bookings here, but i'm curious if there's anything different to consider here with contract execution looking ahead. thanks.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
okay. thanks, tien-tsin. so in terms of operating margins, let me just cover with you what's the driver this year of our 30 to 40 basis points operating margin expansion. and you're right, it is unusual for us to expand our operating margin halfway through the year. and so, implied in our guidance for the year is obviously continued healthy margin expansion in the back half. that's in addition, tien-tsin, to the 40 basis points that we've already done year-to-date, and as i mentioned, which does include the impact of the one-time bonus that we're doing for employees below managing director.
and i'll just maybe highlight a few things in terms of drivers for the -- for the expansion this year. i mean, as always, we first look to strong revenue growth, and we have that again this year. and that's coming along with increased [technical issues] gross margin in the first half of the year, and that's really the first lever that we always look at. within this year uniquely are a couple of things. one is utilization. so we are getting some additional margin expansion this year based on our higher utilization rate. we've talked about that last quarter, that we're looking to bring that down to more normal levels. it did go up this quarter, and we're still working on that. but clearly the first half of the year and into the second half, there will be some benefit to operating margin expansion on that.
and the second part is due to the lower travel, events and meetings spend this year. so we are going to benefit from that overall for the full year, but that benefit really is in the first half of the year as the baseline last year in the back half as you know, we really didn't have travel or have meetings. so it's not a benefit that we'll have in the back half of the year. and i think overall, the key thing though in operating margin is that we always look to drive strong underlying profitability because we want to ensure that we're investing first in our business because we want to drive long-term shareholder value. and so that's really the critical part, that we're able to continue to invest in our business and in our people and in acquisitions but while at the same time expanding operating margin significantly.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. and, tien-tsin, why don't i take the -- i'll take the question about execution. we're very confident about our ability to execute. and let me just remind you that one of the things that's really benefiting us is just our absolute, excellent performance when the pandemic started and we had to move all of our people from our centers while our clients were having to move remotely. as you'll recall, i shared that we closed the books for 70 public companies and we did so without missing a beat, that we, on average, pre-pandemic have a new release every 15 minutes 24 hours a day on the technology, say, seven days a week and we continued with that execution, and in fact one of the things that we believe is driving our growth is that we enhanced our standing with our clients because of how we've been able to execute while at the same time we helped many of them move online. so we feel very good. our centers and our people across the globe in terms of delivery are just amazing, and i should thank them because at the end of the day, that's what really matters for our people, and we really just have exceptional people.
tien-tsin huang -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yeah. thanks, both.
operator
your next question comes from the line of lisa ellis from moffettnathanson. please go ahead.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hey, good morning. and nice results here. julie, i wanted to kind of rewind the clock back to early 2020 which obviously feels like eons ago now, but when you reorganized accenture to pivot to more focus on the geographies and geographic expansion. now that we're a year plus in and the dust has settled a little bit, can you just kind of bring us back to that and reflect on what's working well with that pivot, what's working maybe less well or has been more challenging than you expected and what's different about operating in growth markets just realizing that those -- that the growth markets are an important part of the growth story for accenture going forward? thank you.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
sure. great question. one of the things that we look back on internally as a leadership team was that we actually were very bold in our ambition in my first year as ceo to actually put that new model in place only six months into the fiscal year and change our p&l in the middle of the fiscal year. and we look back and often use it as a lesson as to speed matters because as you think about our execution during the last 12 months, we did so with a new leadership team and a new way of working. and what it really demonstrate was we made the right strategic move. driving the move from industry to geography were a few things. and remember what we did was we also put digital everywhere. so we simplified because digital was now the core of our business, but the first thing is what we call the client proximity imperative. we had such scale in all of our markets. we wanted to put our leaders really closer to our clients, while at the same time really enhancing the ability to move innovation around the world, and we did that by massively simplifying and so we, at the one hand, where we made a geographic p&l but on the other hand we made critical changes to actually make it easier to move innovation around the world.
and secondly, we felt as if the ability to simplify and then have teams come together across our services would really unlock value. and of course we did that before we had covid, but we've seen the acceleration of the need for that because our clients are really looking for the ability to bring outcomes. and so just think about the work that we are doing right now. like i take bbva, which you may know, it's a customer-centric global financial services company headquartered in spain, and we've worked with them to move -- they wanted to increase their digital sales, and that brings together operations, all of our interactive capabilities like paid media, search engine optimization, analytics and marketing operation plus our deep industry experience. and with our support over the last 12 months, they've grown their digital sales more than 50% and they saw an increase in digital customers by more than 50%. the ability to bring those services together seamlessly to deliver those outcomes has really been enabled by that growth model that both simplified, recognized that the core of our business is now digital, cloud and security and enable us to really meet the needs of the client globally.
in terms of growth markets, it's really nothing different there. i mean, the geographic model helps us both focus on the opportunity in each of the markets while at the same time really connecting the innovation and being able to serve global clients better.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
sure. thanks. maybe my quick follow-up is maybe for kc, a follow-up on tien-tsin's question. i know you said, yes, you're running a little hot on utilization right now and you commented on that as well last quarter. i'm curious, though, with the shift to remote work, one, do you think that shift is going to remain more permanent and will it allow you to actually maintain a higher level of utilization on a more permanent basis?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. so thanks, lisa, for the question. yeah, i will just reiterate, we are trying to -- we are working to get it back -- our utilization back into more normal ranges. they did tick up this quarter, and that's really is tied to the increased demand that came back hotter than we expected, right. so, but we continue to believe that the right answer for our people is to lower it back into our more normal historical ranges. and in terms of the structural, is there a structural change, and i believe, just no, that over time, there's really not a structural change in utilization. there is probably some increase right now due to remote working but we don't see on a go-forward, any long-term structural change in our utilization rate.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
yeah. and just remember, lisa, like we have a very important value proposition that includes being able to do continuous learning, but also the right level of time to do strategic thinking, for example, and to come together around important initiatives. and so that's why we believe that over time we really should get back into kind of a more normal regardless of where people are working from.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
terrific. thank you. thanks a lot.
operator
your next question comes from the line of ashwin shirvaikar from citi. please go ahead.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citigroup -- analyst
thank you. hi, julie. hi, kc. congratulations. these are tremendous results. i hate to keep bringing up margin again and again, but one thing i did not necessarily here you explicitly call out was pricing which one might expect given sort of a price for value component given the pivot, the mix as you primarily do digital, cloud and security, and also frankly a shortage of resources, which was also going to be my follow-up question, is that your attrition has picked up, but still below historical levels. i see all the steps you took toward employee health, wellness, eventually controlling attrition. but as demand accelerates across the industry, do you expect attrition to return to historical, like mid-upper teens type level?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. so thanks, ashwin, for the question. so i'll cover the pricing point. i'll hand it over to julie to talk about attrition. so maybe just to start with context overall and what we're seeing in the overall market and the business environment. so as we've been saying and we continue to see that the business environment does remain competitive, and in some areas we experienced pricing pressure, but we are seeing signs of stability, right. so that's probably the first key point. in terms of the pricing that we have across our different markets or services, as you know, the pricing can vary depending on what it is that we're selling and in what markets that we're doing that commercial arrangement. but what is important and what stays the same is that we always look to make sure that we are doing a smart commercial arrangement that benefits both our clients and accenture, and that's a key part of our 360 degree value. but as it relates to what we're actually delivering in terms of profitability, i do want to highlight that within our operating margin and within gross margin, we have expanded the delivery of clients -- client profitability and contract profitability. so that's the key part of our operating margin expansion for the year.
and julie, you want to talk about attrition?
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
yeah. look, i think it's -- i think we would expect that we're going to go back to sort of industry norms on attrition, although we'll always work hard to not do that, right. and we do believe that we are benefiting right now from the way we have cared for our people and the decisions we made to preserve our talent and invest in keeping them through the lower demand there. but certainly, we are tuned as a company to be able to grow and recruit at this level and at the more normal levels, as you said, in higher teens.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citigroup -- analyst
thank you. good results.
operator
your next question comes from the line of bryan keane from deutsche bank. please go ahead.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi guys. and congratulations from me as well. just thinking, julie, about this more structurally longer-term, is this growth rate -- the back half growth rate obviously being really strong and the back half double-digit growth implied for both the third and the fourth quarter, how has the pandemic changed things that this could be maybe more sustainable than just kind of a one-time pickup in growth and maybe the growth could be -- i know we've talked about in the past 5% to 8% constant currency growth. just wondering if that -- that formula has potentially changed in the future due to the pull-forward of some of the digital transformation from the pandemic.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
look, we knew someone was going to try to get us to look ahead for next year, but -- but we're not going to...
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
you got me.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
but we're not going to. but let me just -- so instead of trying to look ahead to next year and thinking about [indecipherable] maybe just focus on how we are looking at our business right now. so, if you think about the last six years when we started digital, we rotated our business so that now the core of our business is digital, cloud, security and all of our services, meaning, not just that's not from a technical perspective. and so think about what we have built are engines of growth as the core of our business, which is what we went through when you think about cloud, industry x, applied intelligence, operations, the things we went through in our script today. and so we have these engines of growth which we continue to invest in.
and i think what's really important the way we think about our business is -- for example, cloud we already scale. we told you last quarter it was $12 billion in fy '20, but it's growing double digits because we're at the very early stages of it. and when you think about accenture cloud first, we've brought together all of our services from strategy and consulting to experience to cloud, industry experience, because not only are companies having to migrate to the cloud, but they need to create value like we're working with an american entertainment company where we're helping them leverage the cloud to accelerate the time to market of new video services, right. so it's not about the migration; it's about the value. and so think about our business as having built these engines of growth, some of which already had massive scale and are continuing and then others like industry x -- industry x is the way that we're going to continue to diversify our revenue sources for resilience over the long term.
we made two acquisitions this quarter, salt solutions and myrtle consulting group, to help build our manufacturing and supply chain. we're going to continue to invest there. we think about that as the next interactive, right, in terms of building this new area, and we're at this amazing tipping point right now where we're seeing an acceleration of digitization in manufacturing and in product engineering. and so we continue to think about how do we both make sure these growth engines are growing but never have to have another rotation because we're always investing. and i mean the last point i would just say is our capacity to invest in acquisitions has been a huge differentiator in building the business we have today as being the core of our business is now these engines of growth, and we continue to execute on that in all of our major strategic areas and the next scale plays, and i'd call out the two we made this quarter in cloud, for example, infinity works and edenhouse.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it, got it. and just kc, a quick follow-up. will travel and reimbursables, will that -- will that go up back to the norms of previous past? i'm just trying to figure out if some of that obviously -- some of that travel work doesn't have to continue and so the model slightly changes on that -- on that front.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. so that's a great question, bryan. so let me just first say tell you what we've assumed as it relates to kind of our revenues. so we do not have in our revenue guidance any increase in travel -- revenue from travel related expenses. now, obviously we're continuing to meet with our clients and do well -- and engage with them, as you can see from our record bookings and our really strong revenue growth. but we don't have any of that -- we don't have that significantly embedded in our revenue.
in terms of for the rest of the year, we'll continue to see where we are with the travel and events and meetings, as we go through throughout the rest of the year and into next year, it's really just kind of too early to tell. julie, i don't know if you want to add anything.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'd agree. i mean, look, i'm having lots of conversations with companies who are just trying to figure this out, right, will travel -- will it actually explode once people feel safe because they need to reconnect, will it structurally shift. and i would say that it's really -- we think it's too early and companies are really kind of all over the map, and hopefully we'll have a lot better sense as we get through the next six months and we see vaccinations variance and how comfortable people are. but it's still -- it's still pretty unclear.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. thanks for taking the questions.
operator
your next question comes from the line of dave koning from baird. please go ahead.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
yeah. hey guys. thanks. nice job. and i guess my first question. outsourcing growth was the strongest i think in six years, and that's really not on an easy comp either. you had a pretty normal q2 of last year in terms of growth. i'm wondering, is there something within outsourcing that has kind of step-function changed to just a better level than normal or something happening there that's really triggering growth in such a stable part of your business typically.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
well, it's a great question and it's really is a big driver of how well we're doing now because in this -- when you have compressed transformation where the companies need to do so much at the same time, there is a really sharp focus on what do i need to do, how do i source the talent, right, and that conversation has absolutely gone faster, but also how can i digitize every part of the organization. and what accenture has which is very unique is this investment we've been making for years in the spin-up platform for example in operations and in technology, things like mywizard and myconcerto which builds in best-of-class ai, machine learning, rapid testing, and these are platforms that we continuously invest in.
and so what's happening here is that we're helping them [technical issues] versus can leverage in order to go faster. but one thing i want to be really, really clear about is although our strategy in consulting business continue to have a high single-digit decline, it was better than we expected, strategy and consulting is absolutely essential to all of these results, including outsourcing, because what we are bringing to them, right, it's not simply always a lower cost, it's increase is in sales through our marketing operations like the bbva example i gave, right. it's manufacturing. at aig, which i talked about, it's insurance, right, as well as the process skills. it is helping them transform the ways they're working by being integrated with us where we're bringing modern ways of working and digital. and so this is what distinguishes us as a company for our clients. it's not -- for you guys, it's type of work, outsourcing versus consulting, which is basically managed services, project work, for our clients, it's our ability to bring all these services together, which is why i emphasized the each of the examples i gave in my script and i'll give you many more, really are pulling all of these things together for an outcome, and when you're going through compressed transformation, that's more important than ever.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks. that's great. and i guess my just quick follow-up. every vertical accelerated in the quarter except for resources. and so i'm just wondering on that vertical, specifically, that got a little worse, but that had really easy comps in the back half. anything to kind of call out there on momentum kind of reaccelerating in the future?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, dave. so resources, it came in in the zone that we expected it to. i'll just point out a couple of things. so we've talked about the industries more impacted by the pandemic and resources clearly has one of those, which is in energy, and they continue to be under pressure. and i would also say that our clients in the chemicals industry also have been feeling some pressure as well. but we've seen stability in our utilities portfolio, which is good. and go forward, right, as we look into q3, we do see an improvement in the resources growth rate.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
yeah. and by the way, this is where industry x is going to be so critical. for example, we're working with a north america -- one of the largest oil integrators in the world in reimagining their plans from both health and safety, security and efficiency perspective. i was just in our brand new ot security lab in houston last week as i actually did go on a business trip, and a big focus of ot security is across all of both process and discrete manufacturing. so there obviously as an industry -- set of industries they've been impacted. but if you think about where we're focused and how we're going to help them from efficiency and safety and security, it's great. we're well positioned.
david koning -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
operator
your next question comes from the line of james faucette from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you very much. and i wanted to go back to one of the comments you made in the prepared remarks in terms of increasing your programmatic v&a. i'm wondering if you could just give us a little color of how we should think about contribution from that specific areas of focus, durability, etc. just trying to understand how you're thinking about that initiative, which seems really important.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
yes. so thanks for the question. you're absolutely right. i mean, our ability to invest significantly in our business, and that includes v&a is a key competitive advantage. and i would just say we've been at this for a long time, to your point. it's been a core part of our strategy since 2013. on average, we've done about 20% of our operating cash flow to v&a and our updated guidance of about up to $2 billion -- at least $2 billion puts us in that same zone. but it's not just being able to acquire a successful integration. and so you can see that that typically provides about 2% of inorganic contribution in this year. it's going to be more in the 2.5%. so we really are very focused on that as a key part of our strategy and we will look to continue to invest in. as we've said, we can always -- we can do more than the $2 billion if the opportunity presents itself. but it is a key part of our investment portfolio.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. and just turning operationally for my follow-up question. can you give some color on how much of the strong demand that you're seeing is driven by your partner network this year and where you're seeing most strength there? and i guess how you think about that part of business generation evolving over the next few quarters and periods?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
look, our ecosystem partners are absolutely essential to our growth. i called them out in our script. we're really proud to be the number one or number two partner with all of the major ecosystem partners. and what we uniquely bring is because of the strength of our relationships, we can really bring integrated value proposition to our clients. and so those relationships are very high priority and important to our future growth.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for that, julie. thanks, kc.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
thank you.
angie park -- investor relations
operator, we have time for one more question and then julie will wrap up the call.
operator
okay. that question comes from the line of bryan bergin from cowen. please go ahead.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you. a question on the outsourcing and operation strength. so you highlighted the aig shared services deal this quarter. have you seen a pickup in captive acquisition opportunities that you've acted upon here over the last several quarters? and i'm curious how we should think about this mix contributing to your outperformance on the pipeline going forward.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
we've shared in prior calls that we do see more interesting captives. we're starting to see us execute on some of them, but i think it's too early to say whether that's going to be a big part of the mix or not. for the reasons i've talked about, we can go in and help digitize. kc, do you want to add anything?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah, i would just say, in terms of what we see, in terms of the mix, for h2, we still see double-digit growth in outsourcing. and for the full year, i think we'll end up at high-single to low double digits positive growth in terms of -- to give you some sense of the mix.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
okay. i appreciate that. and then just on h&ps and financial services, so those both clearly had outsized performance in the quarter. can you just talk about the key contributors underlying those two?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. so we were really pleased with h&ps and financial services growth this quarter. h&ps continues to be growth that we've seen in public service and the work that we've been doing during -- not just only but clearly led by all the work that we're doing with [indecipherable]. and in financial services, we are pleased that we do have strength in our banking/capital markets and that's a statement globally as it relates to particularly and not only in our business in europe but all over, including north america. so very strong performance in both of those and we expect that to continue.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
yeah, and it's the things that are -- it's cloud, right, there is big movement to cloud; it's digital experience; it's more like the example i gave on bbva; it's basically all the trends that we've talked about are playing out really across the industry, and financial services is one of the less -- more moderate impacted industries and they're investing.
bryan bergin -- cowen -- analyst
thank you very much.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
okay, great. well, thank you, again, for joining today, and thank you again to all of our incredible people around the globe. and as always, i just want to end by thanking our shareholders for your continued trust in us. may everyone stay well and healthy.

julie sweet -- chief executive officer
thank you, angie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us.
today, we are proud to announce outstanding financial results for the second quarter of fiscal '21 and our return to pre-covid level financial results a quarter earlier than we expected and with a tough compare.
let's first go back 12 months ago, on march 19, only eight days after the pandemic was declared, when we were all together to announce our outstanding fiscal year '20 q2 financial results, results you may not remember because at the time we were all focused on the go-forward potential impact of the pandemic. in q2 of fiscal year '20, we had 8% revenue growth in local currency, our then highest bookings ever of $14.2 billion and strong underlying profitability and free cash flow. we also announced that 18 clients that quarter had bookings over $100 million.
with this backdrop of fiscal year '20 q2, the significance of this q2's results in fiscal year '21 becomes even more clear. we have delivered 5.4% revenue growth in local currency, which includes a reduction of 2 percentage points from a decline in revenue from reimbursable travel costs, meaning, apples to apples, 5.4% is in the zone of fiscal year '20 q2 revenue when you exclude the travel costs related revenue. we have delivered bookings of $16 billion, beating our previous record set in q2 last year by $1.8 billion, and we have delivered strong profitability and free cash flow. this quarter, 18 clients had bookings over $100 million, and we continue to take market share faster than pre-covid.
in h1, we have accelerated our investment in d&a, with approximately $1.1 billion of capital deployed, and we are increasing our programmatic d&a investment to at least $2 billion for fy '21 from the $1.7 billion we previously communicated. and for the last 12 months, we have remained consistent. we gave guidance every quarter which we met or beat. we deliberately invested in our people and preserved our talent to continue to serve our clients as demand came back. and we continued to significantly invest in our business and our communities. and throughout, we have lived our core values, including maintaining without pause our commitment to make more progress on diversity and inclusion and sustainability.
these financial results reflect these choices, the strength of our core values and the power of our laser focus on creating client value and being a trusted partner as well as our incredibly talented people, strong ecosystem relationships and the resilience of our growth strategy as well as the substantial investments we have made year-in and year-out since we set out to be the leader in digital, cloud and security and continuous innovation. they also reflect the operational rigor and discipline that long has been a hallmark of our success. i want to thank our people for their hard work and continued dedication to our clients and for delivering on our commitments.
kc, over to you.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thank you, julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call.
we were very pleased with our overall results in the second quarter which exceeded our expectations and reflect strong momentum across our business. we are particularly pleased with our record new bookings and strong revenue growth, which demonstrate our leading position in the market as a trusted partner to deliver value for our clients. based on the strength of our second quarter results and the confidence in the second half of the fiscal year, we are increasing all elements of our full-year outlook, which i will cover in more detail later in our call.
now let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter. revenues grew 5.4% in local currency and continue to include reductions of approximately 2 percentage points from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. q2 revenues were nearly $140 million above our guided range, driven by broad-based over-delivery across all dimensions, markets, services and industries, as our business built back even faster than anticipated. we also continued to extend our leadership position with growth significantly above the market. we saw broad improvement in industry trends. approximately 50% of our revenues came from seven industries that were less impacted by the pandemic, which in aggregate accelerated this quarter to low double-digit growth. at the same time, we saw continued improvement from clients in highly impacted industries, which collectively represents over 20% of our revenues and declined mid-single digits.
operating margin was 13.7%, an increase of 30 basis points for the quarter and 40 basis points year-to-date, reflecting strong underlying profitability as we continue to invest in our business and our people, including the one-time bonus we just announced. we continued to benefit from lower spend on travel, meeting and events. and we delivered very strong eps of $2.03, up 10% over fiscal '20 after adjusting both years for gains on investment.
and finally, we generated significant free cash flows of $2.4 billion in the quarter and $4 million year-to-date. we continue to execute on our strategic capital allocation objectives with roughly $3.1 billion returned to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases year-to-date. we've made investments of $1.1 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 19 transactions in the first half of the year, and we expect to invest at least $2 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year.
with that, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. new bookings were a record at $16 billion, representing a 13% growth in us dollar over previous record in q2 of last year. we had very strong overall book to bill of 1.3 in the quarter and 1.2 year-to-date. consulting bookings were $8 billion, a record high, with a book to bill of 1.2. outsourcing bookings were also a record at $8 billion, with a book to bill of 1.4. similar to last quarter, our bookings were driven by both technology services and operations. we were pleased with the strength of our bookings in strategy and consulting, with a book to bill of 1.2.
turning now to revenues. revenues for the quarter were $12.1 billion, an 8% increase in us dollars and 5.4% in local currencies, including a reduction of approximately 2% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. consulting revenues for the quarter were $6.4 billion, up 4% in us dollars and up 1% in local currency, including a reduction of approximately 3% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel costs. outsourcing revenues were $5.6 billion, up 14% in us dollars and 11% in local currency.
taking a closer look at our service dimensions, both operations and technology services grew double digits. as expected, strategy and consulting services declined high-single digits, and we expect strategy and consulting to return to growth in q3.
turning to our geographic markets. the industry dynamics that i mentioned earlier continued to play out in a similar manner across all three markets. in north america, revenue growth was 7% in local currency. in europe, revenues grew 3% in local currency, driven by mid-single-digit growth in italy and the uk. in growth markets, we delivered 6% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in japan.
moving down the income statement. gross margin for the quarter was 29.7% compared with 30.2% for the same period in last year. sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.4% compared with 10.4% for the second quarter last year. general and administrative expenses were 6.6% compared to 6.4% for the same quarter last year. operating income was $1.7 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.7% operating margin, up 30 basis points compared with q2 last year.
before i continue, as a reminder, in q2 last year we recognized an investment gain which impacted our tax rate and increased eps by $0.07. this quarter, we again recognized an investment gain, which impacted our tax rate and increased eps by $0.21. the following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.5% compared with the adjusted effective tax rate of 17.1% for the second quarter last year. adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.03 compared with an adjusted eps of $1.84 in the second quarter last year. this reflects a 10% year-over-year increase.
days service outstanding were 34 days compared to 38 days last quarter and 39 days in the second quarter of last year. free cash flow for the quarter was $2.4 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.5 billion net of property and equipment additions of $93 million. our cash balance at february 28 was $9.2 billion compared with $8.4 billion at august 31.
with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.6 million shares for $1.2 billion at an average price of $255.29 per share. as of february 28, we had approximately $5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. also in february, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share for a total of $561 million. this represented a 10% increase over last year. and our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share to be paid on may 14, a 10% increase over last year.
so, at the halfway point of fiscal '21 we feel really good about our results to date and our positioning for the remainder of the year, realizing that the pace of recovery is hard to accurately predict.
now let me turn it back to julie.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
thank you, kc.
let me start with the environment. we continue to see compressed transformation where companies have to simultaneously transform multiple parts of their enterprise and reskill their people in what previously would have been sequential programs. they're doing so to replatform their businesses in the cloud, address cost pressures, build resilience and security, adjust their operations and customer experiences and find new sources of growth.
covid has hit a giant fast-forward button to the future, and we believe the demand to innovate at unprecedented speed and scale with rapid adoption of cloud, ai and other disruptive technologies is accelerating. for digital leaders, we see them no longer strictly competing for market share but to build their vision of the future faster than the competition. and for digital laggards, they are determined to not simply catch up but to leapfrog. while covid has accelerated the demand, the reality is that the extent of transformation ahead is enormous. the move from approximately 20% to 80% in the cloud alone is a huge undertaking, and it is just the start as companies will then continue to invest to grow and innovate on their new cloud foundations.
which leads me to the role we are playing. in q2, our engines of growth across accenture have roared to life to meet these needs of our clients, and we see strong momentum going into q3. i will share some color and examples. we called the once in a digital era replatforming of businesses into the cloud in september 2020 when we created accenture cloud first to bring industry, cloud and state of the art change management and transformation together. we saw this quarter strong double-digit growth in cloud overall as well as the subset of accenture cloud first which growth was even higher. intelligent platform services, which is essential to building the digital core of our clients, is back to high-single digit growth as companies resume this critical aspect of their transformation.
applied intelligence with our data and ai solutions and security, both sizable but still in the early stages of the scale we expect long-term, both had strong double-digit growth in q2. operations grew double digits as companies seek to digitize their enterprises, leveraging our deep industry and functional expertise and ai driven synops platform. interactive improved and grew high single digits as companies continued to shift to digital channels, need cost efficiencies around sales and marketing to invest in new capabilities, seek more data-driven marketing campaigns and compete for customers and employees on the experience they provide. industry x, which is helping diversify our sources of revenue in the enterprise, grew strong double digits, driven by the need for product [indecipherable] to accelerate the time to market of smarter and more sustainable products and the need to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of manufacturing facilities and the ability to interconnect machines and operate remotely. these engines of growth are multiservice, bringing the best of accenture's strategy in consulting, interactive, technology and operations services together to create value.
we are distinctive because no other competitor has our scale and breadth of services which allows us to seamlessly serve the different dimensions of compressed transformation. we also are able to give our clients speed and cost levers through our managed services to digitize using our assets and platforms and address cost pressures. furthermore, our distinctive capabilities and industry innovation and investment are clear differentiators. our strong strategy and consulting practitioners bring deep industry expertise to all functions of the enterprise and help bring together our services to deliver to our clients, often informed by cross-industry insights such as for payments and omnichannel engagement.
our ability and commitment to consistently invest in acquisitions, r&d and our people is unmatched in our industry and our clients know that through our investments and focus on innovation we will help future proof them such as our innovation in emerging technologies like the work accenture labs is doing testing applications using neuromorphic computing where circuits are modeled after systems in the human brain and nervous system to deliver new ai capabilities and our 360 degree value strategy which seeks to bring talent upskilling, diversity and inclusion and sustainability to our work, is resonating with our clients as they seek to make progress as they transform.
two great examples of compressed transformation, strong leaders and our 360 degree value strategy are aig and shiseido. we are partnering with aig, a leading global insurance organization, to help them drive their aig 200 program, which is designed to achieve underwriting excellence, modernize their operating infrastructure, enhance user and customer experience and become a more unified company. this quarter, we acquired aig's shared services operations, which we will transform to serve aig to create a modern digital shared services platform with end-to-end processes that will improve the user experience using our synops platform, and, consistent with our 360 degree value strategy, we are investing in upskilling our new employees.
we have entered into a strategic partnership with shiseido, a leading global beauty company headquartered in japan. shiseido has launched a fundamental business transformation aiming to become a global leader in premium skin beauty by 2030 under its new medium to long-term strategy win 2023 and beyond. we are partnering with shiseido to accelerate digital transformation and create personalized and seamless customer experiences; design, develop and implement a cloud-based system that will help it adopt processes that enable continuous financial reporting that are forecasting accuracy [phonetic] and more precise inventory management. we are helping them use ai, analytics and automation to create new business value and helping their employees gain high level digital skills.
we are working with specsavers, the uk based leader in optometry, audiology and other healthcare services, to reimagine and transform their entire it organization through our living systems approach. we are leveraging new ways of working and agile foundations to capture efficiencies and reduce costs while positioning the company for growth and diversification to drive business resilience. with our managed security services, we are helping a central bank in asia strengthen their resilience against cyber threats [technical issues] video solution, live streams from 20 trackside and onboard cameras and a growing range of connected devices, we are continuously innovating to embed intelligence in their platforms to deliver the best possible viewer experience.
now let me turn to accenture's greatest and undeniable competitive advantage: our nearly 537,000 people. they are at the heart of our outstanding results. fundamental to our core values is to care deeply for our people, and we place significant importance on providing a meaningful employee experience. for almost every person around the world, living and working during the pandemic has been challenging. to help our people succeed both professionally and personally during this time, we have put in place many programs.
for example, we are partnering with bright horizons in the us through development of an innovative program for school-age children to receive proctoring for their virtual studies and homework. we have extended telemedicine to parents of our employees in india. and we are providing industry-leading mental wellness programs, including thriving minds, a holistic wellbeing program that teaches us about the science behind stress and how to recharge your brain's battery. we are proud that more than 160,000 of our people have completed the program with impressive results, including nearly nine out of 10 participants reported feeling significantly better able to handle challenges in the workplace.
equally important is our focus on vibrant career paths. we have maintained pay increases, bonuses and promotions, both in our normal december time period as well as an added round of promotions in february, enabling us to promote in total at the same level as the prior year. additionally, we will expand our regular midyear promotions this coming june to include managing directors, a first in our company's history as one more way to continue to create new opportunities for our people. and today we are announcing a special one-time bonus for all of our people below managing director to recognize the contributions and dedication to our clients during this difficult year. continuous learning also is a defining feature of accenture. we continue to invest in our people and their market-leading skills with a 28% increase in training hours and 25% increase in hours per person just this quarter.
and coming back to our ability to attract talent, we know that people want to work for companies that not only create value, but also lead with values. we are proud this quarter to have been named for the 14th consecutive year on ethisphere's world's most ethical companies list and for the 19th consecutive year on fortune's world's most admired companies.
our strategic decision to preserve our talent last year, including our recruiters, provided a strong base to meet the surge in demand we have experienced. recruiting, hiring and managing supply and demand has always been a core competency, and we are confident in our ability to attract talent and continue to meet the increased demand. we increased hiring approximately 50% both year-over-year and since last quarter and we've onboarded over 100,000 people virtually over the last 12 months with new innovative approaches.
i would like to recognize the extraordinary leadership and efforts of our chief leadership & human resources officer, ellyn shook and her outstanding team around the globe for how they have helped care for our people throughout the pandemic, guided us through health and safety of covid, ensuring that we are continuously reskilling our people and have helped us manage and realize the incredible expansion of our talent to meet the needs of our clients.
over to you, kc, for our look ahead

let me now turn to our business outlook. for the third quarter of fiscal '21, we expect revenues to be in the range of $12.55 billion to $12.95 billion. this assumes the impact of fx will be about positive 4.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal '20 and reflects an estimated 10% to 13% growth in local currency. for the full fiscal year '21, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of fx on our results in us dollars will be approximately positive 3% compared to fiscal '20. for the full fiscal '21, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% growth in local currency over fiscal '20, including approximately negative 1% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel based on a 2% reduction in the first half of the year and no material impact in the second half of the year.
for operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '21 to be 15% to 15.1%, a 30 to 40 basis point expansion over fiscal '20 results. we continue to expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. this compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal '20. for earnings per share, we now expect full year diluted eps for fiscal '21 to be in the range of $8.67 to $8.85. we now expect adjusted full year diluted eps to be in the range of $8.32 to $8.50 or 12% to 14% growth over adjusted fiscal '20 results. for the full fiscal '21, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $7.65 billion to $8.15 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion. our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to adjusted net income ratio of 1.3 to 1.4.
finally, we now expect to return at least $5.8 billion, an increase of $500 million through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.
with that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. angie?
angie park -- investor relations
thanks, kc.
i would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask the question. operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] one moment for our first question, and that comes from the line of lisa ellis with moffett nathanson. please go ahead.
lisa ellis -- moffett nathanson -- analyst
hey, good morning and thank you. great results here. couple of questions, one is a little more tactical, one more strategic. the first one in bookings, kc, can you just remind us one how acquisitions are not reflected in bookings? and then on the related note is the composition of your bookings changing at all? i'm just specifically thinking about these big $100 million plus transformation programs. are you seeing a notable change in duration or anything like that? just trying to understand the bookings number a little bit and then i'll follow-up. thank you.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
okay, great. thanks lisa. so let me just speak of those bookings a little bit. so we were really pleased with our bookings this quarter or $15.4 billion and again that grew 39% in us dollars, really strong book-to-bill of 1.2%. and in terms of -- when you look at it, there was very strong bookings in both consulting and outsourcing, as well as all three geographic markets. and if you look at specifically on our b&a [phonetic], which also was represented across all of those dimensions, there'll be a slight impact in our inner bookings based on the backlog that we bring in from these acquisitions, but it's not overall significant.
but let me just peel it back in terms of when you look underneath at $15.4 billion, i'd say there's really three things i'd point out. first was that there was really a good mix of all categories of our sales with -- as julie mentioned, we had a record 20 clients over $100 million of sales, and that as you know, positions us really well for the future. but if you go all the way down through the categories, all the way through our smaller deals, they represented very well and that can help us with revenue in the current quarter.
the second thing that i would point out is that our bookings were very broad-based across all of our services and that included strategy and consulting. and the third thing was that it was aligned to our strategic priorities, as we pointed out, driven by cloud, industry x and security for example.
so with those points, i would only hand it back to you to ask the second question or if there is any other color that you want to...
lisa ellis -- moffett nathanson -- analyst
terrific. thank you. the second one, maybe julie, this is for you. i just wanted -- hoping to comment on acquisitions. this is obviously, you've upticked acquisitions, made a couple of bigger ones than accenture has historically done. could you just talk about -- is this just kind of opportunistic or has something kind of shifted in terms of your willingness to do larger acquisitions or specific market opportunities you're going after? thank you.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
sure, lisa, and well, so we've always said, we have the capacity to do larger acquisitions, but we're very disciplined about what we will acquire, and so these were opportunities that were very aligned to our strategic priorities. so novetta being both investment in public sector, but primarily all about advanced analytics, machine learning, cyber and cloud engineering. and also importantly diversification for our federal business, because they're in the national intelligence space. and umlaut is in engineering, which was just an opportunity, it's a company that we know very well that really is giving us an opportunity to accelerate our scale in industry x and we've seen the digitization of manufacturing and engineering be a major priority post-covid, and we've been investing for nearly a decade in this space, we predicted this would happen. as you can see by the number, the amount of work that we're already doing, and this was a great opportunity for a company that we know well.
and our strategy continues to be, we're going to make acquisitions to scale and big market opportunities to add new skills and opportunities as you know that we've built a lot of interactive through acquisitions. for example, those were new skills and capabilities and then to deepen industry and functional knowledge. and so this is a continuation of that and you know i think the advantage we have is our financial capacity to make investments and to increase our investment, you know, for the benefit of our clients and all of our stakeholders, when we see the right opportunities, and we're going to continue to have that discipline around making strategic acquisitions.
lisa ellis -- moffett nathanson -- analyst
terrific, fantastic. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ashwin shirvaikar with citi. please go ahead.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
hey, thanks. and great quarter, congratulations on that from me as well. the question i had is about the momentum that you are seeing in the business and its roots [phonetic] have actually accelerated from what you're seeing in the past quarters. wanted to ask you with regards to whether these changes how you think about managing the business in the interim, in order to continue to deliver? what do you -- what you're seeing from a demand perspective, particularly as we see attrition go up and and so on, and that's in across the board statement, not just an accenture statement. so any thoughts with regards to how you're thinking of delivery?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes, ashwin, i'll take this and maybe i'll frame up a few things for you and hand it over to julie as well. so let me just maybe frame up how we were thinking about, you mentioned the demand in our overall business and think about the quarter and our year-to-date from a financial perspective. and these results are really exceptional when you think about it in the context of our historical performance. so i'll start there, i mean, clearly we're benefiting from an easier compare and a strong market demand, and we see that continuing.
but even with that, bookings at $44 billion growing 25% year-to-date, and that's off a base of record sales through q3 of last year and then you couple that with 54 clients with bookings over $100 million through q3, which is more in the first nine months of this year than the whole of last year '20 -- fy '20 and fy '19, and i mentioned that as you talk about things and different ways we may need to manage differently, just to talk about the scale in our bookings.
if you look at the scale of revenue, we grew record $2.3 billion in revenue this quarter year-over-year and you think about our industries where we're clearly the leader with a breadth and depth of industries, we had 11 of those 13 growing double-digits. and as i mentioned before in our guidance, the increase in our full-year outlook, it's driven by organic revenue given that inorganic is contribution staying pretty much the same. and then you add that all with profitability of 40 basis points expansion this quarter, we had very strong profitability and we're no longer benefiting from a travel tailwind and we continue to invest at scale in our business and our people.
so with that, let me hand it over more to julie to round out some of the questions you had on demand and attrition.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
yes. so, it's a great question around managing our business and so i want to just take you all back to right before the pandemic, i remember back then, and on march 1st, we put in a new growth model we call the nextgen growth model and that was designed for helping us manage our business as we saw the scale increasing, right? and that change in up in growth model was focused on being able to have more of our leaders closer to our clients. we changed the p&l as you recall to the geographic and so we've already put in place a model that is designed to allow us to continue to scale and so this for us was anticipated and it's exciting to see how we are very uniquely positioned as our clients' needs have accelerated, because that's what's driving the demand, right? the needs of our clients have accelerated post-covid to do compressed transformation and we have the right operating model in place.
as we think about attrition, it's ticked up to pre-covid levels in a hot market although not the highest we've ever seen. and so as you said, it's an industry phenomenon and we're comfortable. i mean, our core competency is about managing our supply and demand, but more importantly, our core competency is being a great company to work for, and as you saw with our numbers this quarter, we hired net 32,000 incredible people and that is just a testimony to our ability to attract great talent, as well as continue to train our people. we've trained over 100,000 people since the pandemic declare -- started pivoting to the areas of our clients' needs. so we feel good about it, and of course this is what you expect from us. so we'll continuously improve.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
thanks. so that all good points and i agree. i guess, the next question is with regards to -- and ordinarily, i don't focus on a particular acquisition, but just umlaut just seems to be -- i have to ask, is this the first of many as you expand into -- in much bigger engineering services type presence, that is a relatively massive end market. so strategically, how are you thinking of this?
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
look so -- so the big picture, we believe that the digital engineering and manufacturing space is the next frontier for our clients, right? there has been a lot and there is still a lot to do with respect to the front office and the back office for lack of a better term, right? our clients are building a digital core, they're transforming operations and they're trying to find new ways of growth, but the areas that have been not as digitized over the last several years as companies have pivoted has been in core operations, manufacturing and supply chain.
now we predicted this just as we predicted back in 2013 that someday everybody would be a digital business and so we've been investing, we've already made i don't know, seven, eight, nine acquisitions over the last several years to build these capabilities and you saw that with all the examples that we did in the script. and so this is about rapidly scaling with some of the best engineers in the world, right? because we see the market opportunity, but most importantly, the need from our clients. and so you should expect that we'll continue to build these both organically and inorganically. but obviously, this is a great add in terms of scale for us.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
great, thank you. congratulations.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of jason kupferberg with bank of america. please go ahead.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks guys, good morning. i'm wondering, if you can estimate for us perhaps how much the acceleration in all this enterprise digital transformation has enhanced your structural organic revenue growth profile relative to pre-pandemic levels, because it certainly sounds like this trend continues to have legs?
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
yes, i mean, i think the way to think about it is that we're taking market share and we're really well positioned to capture the growth that's available, because of the needs of our clients. and so you're obviously seeing that uptick in organic growth and how -- and if we think this will be sustained demand. i think it's too early and we're not going to kind of get back into, sort of, giving, sort of, an overview of fy '22. but what we would say is, we do believe that what you're seeing right now in demand isn't just like a recovery, because spending decreased. but actually sustained demand and that we are incredibly well positioned to capture that, because clients are looking for outcomes and the breadth of our services, they are turning to us, because we can give them solutions, not just individual services. they want the innovation that we're bringing, the things like our synops platform. they are very appreciative and focused on the fact that we care about the 360-degree value, so that we're helping improve their own skills, as well as to achieving their goals.
and finally, and i think something that is really critical right now and why we are so well positioned as they see us as a company that creates value and leads with values. and so trust really matters when you are doing major transformation. i'll give you one example, we've had over 80 clients in the last 12 months just come and sit down with us to learn more about our diversity supplier program, because it really matters to them and they see us as a leader, right? these are the things that make us an incredibly attractive and trusted partner. and so we think that this is really an enduring differentiation at a time when there is going to be sustained demand for compressed transformation.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, understood. just a quick two-part follow-up here. your thoughts on q4 book-to-bill, and what were the areas of the business that surprised you most in terms of revenue this quarter, because obviously the overall upside was quite significant? thank you.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes, jason, just in terms of how we think about the fourth quarter, i mean, so obviously, we've had $44 billion of bookings year-to-date and even with that we still have a strong pipeline and we feel good about our position for q4 as it relates to bookings. and in terms of what did better, as i mentioned earlier, it really was broad-based, every part of our business did a bit better.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, thanks for the comments.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of rod bourgeois with deepdive. please go ahead.
rod bourgeois -- deepdive -- analyst
hey, guys. i just wanted to ask about the margin outlook given the increased acquisition contribution that you'll be digesting in fiscal '22. i just like to ask about the margin levers that you'll be able to pull in order to still achieve overall operating margin expansion? and also, i guess, besides digesting this added acquisition content, are you also needing to spend more on people costs, given the award for talent that's out there? so question about margin levers and also the investments in people. thanks.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. thanks, rod. so i mean, let's start with the second one first. so yes, in terms of -- for the people side of it, obviously there's a lot of demand in the market, we're in a hot market right now. and historically, we've seen wages increase and that vary by skills and geographies and we -- that's happening now. but you see that, rod, flowing through our results already to-date and through our guidance. so it's really up to us to manage our business with rigor discipline as we always do you know us well, managing our pyramid, increasing use of automation and just overall delivery efficiencies. so that's the first part on wages as it relates to operating margin.
and just coming back to the same point on b&a. so let me just give you a little bit more color on b&a coupled with what i talked about a little bit earlier. and of course, i'm not going to give any specific guidance for fy '22 until september. but we do expect to have a higher level of inorganic contribution next year probably around something closer to 4% and that's really due to the fact that we're deploying about $4 billion in fy '21, a large portion that's closer to the later part of the year, and we expect to benefit from more of that revenue in fy '22.
we also expect at this time to deploy somewhere around $4 billion in fy '22, that's including umlaut, which we expect to close next year -- early in the year. and of course, as julie said, we've always said -- we always have the ability to do more, but that's a line of sight today. but and it's up to us to manage our -- to all the levers that we have in our disposal to continue within the premise of clients and our overhead and structural costs to make sure that we continue to drive modest margin expansion, while investing at scale in our business and our people.
rod bourgeois -- deepdive -- analyst
great. and then just a quick follow-up on the revenue progression that's happening. clearly, this is a big industry recovery, some of that cyclical, some of that secular, and you have certain covid-impacted verticals that are coming back online. i guess, as we head into the next fiscal year, are there -- on the other side, are there any revenue contributions that will taper as the covid crisis ends? are there any -- is there any sort of lumpy work that might taper off as you head into the next fiscal year, amid all of the other momentum that's happening in the business?
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
i mean, there is nothing material. i mean, we think about the public sector for example, we did a lot of covid surge work, but now you've got the fiscal stimulus that's around the world and you see the digitization of the public sector like we gave the example of concept in italy. so there is nothing material that we think will be difficult to manage, because you're seeing really -- when you see that in the results, kind of, across industries, there is need to digitize. so nothing material that we think to mention.
rod bourgeois -- deepdive -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of bryan bergin with cowen. please go ahead.
bryan bergin -- cowen & company -- analyst
good morning, thank you. i'm curious, over the last two to three quarters, have you seen a notable change in clients' appetite for price increases as broader transformation demand is ramped up?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes, so let me talk to you a little bit about what we're seeing in terms of pricing overall. so just importantly, as a reminder, we talk about pricing. we define it as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell bryan. and as always, the environment remains competitive, and in many areas of our business, we did see pricing was lower and that's really based on a combination of the fact that the market is competitive and disciplined investments that we're making. and so all of those baked into our operating margin guidance for the year.
bryan bergin -- cowen & company -- analyst
okay. and then one on accenture operations. i'm curious if you're seeing any change in the size and scope of engagements that clients are outsourcing. can you just comment on some of the strengths or the drivers of the continued strength that you've shown in that business?
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
yes, it's a great question. it's not so much about the size, it's really about the intent. i mean, what you're seeing is clients really saying in a world where i've got to digitize the entire enterprise, right? what can -- where do i want to focus my own resources and leadership and where can i leverage accenture and their investments? and this is where we really got ahead of the market, right? where we developed synops, and what we're providing them is both cost efficiencies, but really outcomes of actual insights to come from being able to digitize.
and then you add on top of that, where we have more clients thinking about having us takeover, we have a strong pipeline and taking over more people, because we are such a great employee value proposition and so they're starting when we think about the future of work, think about it, we're seeing more of our clients really see it as a combination of their own employees automation or bots and then partners like accenture, that really integrate with their own employees. and we're just a leader here, and so it's more about the trends of the need to digitize. that is what you're seeing reflected which is digitize at speed.
bryan bergin -- cowen & company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of bryan keane with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi guys, congrats on the results. i wanted to ask about strategy consulting. it had been a laggard, but saw that it moved positively into high single-digit. just a little bit on the outlook there, do you continue to see that maybe reach some of the demand you're seeing in some of your other industry groups?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. hey, bryan. thanks for the question. you're right, we were very pleased with the acceleration to high single-digits in the quarter in strategy and consulting, which is what we expected. in terms of how we look at just consulting overall type of work, go forward, we see it being strong double-digit for the fourth quarter and the second half of the year that would -- i mean we've round up really kind of at a strong double-digit growth perspective.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
and bryan as a reminder, because i remind you all every single quarter, right? clients aren't focused on is it strategy and consulting or technology or operations. they are looking for outcomes and what makes us so unique is that all of these things whether it's cloud or intelligent operations or marketing transformation bring together our services and with more confidence and certainty and that's really how we think about it.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. and then just as a follow-up. the increase in m&a, just curious on how you guys are thinking about capital allocation, in particular, the dividends and the share repurchase. does that change at all with a little more m&a?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
obviously, we'll give you -- i'll give you specifics in september, bryan, for next year. but overall, our capital allocation framework really remains intact.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
i mean, you should all just think about this as we're going to deliver on our commitments and we are investing to drive the next waves of growth and we are taking advantage of our ability to do so in this market.
bryan keane -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great, thanks so much.
angie park -- managing director and head of investor relations
last question. operator, we have time for one more question, then julie will wrap up the call.
operator
thank you and that question will come from yingying wang with jpmorgan. please go ahead.
yingying wang -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, thanks so much, amazing results. sorry if this was already asked, i jumped off earlier. just on the record number of deals over $100 million. i'm just curious how the pipeline is for such deals going forward. is there an opportunity replenish just what is the -- what do you see out there in terms of large deal potential from here?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. hey, yingying, we still have a strong pipeline overall and that includes in the large deal category.
yingying wang -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, good. and then just on the $4 billion inorganic contribution, i heard that for next year. how about on the margin impact there, i think kc, you mentioned that there'll be a little bit impact on margin. you'll still be able to expand. just wanted to make sure i heard that correctly? thanks.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yes. so yes, we want to -- so what i did say that we do expect inorganic contribution next year about 4% and we -- our line of sight now is about $4 billion of capital spend next year '22, but we expect modest margin expansion to continue in '22.
yingying wang -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, very good. appreciate that guys. well done.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thank you.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
great, yingying. okay, in closing, we really appreciate everyone joining us today. we believe that we are unique, because of both what we do and how we do it and we are a company that as i've shared before creates value and leads with values. i want to thank all of our people and our leaders for what you're doing every day. and finally, i want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support. we will make sure to earn it every day, be well.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. and and welcome to accenture's third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to our host managing director, head of investor relations ms. angie park. please go ahead.
angie park -- managing director and head of investor relations
thank you, operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings announcement. as the operator just mentioned, i'm angie park, managing director, head of investor relations. on today's call, you will hear from julie sweet, our chief executive officer and kc mcclure, our chief financial officer. we hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.
let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. julie will begin with an overview of our results; kc will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet along with some key operational metrics for the third quarter. julie, will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before kc provides our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021. we will then take your questions before julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.
some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook are forward-looking and as such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on form 10-k and quarterly reports on form 10-q and other sec filings. these risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call.
during our call today, we will reference certain non-gaap financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. we include reconciliations of non-gaap financial measures where appropriate to gaap in our news release or in the investor relations section of our website at accenture.com. as always, accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.
now, let me turn the call over to julie.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
thank you, angie, and thank you everyone for joining us. we had another outstanding quarter reflecting our laser focus on creating 360-degree client value and the importance of our scale, experience, industry knowledge and trust to the world's leading companies and governments as they continue to digitally transform their enterprises.
we had a record 20 clients with bookings over $100 million and a total of $15.4 billion in bookings. we delivered 16% revenue growth in local currency, 3% above the top of our guided range with outstanding profitability and free cash flow. we estimate that we continue to take significant market share. our growth was broad-based across geographic markets and industries with 11 out of 13 industries growing double-digits this quarter and reflects our ability to bring together our unmatched breadth of services from strategy and consulting to interactive technology and operations to create the solutions, which achieve the value at speed that makes a difference to our clients.
we continue to meet our clients' strong demand adding a net 32,000 talented people this quarter alone. we offer an employee value proposition that allows us to attract top talent, develop our people with world-class training and provide them with vibrant career path. we are pleased with our record 117,000 promotions year-to-date, including almost 1,200 promotions to managing director, and while delivering these results, we have raised the bar again in terms of investments.
we now expect to invest about $4 billion in strategic acquisitions this fiscal year with 39 acquisitions closed or announced year-to-date. this includes announcing this quarter two acquisitions with purchase prices over $1 billion each. the acquisition by accenture federal services of novetta in the us, an advanced analytics company, which we expect to close in august, and then umlaut, a world-class engineering services company headquartered in germany, which we expect to close in q1. these 39 acquisitions are well balanced with 10 in north america, 17 in europe, and 12 and growth markets.
our level of investment demonstrates as well how scale, experience and trust matters. scale in terms of our financial capacity, experience in terms of our track record of the successful integration of approximately 200 companies since 2013, and the trust we have earned in the market that attracts leading companies to want to join the accenture family. we invest in acquisitions to scale in areas where we see a big market opportunity to add skills and new capabilities and to further deepen our industry and functional expertise, all to drive continued innovation in the next waves of growth.
finally, because we believe strongly in our commitment to share success with our communities, we recently announced that we would donate $100 for every one of our then 540,000 employees or $54 million to urgently address the needs of our communities, due to the pandemic, including $25 million for india.
kc, over to you.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thank you, julie. and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. as you heard in julie's comments, we are extremely pleased with our results in the third quarter, which continue to reflect very strong momentum across all dimensions of our business. based on the strength of our third quarter results and the confidence we have in our fourth quarter to continue to extend our market leadership position, we are increasing our full-year outlook, which i will cover in more detail later in the call.
before i get into the details, let me summarize the major headlines of our third quarter results, which reflect continued superior execution against our three financial imperatives. revenue increased nearly $2.3 billion, reflecting growth of 16% in local currency. results were approximately $300 million above the top end of our guided range driven by broad-based overperformance across the business, with double-digit growth in all three markets, four or five industry groups and in technology services and operations.
as we expected, both strategy and consulting and the resources industry group returned to growth. these results demonstrate the power of our business model and our unique ability to seamlessly integrate our services at scale. we estimate that our growth continues to significantly outpace the market.
operating margin was 16%, an increase of 40 basis points for the quarter. importantly, we no longer have the margin expansion tailwind from lower travel as we anniversary the benefit of the compare in this quarter. we continue to absorb significant investments in our people and our business as we are always focused on positioning our business for the future and we delivered very strong eps of $2.40, up 26% over fiscal '20.
finally, we delivered strong free cash flow of $2.2 billion in the quarter and $6.2 billion year-to-date, while also continuing all elements of our capital allocation program including returning roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders this quarter via dividends and share repurchases. we've made investments of $1.5 billion in acquisitions through q3 and we now expect to invest about $4 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year, which is -- which does not include the umlaut acquisition, which we anticipate to close in fy '22.
i want to take a moment to highlight that as you can see from our results and guidance this year, we are able to step up our acquisition spend and continue to expand operating margin. and well, i won't comment on the specifics of fy '22 until september, based on our current line of sight, you should think of next year's inorganic contribution in the range of 4%, and we expect margin -- modest margin expansion as we continue to run our business with rigor and discipline.with that, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. new bookings were $15.4 billion for the quarter with a very strong book-to-bill of 1.2. consulting bookings were $8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. outsourcing bookings were $7.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. we were very pleased with our new bookings, which represent 39% growth in us dollars and reflect a record 20 clients with bookings over $100 million. each service dimensions, strategy and consulting, technology services and operations delivered double-digit bookings growth in local currency.
turning now to revenues. revenues for the quarter were $13.3 billion, a 21% increase in us dollars and a 16% increase in local currency. consulting revenues for the quarter were $7.3 billion, up 21% in us dollars and 16% in local currency. outsourcing revenues were $6 billion, up 20% in us dollars and up 16% local currency. taking a closer look at our service dimensions, operations grew very strong double-digits, technology services grew strong double-digits, and strategy and consulting grew high single-digits.
turning to our geographic markets. in north america, revenue growth was 18% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in public service, software & platforms and consumer goods, retail and travel services. in europe, revenues grew 14% local currency. we saw double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services and industrial, and high single-digit growth in banking, capital markets.
looking closer at the countries, europe was driven by double-digit growth in uk, italy and germany. in growth markets, we delivered 15% revenue growth in local currency, led by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, banking, capital markets and public service. from country perspective, growth markets was led by double-digit growth in japan and brazil.
moving down to income statement. gross margin for the quarter was 33.2%, compared with 32.1% for the same period last year. sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.6%, compared with 10.2% for the third quarter last year. general and administrative expense was 6.6%, compared to 6.3% for the same quarter last year.
operating income was $2.1 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 16% operating margin, up 40 basis points, compared with q3 last year. our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%, compared with an effective tax rate of 25.5% for the third quarter last year.
diluted earnings per share were $2.40, compared to eps of $1.90 in the third quarter last year. days service outstanding were 36 days, compared to 34 days last quarter and 41 days in the third quarter of last year.
free cash flow for the quarter was $2.2 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.4 billion net of property and equipment additions of $158 million. our cash balance at may 31st was $10 billion, compared with $8.4 billion at august 31st.
with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3 million shares for $835 million at an average purchase price of $276.98 per share. as of may 31st, we had approximately $4.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. also, in may, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share for a total of $559 million. this represents a 10% increase over last year, and our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share to be paid on august 13th, also a 10% increase over last year.
so, in summary, we are extremely pleased with our results to-date and are now focused on q4 and closing out a very strong year.
now let me turn it back to julie.
julie sweet -- chief executive officer
thanks, kc. i'll start with the environment. the dynamics in the market we are seeing are not only a recovery from the lower spending pattern at the onset of the pandemic, but a more sustained growth in demand, as companies raise to modernize and accelerate their digital initiatives with compressed transformation.
pre-covid, our research showed a digital achievement gap with leaders growing 2 times faster than laggards and we estimate that gap has now widened to 5 times with leaders stepping up their investment in technology and innovation and leap progress taking accelerated steps to catch up.
cloud is an even more critical enabler as companies are increasing their focus on enterprisewide transformations and rapidly moving to digital and cloud powered models. these needs of our clients are driving strong momentum in our business with an acceleration of continued strong double-digit growth across applied intelligence, cloud, industry x, intelligent operations and security, with interactive and intelligent platform services returning to strong double-digit growth this quarter. these strategic priorities are multiservice and are powered by our unparalleled technology ecosystem relationships.
let me share some color to bring this demand to life. i want to particularly highlight cloud, which continues to have very strong double-digit growth rates, as well as the subset of accenture cloud first where growth was even stronger and has exceeded our expectations when we formed cloud first last september. with our cloud first services, we are helping agencies served by concept. italy's national procurement agency to deliver on italy's national recovery and resilience plan. we develop and -- developing and running industry-specific cloud-based platforms to standardize and improve their efficiency and speed, reducing the time to launch new contracts and ultimately providing much improved services for italy citizens.
we are using our intelligent platform services to help dupont, a company with a rich history of business reinvention. we imagine its financial structure to coordinate operations across its large geographic footprint. after going through a strategic and deliberate restructuring through m&a, we will now help dupont implement a central finance processing suite that will help them to consolidate their multiple financial systems and chart of accounts into one and close the books faster. this will provide real-time review of results for all of the business units, all in the cloud, giving dupont more agility, speed and certainty in a complex and volatile market.
we are helping jaguar land rover transform its global marketing model to deliver a more personalized customer experience with creativity and technology at its core. we were selected for our technology capabilities, data-led performance and experience-led approach. we will use the strength of the experience, creative and digital capabilities of interactive and the marketing delivery capabilities of operations with our synops platform, which we already use as part of jaguar land rover's warranty operations. synops will deliver ai-powered insights and highly automated production around the world.
security is top of mind for our clients as the threat landscape expands. our very strong double-digit growth is driven by the breadth and depth of our services from advisory to cyber defense to manage security. for example, facing ever increasing cyber threats and continued financial pressures as a result of covid-19, accenture is helping a uki bank by bringing together the full breadth of these capabilities to provide innovative solutions to support the bank's future security strategy.
across many of these examples are our implied intelligence services. we were excited this quarter to announce accenture federal services agreement to acquire novetta, an advanced analytics company serving us federal organizations, it is demonstrating what's possible with analytics, machine learning, cyber and cloud engineering. this will augment our already strong capabilities and scale in these critical areas providing even more diversification across our federal business, specifically in the national security space, which is seeing substantial growth.
i want to give a special recognition to our colleagues serving the public sector around the world throughout the pandemic. there were seven consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, reflect your absolute commitment to the important missions of government serving their citizens.
turning now to industry x, our digital engineering and manufacturing services. we believe the product development, design engineering, manufacturing and the supply chain make up the next big digital transformation frontier. the impact of covid-19 is accelerating the need to transform these core operations, and for nearly a decade, we have been investing to build the unique capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to combine the power of data and digital with traditional engineering services.
we are very pleased with the announcement of our agreement to acquire umlaut, which will add more than 4,200 industry-leading engineers and consultants across 17 countries and expand our capabilities across a range of industries including automotive, aerospace and defense, telecommunications, energy and utilities.
some recent examples of our industry x services include helping a german telecom company continuously develop and enhance their internet television service by utilizing embedded engineering in their set top boxes and managing new features on the platform. helping a large media conglomerate accelerate their primary revenue streams in digital products and advertising with our product and platform engineering expertise to design, build, test and deploy new products, services and features. and working with a global automotive oem to execute online remote software updates for their in-car computer systems to allow seamless deployment of new software versions.
we are also working with an american multi-national manufacturer of confectionary, pet food and other food products to deploy a digital twin platform to optimize production in its manufacturing facilities, improve margins and reduce waste. we're working with a large electric company in japan to help their power plants -- to help bring their power plants into the future by digitizing their operations and standards across each department.
and with a large oil and gas company to build their internal digital capabilities to substantially reduce time to market for new digital solutions that extend to its customers, while supporting the company's key safety and sustainability goals throughout the use of a digital factory.
taking a step back, the examples i have provided today all required deep industry knowledge and innovation. our breadth and depth across industries enables us to tailor industry solutions, while bringing cross-industry expertise as we help our clients facing industry convergence and by using the lessons of other industries. we are proud this quarter that fast company recognized us for innovation across multiple initiatives in its world-changing ideas awards.
our cross-industry expertise is one of the powerful sources of our ability to innovate. for example, using our deep banking industry and technical expertise, we rapidly developed for a commercial bank, which was not a traditional small business administration lender, a program under the us paycheck protection program that allows them to make loans to 1,000s of small businesses struggling with the impacts of the pandemic.
we then pivoted to apply this approach to stand up facebook's small business grants program for black-owned businesses enabling the distribution of 10,000 grants to black-owned businesses in the us. this grants program is an important part of facebook's overall commitment to invest $200 million in building programs and tools for black-owned businesses.
finally, let me turn to our incredible people. their health and safety remain our top priority. we are supporting our people by facilitating vaccinations including standing up clinics in many of our offices such as in india where already 50,000 of our people, their families and contractors have been vaccinated. we have been focused on taking the lessons of an almost 100% remote workforce during the pandemic to a new way of working, moving from a remote or hybrid model to an omni-connected experience.
people will work in a office, from home and at client sites and it is likely many of our clients will be doing the same. so our approach focuses on the experience of connecting to continue to serve our clients in a differentiated way and create an environment that our people feel a sense of belonging.
the rich diversity and ingenuity of our people from our board of directors to our new hires helps us deliver 360-degree value for the benefit of all. we now have more than 250,000 women, representing approximately 46% of our workforce. as you may recall, shortly after the murder of george floyd in the us, on this call, i shared with you our commitment to take three actions in the us, setting external goals to increase representation, training our people and making a bigger impact in our communities.
one year later, i am pleased to report that we not only took each action, but have made measurable progress, including increasing our representation, having 95% of our us people complete our new anti-racism training and making substantial new investments in our communities. you can find a full progress update on our website, because we believe transparency and accountability are hallmarks of good governance and essential to building trust.
as we see the rise or continuation of all kinds of hate crimes against diverse communities including violence against asians, the lgbti community, anti-semitism and islamophobia, i want to reaffirm my and accenture's unwavering commitment to equality and justice for all and zero tolerance for racism, bigotry and hate of any kind.
kc, back to you.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thanks, julie. let me now turn to our business outlook. for the fourth quarter of fiscal '21, we expect revenues to be in the range of $13.1 billion to $13.5 billion. this assumes the impact of fx will be positive 4%, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '20 and reflects an estimated 17% to 21% growth in local currency.
for the full fiscal year '21, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of fx on our results in us dollars will be approximately positive 3.5%, compared to fiscal '20.
for the full fiscal '21, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 10% to 11% growth in local currency over fiscal '20, including approximately negative 1% from a decline in revenues from reimbursable travel. based on a 2% reduction, the first half of the year, and no material impact in the second half of the year. importantly, organic revenue is a driver of the increase to our updated guidance, as we still expect the inorganic contribution to remain at about 2.5% for the full-year.
for operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '21 to be 15.1%, a 40 basis point expansion over fiscal '20 results. we now expect our annual effective -- our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%. this compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal '20.
for earnings per share, we now expect full-year diluted eps for fiscal '21 to be in the range of $9.07 to $9.16. we now expect adjusted full-year diluted eps to be in the range of $8.71 to $8.80 or 17% to 18% growth over adjusted fiscal '20 results.
for the full fiscal '21, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.65 billion to $9.15 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $650 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion. our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.4 to 1.5.
finally, we continue to expect to return at least $5.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.
with that, let's open it up, so that we can take your questions. angie?
angie park -- managing director and head of investor relations
thanks, kc. i would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call.
",2021-Q3,ACN
0.8442000000000001,1.0,,,":
operator
of course. [operator instructions] and today let's see our first question comes from the line of keith bachman of bank of montreal. please go ahead.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hi. many thanks for letting me the opportunity to ask the question. i had two if i could. outstanding set of results and guidance first of all. i wanted to ask about the cash flow if i could, guidance. and even at the high end of the range the cash flow margin would be a pretty significant step down from fiscal '20 into fiscal '21. so i just wondered is there any puts and takes within the cash flow guidance that we should be aware of as we're doing our model? thank you. and i have a quick follow-up to that.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
sure, great, thanks. nice to hear from you keith. yeah, so our free cash flow of $7.5 billion to $8 billion, it reflects very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2, and so we're really pleased with that. and it does have slightly higher capex expense of $700 million. so that's one slight difference from over '21 we did have exceptionally a strong free cash flow in fiscal year '21 at 1.5 free ash flow to net income ratio. and that is just exceptional performance. it's not unusual for us to have free cash flow guidance at the beginning of the year, that is a decrease over what we've done in the previous years. and then lastly, we do allow for a slight uptick in dso in our guidance for next year, which would still be very industry leading dso performance.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay. excellent, excellent. and then, julie, maybe just for you. i think you mentioned this year you did 46 m&a deals and you mentioned in the guidance comments that there's quite a bit of m&a, i think $4 billion in m&a contemplated for this coming fiscal year. how do you think about the integration risk? accenture has i would argue a very special culture and you're bringing in a lot of new people over the course of the last 12 months than before the next 12 months. how do you think about the risk of a simulation of these deals and how do you manage this process? you have a very good track record over the last 10 years, but there is a lot of m&a on the table that you're bringing into the company. i was just wondering if you could speak to how you think about the risk associated with that to make sure the business keeps keeps moving forward?
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
sure. so, great question, and thanks, keith. so first of all, as you indicated, we've got a really strong track record and so the step up in acquisition comes based on years of experience, including and fine-tuning integration. so that's number one. secondly, our acquisitions happen globally and as i've talked about this year, they're pretty evenly balanced. and why is that important? when we switched to our model earlier this year of a geographic focus model from a p&l perspective, one of the reasons is to allow us as well to be super close to our people and most of these acquisitions are not global, right. some are, like an umlaut. but, like for example, project nevada in the federal business, very local, and the vast majority are in one or two markets like -- and so the integration, it's not like you have this enormous company that's trying to integrate lots of people all over the globe at the same time. we have senior leaders accountable for the acquisitions and so we really get the right balance, and we have our own and so for example, when we look at this, we look at market by market, how many acquisitions that we're doing in this market. so how does that enable us to make sure that we can spend the time. so this is a finely tuned approach for integration. and of course, we bring on people in acquisition or not all the time and so we just focus on culture is just part of who we are.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
okay, excellent. thank you, julie.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of lisa ellis with moffettnathanson. please go ahead.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. thinking about the $50 billion of revenue milestone, which is pretty amazing. julie, as you're mapping out the path to $60 billion over the next few years, can you talk about where you see the major sources of incremental revenue looking out from here forward? thank you.
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
great, well thanks. thanks, lisa, and i'll talk to you. first of all, and i talked a little bit about in this in the script. we are still very early in the transformation of companies in building just their digital core. so for example, if you look at something like sap, their stats that they point out is sort of less than 20% of companies who've actually both bought and begun implementing [indecipherable], right. and we see the move to the cloud, you've got sort of maybe today roughly 25% to 30% of workloads. so there is a lot of work which is a multi-year journey in actually building the digital core and then at the same time transforming the ways they work. so we've got multi-year ahead. and even when you look at who's doing compressed transformation, you have this core of leaders and leapfrogers, but the vast majority of companies are not yet engaged in compressed transformation. so just from a multi-year outlook on the fundamentals of replatforming and moving to a true digital digital-enabled enterprise is still in early stages.
then you add on top of that, there are whole parts of the enterprise where even the technologies are really new and so industry x is a great example of that. we see that as the next digital frontier, and we're still very, very early and so that will be kind of its own ways as we look -- as we look forward. and then areas like sustainability, again technology is early. every industry has to find its way on sustainability. and so as we think about our own growth strategy, it starts with what our clients needs. so we continue to diversify the parts of the enterprise that we're serving and that enables -- that's what our clients need and that enables next ways of growth for us. and we continue to innovate and anticipate like in sustainability, what our clients need and so when you kind of take this you see both from serving the enterprise, the majority of that and then you add a top of that, that there are areas that are evergreen, like interactive. it's all about client, the growth agenda, it's always going to change. manufacturing will be the same. security grows as the digital landscape grows. so hopefully that gives you a flavor of how we're thinking about both our next ways of growth and just the resiliency of the diversity of what we do.
keith bachman -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah, terrific. then my follow-up was actually on managed services which you called out in the prepared remarks, not really used to thinking about accenture doing managed services. can you just elaborate a bit on that? is this primarily actually infrastructure related managed services or apps or just maybe a little bit more detail on what exactly you're doing and accenture's differentiation there? thanks.
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
so just think if we had consulting and outsourcing, right. so managed services is just another term for outsourcing. and so if you think about our operations business, which is now about $8 billion, right. so all the managed services we provide, everything from finance and accounting to industry specific, like we called out in the script, the stuff we're doing and telecom, we're doing things in insurance and both health and p&c, so you had industry specific. we have marketing services through that. then of course there is our powerful it services. we've been doing outsourcing for years, right. term application outsourcing is an industry term. and then we have our managed services and security. we bought symantec last year. and so this is a core part when you think about our revenue between consulting and outsourcing. and the point that's happening now is that we've always done this, but what we're seeing is -- i just had a call with the ceo the other day who is like -- he started the call was like, julie, i'm really having a hard time hiring people in digital, right. and how are you seeing companies help and we talked about how by strategically outsourcing like in security, in marketing, you can access the digital talent and it becomes part of their own talent strategy to address the war for talent, while at the same time digitizing faster. i have another client who said look you had 50 things that my it department was about to build in order for us to automate and transform and i get it through your synops platform, the same is true on the it and infrastructure side. and of course, infrastructure managed services in the cloud growing area as well from the move to the cloud. so i think the shift we were calling out, lisa, though it's just how strategic this is at a time of compressed transformation because it's meeting the needs of the gor [phonetic] on talent and the need to digitize and the need to move fast at the same time.
lisa ellis -- moffettnathanson -- analyst
great, thank you. thanks a lot and congrats.
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of bryan bergin with cowen. please go ahead.
bryan bergin -- cowen & co -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you. first a question on bookings. can you talk about the dynamic in 4q? it looks like outsourcing did tick down for the first time in a while year-over-year. so just anything to call out there? and then just generally, how do you see the pipeline developing as you think about fiscal '22 bookings levels?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah, thanks, brian. so there is nothing really to point out in terms of q4 bookings with outsourcing, they can't just be a bit lumpy. but it was very strong performance. but let me just maybe talk a little bit about overall bookings as we head into '22. we do feel really good about the momentum in our business. and as julie went through, we had 72 clients with bookings over $100 million this year and you can see that then helping us as we head into fy'22, bryan, lets say 18% to 22% that we have in q1, and you also see that in our 12% to 15% revenue range that we have for fiscal '22. i think it's important to also note that it does include about 5% inorganic contribution, but it's at the top end of our revenue range, again driven by -- driven by bookings. it's going to represent about 10% organic growth at the upper end. and what we do benefit from an easier compare in the first half, it does continue to imply strong organic growth in the second half. and if you look at why is that. when you peel back bookings, again pleased with the $15 billion that we had in q4, strong book-to-bill of 1.1. it is $60 billion for the whole year with double-digit growth in consulting. and i think it's important to also note that consulting bookings, we had $8 billion for the last three quarters, which is terrific.
and outsourcing, which for the entire year had a very strong book-to-bill of 1.2 in all three markets and services. and when you peel it back, there is really three things again, just peeling back bookings for you. there are three things that i would also note. one is that, yes, we did have a lot of larger bookings that help us -- position us well for the future throughout fy '22, but we had a nice mix all the way through to the smaller deals, which benefit near-term revenue. the second thing is that the bookings were very broad-based across all of our services and that includes strategy and consulting, which is really good as well. and lastly, there are as julie talked quite a bit about our strategic priorities, cloud, industry and security for example.
bryan bergin -- cowen & co -- analyst
okay, thank you. a follow-up here then on attrition. can you just give us a sense of what you're anticipating for attrition level factored into '22? and any added measures you're taking to try and drive that 19% down?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah, so let me just maybe talk a little bit about the numbers and julie can give some other color here. but our managed attrition is brian, was really in the fourth quarter was in the zone that we expected, and its 14% for the year and we've been at 19% before, it's obviously a very hot market right now. but when you peel it back, it continues to be more in the lower part of the pyramid and it's largely concentrated in india, where we really don't have any issues in hiring.
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
yeah, and i think that's important because you look at a headline number and then you have to really kind of understand where is the attrition and at the same time, as you might imagine, we're always very focused on making sure that we're attractive. so we're very pleased that our executive retention is going very well. i think we are -- we are much focused on our employee value proposition. and when you think about the actions we've taken, like a record number of 120,000 promotions, the training that we're providing people that's really valued. and then frankly things like the way that we have approached vaccines, right. so we've now vaccinated 85,000 of our people and their families directly, in addition to what we're supporting through, like in the u.s. through our our carriers. and as i talked a little bit about in the script, what we find is people really care about the fact that they are working for a company that focuses on financials and all of the other, what we call 360 degree value. so what we're doing is sustainability, being a leader that we're going to be carbon-neutral by 2025 really matters. and so we continue to look at how can we help our people be net better off, succeed personally and professionally and be proud of the company that not only creates value but leads with values.
bryan bergin -- cowen & co -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of james faucette with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
james faucette -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you very much. wanted to ask a couple of quick questions that are follow-up on the hiring. your pace of hiring and net has been quite stunning at least over the last couple of quarters. can you talk about a little more detail in terms of how you're finding the hiring environment, particularly for newer skill sets? and i guess do you think you need to kind of sustain the recent pace of hiring going forward? and i guess my second question i'll just throw it in at the same time is back to vna [phonetic] you talked about the kind of the inorganic contribution and integration. but is this kind of the recent pace that we've seen? is this also something that you expect to need to sustain and want to sustain on a go-forward basis, whether in terms of number of deals or amount that you're spending, etc.? thanks a lot.
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
okay. thanks. i will cover the head count. so i would just first start with -- in this market with the war for talent, we're very pleased with the 56,000 net additional people that we hired in q4. as we see strong momentum really continuing in fy'22 and you see that again in our growth rates for the first quarter, we're off to a strong start at 18% to 22% in q1, and the full year at the top end of 15%. and we were able to accelerate some of our hiring, and we plan to continue to do so in quarter one in order to have the talented people that we need to match demand in the market. and so that's to your first question on hiring.
to your second question on vna. well, i won't guide longer term and to the amount of spend that we're going to do past '22 in vna. it remains an important part of our strategy on a go-forward basis.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah, and i just -- i think it's just remember, taking a step back on two things. one is on the people side. we made a deliberate decision to accelerate hiring this quarter and next quarter, which given as you said the environment and our ability to attract people we think makes sense so that we're not -- we're not worried about being constrained with respect to people and we're able to do that, and i think that's a huge differentiator for us. and secondly, and we made a decision last year and we've made a decision this year in vna to really invest and take advantage of our ability to invest to serve our clients. and when i go to clients, one of the things that we talk about is and clients really value is it when they're partnering with us, they're partnering not just with the capabilities we have today, but because we have a track record of investing year in and year out and creating and anticipating their needs, and we point to the kinds of acquisitions, like in umlaut, like in nevada, like infiniti works and cloud, and that we're doing it in markets all around the world to benefits them. and so we believe this is really setting us up last year and this year right for this next ways of growth and it's truly differentiating in the eyes of our clients.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of ashwin shirvaikar from citi. please go ahead.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
thank you. hi, julie. hi, kc, angie. congratulations on the results and outlook. first question is, it seems clear we are in a very exciting time here for it services. i had this view for some time now that the acceleration of demand that you're seeing is sustainable for several years. i don't mean to imply that getting revenue growth is easy, but if you have to worry less about revenue growth given the investments you already made, do you have the opportunity to change your financial model, accelerate it, get higher gross margins, better g&a leverage, thoughts on moving to a more non-linear model with solutions may be especially important given that you are at 620,000 people?
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll start with that. i think, ashwin, our financial model really remains the same in terms of three key imperative that you have to go through each year, which is grow faster than the market take share, modest margin expansion, while investing at scale in our business, in our people. so in the last part, maybe i'll just talk about op margin. so we are very proud of the 10 basis points to 30 basis points that we have this year. that does imply, obviously, that we will continue to get efficiencies in how we run our business both in terms of how we deliver to our clients as well as within the sg&a and how we run our own organization.
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
yeah, maybe just to add a couple of points. i'm glad you acknowledge that revenue growth is not easy. so thank you for that. but i -- we are just taking a step back to just to make sure because i think over the last decade you've seen a real shift in the professional services industry. the nature of the exponential technology change and the need to help clients move faster and do so more efficiently has meant that you need to be able to invest significantly. so as we think about moving forward, like the investments we've done to build synops and continue to evolve it to build industry solutions as you mentioned, require us to continuously innovate in best, you saw that in our ip patent portfolio. and so what i would say is, it's not that you sort of say here's the revenue and then can you just fundamentally shift because there is significant cost. having all aspects of our business grow like this is not simply because there is demand, it's the solutions we're bringing out.
as i've talked about in prior earning cloud, it isn't linear today even because we've automated so much of what we do when you look at something like our operations business, you look at mywizard, and we continue to do so, and that's really part of the business now. and so i think it's important to kind of understand what's helping drive the demand for our services, the way we are gaining market share is not simply because there is a lot of demand in the market, but the solutions we're bringing. and this is our big differentiator because we can go all the way from strategy to operations, right.
all of the examples we're giving involve multiple aspects of our services and you can't just build that overnight either, right. so the fact that we're becoming integrated and talent strategy in our outsourcing, also called managed services is about being trusted and the fact that we could deliver during the pandemic and be a trusted partner puts us in a very different place than others who might be trying to build these capabilities.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
got it, got it. thank you for that. and then the other question is over the last 18 months your revenue growth has absorbed the negative impact of less t&e. is that coming back? do you have updated thoughts on back to office? what's the assumption for that in your outlook?
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
so i'll let kc answer specifically, but i will say that if any of us can actually predict how we're going to go to the office, i'd like to meet that person. it is best to say, it's been a humbling experience, right. how many times that we all gotten ready to go back and i don't know about you, but like like five different things that we're going to be in person in the next few months are coming back to zoom or our team. so it's been an interesting time, the new normal. but kc, why don't you take us through just to see assumptions we're using.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah, so ashwin, just -- first i'll start with revenue. our revenue guidance, the 12% to 15%, it does not include any specific uptick from reimbursable travel. and if that assumption changes, we'll reflect that in our updated guidance. and as julie said just in terms of increases to travel assumed in our overall p&l for '22, it is difficult to predict, but we do have an increased build into particularly in the back half of the year for some travel costs.
ashwin shirvaikar -- citi -- analyst
got it. thank you for that.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of jason kupferberg with bank of america. please go ahead.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, guys. good morning. i wanted to start just with the visibility question. the reason i ask is obviously your constant currency revenue growth here in q4 was quite robust, but it wasn't really above the top end of your guidance, whereas in recent quarters you had been handily exceeding the top end of your expectations, so i'm just wondering is it simply because your visibility has improved so you've gotten more comfortable, you don't necessarily need to put extra cushion into the guidance? or did some bookings not ramp as fast as expected in the quarter? and then just a related question for fiscal '22. as you set the initial outlook for this year, any change in approach versus this time last year, again perhaps because your visibility has improved? thanks.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah, i will answer both questions in really the same way, which is for the fourth quarter we were slightly above our fx adjusted guided range, but we always try to aim to be in the top part of our guided range. and really just this year it's been a story of an unprecedented ramp so we're really pleased that we were able to kind of nail down where we thought we would end up the quarter. and it's just the same thing really for '22, it's not any change in visibility, it's not any change in the way we're doing things. we always call as we see it. these are our best estimates. and with the 12% to 15%, all parts -- all points are in possibility that's why they're in the range, but we continue like we always do to aim for the top margin and top part of the range. no change.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, ok. good to know. and just a follow-up. what are your expectations for book-to-bill in consulting and overall for the first quarter and for the full fiscal year? and then just what you're thinking about for consulting versus outsourcing revenue growth this year? thanks, guys, congrats.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you. yeah, so we feel good about our pipeline as we head into the fiscal year. i would say, i will just comment on q1 bookings. we do feel really good about where we are. historically, we do see some seasonality in q1 and large deals can make things lumpy, but we feel really good about our positioning for the first quarter. and in terms of revenue growth, i'll just say that for quarter one we see consulting continuing a strong double-digits and outsourcing in the double-digit range.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. and for the full year.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
and for the full year, i mean consulting should continue to be strong double-digits and outsourcing depending on where we land in the range will be high single to low double digits.
jason kupferberg -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you.
angie park -- managing director and head of investor relations
thanks. operator, we have time for one more question and then julie will wrap up the call.
operator
of course, and then last question comes from the line of tien-tsin huang with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you so much. really impressive growth at scale here. i wanted to ask on industry x, it was $5 billion in revenues [indecipherable] up 36% down. so i think julie said is the next frontier here. does this have potential to be as big as cloud? i'm just trying to think about the sizing of industry x recognizing it's early but also its importance?
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean i think, we're not really sizing that today. i mean, when think about cloud, cloud is the entire enterprise. so hard to sort of do that. what we'd say is this will be, i mean we're already at $5 billion and we consider the next digital frontier and it's super early, right. some technologies have just really been coming online in the last year or two that are cloud-based and when you look at like what we're doing, for example like vivienne westwood, one of the largest independent global fashion companies, we're doing a new plm solution for them. we're doing so for alstom, a global leader in transportation, where you're doing the same in the power company because like we -- the range of what we're doing is both broad-based in terms of industry and so we do think of this as really a big growth driver for the future, but not sizing it today.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay, no worries, just thought it was interesting because the scope of it can be quite large. just my quick follow-up on -- i know you had -- you fielded a lot of questions on acquisitions already. digital assets are being valued pretty highly here across the board. looks like you're still implying a reasonable revenue multiple with your inorganic contribution. have you seen any changes on the valuation side? i know you're still a destination for many companies, but just curious if valuations have changed in any way in your thinking?
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
kc, do you want to answer that.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
clearly, valuations where we participate in the overall market, you've seen what valuations have done in the overall market. but i would just say that we have pretty high hurdle rates in terms of what we expect from our business cases and we track that very closely as you would expect of us and we're very pleased with our ongoing performance of our portfolio against the hurdle rates that we put forth in this business cases.
tien-tsin huang -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yeah, no, it's impressive. thank you, both.
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
okay. thank you. alright, well, now time to wrap up. in closing, i want to thank all of our people and our managing directors for what you all do every day, our people and actions and results in fy '21, it really put us in a terrific position as we go into fy '22 to create even more value ahead, and i know i and the entire leadership team are super excited and confident about what's to come and i'll simply end by thanking all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support. be well, everyone. thanks.

now let me turn the call over to julie.
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
thank you, angie, and everyone, for joining us. before diving into our results, thank you to our 624,000 incredibly talented people around the world, including over 8,500 managing directors. this past fiscal year, your hard work and dedication to creating value that matters for our clients with unwavering, despite the ongoing and sometimes quite extreme challenges of covid, we've had a truly extraordinary year as reflected in our outstanding financial results and in the 360 degree value we delivered beyond our financials, from the over 120,000 promotions and over 31 million training hours, an increase of 40% for our people, to increasing our workforce by approximately 118,000 people, creating significant employment opportunities in our communities, to achieving 46% women on our way to our goal of gender parity by 2025, to our top 3 ranking in the refinitiv global diversity and inclusion index for the fourth consecutive year, to the number one position with our largest ecosystem partners, to the exciting accomplishment of 50% renewable energy now powering our offices and centers globally, to the donation of $54 million in covid surge relief.
in december, we will publish our first ever annual 360 degree value report to more fully describe the fy'21 value we created in all directions, and will report against three additional key esg frameworks, sasb, tcfd and wef ibc. we believe that the trust we have from our clients and partners, our continuous innovation and our ability to consistently attract the best people, including the 56,000 net new hires this past quarter are directly linked to our commitment to measuring our success by how well we create this 360 degree value for all our stakeholders, clients, people, partners, shareholders and communities, and on our culture of shared success. here are some key financial highlights of the year which position us strongly as we begin fy '22.
fy'21 demonstrated our leadership in helping our clients achieve compressed transformation with 72 clients, with bookings greater than $100 million compared to 53 last year and 229 diamond clients, our largest client relationship compared to 216 last year. with the 20% increase in bookings to $59 billion, we have strong momentum across all dimensions of our business, across geographic markets, industries and services, reaching revenues of $50.5 billion, a significant milestone, representing 11% growth, we added $6.2 billion in revenue this year, gaining significant market share with 40 basis points of operating margin expansion, demonstrating yet again our ability to grow profitably and at scale. we achieved this profitable growth while investing at a higher level than ever before with $4.2 billion in acquisitions, $1.1 billion in r&d and assets platforms and industry solutions, including growing our portfolio of patents and pending patents to more than 8,200, and total training investment of $900 million. and according to brandz, our brand value increased 56% to over $64 billion, ranking us number 27 on the prestigious brandz's top 100 most valuable global brands list.
finally, i want to highlight cloud and our ability to move with agility to serve our clients needs and capture momentum in the market. at the beginning of fy'21 after investing in cloud for a decade, we saw that the pandemic would dramatically accelerate our clients move to the cloud. more than technology, the move to the cloud would be about the adoption of a new operating system for the future enterprise, a dynamic continuum of capabilities from public to edge to everything in between, opening up radically new ways for companies to work, compete and drive value. just over one year ago, we created accenture cloud first to capitalize on this momentum, bringing together all of our capabilities from migration to cloud native development, data ai, industry talent and change. accenture cloud first was the biggest driver of our overall cloud business growth from $12 billion to $18 billion, a 44% increase. kc, over to you.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thank you, julie, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. we were very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which completes an outstanding year for accenture, and reflect broad based momentum across all dimensions of our business. once again, our results reflect our relentless focus to deliver across our three key imperatives for driving superior stakeholder value.
so let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights of the quarter. revenue growth of 21% in local currency at the top end of our guided range reflects double-digit growth across all markets, all industry groups, and all services. we also continue to extend our leadership position at an accelerated pace with growth significantly above the market. operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 30 basis points for the quarter, reflecting a 40 basis points of expansion for the full year.
we delivered this expansion while investing significantly in our business and in our people to position us for long-term market leadership. we delivered very strong eps of $2.20, which represents 29% growth compared to adjusted eps last year. and finally, we delivered free cash flow of $2.2 billion, which was driven by continued strong growth and profitability.
now let me turn to some of the details. new bookings were $15 billion for the quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.1 consulting bookings were $8 billion with a book to bill of 1.1. outsourcing bookings were $7.1 billion with a book to bill of 1.2. we were very pleased with our new bookings, which represents 7% growth in u.s. dollars with 18 clients with bookings over $100 million. we were also pleased with the strength of bookings across all services with a book-to-bill of 1 in strategy and consulting, 1.2 in technology services, and 1.1 in operations.
turning now to revenues. revenues for the quarter were $13.4 billion, a 24% increase in u.s. dollars and 21% in local currency, slightly above our fx adjusted range, as the fx tailwind was 3% compared to the 4% estimated last quarter. consulting revenues for the quarter were $7.3 billion, up 29% in u.s. dollars and 25% in local currency. outsourcing revenues were $6.1 billion, up 19% in u.s. dollars and 16% in local currency. taking a closer look at our service dimensions. strategy and consulting, technology services and operations, all grew very strong double digits.
turning to our geographic markets. in north america, revenue growth was 22% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, software and platforms and public service. in europe, revenues grew 18% in local currency, led by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, industrial, and banking and capital markets.
looking closer at the countries, europe was driven by double-digit growth in the u.k., germany, france and italy. in growth markets, we delivered 21% revenue growth in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in consumer goods, retail and travel services, banking and capital markets and high-tech. from a country perspective, growth markets was led by double-digit growth in japan, australia and brazil.
moving down the income statement. gross margin for the quarter was 33.3% compared with 31.8% for the same period last year. sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.3% compared with 10.6% for the fourth quarter last year. general and administrative expense was 7.4% compared to 6.8% for the same quarter last year. operating income was $2 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.6% operating margin, up 30 basis points compared with q4 last year.
as a reminder, in q4 last year, we recorded an investment gain that impacted our tax rate and increased eps by $0.29 for the quarter. the following comparisons exclude this impact and reflect adjusted results. our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 28.4% for the fourth quarter last year. diluted earnings per share were $2.20 compared with adjusted eps of $1.70 in the fourth quarter last year.
days service outstanding were 38 days compared to 36 days last quarter and 35 days in the fourth quarter of last year. free cash flow for the quarter was $2.2 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $236 million. our cash balance at august 31st was $8.2 billion compared with $8.4 billion at august 31st last year.
with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3 million shares for $915 million at an average price of $305.61 per share. also in august, we paid our fourth quarterly cash dividend of $0.88 per share for a total of $558 million. and our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.97 per share to be paid on november 15th, a 10% increase over last year and approved $3 billion of additional share repurchase authority.
now i would like to take a moment to summarize our outstanding year. we are extremely pleased with the performance of our business in fiscal year '21, greatly exceeding all aspects of our original outlook that we provided last september. we delivered $59 billion in new bookings, a 20% increase in u.s. dollars over last year, which positions us well as we begin fiscal year '22. revenues increased a record $6.2 billion, hitting the $50 billion mark, reflecting growth of 11% in local currency for the full year. this result which is more than double the revenue growth we anticipated at the beginning of the year showcases our agility and ability to quickly scale to deliver value and outcomes for our clients.
operating margin of 15.1% reflected a 40 basis point expansion over fiscal year '20, above the top end of our original guided range even after making continued significant investments in our business and our people. adjusted earnings per share were $8.80, reflecting 18% growth over adjusted fy '20 eps and was well above our revenue growth. as a reminder, we adjusted earnings in both years to exclude gains on investment. free cash flow of $8.4 billion was significantly above our original guided range, reflecting a free cash flow to 0 of 1.5, driven by strong profitability.
and finally, we significantly exceeded our original guidance for capital allocation by returning $5.9 billion of cash to shareholders, while investing roughly $4.2 billion across 46 acquisitions to acquire critical skills and capabilities in strategic high growth areas of the market. so again, fy '21 was truly an outstanding year. momentum continues into fiscal '22 and we are laser-focused on capturing the market opportunities, coupled with a disciplined execution that you and we expect of us. now let me turn it back to julie.
julie sweet -- chair and chief executive officer
thanks, kc. turning to the demand environment. compressed transformation underpinned by cloud and digital continues to drive strong double-digit growth across our business, including for applied intelligence, cloud, industry x, intelligent operations, interactive, intelligent platform services, security and transformational change management.
technology is the single biggest driver of change in companies today and the depth, breadth and scale of our technology capabilities across our services is unmatched. we see the demand environment shaping up for fy '22 to be more of the same, while digital leaders second seeking to widen their competitive advantage and the companies seeking to leapfrog their cloud and digital transformation are driving momentum in our business. the vast majority of companies are early in their transformation and whether digital leader, leapfrog, laggard or in between, all face multi-year journeys ahead of them because the replatforming in the cloud and use of new technologies across the enterprise is a once in a digital era profound transformation.
simultaneously, we have ongoing exponential technology change that is accelerating and will create new opportunities, disruptions and change for our clients. in addition, growth in parts of our business are by their very nature continuously evolving. for example, interactive, now a $12.5 billion dollar business growing 15%, continues to set a new standard for customer experience, connection, sales and marketing at the intersection of data, creativity and technology, and is tied to the ever changing needs and preferences of b2c and b2b customers. similarly, security, now a $4.4 billion business growing 29% is driven by needs related to an ever expanding digital threat landscape, and with our managed services is providing much needed protection and talent to our clients.
our clients value the depth and breadth of our services for the entire enterprise, across strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations, and industry and functional expertise across 13 industries, plus the ability to deliver tangible outcomes as well as our strong track record of investing ahead of our clients to anticipate their needs, needs drive our next wave of growth, such as our early moves in digital cloud and security, they remain entire parts of the enterprise for which digitization and the move to the cloud has only just begun. in particular, both the things companies make and the way they make things are being dramatically changed by technology and that is the focus of our industry x business, which we believe is the next big digital frontier. in fact, a 2021 gartner survey of board of directors indicates that 93% expect that the number one business priority that will see transformational improvement from digital technology is manufacturing, distribution and supply chain.
we have invested for nearly a decade in industry x and are now at approximately $5 billion in revenue growing 36%. we look forward to welcoming the 4,200 industry leading engineers and consultants of umlaut when the acquisition closes in october. similarly, sustainability is a critical area for which technology is still evolving. we believe that every business must be a sustainable business and yet companies are at very early stages of figuring out how to make this shift. last year, building on years of investment and experience, we launched our sustainability services under our new chief responsibility officer and global sustainability services lead.
we have continued to accelerate our focus in this expanding and changing market and are proud of the work we are doing with leading partners like mastercard, as we enhance its ability to track and analyze the carbon emissions of their suppliers and help decarbonize the u.k. energy system with clients such as national grid.
we do see a shift in the nature of the demand for our managed services across it, security and operation, with these services emerging is one of our most strategic differentiator as companies simultaneously see greater resilience, chase a war for talent, the need to rapidly digitize and cost pressures strategic managed services are increasingly a c-suite priority, with accenture as the trusted partner of choice and increasingly integrated as a part of their talent strategy, table stakes from managed services, our efficiency, resiliency and reliability.
we further differentiate in our managed services because they are uniquely informed by our strong strategy and consulting capabilities and deep industry and functional expertise, and they benefit from our strong level of investment for digital platforms, like synops and mywizard and the seamless integration with our ecosystem partners as well as due to the incredible pool of talented people our clients can access quickly when partnering with us. for example, we are partnering with olympus, a leading manufacturer of optical and digital precision technology to help them drive their transformation to become a global medical technology company. as part of this partnership, we have acquired their japanese it subsidiary company, which we will transform to deliver significant it cost savings to olympus, as well as upskill their people, combining their knowledge with our talent and technology to lead olympus's digital transformation.
now, let me bring to life some more of the demand we are seeing. all of these examples bring together the diverse capabilities across accenture to create tangible value. we are a leader in cloud because we're able to serve our clients across the cloud continuum and create business value. we are partnering with kubota, a japanese multinational company providing solutions, leveraging a diverse range of products, technologies and services in the fields of food, water and the environment to accelerate kubota's digital transformation by creating solutions that will enhance the productivity and safety of food, promote circularity of water resources and waste, and improve urban and living environments, we will help create innovative sustainability solutions and a platform applying leading edge digital technology, including ai and iot. diverse data held across the group will be centralized for easing maintenance and use. we're also modernizing, replacing or migrating legacy applications to the cloud and strengthening their global computer security incident response team.
we are partnering with [indecipherable] a us-based global manufacturing services company to further enhance their it infrastructure capabilities to providing infrastructure managed services for digital workplace, network cloud and data center support. we're helping fennia, a finnish insurer offering casualty, motor and health and accident services to implement a cloud-based policy administration system to improve customer service using data and automation to make sales, claims, payments and policy management processes more user friendly. this will allow the company to quickly respond to changing market and customer demands and meet its goal of providing the best customer experience in the industry.
compressed transformation is occurring across industries. we're partnering with unilever, one of the world's largest consumer goods companies in their digital transformation. together, we are setting a new industry standard by reinventing technology delivery with cutting-edge automation, delivering cloud migration at scale, the largest erp migration to the cloud and the industry and shifting to technology solutions that support their growth strategy. with mccormick, a global leader in flavor in the food industry, where we are partnering on a strategic transformation program, encompassing finance, supply chain, logistics and plant maintenance.
the new cloud-based platform and innovative data driven approach will help standardize processes, increase efficiencies and support their goal of doubling in size quickly. we're helping a european financial institution build the bank of the future and helping them become a next level innovator, one that is leveraging technology and sustainability to transform multiple parts of their business, drive hyper personalized customer experience and create new lines of business like wealth management and insurance, which is expected to triple digital sales by 2023 and improve their already stellar cost to income ratio, at the same time we're helping them deliver on their esg initiatives, including inclusive financing, green software and carbon data free data centers.
at accenture, we're enabling new experiencing growth and cost transformation across the enterprise and across industries, and a key enabler to these innovative scaled service is the power of our operations capabilities. we are helping open fiber, an italian telecommunications company design and orchestrate construction of an ultra broadband network, which will deliver fiber to 20 million households across italy. digitization and automation will help the construction site to proceed faster and more efficiently.
with interactive, we're helping mediamarktsaturn retail group, europe's leading consumer electronics retailer transform their digital content capabilities with a state-of-the-art marketing operation. automation and data insights enabled by synops will help deliver more engaging and personalized content while driving millions in savings.
our industry expertise continues to be a core competitive and managed, allowing us to reap deep industry and cross industry knowledge enterprise wide for our clients. i want to recognize in particular our software and platform industry, which is approximately $4 billion in revenue. in q4, this group celebrated 20 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, serving as a leading partner to our clients in this hyper-growth industry.
kc, back to you.
kc mcclure -- chief financial officer
thanks, julie. now let me turn to our business outlook. for the first quarter of fiscal '22, we expect revenues to be in the range of $13.9 billion to $14.35 billion. this assumes the impact of fx will be about positive 0.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '21 and reflects an estimated 18% to 22% growth in local currency.
for the full fiscal year '22 based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of fx on our results in u.s. dollars will be approximately negative 0.5% compared to fiscal '21. for the full fiscal '22, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 12% to 15% growth in local currency over fiscal '21, which includes an inorganic contribution of about 5% as we continue to expect to invest about $4 billion in acquisitions.
for operating margin, we expect fiscal year '22 to be 15.2% to 15.4%, a 10 basis point to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '21 results. we expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. this compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.1% in fiscal '21. for earnings per share, we expect full year diluted eps for fiscal '22 to be in the range of $9.90 to $10.18, or 13% to 16% growth over adjusted fiscal '21 results. for the full fiscal '22, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $7.5 billion to $8 billion. our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. finally, we expect to return at least $6.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.
with that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. angie?
