thank you. we'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question today is coming from edward kelly from wells fargo. your line is now live.
edward kelly -- analyst -- wells fargo
hi, good morning, guys. vivek, i just wanted to, you know, first just, you know, clarify one thing that you said about quarter-to-date trends. i think you said in line with the exit of q4. so i guess at the end of the day, are you talking about quarter-to-date trends that are above the high end, that 11% number that you talked about for the tier-stack expectation for -- for 2021?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
no, ed. the way to think of it is what we've tried to do, because it's so difficult to think about the lapse and such, we have tried to model the business on dollar sales on a weekly basis. ok? and -- and the assumption we had made going into the year is that the dollar sales on a weekly basis will kind of remain like the way we closed out the year, the last few months of how we closed out last year. and of course, adjusting it seasonally.
and -- and that's what we're seeing. so, bob, would you add anything to that from a stack standpoint?
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah -- yeah, i -- from a stack perspective, there will be some -- some differences by quarter, but we think the right way to try to make sure that we forecast the quarter is as vivek suggested, which is taking a look at the absolute sales dollars and trend those forward. and that's what we've done to begin the year. and we're tracking along that very closely.
edward kelly -- analyst -- wells fargo
ok. and just thoughts around, you know, how you think about the cadence of the ids throughout the year if you're -- if we're back to this like 9.5% to 11% stack? i would assume that we have some deceleration in the back half. how -- how are you thinking about the cadence of that? and then i -- i did have a follow-up on this, you know, the differences geographically because you've said that they've been kind of consistent, maybe just more color there. because i don't think dining out trends are, you know, are -- are -- are consistent, right? there do seem to be differences with, you know, say states that have less restrictions for instance.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, ed, so the way we've thought about the business, you know, the further out you go, the harder it becomes to predict what the top line is going to be, which is why we've said we want to have strong productivity programs yielding in the second half of the year. so if the sales turn out to be better than we have imagined, it would be a strong second half on -- in -- on multiple dimensions. but we've made sure that we have that cushion of productivity in the second half of the year. now, the second -- on your second point in terms of jump -- different geographic, in q4, we certainly didn't see it.
but what -- what happens when you get into q1, you know, you're -- you're seeing some very diff -- big differences in lapse across regions, right? so part of it -- so we're going through a very noisy period right now between what happened last year and what's happening now. so i'm not going to conclude that we are not going to see differences in reopenings this quarter. we want -- the statement we made in the-- in the -- in the discussion was about last quarter.
edward kelly -- analyst -- wells fargo
ok. and then just last one for you. the incremental $500 million in cost saves, can just provide a bit more color around where they came from? and then, you know, i assume some of this maybe gets reinvested in the business. how do we think about, you know, sort of like what's reinvested, what's not in the priorities there?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. so let's start with that philosophy. we really generate productivity. there's always productivity that's going into reinvesting in the business to make us stronger to be ahead on capabilities.
and there's some productivity that's always there for a rainy day, right, to take to the bottom line. that's how we think about it. and we'll always have that mindset in this business. and so now, let's talk about the 500 million.
i would frame it this way, the -- we, you know, we -- one of the great things about our company is that we are incredibly locally nimble, and we've learned a lot through this pandemic and how that is an advantage to us and how we are able to react with speed. what we've also learned through this pandemic what else is extremely important to preserve, ok? and we're going to preserve that. but we also have 13 divisions that -- we have 13 supply chains in the company and 13 buying organizations in the company, they're going to change some aspects of that. and by changing some aspects of that, we get a lot of leverage.
both in the supply chain, in the design of the supply chain, and what -- and making things easier for our supplier partners, and in the discussions on how we buy. so those are completely two new topics that are substantial programs that we've launched and will continue over the next two years.
edward kelly -- analyst -- wells fargo
all right. thank you.
operator
thanks. our next question is coming from ken goldman from j.p. morgan. your line is now live.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
good morning, ken.
ken goldman -- analyst -- j.p. morgan
hi, thank you. hey, good morning, everybody. i wanted to follow up on ed's question but not from this quarter, from last quarter when ed asked. i think about the gross margin and, bob, i think at the time you said it should be relatively flat.
you know, you are quantifying it necessarily, but i just wanted to see if there was any update there? anything you could tell us about your, you know, your gross margin executed for 2021 with the -- with the benefit of a little more -- a little more time.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah. we're -- we're still -- well, first of all, i'll start off a little bit with the comment that vivek just made. because of some of the productivity initiatives that we have, we actually generate tailwinds as we call them to our gross margin. and so because we have that benefit, you know, we -- we do feel confident that kind of overall we're going to end up with gross margin for fiscal '21 to be directional to what we saw here for the full year in 2020.
now, it won't necessarily be exactly the same cadence by quarter because there were some -- some big swings in the first couple of quarters so you needed to kind of seasonalize that to a typical year. but overall, we feel very good about our -- our ability to kind of keep gross margins at the full-year level, and the -- which is a nice step up from where we were running in 2019, of course.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, ken. i mean, if you think about it, i'll give you four initiatives, all of these are substantial, right? so i've always talked to you about this notion of we're going to have gross margin tailwinds that we judiciously invest back so that we can strengthen the business. so four big wins. the first is own brand's penetration coming back, thousand basis points and every one of those items.
the second is we are excited about our shrink initiatives. you know, it's giving -- it's redoubling our confidence that our shrink initiatives are working. and then, we just added two big ones, supply chain and the entirely -- that the entire cost of goods that they're buying the cost -- they're buying those things differently, right? and that those things that are mostly national. those are substantial tools of gross margin tailwinds.
and -- and then there are the mix issues. but even those -- i'd stop with those four and we see -- we see a lot of upsides there.
ken goldman -- analyst -- j.p. morgan
ok. no, that -- that is helpful. thank you. and then, vivek, i wanted to follow up, you gave some examples of some categories that continued to do well after some areas that reopened -- meat, seafood, cereal line, i think.
you also gave some examples, i think you said soup and pasta and maybe pasta sauce that are sort of below recent levels. you know, i want to know if you -- and i don't mean to put you on the spot here but, you know, i can understand the meat in the seafood sign and the wine sign, surely. but what -- what is the distinction between certain sort of center store categories whether it's cereal or pasta or soup? you know, what -- what do you think is driving one to continue to do better versus another that isn't necessarily doing quite as well? is it really -- or is it really just a question of hey, people stock up on things like soup and pasta bottle and you're just lapping it. is that the issue?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
that -- that's it, ken, you've got it. so what you're seeing it's all, hey, no -- nobody shot on paper now, right? so yes, i think we're seeing things that have been loaded in the store. and -- and so that's -- i'm sorry, in the pantry. so you've got that, that's always there.
but you're working more from home and you're eating more breakfast at home and you're eating more lunches at home, which is continuing to drive that fresh consumption. so it's remarkable. we're continuing to see steady fresh consumption and the same kind of frequency of purchases on fresh, and people are feeling comfortable that they've got enough in the pantry and some other products.
ken goldman -- analyst -- j.p. morgan
understood.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
thank you.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer

thank you. your next question today is coming from robbie ohmes from bank of america. your line is now live.
robbie ohmes -- analyst -- bofa securities
oh hey, good morning, everybody. you know, vivek, i was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the 1% to 2% food-at-home inflation assumption that you guys are thinking about for this year. and maybe even to that, a lot of the cpg companies have obviously been talking about pushing through, you know, a fair amount of price increases this year. you know, how does that play out in your -- your thinking and maybe about, you know, you guys mentioned the press release strategic price investments that you made this quarter? how are you thinking about price investments this year? and you know, we're seeing the competitive promotions are coming back within the industry, you can see in the olsen data.
you know, maybe you could just tell us about the scenarios you've been thinking about for how crude inflation could play out this year.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
so, robbie, let me give you some context then i'll have bob add color to it too. so the 1% to 2% is a planning assumption and we like that because we know we can add a 3% to 4% inflation. it's a better thing for our business, right? it's a better it's a -- better outcome in our p&l. so we plan the 1% to 2% and then see how -- and then go from there.
we're seeing a 3% to 4% inflation like you've all seen it. now, i have no idea where the inflation is going to land, we don't. right? but here are a few things to consider. one is that the demand is still ahead of supply in so many categories.
it's still the case. ok? two, we've got a consumer -- i guess i didn't know we should never generalize this, but by and large, the consumer is healthy, they've got the cash, you know. and so you know, to me it's as if it's demand-driven inflation. i -- i think you're going to see consumers still shopping in these categories.
now, when it comes -- if it goes beyond that 3% to 4%, then here's what's going to happen, we are going to be -- we're going to have difficult conversations on how much we can accept because we're not going to pass through all of it. and we're going to have difficult conversations up and down the supply chain if it gets to a place where it's going to exceed that 3% to 4%. the last thing i'll leave you with is yes, a lot of this inflation that you're hearing about from cpg and others it, you know, the nice thing about when it is planned and when it is available and when you have some sense for how it might shape up, it's more manageable. the ones we worry about are the spikes and we're not seeing any of those emerging at this time, robbie, but -- but that's the planning -- that's the planning of a push we've taken to inflation.
bob, anything else you'd add?
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
i think you've covered it well. the 1% to 2% really is just our baseline planning process and any upside from that typically will flow through either to the bottom line or we may choose to utilize that to drive the top line.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
but i think you've covered it well.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
and in pricing, robbie, our pricing investments continue. we do it surgically, we're doing it -- in all the time, every quarter in different markets. and when it comes to promotions, we are not seeing a significant step up anywhere in the market. we think it's quite rational and we're all going more digital.
so it's not going to be it's -- it's not going to see a big step up in the wednesday flyer from four pages to 10 pages.
robbie ohmes -- analyst -- bofa securities
that's really helpful. and just a quick follow-up on dug profitability. it sounds like you're feeling better about it, you know, going forward. is that more about, you know, efficiencies you figured out on executing that that's made it a lot more profitable at the store level or you see something on the mfc is working that makes you feel like you may be figured something out there.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
look, so what happens with -- with dug is as you see the orders are still going up. you can literally see the labor cost curve, right? it comes down pretty rapidly, it's an exponential curve. and so you see that and you -- and you're all -- so when you get to a certain level of orders for a store, your labor costs become better. and we're starting to get to that, right, in -- in many of our stores.
the second thing we have done, we've launched new picking algorithms, and the other thing when you get a lot more scale, you're picking becomes more efficient, right? that's why your cost comes. i mean, we've got new picking software in place and the third thing we're seeing is that as things get better in stock, right, and we are having you're not having to go out of the mfc to go pick in the store, you're seeing better efficiencies in the mfc itself. so we're -- we're adding all these up, robbie, and starting to feel really good that dug can be a profitable engine within the e-commerce offerings that we have.
robbie ohmes -- analyst -- bofa securities
that sounds great. thanks so much.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, robbie.
operator
thanks. our next question today is coming from simeon gutman from morgan stanley. your line is now live.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
hi, simeon.
michael kessler -- analyst -- morgan stanley
hi, guys. this is  oh, hey, this is actually michael kessler on -- on for simeon, but thanks for that 
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
ok.
michael kessler -- analyst -- morgan stanley
my first question is actually on -- on -- your guidance on kind of promotional strategies and you've talked a lot about being more targeted and surgical with high-level damage. i want to get an update on the progress you guys have made. are there any examples you can point to and, you know, if you can see kind of innings or kind of a roadmap for how that plays out? and also, how does that kind of interplay with the price investments that you guys just spoke to and how that -- how that's trending?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. so think of two different things that we're doing. one is we have -- now all our promotions made on -- on one platform across the company. ok? and it's a platform that our merchants access and because it's all technology and we can see the data, our pricing team can look at the totality of the promotions and get a sense of where people are heading.
so we -- what that does is it allows us to maintain that local nature of being reactive and appropriate in a market yet being able to see the full picture from here because we're now on one technology platform. so that's tremendously helpful. the second thing i mentioned to you is that we now have 25.4 million people on just for u. and so -- and so we've just added another million -- and million -- 1.1 million just last quarter.
and those 25.4 million people get promotions targeted to them. it's -- we can access them, they can access it digitally, we access them digitally. so at the underlying, all of these promotions are a technology capability. right? so on that -- on the second one we've had it for a long time, we just get smarter and smarter about using it.
the first one i mentioned, we rolled it out across -- last -- during the pandemic, we've rolled it out and we are continuing to improve it. on that one, i'd say if that was a baseball game we're probably not -- not turning there, right? we have a lot more to go in terms of optimizing it.
michael kessler -- analyst -- morgan stanley
great. that's very helpful. thank you. and a follow-up actually on -- on robbie's question on the drive up and the profitability there and the comments, i think bob you made there or one of the guys made on mid to high single-digits flow-through on that.
i guess number one, is that on ebit basis and i'd love to hear maybe some of the assumptions that you just kind of use and what, you know, as far as income mentality how that's -- how that's factored into that number. and i guess also, does that kind of imply that given the incremental cost of delivery versus drive up that delivery is more likely to be flattish or even loss-making? i guess, how you guys are thinking about looking to improve that or is that something where, you know, it's kind of the reality of the business as it stands right now and, you know, you will you have to accept it for the sales?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. let me provide a little bit of context and i'll have bob talked to you specifically about the flow-through in the -- in the ebit piece. you're right, the delivery business is not profitable. the -- the -- the dug business is.
because it's harder to recover the delivery costs. as you know though, we just have shifted a lot more of that where we are using third parties and so we are on a path to improve that side of the business. but that would be the harder one to get right on profitability over time. now, here's the other thing, yes, we're excited about the income mentality and we can see income mentality because we know the customer.
we know that she bought spent $100 with us typically and now she's spending 125 bucks with us. and so -- and that 25 bucks is coming from e-commerce. and so we're able to track that incrementality. but -- but we -- we are fully cognizant that you don't build a big business all purely around incrementality because at some point that business, too, has to become on a unit basis profitable.
but we've got some time, right? we've got other things in our p&l that -- that are driving productivity that can allow us to make these investments, and that's how we're working it. and i talk to you about some of those improvement initiatives in e-commerce. bob, can you clarify the flow-through coming?
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah, definitely. so when we look at dug, as you know, we had -- that was our fastest-growing segment of our e-commerce this past year. and because of that, we're getting tremendous scale benefits which are now coming through in our -- in our latter quarters where we are seeing on an incremental basis, the mid to high single-digit ebitda is -- is what we're looking at there, which is effectively the same ebit, i think, in the business because there's not much amortization. but anyway, so we just look forward to as we continue to -- to see the -- that business scale even higher as well as factor in the savings from mfcs in the future that that mid to single -- mid to high single-digit rate will continue to improve.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. and the only thing i'd add on deliveries, we have prioritized speed. we believe time is money, that people are going to expect shorter and shorter delivery windows, and we have absolutely prioritized that. and that fits with what we're doing with stores and mfcs and we will -- we'll -- we'll keep stay on that path for a long time.
michael kessler -- analyst -- morgan stanley
thank you.
operator
thank you. next question today is coming from karen short from barclays. your line is now live.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
hi, karen.
karen short -- analyst -- barclays investment bank
hey there. i just wanted to go back to this weekly sales commentary as it relates to 1q. so, if i take what the weekly sales looked like they were doing in 4q, i'm not doing average weekly sales per store but just weekly sales, and i bring that forward to 1q, i'm backing into kind of a negative 9.5% comp in 1q. can you maybe just let me know if that's, you know, directionally accurate because i -- i think the way you've described it was just a little nuanced.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. go ahead. go ahead.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll start off and vivek, you can fill in any blanks that you think i missed. first of all, what you need to do is take a -- we took the fourth-quarter average weekly sale run rate, but then we had to adjust it seasonally for the first quarter. because as you -- as you know, we have stronger holidays in the fourth quarter.
karen short -- analyst -- barclays investment bank
right.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
we need to kind of normalize there if you will. so, that would be maybe the -- the one adjustment that i would say relative to what i think i heard you say.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. and, you know, i would -- i'd rather not comment on comps at this time, karen, but we want to give you some sense for the momentum in the business by giving you that -- those -- at least that additional information for q -- for this q1.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah. and the other thing that we feel really positive about is it -- it's not only the continued momentum there, but we're also seeing the continued momentum of market share gains.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yes.
karen short -- analyst -- barclays investment bank
right. no, no, that's helpful. i just wanted to make sure it was a very nuanced comment.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah.
karen short -- analyst -- barclays investment bank
and then i -- i wanted to just clarify. so, when we look at ebitda, by my math i think the -- the right number total covid costs embedded in the 2020 ebitda number was $875 million. so, can you just confirm that? because i guess what i'm trying to look at is when i look at the midpoint of your guidance, call it $3.55 billion for 2021, i'm kind of trying to think intellectually about how that should compare to the $4.524 billion that you reported. because presumably, that $875 million goes away in 2021 at -- or -- and or doesn't increase.
so, like net -- it's a net flat number, right?
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah, i think you're directionally correct there. remember that the first quarter had the biggest chunk of it, right? and we had announced that we had roughly $600 million in the first quarter. i think we added back a small portion of that but -- but that was direct -- directionally the number there. and then we had an additional just over $100 million per quarter after that.
karen short -- analyst -- barclays investment bank
ok. and then sorry, two housekeeping questions. i don't know if -- you did give us fuel in terms of the impact in 1q, is there any way you could give us fuel for the year in terms of what you thought was outsized in dollars? and then the second question i had is just on the -- this hero pay initiative in california. broadly, how -- how do you factor that into your guidance?
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'll -- i'll first take the -- the fuel. our intention was not to -- to provide quarterly guidance for -- for fuel or any other lines other than we wanted to call out that fuel was going to be a headwind in the first quarter. i would say for the year, it's directionally that amount of -- of headwind for the full year. so, the impact is really a -- a first-quarter primary event.
there's certainly smaller impacts by quarter but i prefer not to -- to try to -- try to list what those are but kind of net out.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. and -- and the hazard pay that we're seeing in certain pockets in -- of the country, karen, look, those are -- those are, you know, we are -- we -- we think that those will abate as vaccination -- people get vaccinated. and -- and i wouldn't want to say it's not material but -- we'll -- we -- it is part of our planning and we are going to absorb it.
karen short -- analyst -- barclays investment bank
great. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. next question is coming from beth reed from rbc capital markets. your line is now live.
beth reed -- analyst -- rbc capital markets
hi, good morning, guys.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
hey, beth.
beth reed -- analyst -- rbc capital markets
so, couple of quick ones on your id sales guide. what are the embedded expectations for share gains in that? and then just wondering if you could comment on any potential impact from stimulus on quarter-to-date trends.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah. as far as your first question on market share gains, i mean, we would hope that we'll continue to see the trend we're seeing now. that's a -- that's kind of a hard one to predict.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
as we move forward, though.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. it's, you know, the one thing with share gains is we've -- we had such a tremendous year in 2020. and so, if you look at it on a one-year stack, it just becomes difficult. it -- so, it'll be likely that we would, you know, share will look negative.
but our -- what we have looked at is on a two-year basis, and on a two-year basis that substantial share gains and we're seeing that happening even through the first part of this quarter. so, -- and then on -- on -- on the stimulus, what's interesting is that when we look at different segments of our shoppers, let me stay with income for now. we are -- we continue to see -- we haven't seen a dramatic shift in consumption patterns for -- for lower-income households. if the stimulus mattered to them, we were doing better with them pre-stimulus, and we continue to do well with them.
beth reed -- analyst -- rbc capital markets
ok, got it.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
also have seen a substantial change from the stimulus itself, at least for us.
beth reed -- analyst -- rbc capital markets
ok. thank you, that's helpful. and then just going back to the gross margin for a second. can you talk a bit about some of the mix improvements that you've been seeing there and how you see those playing out over the course of the year?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. mix improvement is a very deliberate approach we take, right? and that's been historical that the albertsons company is as simple as something that, you know, sell a cut watermelon or cut asparagus instead of whole watermelon. and so, those initiatives continue -- we continue to find new ways of doing those types of things. the meals initiatives that we are rolling out are again gross margin enhancers.
and -- and so, the -- and the price -- the owned brands are gross margin enhancers. when you do well in fresh and we continue to do well in fresh, that's a gross margin enhancer, notwithstanding all of the other things that i talked about that are productivity -- productivity-oriented, right? so, do we -- again, i'll come back to -- to both your questions and others on gross margin. we believe that we have plenty of tailwind.
beth reed -- analyst -- rbc capital markets
got it. thank you.

thank you. next question is coming from scott mushkin from r5 capital. your line is now live.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
hello, scott.
scott mushkin -- analyst -- r5 capital
thanks. hi, good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to talk a little bit about the store environment as you grow pickup and delivery.
how do you keep the store environment, you know, good for people that actually want to come into the store? and then, you know, you're -- you're probably rotating labor from customer-facing activities to picking activities in a moment to see how you guys are attacking that -- that issue as well.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
scott, we're not doing the latter, right? we're not saying, hey, we're going to sacrifice service in one com -- part of the store to support another part of the store. so, when it comes to the frontend, we have, you know, it's a completely different system that allocates -- that allocates what labor needs to go to a frontend of a store. it's based on historical and predicted demand and we do that. and we hold people to that standard on that front.
we're adding labor to the store for e-commerce, which is where -- which is why -- and you have to add that labor in kind of like block increments. you don't say it's half person and -- you have to add a block to get it going, which is why as orders go up in the store, you see this thing -- you see the -- the improvement in profitability. now, the other thing i'll tell you, scott, is, you know, we're -- we are a -- we are a higher index on fresh. the way you win in fresh is you don't just stock it up in the morning and -- and then revisit it at the end of the day or the next morning, you're in the store working fresh all the time.
and so, part of that is a mod -- is a labor model that allows us to be great at fresh, right? and by the way, that same philosophy exists in much of the store. so, in our stores, you'll see people working the store through the day, so that the store remain fresh and staunch, even while people are picking the store. and so, that's the philosophy we've taken. we've not had run into that issue yet where a store is depleted or overcrowded for e-commerce.
scott mushkin -- analyst -- r5 capital
ok. thanks. and then as a follow-up to -- to the -- the -- this question, the wall street journal had an article talking about the competition for labor. and given that -- that you guys are growing these businesses where you're going to be adding labor, how should we look at kind of labor costs as -- as the year progresses? is this something you guys worry about? and how -- what are you doing to control that -- that line item?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yes, scott. a lot of our, you know, a lot of our labor is -- is unionized and we have contracts with -- with our unions. they come up every so often for renew -- renewal and they typically negotiate it for three years or five years. and so, a lot of our wages are in -- in that sense, predictable.
and so, we really focus a lot more on hours. so, you -- you add hours in some places, you drive productivity in other places to take the hours back out. and then we have all of these initiatives, right, like you've -- we've talked about in the past far, which is an ordering program, production scheduling programs, etc., that drive -- and -- and automation that we're doing that continue to drive productivity in labor hours. and that's how we manage that equation.
scott mushkin -- analyst -- r5 capital
thanks, guys.

hey, vivek. i know you guys had 4.5 million roughly loyalty customers this year, and i know omnichannel was up 3 times. how many -- how many, you know, actual omni-channel households could you add, you know, relative to that? i'm curious how many are coming from this -- this omnichannel. and then, you know, how big is the omni-channel customer base today as part of that $25.4 million?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, john, let me put it this way. you know, we are -- our -- our mix of e-commerce has improved dramatically, but we're still behind some others, right? and that's why we are going to continue to invest in this business because we know that it's resonating. we -- we haven't passed out those numbers that you're -- that you just asked me about. but we -- we are excited about the growth rate, we know who they are, and we're going to continue to do -- to invest in it, so the -- the e-commerce business becomes a bigger mix.
we've got -- we -- we are -- we've got a -- a few points of catch up to do on that.
john heinbockel
and i -- i think you said the 11 million, that was total customers 
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
identifiable 
john heinbockel
you only have 
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
john. yeah, identifiable. so, that's pretty good, right, because we know some -- because they are identifiable, we know what they're buying. we know -- we know what they're buying, whether they're going to engage in e-commerce.
we -- so, that's the part that we're excited about, it's 11 million identifiable customers.
john heinbockel
that -- that you added and the 4.5 million were loyalty, right? so, you still 
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
that's right.
john heinbockel
in theory, i guess, of that 5 million -- 6.5 million that are not -- that are identifiable but not loyalty, what's your 
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
that's right.
john heinbockel
how do you go about them to be loyal customers and how optimistic are you that you can do that?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
and, yeah, that's the -- so, our -- our loyalty team is now expanding the way they're thinking about it, john. it used to be that our loyalty program was primarily -- had a financial incentive. it was rewards on fuel oil pricing. and now, we're starting to open up other things that you'll see us launching in the market so that we can get more of those other 6 million customers engaged in the loyalty program.
not -- prices isn't -- price isn't the answer for everybody. some people care about convenience, some people care about experiences, and that's what we're going toward.
john heinbockel
ok. thank you.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, john.
operator
thank you. our next question is coming from rupesh parikh from oppenheimer. your line is now live.
rupesh parikh -- analyst -- oppenheimer & co. inc.
good morning. thanks for taking my question. so, going -- going back to your capex guidance for this year, you guys deferred increase in capex at $1.9 billion or $2 billion. as we look forward, should we think about this as a right -- the new base level to think about, you know, in future years as well?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
no. don't. don't think of it as -- as the new base level, you know, we would -- remember, recall, we were at about -- at $1.5 billion in the past. and, you know, we would keep it to that ratio of percentage of sales about -- about -- about say 2.5% of sales what you should expect in the long-run algorithm for us.
you know, we are just being opportunistic here. when we have the cash, we're pulling forward initiatives that are -- we know are clear roi winners, right, so we've done that. and then we're -- in that $1.9 billion, you'll see a substantial investment in -- in our digital agenda. building digital capabilities around the company, so we can monetize all those things i just told john about, those 11 million additional customers.
rupesh parikh -- analyst -- oppenheimer & co. inc.
great. and then may -- maybe just one follow-up question on free cash flow. i know -- i -- i think this year, there's going to be some specific items that may weigh in your cash flow such as that payroll tax deferral. so, bob, just curious if you can just share any other discrete items we should be thinking about on the -- on the free cash flow side for this year.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
you're -- you're -- you're correct on the free cash flow side, or i'm -- i'm sorry, on the cares act. that was about $200 million -- just over $200 million that we'll have to pay back in the fourth quarter of this year. outside of that, there's -- there's really nothing out of the ordinary.
rupesh parikh -- analyst -- oppenheimer & co. inc.
ok. great. thank you.

vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, melissa. good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for joining us today. i want to start today by thanking our associates for their unwavering commitment to take care of our customers, our communities, and each other during every twist and turn of the pandemic over the last year. 2020 was a difficult year for all of us, and our hearts go out to all those directly impacted by the virus.
2020 was also a transformational year for albertsons companies. we deepened our relationships with customers and added many new ones through our execution in stores and through online channels. we accelerated digital transformation across our company. almost every critical capability in our company is now enhanced with or enabled by technology.
we delivered our planned productivity target, and we added to it. we further strengthened our culture, learning how to sustain the flexibility and speed that comes with being locally great, while at the same time leveraging the scale benefit that comes to being nationally strong. as i've mentioned throughout the year, our strategy is focused on building deep relationships with our customers. we support this strategy with our differentiated product offerings, anchored in fresh and own brands, our breadth of assortment so they can complete their shop with us, everyday execution excellence in every store, and the suite of omnichannel capabilities that allow customers to conduct their shopping with us in any way they want.
our enhanced loyalty program is also resonating with customers as we provide them with personalized offerings and drive repeat shopping occasions. as a result of our team's execution, we delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter and record results for the year. our full-year results exceeded our outlook across all key metrics, with id sales up 16.9%, adjusted ebitda, up over 60% to $4.5 billion, and adjusted eps growing 212% to $3.24. and q4, id sales were 11.8%, with continued market share gains in both dollars and units.
importantly, growth in q4 remained strong across our geographies regardless of the level of covid restrictions in place, giving us confidence in the sustainability of our competitiveness in the future. our digital initiatives were a key catalyst for growth. in q4, digital sales growth accelerated to 282%, with growth of 258% for the full year. membership in our just for u loyalty program continued to accelerate sequentially and has been up over 20% year over year each quarter and is now at 25.4 million members with a 93.1% retention rate.
these members have been a key driver of share gains as they spend 2.6 times more than non-registered customers. we've also increased the number of actively engaged customers almost 10%, who spent nearly five times more than a nonactive customer. we know our retention rate is 34% greater when a household is actively engaged in our loyalty program. we closed 2020 with almost 11 million more identified households shopping our stores than in 2019, allowing us to understand which categories they are purchasing with us for the first time, how often they're coming back to repurchase, how they're progressing up the loyalty ladder and their incremental spend levels as they migrate from in-store to omnichannel engagement with us.
we ended fiscal 2020 with three times the number of omnichannel households compared to fiscal 2019, fiscal year-end 2019. these households spend more with us and are more profitable. we also saw that as customers moved into omnichannel, they also increased their spend in our stores with a net growth of 20% per household and a total spend rate two times that of an exclusively in-store shopper. we also -- we saw even our most loyal households early last year purchased two times the number of categories in our stores than the prior year, for example, in paper goods.
and we're able to quickly reward these new category buyers with personalized deals to retain that category spend in our stores. at the start of the fiscal 2020, i shared with you four strategic priorities that we are focused on in-store excellence, accelerating our digital and omnichannel capabilities, driving productivity, and strengthening our talent and culture. regarding in-store excellence, our ability to create a one-stop shopping experience for our customers has remained a key differentiator for us, supported by the quality, variety, and depth of our fresh and own brands offerings that give us a competitive advantage. in fresh, we continued to see id sales outpace center store by 300 basis points.
standouts during the quarter was seafood, meat, floral, as customers continue to spend more time at home. this trend continues as we see customers supplementing their weekly stock-up shop, filling in with fresh items in smaller chips during the week. our own brands portfolio also continues to gain traction driven by the introduction of new innovative products, as well as our focus on albertsons legacy divisions that were historically underpenetrated. much of the disruption of the supply chain at the start of the year has abated, and penetration continued to improve in q4 and is now exceeding 25%.
we continue to expect own brands penetration to reach 30% in the next few years. with gross margins approximately 1,000 basis points higher than national brands, this should increase our flexibility to grow the business going forward. we are continuing to innovate and expand our portfolio of brands, moving quickly to meet evolving consumer preferences. as a result, we launched over 1,200 items in fiscal 2020, well above our stated goal of 800-plus new items for the full year.
we're also working on some exciting changes to our meals program that will give us significant growth opportunities. we're expanding the rollout of our ready meals program in our united division to other divisions, where we make ready-to-eat, ready-to-heat, and ready-to-cook meals in our stores. finally, we continue to invest in our stores. we opened nine new stores and completed 409 upgrades and remodel projects during fiscal 2020.
moving on to our second priority, the acceleration of our digital and omnichannel capabilities. digital continues to be a key growth driver for us as we achieved over 200% digital sales growth in each quarter this year, demonstrating the strength of our digital offerings to capture consumer demand for more convenient shopping experiences. drive up & grew go -- drive up & go grew over 1,000% in q4 and 865% during fiscal year 2020. we launched 343 new dug locations in q4, and dug is now available in 1,420 stores.
this puts us ahead of schedule, and we now expect to have dug in approximately 2,000 stores with 98% coverage by the end of fiscal year '21, above our prior target of over 1,800 stores. we're also extremely pleased about the profit curve in our digital business, particularly in drive up & go. we are seeing our incremental dug sales driving flow-through of mid- to high single digits. and we expect that to continue improving as our dug business continues to scale.
in 2020, we saw significant acceleration in consumer preferences toward digital, and we drove a step change in our digital offerings to meet this demand. during the year, we invested over $300 million to accelerate our offerings and launch new capabilities. to enhance the customer experience, we've improved our on-time filling and delivery to 95%, enabling consistent on-time delivery and dug pickups. we leverage our loyalty program to provide exclusive events like virtual cook-alongs with celebrity chefs.
we began a trial of an automated electric delivery robot powered by tortoise and continue to pilot a number of walk-up and go options, including walk-up counters, pickup lockers, and stand-alone kiosks. and we're testing in market an integrated loyalty and e-commerce app, offering an effortless ordering experience to a single interface. and to improve the profitability of the business, we shifted delivery at many of our locations' third-party logistics providers to improve speed and lower costs. we improved our picking software, optimizing, and standardizing the picking process to drive cost reduction through increased picks per hour and improved order prioritization.
from our two mfc installations, as in-stock commissions have improved, we have learned that the labor cost per order can be dramatically reduced without compromising the breadth of assortment and the customization a customer can get from our store. we're opening our third mfc this week and have plans for an additional six before the end of our fiscal year, bringing our total to nine mfcs. our third strategic priority is driving productivity to support reinvestment in the business and help offset inflation. we achieved approximately $500 million in gross productivity savings in fiscal 2020 as a result of our actions with large contributions from indirect spend, labor productivity, and shrink reduction.
given our progress to date and incremental opportunities we see ahead, we now expect to exceed our goal of $1 billion in gross savings by the end of fiscal year '22 and have increased our cumulative target to $1.5 billion. the additional $500 million in savings is principally driven by new projects related to the transformation of our supply chain and the additional cost reduction programs and further optimization of our promotional spend. our fourth priority is strengthening our talent and culture and supporting the communities we serve. we are committed to adding talent in key areas and recently announced that we have hired a new chief data officer to lead efforts in translating data into an enhanced customer experience.
in addition, i would like to call out the contributions of our pharmacy teams to our communities. partnering with the department of health and human services and with local authorities, they have administered 3.1 million covid vaccine doses as of friday last week. we are very proud of how nimble our pharmacy teams have been to support this effort, delivering the service in our stores and in several offsite locations, enabling easy scheduling through our app, executing with high throughput, and emphasizing equitable distribution and dispensing of vaccines. we are now providing access to vaccines in 100% of our locations.
in total, we have hired 1,000 new associates and trained 2,000 pharmacy technicians to support this effort, and invested in technology solutions, including handheld devices, to make it easier for our associates to facilitate these transactions outside our stores. during fiscal 2020, we also supported our communities with food and charitable donations totaling $260 million. for example, through our albertsons foundation nourishing neighbors program, we gave $95 million to support -- support to the communities in which we operate and reached 13 million individuals and over 3,000 organizations. and we assisted our neighbors in texas following the unprecedented winter storm there, matching the first $250,000 raised in our stores.
these actions are all part of our ongoing focus on esg. we recently completed a new materiality assessment, which will be the foundation for our esg strategy and initiatives going forward as our efforts here continue to evolve. we've already identified high-priority areas. and you can expect to hear more from us on topics such as diversity, equity and inclusion, energy and emissions, product and consumer packaging, food waste, and community stewardship.
and last week, we announced our commitment to setting a science-based target to reduce carbon emissions. and now i would like to ask bob to cover the details of our fourth-quarter financial results.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
thanks, vivek, and hello, everyone. i'm pleased to provide details on our strong fourth quarter and record fiscal 2020 results. for the quarter, total sales were $15.8 billion, driven by our 11.8% increase in identical sales. our gross profit margin increased to 28.9% during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 28.6% in q4 2019.
excluding the impact of fuel, our gross profit margin increased 10 basis points, primarily driven by improvements in shrink expense and sales leverage, partially offset by investments related to our growth in digital and strategic investments in price. we continued to see significant sales leverage on expenses in the fourth quarter. excluding fuel and one-time pension charges, our selling and administrative expenses decreased 80 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year. incremental covid costs during q4 totaled approximately $110 million.
interest expense declined $28 million to $113 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $141 million during the same quarter last year, primarily driven by lower average interest rates as a result of our refinancing transactions and lower outstanding borrowings. adjusted ebitda was $917 million, compared to $756 million, or $702 million excluding the extra week during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. the 30% growth in adjusted ebitda represents a strong flow-through of approximately 15%. adjusted net income was $347 million, or $0.60 per fully diluted share, compared to $194 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, during the fourth quarter last year.
turning to the full year. we delivered strong results that were above the outlook we provided last quarter. identical sales finished the year at 16.9%, above our expectation of approximately 16.5%. adjusted ebitda finished the year at $4.5 billion, driven by strong sales leverage, both in gross margin and in selling and administrative expenses that translated to strong flow-through.
adjusted eps finished the year at $3.24, which was $0.09 per share above the top end of the range of our outlook we provided during the third-quarter call. our strong sales results -- and our strong results have generated a very robust operating free cash flow of $2.3 billion in fiscal 2020. our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and include reinvestment to drive profitable growth, continued deleveraging, and returns to shareholders through our $0.40 per share annual dividend, and opportunistic share repurchases. capital expenditures were approximately $1.63 billion during the year, and we completed 409 remodels.
we also accelerated technology-related investments, including those in digital. as we've outlined, these high-return projects included both in-store and productivity initiatives in manufacturing and supply chain and in merchandising to expand our meals program, as well as in digital, including incremental dug rollouts and other technology initiatives intended to drive efficiencies and future productivity. but at the same time, we've generated asset sale proceeds of approximately $161 million as we continue to actively manage and selectively monetize our real estate portfolio. we made significant progress in delivering the balance sheet and reduced our debt during the year by $400 million and refinanced debt at very attractive rates.
these actions will save the company approximately $77 million of interest expense on an annualized basis. given these actions and the strength of our cash flows, our net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio is now 1.5 times on an ltm basis. finally, we completed stock repurchases of $119 million under the company's $300 million authorization in fiscal-year 2020. turning to the outlook we provided this morning on fiscal-year 2021, i'd like to provide some details and color.
as you know, because of the way 2020 played out with some of the pantry loading we saw early in fiscal 2020, we think it's appropriate to provide guidance through a two-year lens against 2019 to show the step-change improvement in our business. we expect identical sales on a two-year stacked basis to be in the range of approximately nine hun -- 9.5% to 11%. we expect adjusted eps in the range of $1.95 to $2.05 per share, which represents over 37% compound annual growth compared to 2019. we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion, representing compound annual growth of 13% of the midpoint of our range compared to 2019.
we also expect to spend $1.9 billion to $2 billion in capital expenditures, which includes incremental capital for high roi projects that include in-store remodels that will have near-term paybacks, as well as our continued acceleration of digital and technology investments. the implied growth in sales and related flow-through to ebitda on a two-year basis on this guidance continues to be industry-leading even as we continue to make investments designed to drive long-term sustainable growth. as you think about the year, we want to point out a couple of items that will impact the cadence of the annual guidance within fiscal 2021. as you know, fuel margins spiked significantly during the onset of covid-19, and as such, we expect fuel to be a headwind during the first quarter of approximately $50 million.
in addition, the incremental productivity savings that vivek mentioned will be ramping up and more heavily weighted to the second half of fiscal '21, enhancing our confidence in achieving our ebitda and eps goals. before i turn it back to vivek, i want to spend a brief moment to discuss the impact of the american rescue plan act on our multi-employer pension plans in which $86 billion were earmarked for underfunded multi-employer pension plans. the net effect of this legislation safeguards and protects benefits of the retirees and these plans for at least the next 30 years. in terms of the impact to albertsons companies, the multi-employer plans that are classified as critical or critical and declining are likely to be eligible for some level of relief under the special financial assistance through arpa.
though the amount of financial assistance received will vary by plan, we currently estimate that these plans represent over 90% of our estimated share of the $4.7 billion total underfunding of all the multi-employer plans to which we contribute. pending details on how the program will work, we expect the financial assistance program will provide the necessary funding for the multi-employer plans to which we contribute to remain solvent through at least 2051. it also ensures the help of the pbgc, which is the guarantor of participant benefits for these multi-employer plans. we did not anticipate that our cash contributions to these plans will change in the near term as we continue to fund what we always have based upon collective bargaining agreements.
and as we have consistently indicated, the legislation confirms that the underfunded liability related to these plans is not an obligation of the company. and now, vivek will provide some closing remarks.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, bob. before we turn to q&a, i want to share a few closing remarks. fiscal 2020 was a transformational year for albertsons companies, and we believe the changes we have made to our business have enhanced our ability to retain our customers, continue to drive share growth, and grow from a higher baseline relative to our pre-pandemic trajectory. we have learned a lot from the pandemic, both in terms of customer behavior and how to operate the business more efficiently.
we are emerging from this crisis more digitally focused, both in-store and online, and elevating the service our customers expect, while at the same time being more productive. and in doing so, delivering more profitable growth. we further strengthened our financial position. we've generated strong free cash flow, allowing us to accelerate investments in initiatives that will support future growth, reduce debt, pay our dividend, and repurchase shares.
and through debt reduction and refinancings, we have truly transformed the balance sheet and we are approaching the future from a much stronger position. and we are continuing to develop and execute our esg agenda, enhancing the sustainability of our operations, supporting the communities in which we operate, and investing in people with an unwavering commitment to diversity and inclusion across the organization. as i reflect on some recent topics of interest in our industry, i would like to share some insights on the first seven weeks of fiscal year '21. i realized this is unusual, but we live in unusual times and -- and you will ask us these questions anyway, so here goes.
our sales momentum continues with growth in market share in food and a two -- on a two-year basis in mulo. when looking at our average weekly sales dollars, sales are trending at approximately the same levels that we exited -- exited the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis taking account -- taking into account holidays in spite of significant business reopenings across the country. we are seeing continued strength in sales of items that have been elevated throughout the pandemic such as meat, seafood, produce, eggs, breakfast cereal, and high-end wines that provide evidence that some important food and beverage categories that shifted from food away from home are still being consumed at home. but we've also seen as we expected some categories falling below pandemic levels such as soup, pasta, and pasta sauce.
while food-at-home inflation is still at recent high levels and could be sustained at these levels for some time, we have planned our business assuming inflation of 1% to 2% this fiscal year. and we expect a rational competitive environment to prevail, driven by relatively tight supply, sophistication and promotion management, and more digital promotions. with all this as a backdrop, we are confident in our ability to continue to produce strong results. i want to reiterate my thanks to our entire team of approximately 300,000 associates.
i'm so proud of what they have done to serve our customers and communities over the last 13 months. and we'll now take your questions.

operator
thank you. we'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question is from john heinbockel from guggenheim partners. please go ahead.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
vivek, i'm going to do two quick ones here. one, now that you've got another, i don't know, 20 weeks under your belt this year, what's your thought regarding the secular algo, right? and how that may have changed because of covid? and then secondly, with all the capital, right, the cash and free cash flow you've got, what would you like to invest in strategically? and i'm not talking about dividend or stuff like that, but more either organic or m&a that you think would be additive to the business. is there anything like that out there? [technical difficulty]
operator
pardon me. we seem to be having technical issues with the speakers' line. i believe that they are speaking now, but we're not hearing them. i'm going to pause for a moment and try to reconnect their line.
one moment, please. ok. we have the speakers again. please proceed.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
hey, john and everybody. sorry about these glitches. sorry about that, guys. john, let me answer your question first.
on a secular trend basis, i'll point to a few things. one, a very healthy consumer, ok? we are still seeing no trade down. they're still buying many discretionary items in our store, traded on up meat, wines, etc. second, it's clear to us that they're eating a lot more at home.
our fresh sales are higher than the rest of the store, so that continues. i think partly driven by the fact that people are still working from home, and i've always maintained a point of view that that will continue into the future, and also partly that people are more comfortable cooking at home. our ecommerce continues to be strong. you know what, if i was to dissect that a little bit, you'll see that our ecommerce transactions are still higher over last year.
but the baskets are smaller, as you would expect, because people bought everything and anything they could last year on ecommerce. but what's very interesting is there's -- people are coming back to the store. the traffic to the store has gone up significantly, and it went up week over week over week through the last quarter, right? so i mean, those are a few things i'll say. and just a lot more digital engagement, which we love, john, because now we can get more data and we can personalize and do the right things for them.
on cash, our priorities will still be the same. it's about growth. and we will first focus on organic growth. we'll continue to invest in our fleet.
i think it's clear to us that stores still matter and we'll continue to do that. and we're going to put a lot of energy into digital growth, and that is both the software side and the hardware side. we're going to roll out more mfcs this year, and we see a lot of promise there, and we'll continue to do that. and we'll be opportunistic on m&as.
and the stronger we are, the better the returns will be on m&a as it's turning out for us and things are about to change.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from paul lejuez of citibank. please go ahead.
paul lejuez -- citi -- analyst
hey, thanks, guys. vivek, toward the end of your prepared remarks, i think you had a couple of comments about inflation. just wondering if you could dig in a little bit deeper in terms of what you're seeing on the cost of goods side of that inflation equation? and how do you see that trending over the balance of the year? and then related to that, how does that change the way you think about pricing on national brands versus what you might do with your private label product pricing? thanks. 
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
do you want to touch on inflation, bob? and i'll do the pricing piece.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
you bet. paul, what we saw in product cost inflation was somewhat modest, 1.5% to 1.7% during the quarter. and so we saw that that was increasing slightly as the quarter continued but still within a reasonable range.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and you know, our outlook on that is that i think it might be slightly higher toward the back half of the year, paul. but i've always maintained that if it continues to be in the 3% to 4% range, it's actually good for the business, especially with a strong consumer like i've indicated. this is something we can pass through, and we get a lot of leverage when it gets into that range.
now, when it comes to pricing on own brands, look, our own brands penetration is up. that's a good sign. it helps us on gross margins. we were all worried, you were all worried whether the own brands going to decline, but it's coming back nicely.
our own brands branch pricing will always be -- you'll have two things. one is pricing to make it an opening price point and pricing on some of our products, which are destination products where we'll be a little more aggressive because we can compete well with the national brands. and we'll just track it with what's happening in the national brands.

our next question is from karen short with barclays. please go ahead.
karen short -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
thanks very much. i just wanted to clarify a couple of things that you said. bob, i think what you had said is that you were comfortable with the ebitda margin for 2q or consensus margin was appropriate for 2q. so i just wanted -- looking at that consensus from what i can tell is a 5% ebitda margin.
so is that the right way to think about the delta between 1q and 2q? there's obviously some deleverage, but the delta on that change sequentially is what the contribution of the vaccines were to mostly to 1q gross margins? i'm just trying to understand the magnitude of the vaccine components on 1q.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
great. yeah, great question, karen. you've got part of it right there. certainly, the vaccine income was a portion, but it's actually a slight -- the larger portion.
if you go back five years kind of throughout 2020 out, you'll find there's a seasonality adjustment, if you will, or a difference from q2 -- in q2, going down 60 to 70 basis points that happens every year. and then that pops back up as you get into q3 and q4. so the bigger piece of that is just normal seasonality, a little bit on pharmacy and other items.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
and we're accelerating dug rollout. we're pulling it further up into q2 because we think we can go faster and should go faster in it. so it's a combination of things there, karen.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
that's right.
karen short -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
ok. thanks. and then i wanted to actually just go -- switching gears to the centralization of the supply chain. i guess i wanted to ask just broadly, how you weigh the risks -- risk and rewards of that effort? because i guess, in kind of the history of centralization, it's always kind of been a short-term benefit, but longer term, it hasn't always worked.
so i'm wondering if you could give a little color on that. and then is the vast majority of that $500 million -- i'm assuming it is all a gross margin benefit to the extent that that centralization is executed the way you hope.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. there are two topics, two different initiatives that help with gross margins. and if you think about the second half of the year, karen, we've always maintained that. more of our productivity is coming in the second half, it's because of these two new initiatives.
the first one is around supply chain, which is optimization of our distribution centers, rethinking how the network of distribution centers, and so on. the second one is by pooling our spend on major categories and buying it as one national company rather than buying these big cpg products as different divisions. now, you're 100% right. and centralization, the notion of pure centralization has been short-lived.
and you always get into the other side where people stop listening to what happens in the field. we've spent -- we've done two things. one, we've pursued the dollars, and we are continuing to pursue the dollars. and think of that as one set of initiatives.
we've spent equal or more time on thinking about how we do it, how we make sure we are able to leverage the local knowledge that people have. we have maintained the core of those teams in our markets so that they can provide local knowledge and insight. and we've added teams at the center so that they can start getting the leverage where we need to, right? and we've worked through every detail there, and we're very conscious of it. that are people on my team who have been through the other side.
and so we know what we don't want to do. and so we're being cautious, but your caution is a good one, karen. but to me, i'd rather do this and work it than be afraid to do it, and that's where we're going down this path.
karen short -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thanks very much.

operator
we'll move on to the next caller. the next caller is edward kelly with wells fargo. please go ahead.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning. i wanted to go back to the gross margin. your performance on a two-year basis, up 90 basis points is obviously strong.
can you provide just a bit more color in terms of like unpacking that and the drivers of that? and then as we think about q2, should we expect a similar trend? i mean, the comparison is similar, you've started off the same way from an id perspective it seems like. and then just bigger picture, if we were to take a step back, how do we think about the sustainability of this gross margin sort of post-pandemic versus pre-pandemic? and how much of this do you think ultimately fades?
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
ok. i'll take the first half of it here. as far as the 90-basis-point improvement relative to '19, it's really made up of several things here. we have had tremendous shrink improvement.
in addition to that, we've also had several productivity initiatives, so that being one of them. but in addition to that, we've had some promotions efficiency improvements that have helped us out, as well as we've talked a little bit already on the call about own brands. our own brands mix has rebounded back up. and as you know, that has a higher gross margin to it.
our fresh mix, that also has been growing as well. and so all of those things kind of work together to support that 90 basis points. now as far as going forward, how we guided in our last conference call, as you might remember, is we said that we felt like that we would be directionally flat to the 2020 fiscal-year overall gross margin, which implies that we'll be up to roughly 65 basis points that we were up in 2020 versus 2019 for the full year. it's not going to necessarily be a flat amount per quarter because last year was kind of a strange year, and there were -- some quarters are higher than others.
so i would kind of -- if you're to pattern it off with anything, i'd pattern it off of adding that to 2019.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
and, ed, to me -- a lot of what bob mentioned were operational things, shrink, etc. what i said earlier about supply chain and cost of goods also continues to support gross margin. we are always, always seeking tailwinds for gross margin, ok? the meals program, when done right in the store is accretive to gross margin. and so we keep seeking that.
but i will tell you that our intent will never be to keep expanding the gross margin as the means to the bottom line, right? because what it gives us is it gives us a chance to surgically keep investing in price and other things that we can do to drive growth for -- and get more volume through the p&l, which is always -- which clearly in our business gives us tremendous flow-through. so that's how we play it. you'll always find us seeking more ideas.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
and just one quick follow-up for you on the $2 billion-plus cash balance that you've got. you've talked about investment, but you've also been a cash flow positive company, right? like you haven't -- you've been more than covering that need. how do we think about the real sort of like optionality around this cash balance, whether it's debt reduction, whether it's you have a sponsor that still owns a lot of stock? if there was something to do opportunistically there, would that interest you? you have bought stock in the past? i'm just kind of curious as to how we really think about this $2 billion and what happens with it.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah. ed, good question, but we really do have our focus on investing it back in the business to drive sales. that's really it. we may do -- we had planned to pay down just a little bit of debt this year.
so we'll use a little bit of that as one of our bonds comes due a little bit later on. we keep our eyes open for m&a opportunities, but that would be our priority.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and we will remain opportunistic, ed. we are good at buying emerging companies. and as those opportunities come, we'll do it.
but primarily now we're focused on driving the organic growth. we think there's a lot more potential in the transformation we're doing right now.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thank you.

and the next question is from scott mushkin with r5 capital. please go ahead.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital llc -- analyst
let's try to do this again. hopefully, you guys can hear me this time.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
i can hear you, scott.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital llc -- analyst
ok. perfect. i think maybe it was my phone. i don't know.
anyway, i wanted to ask a longer-term question around omnichannel, digital. and just really understanding two things. number one, it seems like you guys are trying to pursue a much more asset-light model compared to some of your competitors, and i want to make sure my interpretation is correct there. then the other thing i want to talk about or maybe you could answer is kind of keeping the store environment shoppable.
i mean, i was in a walmart yesterday down in houston. i think there was just fighting in the shelves with the pickers is difficult. so those are kind of two questions, and i have a follow-up.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. let me start with the second question first, right? because our ecommerce business, i would say, i don't characterize it as asset-light, i think it begins with saying our greatest asset is the store. full stop, right? and so we are like ducks paddling pretty hard every day. it's smooth on the top, but we are paddling very hard to run great stores.
and it's simple for us. it's got to be full. it's got to be clean. the fresh has to be really fresh.
we've got to offer the variety and we better have good service. and by the way, better manage the labor properly. and there's a group of us who are maniacal about doing that. when you have that, it gives you a great base to build an ecommerce business.
and our ecommerce business is built on those stores. and the reason i don't say it's asset-light, scott, is that i do believe that there is room for mfcs and mfc growth, ok? the nice thing about the mfcs is it is assets, it's more assets, but it gives you optionality. you can go at a certain pace. you're not making any single bet.
you're making many, many bets. and with every passing year, you're getting more new technology on the bet you're making. so we like that that's the approach that we're taking. on the delivery side of it, yes, we are going -- we were asset-heavy, and we are going asset-light, right? because i don't believe the model of the milk run with the truck is a good idea for grocery.
and so we are using much more of the point-to-point deliveries. so that's how we think about it. but everything rests on running great stores, which is always our no. 1 priority.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital llc -- analyst
that's great. thanks. and then my follow-up is actually a little bit -- i think we're -- maybe ed was going on this question, is that your stock sitting here, with my math, just under five times ebitda in 2022. that's really low, almost kind of -- almost getting to the stress levels.
is there anything from a management perspective that you think you guys can do to try to get more attention to what you're doing to kind of get that valuation up? do you guys even think about it? thanks.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
thank you, scott. there's about $11 billion pre-pandemic real estate value also embedded in this. so we think -- yes, we agree with you. we agree with you.
and hopefully continue to put up quarters like this will make a difference.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital llc -- analyst
all right, guys. thanks very much. nice quarter.

the next question is from ken goldman with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thank you. you mentioned that you were successful in passing along inflation of -- you're still well below that 3% to 4% range you said is still good for the business. a lot of the packaged food companies we cover though, they're facing more inflation than they expected even a couple of months ago.
now some of them are talking about seeking second rounds of pricing with customers. so i'm curious, what is your appetite for letting second rounds through in a general sense? historically, there's been a lot of pushback to that. but right now, elasticity is just not that powerful a driver, so maybe you're thinking about letting more through than usual. i just kind of wanted to get your sense for how you're dealing with some of your vendors coming back asking for more.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ken, good morning. yeah, let me put it this way. first, it's always on a case-by-case basis, ok? and i know that some of our cpg companies are facing challenges in labor, challenges in transportation, etc.
we have our large own brands business. and because of that, we get tremendous transparency also to what's happening to cost. so we end up having good and constructive negotiations with our supplier partners. and where it is warranted and legitimate, we will pass it through.
and when i say the 3% to 4%, recognize that, yes, we may have several cpgs where there is a legitimate cost increase and requiring a price increase, and we'll do that. but it rallies that our entire portfolio goes up 3% to 4%. you're always something that is going down, especially when you have such a high fresh component. and that's what happens.
that's why you end up with this 3% to 4% despite you hearing the noise about inflation in many of the cpg companies coming together. all that said, i do expect it to be a little higher in the back half of this year. there's no question about it. i do expect it to be higher but in the range that we feel comfortable passing through.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then a quick follow-up. are there any signs that any of your major competitors are planning on stepping up discounting in the back half of the year? are you pushing any of your major vendors to start spending back more in the stores? i know some of that is counterintuitive with the pricing that's going on, but just trying to get a sense of the environment you're seeing right now and what you're looking for there.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
it's remarkably about the same as it was for the last -- i looked at it just recently, the index promotions and stuff. it's about been the same for the last several quarters -- last two or three quarters, ken. i think you have two. one is you talked about the elasticity.
the other thing to keep in mind is supply. those -- the types of things that you would tend to promote in football like a soda or beer or gatorade and other things -- i mean, things are in tighter supply. so it's just going to be harder for us to do anything like that. so i think you're seeing the discipline in the marketplace.

simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, everyone. good morning. i hope you can hear me. nice quarter.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, we can hear you.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. so my first question, i want to talk about the top line in the quarter. so the stacks look like they're accelerating. the industry is certainly not.
so you're certainly taking share. can you talk about how you look at the business? it looks like it's accelerating versus -- it accelerated in q1. can you break apart units in pricing and take out fuel and adjust for seasonality? and is that fair? is it accelerating? is it about the same versus the prior quarter? and vivek, you had this hypothesis pretty early on that some of the habits during covid would hold. it looks like that's true so far.
why should that continue even as we moderate -- as we go back post-covid, like why should that hypothesis still hold going forward? are you seeing things that give you confidence in that now?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. simeon, let me answer the second one. bob can then come back to the first one. so let's go into what is driving the sustenance of that behavior.
i always believe that the bigger impact of the lasting -- more lasting impact of the pandemic is the work from home, right? and so you're finding more and more companies going to a model where they say come three days to the office or two days to the office. but that really means two days at home or one day at home, and that's a substantial number. so i think you're going to see -- as long as that continues and we all get into a different mode of working, you're going to see more in-home consumption, especially breakfast and lunch, and that's substantial. the second thing we're seeing, this one, i don't know how long it will hold, ok, which is people cooking more at home.
and i'm seeing that only because you're seeing a lot more fresh sales than 2019, and it's higher on a relative basis to the rest of the store. that, i don't know, simeon, how long it will last, but i can see that pattern going for at least a year. the real test will be what happens when schools open, what happens when colleges open in the fall, what happens when people start traveling more, and so on, which is why in our outlook, you've seen that our sales are adjusted a little down for the second half. but the trends i'm seeing now are pretty positive.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
and then on the first item, simeon, you really can't look at the id rates very well, especially in the first quarter because things were really crazy a year ago as you know. but when we track -- we obviously track things on an average dollar basis, on a weekly basis, and we saw some very solid strength and momentum really throughout the quarter. 
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
consistent, right?
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
that's right. and as we said in our prepared remarks, we continue to see that into the second quarter much at the same level as we saw in the first quarter. so we're very optimistic on where sales are going.
operator
the next caller is kate mcshane from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
kate mcshane -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi. good morning. can you hear me?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes, kate. sorry about the technical stuff, but we can hear you well.
kate mcshane -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. good. no, no problem at all. i just wanted to follow up on the digital delivery piece, the third-party fulfillment.
i just wondered, ultimately, what that looks like in terms of how many partners do ultimately have when it comes to third-party fulfillment. and what does it mean for profitability? and finally, just the last question related to that is just what does it mean when it comes to data and using these other third-party fulfillment marketplaces?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes. ok. so kate, let me split that into two buckets. one is recognize that the fastest-growing business for us is drive up & go, and we're really excited about that, right? it is growing on top of last year, and it's growing faster than the expansion rate of our drive up stations.
and in the drive up & go, we have everything, right? we do the entire -- the service. there's a second part of the business where customers are ordering through us, and we are using a third-party to do the last mile. and that's purely more than anything an efficiency play because it allows for speed. you can get it done in a two-hour delivery.
and we believe in the notion of speed in ecommerce, right? so that's the second part. then the third part of the business is where we have a third-party who is getting the customer order and picking in the store and delivering it. and so that's -- and that part of the business, we are using multiple partners. and really, our philosophy there is that we're going to meet the customer where they want, right? and many of our customers -- most of our customers are shopping both.
the best customers are shopping both online and in-store. and our stores are in great locations. so i think it works for everybody, including the third-party when we are shopping proximal to where the customer is living. so that works for us.
and what we are doing is we are engaging more and more in the transparency around the data and in loyalty programs so that we continue to maintain that relationship and have the knowledge of what that customer is buying. so we'd look at it in three parts. and i just think at the end of the day, we'll focus on reaching that customer in many, many different ways.
kate mcshane -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you.

the next question is from michael montani with evercore. please go ahead.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey, good morning. thanks for taking the question. just wanted to ask, if i could, on the 10% id sales decline and then 16.5% two-year. if you all could share what the traffic and ticket split was? it did sound like traffic is positive.
so i thought that's an important point to tease up and then just a follow-up.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah. first of all, customer count or transactions is up, although the basket is down a little bit, of course. so we're seeing some of that. but we see that as a real positive thing.
people are coming back to the stores more than where they were a year ago certainly. and we're seeing strong sales and volumes as well.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, michael, what's been interesting is the traffic count -- the transaction count is up both online and in store over last quarter, right? and you would expect it in the store, but it's nice to see that online transactions are also over the last quarter. so and it's really a matter of baskets dropping, which also you would expect given how much of stock up there was last year.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. and then just the follow-up i had was you've seen some good traction, i think, in multichannel. and i just wanted to get a handle on any color you can share with respect to kind of the flow-through rates as that business continues to grow.
and how it would compare to kind of the core brick-and-mortar flow-through? is there a pathway to get it equal or above when you think about that, vivek and bob?
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah. i'll start here. certainly, our biggest growth has been at dug and our drive up & go. and our drive up & go on an incremental basis is improving as we move along, as we're getting more and more volume into that.
and we can see a day where that probably will be indifferent. as far as delivery, i don't know that we can see that that's ever going to be something that's going to be as profitable as drive up & go or the other. that last mile, that piece of it is always going to be an incremental cost.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
right. and michael, then what you do -- so if you like toward later in the year, toward the end of this year, we are relaunching our media platform. and so you find other sources of revenue and profit because you're getting more and more digital engagement with that customer. and that's what we're excited about.
so if you think about ecommerce, yes, it's a little more logistically intensive, but you get more digital engagement that opens up other avenues for you. and that's how we see this. and then finally, i think there is a scenario down the road where the mfc start getting the cost curve pretty far down. so compared to maybe two years ago, we are seeing a lot more levers to make the e-commerce side of the business indifferent, if i can call it that.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
really interesting stuff. thank you for the color.

the next question is from robby ohmes with bank of america securities. please go ahead.
robby ohmes -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. my first question is, can you hear me?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we can.
robby ohmes -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
excellent. excellent. and i apologize, i dialed in and i did miss some of the call, but so i wanted to just follow up, i think, on simeon's question. it does look like you gained market share this quarter.
is that right from your perspective? and if so, do you think -- what was the biggest driver? do you think vaccines played a role in that? do you think you were doing things better within stocks? or were you doing things maybe with relative pricing? and where do you think the market share is coming from?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
if you look at -- if you decompose it and how and where we're gaining market share, we're gaining a lot of market share in food, in the world of food. less so if you compare it to mulo, but on a two-year basis, we are also holding market share in mulo. that includes all of the other channels. i think we're keeping the market share because, one, we have seen a greater index in our purchases on fresh relative to the rest of the store.
so i think -- i told you transactions are up. the transaction is up because people are coming back more often for fresh, and that helps us with the market share. so clearly, that's a component of it. i'll tell you, interestingly, on the vaccines, we're proud of what we did on that, ok? we punched above our weight on vaccines.
once again, just tells our -- we are proud of how flexible the team was and how creative the team was. we got a lot of customers in who are not shopping with us, and we kept some of them. so in the grand scheme of things, robby, it wasn't the vaccination traffic that drove our total food sales market share, i think it's more fundamental operations and running great stores and having this e-commerce business beginning to hum.
robby ohmes -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

the next question is from krisztina katai with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
krisztina katai -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning, and congrats on a great quarter. i guess i wanted to, again, follow up on the market share that you continue to gain, like really good results there on a two-year stack. so i was just curious how that has evolved throughout the first quarter compared to your expectations, really, as you started lapping some of those share gains from last year.
and a follow-up to that is going to be a question on your promotional strategies. you talked a lot about being more surgical with promotions. so maybe if you could give us an update on the progress that you have made. and i was curious to see if there's anything to share that's interesting on the behavior of some of these newer customers that you have acquired over the last 12 to 15 months.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so the market share gains, i think, first, we had a -- our last quarter last year was 26% id. so we are lapping a very strong quarter. and i've been pleasantly surprised that on top of that quarter, we are gaining market share.
and the market share gains have been steady. i look at it every week, and it's been steady. and we frankly -- we feel like we won both holidays in quarter 1, ok? and so we feel good about that. with regards to -- you had a question on customer behaviors.
the customer behaviors with the new customers -- i think a lot of customers we brought in, we brought in through ecommerce. some of the customers we brought in, we brought in through the vaccinations, though a smaller portion. and what we're seeing there is that the customers that we are most excited about who are coming through ecommerce and then engage also in our store. they spend a lot more with us, a lot more with us than -- and the customer behavior or the -- i mean, that's about -- that's the broad message i'd give you on behaviors.
you had another question, though. do you have one other? promotions. yes. promotions, yes.
you know, if you look around our markets, you'll notice a couple of things. one is that we have fewer promotions. our flyers are smaller. so at least the physical side of what you see.
and you'll see that more of our promotions have gone digital. and when you go digital, you'll see that more of our promotions are personalized to the individual. and so that's from a broad reach perspective. and then underlying that, we've talked about a promotion technology that we have, which is now implemented fully that make sure that we don't waste promotions.
and so this notion of being surgical and digital is only getting better.
krisztina katai -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then i had a follow-up question on digital sales. so the two-year stack was still very strong, but it did decelerate versus the fourth quarter.
so my question is around your expectations for the balance of the year. and if this kind of level on a two-year stack basis is what you're expecting going forward now as consumers are increasingly coming back to the store?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
i think -- let's break down the two-year stack. i just want to be sure that you take away from -- there are a couple of components that are still growing. drive up & go is growing, it grew 75%. traffic in our ecommerce business is still up even over 2020.
so what you're seeing is relative to a very, very significant basket uptick in q1 2020. you're seeing that come down, which is why the numbers look that way, ok? i suspect what will happen is if you keep the same traffic -- remember, the baskets got smaller as you went through the year and people ended up not panic buying like they did. i think you'll see these numbers coming back up because the traffic is still staying positive.
krisztina katai -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thank you so much.

the next question is from robert moskow with credit suisse. please go ahead.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question. i wanted to know that, vivek, if you could share a little bit about what your learnings have been so far on mfcs? as an outsider, it looks like your approach to this is kind of cautious. you're kind of testing and learning.
so what have you learned about the operational effectiveness it can give you? and what are the challenges they pose?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so you are right. we are cautious in the sense that part of the trick on the mfc is first learning how to operate it and connect it to what's happening in the store. recognize that what you're trying to do in an mfc, you're trying to pick as much as you can from the mfc, and then pick the tail from the stores so that you don't lose the specialness of what you can give the customer from a store, a bouquet of flowers, a special cut of meat and so on.
but really, you've got to pick all of your core fast-moving items in the middle of the store. so first, how do you integrate it? how do you integrate orders? because one store is now covering six, seven stores. how do you think about the mix, especially if you're curating by store? so there's a lot of learning on that. there's a lot of learning also on just the algorithm that continues to learn to optimize the inventory in the mfc, so you can increase the pick time, there's learning in that.
and it's a lot of software that has to connect with the rest of the system, your ordering system for the overall business and so on. so we're learning a lot of those things. the second learning we're going through is how to configure it. we've got two that are connected to a store.
we're going to open another one that's not so connected to a store. we're exploring whether we should open a complete dark one, right? so there are different options, and these different things fit in different markets. and so we're going to test that through the rest of this year. and then i think we'll have enough to have learned a few prototypes that we can start scaling quickly.
so that's the journey we're going through, robert. and the nice thing about it is that i talked about the optionality. there's no need to punch out 100 of these quickly because the business is still growing with the base of the store. and by the time it gets to sufficient scale, we'll have this figured out.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. and i'll exercise one more follow-up here. you said that you want to be very active in m&a and that you're good at it. what are you seeing in terms of deal flow coming across your desk? these regional stores got a bit of a lifeline from covid.
i'm sure their sales are good. so does that mean that there's fewer opportunities to buy? or is it different than that?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
the deal flow is -- you know, i think it was higher pre-covid, let me put it that way. i think we're going to have to be patient. and i think the opportunities will come. and actually, that's good because it gives us a tremendous opportunity to modernize every aspect of our business, learn how to leverage our customer data, learn how to apply technology everywhere, learn how to become personalized and extremely surgical.
and so that we can get even more synergies when we do it. so that's how we're being patient, and we're going to continue to build our business.
melissa plaisance -- group vice presidnet, treasurer, and investor relations
ok. great. thanks for that question. we have time for two more questions.
operator
the next caller is joe feldman with telsey advisory group. please go ahead.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
hi, joe.
joe feldman -- telsey advisory group -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks. hi. how are you? thanks for taking the question. a lot of mine have been answered.
but i want to ask, can you talk a bit more about the prepared meals and the -- remind us of the expansion and what you're seeing. and i recall there were some changes that you did make to that -- to the prepared meals programs and some of the things in the stores where you try to package things more. are you going to go back to the kind of, i guess, the salad bar type of a prepared meal plan or not as you go forward?
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, yeah. good, good question. so let me separate two things, ok, joe. one is salad bars, wing bars, and all of those things that we had pre-pandemic.
and the amazing thing about when you have these disruptions, you still learn a lot. and so we're bringing those back, but we're bringing those back with kind of deliberately. so if you go to some markets, you'll see that we brought back the wing bar because in that -- in those markets, we sell more when you put it -- when you leave it in bulk, and there's that freshness component. there is the -- people believe you cook it -- actually they won't believe that we cook it in the stores, or they see all of that.
in some markets, we've opened the salad bars, and we're having good success with it. so we're going to bring some of that. and some of those, we're not bringing back at all, right, because customers have just switched habits to having it packaged -- prepackaged for them. the meals program is different.
the meals program, what we are trying to do is to give people the option of having meals that were -- that products that were prepared in store, taking it home and having a great meal in 15 minutes in an oven, right? and that's working really well for us. it's -- you can't do that if you don't have a tremendous presence in fresh. and if you don't have a butcher in the store to cut your meat the way -- so that it's done that morning for you. and we're rolling that out and are having great success with it.
what i'm proud of the team is they also learned how to manage the shrink with it, which is the most difficult part of that whole process.
joe feldman -- telsey advisory group -- analyst
that's really helpful. thanks. most of my questions were asked. i'll pass it on.
melissa plaisance -- group vice presidnet, treasurer, and investor relations
thank you. ok. last question.
operator
our last question is from kelly bania with bmo capital. please go ahead. 
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
kelly, good morning.
kelly bania -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
good morning. thanks for fitting me in. just one quick -- one clarification question and then another one on wages. just curious if you can -- so much moving parts in the numbers right now.
i was curious if you can help us kind of break down that two-year stack of 16.5% between volume, price, and mix and trade up, if you can put any kind of numbers around that maybe on a two-year stack basis, just so we can kind of understand the underlying components there? and then also just on wages, curious, obviously, a lot of noise in the market and announcements and increases in both wages and maybe benefits. just curious if you can help us understand what you're thinking for this year and next year and if you're making enough investment in that area for your employees? thank you.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes, kelly, let me tackle the wages piece, and then bob can come back to what we can share on the two-year stack. on the wages piece, kelly, we are not seeing the same challenges that you might hear from restaurant operators and others, ok? we're seeing some pressure on labor in certain markets and in some of our distribution centers. and the way we're seeing the pressure there is more from turnover and the ability to fill jobs. but we are in a place where we can still quite comfortably cover it with overtime and things like that.
so we feel good about that and recognize that with union wages. we -- our wages are typically higher than the market. we offer benefits. and the increase that we'll see in wages as we go forward will be part of the negotiated contracts.
and it typically ranges around 2%, as set of contracts come up and it ranges in that. so that's how we think about the planning horizon on wages. bob, could you share because the units are significant --
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
yeah, you're exactly right. i would say on the two-year stack, the most significant part of the increase there is certainly on units.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
now, if you try to look at things from a customer versus basket perspective, what we will say, and i think we said this a little bit earlier, we're pleased to see that we're favorable on customers versus a year ago. which was certainly down big time a year ago. but i don't think we're quite back to the levels that we were in 2019, but we see it trending that way.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
correct.
melissa plaisance -- group vice presidnet, treasurer, and investor relations
ok. well, thanks, everyone, for participating. we ran a little bit over given some of the glitches in this call. we appreciate your interest in albertsons companies.
and cody perdue and i will be available the balance of the day for the follow-up calls. thank you.

thank you for standing by. welcome to the albertsons companies first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. all participants will be in listen-only mode until the q&a session. this call is being recorded.
after the presentation, there'll be an opportunity to ask questions. i would now like to hand the call over to melissa plaisance, gvp, treasurer, and investor relations. please go ahead.
melissa plaisance -- group vice presidnet, treasurer, and investor relations
good morning, and thank you for joining us for albertsons companies first-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. with me today from the company are vivek sankaran, our president and ceo; and bob dimond, our cfo. today, vivek will share insights into our first-quarter results, as well as review our progress against our strategic priorities. bob will then provide the financial details of our first quarter, as well as updated full-year 2021 outlook before handing it back over to vivek for some closing remarks.

and with that, i will hand the call over to vivek. 
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, melissa. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. we entered uncharted territory in q1 with comparisons to last year's pandemic stock-up period and the gradual reopening of various geographies as vaccination rates accelerated and covid-related restrictions were lifted. in this dynamic environment, we remain focused on executing our strategy centered around deepening relationships with our customers and leveraging technology to run our business more efficiently and effectively.
i am pleased to report that our results for the quarter exceeded our internal plans across all key metrics, increasing our confidence in the balance of this year. our id sales grew 16.5% on a two-year basis, and we continue to gain market share in food on a one-year basis and in mulo, which includes most food, drug, mass, club, dollar, and military on a two-year basis. in addition, we achieved ebitda of -- adjusted ebitda of $1.3 billion and adjusted eps of $0.89 a share ahead of our expectations. against the backdrop of growth exceeding 200% in every quarter in fiscal '20, our digital initiatives continue to resonate with our customers.
and we have retained the sales levels we achieved last year with digital sales virtually flat year over year in q1 and a two-year stacked id sales growth of 276%. with all the options we have in place, we have achieved 95% customer coverage with ecommerce and retention has been strong. at the same time, we have seen a pickup in in-store transactions versus q1 '20, and many of those incremental in-store shopping trips are focused on fresh. at the end of q1 '21, we had 3.6 times the number of omnichannel households than we had two years ago in '19.
we've seen that as customers move into omnichannel, they also increased their spend in our stores with a net growth of 17% per household spend in the quarter and a total spend rate of two times that of an exclusively in-store shopper. in fact, in q1, with identified households, an average in-store-only shopper sales were down while the omnichannel customer sales were up year-over-year. we've grown our identified households by 8% year over year for the last 52 weeks, allowing us to better understand their needs so we can personalize our offerings for them and drive recurring and incremental spend. membership in our just for u loyalty program continued to accelerate and was up over 18% year over year in q1 '21 to 26.7 million members.
we also increased the number of actively engaged customers by almost 13%, and we have a 94% retention rate that engage just for u households. remember that actively engaged customers spend four times more with us. in summary, our strategy of building lasting relationships with customers through a combination of digital and in-store engagement is driving our top line. overall, our strategy is focused on four priorities: in-store excellence, accelerating our digital and omnichannel capabilities, driving productivity, and strengthening our talent and culture.
in-store excellence is demonstrated through the one-stop shopping experience we continue to provide for our customers supported by the quality, variety, and depth of our fresh and own brands offerings that give us a competitive advantage. in fresh, which has always been a strategic focus for us, we continue to see stickiness giving us confidence that our strategy is working. the fresh department sales growth outpaced center store by approximately 200 basis points on a two-year basis, which each of our fresh categories ahead of pre-pandemic levels as customers continue to consume more meals at home. as our markets have opened up, we've seen customers shopping in our stores more often and continue to see fresh as a key driver for growth.
our own brands portfolio also continues to appeal to our customers with strong sales driven by the introduction of new innovative products, as well as our focus on albertsons legacy divisions that were historically underpenetrated. our q1 sales penetration was 25.2%, up over 100 basis points from q1 '20 when supply issues impacted sales. we continue to innovate launching 318 new items in q1 '21, many of which were signature farms bulk items, including trail mixes, various nuts and dried fruits, open nature almond butter, and signature select premium beef patties. we continue to expect to launch over 800 items this year.
we're also proud of our own brands team that was named the store brand magazine 2021 game changer as a private brand that revitalized the industry. we also continue to capitalize on demand for convenient and fresh meals as consumers come to us for food beyond the purchase of ingredients. we have begun the rollout of our ready meals, our ready-to-eat, ready-to-heat, and ready-to-cook meals program, and expect to be in approximately 500 stores by our fiscal year-end. finally, we continue to invest in our stores.
we opened five new stores and completed 33 upgraded and remodel projects during q1 '21. our second priority is the acceleration of our digital and omnichannel capabilities. digital is an important growth driver for us as we strive to provide an area of convenient shopping experiences for our customers. we added a net 320 new dug locations, drive up & go locations, in q1 '21, bringing our total to 1,740.
and dug sales grew 75% year over year. we now expect to have dug in approximately 1,950 locations, representing approximately 98% coverage by the end of the second quarter. as part of our growth plans in digital, we also remain focused on delivering a superior customer experience, as well as improving profitability. for example, we continue to achieve on-time tilling and delivery rates in excess of 95%, demonstrating consistent on-time delivery and dug pickups.
we began the rollout of our integrated loyalty and ecommerce app offerings of connected customer experience through a single interface. we launched a new san jose bay area mfc, and that plans for an additional six mfcs before the end of our fiscal year, bringing the total to nine mfcs. we sped up delivery times while reducing delivery cost per order by expanding our third-party delivery store network while also adding doordash one-hour delivery to our ecommerce options, which has been rolled out to nine divisions so far. we also implemented our enhanced picking software at all dug locations to help optimize and standardize picking processes, increasing picks per hour, and enhancing order prioritization.
and we improved customer service by migrating all support to one it platform. our third strategic priority is driving productivity to support reinvestment in the business and help offset inflation. we are making progress against our productivity agenda, and we exceeded our internal expectations in q1. during the quarter, we made significant progress in labor efficiency, shrink, promotions optimization, and indirect expense.
we continue to expect to achieve $1.5 billion in gross savings by the end of fiscal '22. our fourth priority is strengthening our talent and culture and supporting the communities we serve. we continue to add talent throughout the company at both the corporate and division level, including the recent appointment of jennifer saenz, our new chief merchandising officer, and are very proud of our store-level teams who are adapting well to a changing environment. our pharmacy team also continues to come through for our communities.
to date, they have administered 6 million covid vaccine doses. in addition, during q1, our nourishing neighbors fundraising drive raised approximately $9 million from our generous customers at our check stands, which was matched by the albertsons companies foundation resulting in $18 million in funds to feed children and families this summer. as part of our ongoing focus on esg, we recently announced that we are the first company in america to introduce a 100% zero-emission refrigerated grocery delivery truck. and we have been enhancing our supplier diversity program through new partnerships and an improved database and tracking tool.
and in conjunction with our recently completed new materiality assessment, we're focused on quantifying our carbon-reduction opportunities, baselining our food waste, plastic, and packaging footprints, and further developing goals and targets for de&i and community stewardship. we expect to share our key focus areas and commitments later this year. and now i would like to ask bob to cover the details of our first-quarter financial results and outlook.
bob dimond -- chief financial officer
thanks, vivek, and hello, everyone. i am pleased to provide details on our strong first-quarter results, as well as an update to our fiscal 2021 outlook. in many cases, i will make comparisons back to our first quarter of fiscal 2019 period to demonstrate the performance versus our pre-pandemic levels. for the first quarter, total sales were $21.3 billion, up approximately 14% or $2.5 billion compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which is primarily driven by our 16.5% two-year stacked identical sales results.
our gross profit margin came in at 29.1% during the first quarter of 2021, compared to 29.8% in q1 2020 and 28% in q1 2019. excluding the impact of fuel, our gross profit margin was up 10 basis points compared to q1 of 2020 and increased over 90 basis points compared to q1 2019. the increase compared to q1 2019 is primarily driven by improvements in shrink expense, our productivity initiatives, sales leverage, and improved pharmacy margins relating to administering covid-19 vaccinations, partially offset by investments related to our growth in digital sales. our sg&a as a percentage of sales, excluding fuel, increased 115 basis points year-over-year as we saw sales deleverage versus the period of significant heightened demand in the first quarter of last year.
but importantly, on a two-year basis, we decreased our sg&a as a percentage of sales by 75 basis points. covid-19-related expenses during the quarter totaled approximately $130 million. some of this was one-time in nature, including the write-off of some covid-related inventory and supplies, so we expect these costs in future quarters will be lower. interest expense was $153 million, compared to $181 million in the first quarter a year ago.
the reduction in interest expense is primarily driven by lower average interest rates due to our successful refinancing transactions during fiscal 2020 and our continued deleveraging. adjusted ebitda was $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2021, representing compound annual growth of approximately 22% versus the first quarter of 2019. the growth in adjusted ebitda versus the first quarter of 2019 represents strong flow-through of approximately 17%. adjusted net income was $518 million or $0.89 per fully diluted share, representing compound annual growth of over 70% compared to q1 2019.
we ended q1 with $2.2 billion in cash on the balance sheet and are pleased that this gives us flexibility to continue to invest in growth opportunities. capital expenditures were approximately $513 million during the first quarter as we opened five stores, closed five, completed 33 remodels, and invested in our digital and technology platforms. we continue to expect our spend to be approximately $1.9 billion to $2 billion during fiscal 2021. during q1, we also received upgrades from our debt rating agencies as moody's upgraded us to baa stable and s&p upgraded to bb stable.
we ended the quarter with our net debt-to-adjusted ebitda ratio at 1.5 times on an ltm basis, consistent with the levels we exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. turning now to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2021. given the outperformance in q1 and recent trends, we have updated our guidance for fiscal '21. some of the outperformance in q1 is related to covid vaccine revenue that was ahead of expectations.
and this revenue source has begun to taper off as the pace of vaccinations slows. nonetheless, our competitive advantages and the underlying stickiness of the business gained during the pandemic, as well as the ability to pass along modest inflation and the continued consumer demand for premium items gives us confidence in the strength of the business for the balance of the year. we now expect identical sales on a two-year stacked basis to be in the range of approximately 11% to 12% compared to prior guidance of 9.5% to 11%. we expect adjusted eps in the range of $2.20 to $2.30 per share, which represents a two-year compounded annual growth of 47% at the midpoint of the range, up $0.25 from our prior guidance range.
we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, up $200 million from our previous guidance range and representing two-year compound annual growth of approximately 16% at the midpoint of our range. in q2 to date, we are seeing our core business sales on an average weekly dollar basis and market share gains continuing at similar levels to q1. as a result of seasonality and the drop-off in the pace of covid-19 vaccinations administered, we believe the current consensus expectation for q2 ebitda margin is still appropriate. we continue to believe that our productivity initiatives and seasonality will drive stronger ebitda margins in the back half of the year compared to q2, as we noted on the year-end call.
and now vivek will provide some closing remarks.
vivek sankaran -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bob. before we turn to q&a, i want to share a few closing remarks. while it's hard to predict the impacts of covid-19 on demand over the long term, we believe there are a few trends that will stick with us. first, we believe digital engagement with consumers in our sector will continue to increase.
this provides us with an opportunity to gather more data and deliver a better, more personalized shopping experience for our customers. second, even though we saw a step-change in 2020, we believe consumers will increase their use of e-commerce solutions, especially pickup in store and rapid delivery. particularly in our industry, consumers value speed and delivery, and we are committed to continuing to enhance speed by leveraging our great store locations. lastly, we believe more remote work is here to stay.
this means more meals at home, which will continue to benefit our business, particularly the demand for fresh ingredients and meals. albertsons companies is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends given our unique competitive advantages. and as we go forward, we'll remain focused on investing in technology to amplify our strengths and become a faster and more efficient business to better serve our customers and drive ebitda flow-through in our p&l. with this as a backdrop, let me also share some insights on recent trends in our performance.
despite business reopening and people resuming travel, our sales momentum continues with growth in market share, and we are very focused on continuing these trends on market share. when looking at our average weekly sales dollars, sales in q2 are continuing at the same levels as in q1. we are seeing continued strength in sales of items that were elevated throughout the pandemic such as meat, seafood, produce, and high-end wines, providing evidence that some important food and beverage categories remain shifted to food at home. while we are seeing higher cost inflation in some categories, we saw modest inflation during q1, and we were generally successful in passing it through as the competitive environment has remained rational.
and we continue to see households upgrading to more quality and premium products indicating that the consumer is still strong. overall, we are confident in our ability to continue to produce strong results. i want to extend my thanks to our entire team of approximately 290,000 associates who are continuing to take care of our customers and communities this quarter, as well as throughout the pandemic. we will now take your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question is coming from the line of simeon gutman with morgan stanley. please proceed with your questions. 
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, vivek. my first question is on inflation, i guess just straight housekeeping. so can you talk about product cost inflation or retail price inflation to the customer? where is it, and how is it trending sequentially? and trying to figure out what the benefit could have been during the quarter. thank you. 
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, simeon. i'm going to turn that over to vivek.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes, simeon. so the cpi inflation was around 2% in the quarter. ours was about 3% on cost, ok, for the quarter. and as i said earlier, we expect the inflation to be higher as we go through the year, but we expect it still to be in the 3% to 5% range, which, in our opinion, is extremely manageable.
and you're seeing that come through in at least the quarter we just delivered. so we feel good that we can manage it through both what the customer is able to -- we have strong customers. so with that backdrop and what we have going in productivity, we are able to manage that in our p&l.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. ok. that's helpful. my next question, i want to ask sharon about the phrase table stakes.
i think you remember, it was mentioned a lot at best buy. and i think it was related to pricing and making sure prices were at parity to large competitors. and i know we've talked about this with albertsons in the past, but i'm curious, sharon, your own perception as a customer of albertsons and the industry so far. what do you think -- or where should pricing be? where should you operate? i'm curious if you have a view yet? like, where would it make sense? where wouldn't it make sense to level the playing field against other competitors?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes, simeon. thank you for that. i think i'll let vivek talk first about where we have been with pricing, and then i will follow up with my view as it relates to albertsons in that comparison you spoke to. so vivek, why don't you take the first part, and i'll take the second?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. simeon, i just want to be sure that i reinforce our approach to pricing, right? the first thing we look at is, are we gaining market share in dollars and units. because to me, gaining market share units gives us a good indication that the value we are providing our customer across the mix of our portfolio, the fresh portfolio we have, our own branch portfolio and the branded portfolio resumes, and so that's the first thing. the second principle on pricing, i want to reinforce again is that we take an incredibly surgical approach to it.
so every single quarter, you should know that we are investing in pricing. and we invested by price area in specific markets. and again, it's with the outcome that we care about, which is growth and market share gains in dollars and units. so please keep that philosophy.
and then, sharon, you might want to add to that?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so simeon, i would say that interestingly enough, there are great similarities to what we were doing in my previous life. and i would say, overall, the company has a very surgical approach to pricing, and that is actually not new. we are definitely building capabilities in this area.
i would say that they have moved their capabilities in this area materially over the last 12 months. and when i look at that, lightning rod products, we might call them something different in the grocery space. but there are products that we offer in our store that, mentally, customers are consistently benchmarking. and to the extent that we see that, of course, we are going to be reacting because that is what is good for our customer.
so it is different in every category. we have a much more expansive number of products that we offer. and i would say that you will continue to see us invest in surgical ways into pricing over time where it makes sense to do it.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. right. thanks. nice quarter, everyone.
take care.

our next question is coming from the line of edward kelly with wells fargo.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
good morning, everyone. i guess for -- i want to start with just a follow-up and then i had a bigger picture question. but just on the inflation front, you mentioned last quarter, sort of 3% to 4% being like a good number for the business. today, you said sort of 3% to 5%.
cpi is running much higher than that. i mean cpi is kind of closer to the high end. i'm just kind of curious sort of taking a step back, can you just provide a bit more color on sort of how you're thinking about this, in terms of, like, how you manage it strategically? what your competitors are doing? and how we should be thinking about the gross margin in the back half of the year against that backdrop?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
ed, i'll let vivek take that.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. so let me start with the gross margin question, ed, because that's ultimately what we are trying to manage to at the top, right? so we want the top line growth, and we want to make sure that it comes with a healthy gross margin. i've always maintained the fact that in our company, we obsess about this notion of gross margin tailwinds. and gross margin tailwinds come from better mix management, better shrink management, smarter promotions, supply chain benefits and cost of goods benefits.
and those first three have been programs that we've been doing for a while now. and the last two, as we talked about earlier, we are going to see more and more benefits from that toward the back half of the year. so from the management of the gross margin in the p&l, while we can't predict what's going to happen with inflation, we certainly are prepared with what we can do with what's in our control. so think of it that way.
now secondly, with my 3% to 5%, i mean to me, the cpi projections came up. i think they've gone up to 3.5% for the full year. so i expect that it will continue to increase a little bit over what we've seen through the rest of balance of this year and maybe the first part of next year. but it's still, in my opinion, ed, very much in the manageable realm for a country like ours, especially with the consumer, with the backdrop we're seeing with the consumer.
the last thing i'll leave you with is, you'll see that a big part of the inflation is proteins. and protein inflation doesn't -- it tends to be more cyclical. so i suspect that some of that will come back. protein inflation -- and you'll see it in different parts of protein.
so -- and it's a very manageable part of the business, especially when we have butchers in our store who can manage and give different choices for consumers. and that's how we manage the protein inflation, so consumers can always have something that they pick up to meet their budget.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then i just wanted to follow up related to the broader category of investments. so you're ramping investment in the business and in digital transformation.
i'm curious, is this changing at all with sharon joining? what i mean by that is, either in urgency or the size of the spend, kind of curious, sharon, is that how you think about like the position of the company's stores or technology or supply chain, and how that could impact areas like capex going forward? we have seen companies sort of ramp capex into transformation. so i'm kind of curious as to how that may apply here.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
ed, i think that they have had a very disciplined strategy around the capital investments that they are currently doing. to the extent that we could accelerate those investments, we would. and from my perspective, these investments create gradual and incremental returns over time. and the early stages of these types of transformations start with having to build the foundations.
where the company is now is very much on getting out of systems that are old enough to drink and vote in most states and actually putting in platforms that they can build on quickly, right? and so this is a story that you hear from every large retailer who has legacy systems. so they have been working on that for the last 18 months -- 24 months since vivek joined the company. we are in the process, the analytics behind these investments and the work to determine direction is very well on its way, on many of these projects, and now it's the execution that needs to happen. rest assured that our goal is going to be to accelerate the pace at which we are rolling this out.
one of the key things we had to do was to get ourselves into the cloud. and as you know, that is a significant undertaking, and the company is making great progress on that. we still have a ways to go, but we are making very good progress in that space, thus being able to move much faster in the future. so your question was, how do i feel about it? i feel the discipline around it and the strategic discipline around it has been excellent.
i think there is always the opportunity to accelerate, which is something that i mentioned in my prepared remarks that i'm very interested in doing, both on the technology side and on the supply chain side of it. and as we look forward and we get into our guidance for 2022, this has been a question that i've received numerous times from many of you in the private meetings before our call today, and i will be providing some additional color when we go into 2022. as we get clear picture of the 2022 capital spending expectations and budget. but as you know, they have taken them up.
so i feel very confident that we will be able to execute against the initiatives that they've originally laid out.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst

our next question is from the line of john heinbockel with guggenheim.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
i wanted to start with omnichannel households, right? so up four times, i would imagine that's still less than 5% of your total households. is that fair? and then when you think about maybe the next two years, can you double again the number of omnichannel households over that time period to two times? and what do you think drives that? obviously, organically just having capabilities with some of that, but more -- is it really your outreach marketing-wise, right, that drives that growth from here?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
i'm going to let vivek take that. 
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
hey, john. good morning, john. we are below our competitors in terms of our overall omnichannel mix in the business, and we've said that before and we continue to grow that. we are excited about the growth rate, but we're also excited about the quality and the speed at which we're providing it, right? so to your question, i do think we can continue to increase it at the same pace, if not more.
and there's a couple of things. one is just making sure we are covering the entire market. i'll give you an example, john. when we open up two-hour delivery in our markets, we see even more incremental growth, right? people love the speed.
and our coverage is in the close to, say, 60% of the market, and we're going to continue to grow that. so our philosophy here is to keep giving customers more choices on drive up & go. it's three-minute service when you pull up to the parking lot. we want to make sure we give you more speed in delivery and more choices in delivery.
and i think that's -- those fundamentals -- and as we open it up, continues to increase the number of omnichannel customers we get. to your point, we haven't turned on a big marketing blitz or anything because we see a lot of customers coming to our stores, and we just convert them at that point. they see the availability and they start engaging in it.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
and john, i would add to that, that over time, this past year, we have been adding capabilities. the app that customers were buying online with has been upgraded materially. again, all of these initiatives that we're working on in the e-commerce side of the business are gradual and incremental. you implement them, customers learn to use them.
they see how much more efficient they are. they have a better experience, and then they use it more. so we've really soft launched the majority of these. we're also making similar progress in the loyalty area.
we talked in vivek's prepared comments about the fact that we are increasing our number of loyalty member. and as we enhance the benefits and enhance the efficiency and the experience the customer has in redeeming loyalty, etc., that will also be greatly helpful to advancing this.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
and then maybe as a follow-up, right? so if we're going to -- i don't know if it will be a double in omnichannel customers, right, but certainly, the demand is going to increase exponentially. so maybe talk to -- and i know the mfcs tie into this but it's broader than this. bringing the cost to pick, i guess, i don't know if you guys look at cost to pick a piece as opposed to an entire order, but cost to pick down -- and how much can you bring the cost to pick down by, right? can you bring that down 25%, 30% or possibly even more?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
vivek?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. john, the cost to pick down, there's two steps. one is, how do you become more and more efficient in the store, and that's through technology. and then in some of our stores, we've created what we call a ware room so that your fastest-moving items can be baked even faster in a very small space.
so that's -- but you're going to reach the physical limits. and so our long-term strategy will not be about picking everything from the store. on certain locations, we had to do that, but that's where the mfc comes in. what i can tell you is this that we've seen the mfcs getting to a point where the cost to pick becomes about the same as the labor cost that we have for an order in a store, right, because of the productivity it gives you.
and at some point, you start becoming indifferent to whether the auto has picked -- whether -- or somebody shopped the store or whether they shopped it through the mfc. that's their vision. when that converges, this thing opens up in a big way for us because you're kind of indifferent. the mfc are going to take a little while, john.
as we said, a couple of mfcs, we couldn't get done, right, because of delays, permitting takes a little longer, construction takes a little longer in today's environment.

our next question comes from the line of karen short with barclays. please proceed with your questions. 
karen short -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
hi. thanks very much. so just a question regarding guidance. so your comps guide has obviously improved.
but when we look at the second half ebitda dollars, they're kind of more or less in line with consensus. so i'm kind of wondering if you could give a little color there, meaning, you can obviously raise top line, but you didn't really change the second half ebitda dollars. and then tying into that, you did say sales accelerated throughout the quarter, but the full-year id guide implies the deceleration in the one and two-year id. so some color on that? and then i had a bigger picture question.
melissa plaisance -- group vice president, treasury and investor relations
karen, on the bigger view for the back half, i'll let vivek take that. and then i'll take more of the detailed financial side of the question.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
karen, the way i think of it is -- let's say we've got about 2.5 points additional id growth, right, let's say, about $1.65 billion or so at a 15% flow-through is an additional $250 million for the year, right? so that's how i would think of it as -- and remember that the back half of the year is going to depend a lot more -- we're getting a lot more of our productivity. so that's how we have trained at least the model for how we think about the full year.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
and then, karen, when you look at the back half, if you do the math, basically, you're in the back half at -- in the midpoint of it somewhere around flat, so obviously, that will flow through, as vivek just described. and i would say this, as we look at the back half, like, all of you, like, every report that i've read that many of you have written. we are very thoughtful about whatever dynamics will result in the back half as it relates to the stimulus changes that will be upon us, which some have already happened. however, i will point out there's been some new ones.
we went from the snap increases throughout the first part of the year and now they are paying out the child care credits on a monthly basis. and as we understand it, we are -- the industry looks like it's seeing a lot of that going into grocery and into everyday necessity. so we are thoughtful about the back half, and we will continue to push the business. but as we see it, right now, i think we've played in a very balanced view of what the back half could look like on the comp side.
karen short -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then, sharon, in your comments, you obviously said you had -- there were great similarities at albertsons to kind of some of your former experiences. but one comment you made was that you're taking, i think, a very surgical approach to pricing and have moved significantly in the last 12 months on that front.
can you just update us on where you're at in terms of that? and what is to be expected going forward?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
as it relates to my comments on the pricing, the company is building a very strong pricing team. considerable resources have been added to that. this is one of those investments that we continue to talk about on our strategic priorities. so again, this is all about data, karen.
and as you think about the time, the benefits of that are gradual and incremental. i hate to keep saying that, but it is true for just about every one of the underlying projects and the strategic priorities that albertsons has. so as we think about pricing, again, what i said is the company has always been known for its deals. while the price that you see, customers are getting special pricing through loyalty.
they are getting special pricing through deals. and actually, we have data that would tell you that people come to us for our deals. so it is interesting to see how well the company is managing that at this point. now do i think we need to go further? i do.
and there's no one here that doesn't think that you have to keep safe and keep pace with what others are doing in the industry. so i feel like we will continue to see benefit in pricing, and i think we will be looking at the guests, like we always have been looking at them and where we believe it is important, and it will create more stickiness with our customers. we will be adjusting that pricing. but i just don't think that -- like there's -- simeon said earlier, that this is a lot like best buy.
i think it isn't in the pricing arena. and at that side, we did match price but there were many products that you can't match, and that is always the case. so happy to have some further conversations as we talk about this over time. but i feel very confident that we are building a much stronger pricing capability in the company, and we will see benefits from that.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. karen, if i can add to that. there's -- we talked some time about our promotion tools that we are launching. now that is national.
all our promotions are going through that too. and while we are doing less promotions, we're also doing a lot -- we're a lot smarter with our promotions. we know which ones to do to drive traffic, which ones to do to drive margins, etc. and then a lot of that is also going digital.
so from a promotion standpoint, we have so far ahead of where we were a couple of years ago, from a data and technology capability to do it. and that's the principle we're going to continue to go down. the other thing we're doing when we talk -- and sharon said surgical is that, in these different price areas, we also adjust price -- everyday pricing. and we do that very, very -- in every quarter, there are some parts of our -- some markets in our franchise where we're adjusting it on an everyday basis.
that's the combination that we continue to play, and we're getting better and better at it because we have the data and the tools to do it.
karen short -- barclays investment bank -- analyst

our next question is coming from the line of ken goldman with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks, sharon. you mentioned that one of your priorities right now is working on the productivity agenda.
we've seen overall, for the grocery sector, margins decline for decades now. so i'm curious, when you think about productivity, are you thinking about the net effect potentially being that margins over the very long term could reverse course and start to rise over time? or is the idea, you really just need more tools so that the headwinds just aren't -- or offset partially a little bit better. i'm just trying to get a better sense of how you view this. because i think there's a belief out there overall that margins will continue to decline forever in this industry, and i'm just not sure how you see that.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
so vivek had made some comments about this in the last conference call. i'll let vivek take this first, and then i'll give you my view.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes, ken. the approach here is, we want to make sure we don't grow this business simply by expanding gross margins. we want tailwinds in gross margins, but we always want to have room for reinvestment of that for growth. so that's number one.
number two, you can speak about the industry, but i want to speak about albertsons. we've got plenty of room in the middle of the p&l to drive more and more productivity. why is that, ken? it's because we are -- yes, we went through the integration in the past but we haven't yet learned how to fully operate with scale benefits. and a lot of the initiatives that we are driving are driven by improving -- leveraging initiatives that get us better cost because of scale benefits.
we haven't implemented all the technology that many others have, that drives productivity benefits. so in the middle of the p&l, you're seeing our productivity being driven by initiatives, frankly, that are not new to the sector, but new to us, right, which gives us more flow through in the middle of the p&l. so -- but think of that philosophy, ken. it's managing the gross margin through tailwinds and investments so that we are driving customers back to us and engaging more with customers and driving the top line and a set of technology and scale-based initiatives that improve the middle of the p&l that end up with margins, right? so -- but -- and if we can keep that engine going, which we think we can, we'll continue to normally deliver growth but healthy margins.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
and ken, i would just add to that to what vivek said that there are other ways as well that we think are going to help offset some of those cost pressures. i, first and foremost, want to say that there is no doubt in my mind that there will continue to be cost pressures on all of retail. grocery -- consumer electronics, pick one, home furnishing, it doesn't matter. there will be cost pressure.
there is also the incremental cost of adding these online businesses, which we're all aware of. in order to combat that, first of all, growth has to be the foundation of the strategy. and we are making great strides in continuing to gain market share, and it is a deep, deep focus of the organization to gain market share. and as vivek said, on a two-year basis, we gained it on both metrics.
we were gaining on dollars, and we're gaining on units. the second thing that we have that other retailers in the space have already taken advantage of is the penetration of owned brands. we still, in the ipo -- and you can go back to the ipo, we talked about the fact that we have an increased opportunity for penetration in own brands. we have not yet -- vivek mentioned a 25.2% penetration today.
we still have significant opportunity there, and we will continue to capitalize on that. another area that we have opportunity to create a tailwind or an offset to some of these pressures is going to be in the mix of fresh. we continue to talk about the fact that we are growing faster in fresh than we are in the center store. that is giving us a margin benefit.
and we will continue to grow in that area because we believe that this is one of the greatest things that we can do for our customers is to create an incredible fresh experience, but it also has margin benefit from a mix point of view. so those are just a few things i would add to what vivek said that will give us some tailwinds to help offset the cost pressure that we would all agree is certainly coming.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst

our next question is from the line of paul lejuez with citi. please proceed with your question. 
paul lejuez -- citi -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks. curious about the categories where you're seeing the highest levels of inflation. and vivek, i think, maybe mentioned protein earlier.
and how you've chosen to passthrough or not passthrough those higher prices to the customer? what has been the customer reaction in terms of elasticity of demand? and how does that compare to what you had expected? thanks. 
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
vivek?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. thank you, paul. good morning, paul. we are mindful.
let me start with this. we have not seen a material change in customer behavior. and i think it speaks to the strength of the customer. it speaks to the fact that they're, in my opinion, still consuming a lot at home.
they're enjoying cooking and so on. so we're seeing those trends stick. and in fact, in the research we are doing with our shoppers, we don't see that changing dramatically. we don't see their intent changing dramatically over the next several weeks and months.
so that's number one. number two, remember, we are always optimizing for a basket, and that's important to keep in mind because you can see the protein inflation going up and so on, but we're always managing for two things. one is, what's the right way to pass the inflation so we get the -- we make the basket affordable and yet keep the gross margins that we want. the second thing we do is manage it locally.
and that's something we can do with our model because we've got the divisions that know what's necessary in their market versus the competition they have. so in those two dimensions, we're able to manage that passthrough, if i can call it, very, very locally. and that's the combination that's giving us the ability to deliver the gross margin without compromising the sales. is that helpful?
paul lejuez -- citi -- analyst
yes. thank you. and then just another follow-up. on the sg&a front, can you quantify some of the year-over-year changes in terms of which were the -- which were moving the dial.
and i'm also kind of curious about the productivity initiatives, where you stand in that $1.5 billion by '22? how is that progressing relative to your plans?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so why don't i take that one, paul? on the sg&a and the increases, there's a couple of dynamics during the quarter that we discussed in the press release. the first one was that we had the reopening of many of our fresh departments, deli, bakery, prepared foods, that creates a mix difference within our stores and the labor hours that, of course, go along with that. so that was one of the big drivers and one of the largest drivers.
the second area that we saw increases is in the market wage rate. while we do have union contracts across majority of our employee base, we still have annual increases that come along into those contracts. and then, of course, i don't have to describe for you the wage pressure that you would see in any role, and we can start with stores, and we can work our way all the way through the corporate headquarters. we have wage pressure in virtually every area in the company, like, every other retailer.
we also had a higher stock-based compensation this quarter, based on a credit that flowed through the p&l last year. but in the order of magnitude -- they are in the press release of the order of magnitude.
paul lejuez -- citi -- analyst
got it. and just that $1.5 billion?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. we have not disclosed our progress against that. however, we are progressing as you would expect them to progress. and we continue to be committed to delivering on that promise.
paul lejuez -- citi -- analyst

rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to follow up on the gross margin line. i was wondering if you could provide more color on the puts and takes you see on the balance of the year.
and i think last quarter, you guys indicated you could be close to flat with the prior year. so i just wanted to get a sense of what your updated expectation is for the full year. thank you. 
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
vivek, do you want to talk about the back half gross margins?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. rupesh, i think the -- let's think of it as some of the initiatives that are going to help us in the back half of the year in gross margin, in addition to the things we talked about before, mix, shrink, promotions, own brand penetration and so on is the new flow-through coming from supply chain benefits and the new flow through coming from cost of goods reduction, right, which both of them are leveraging our scale, and i talked about those initiatives earlier. so we feel good about the overall gross margin tailwinds that we have coming with us. and we'll continue to use that appropriately to drive growth and where we need to make investments.
so no -- there should be no fundamental change to the thinking on gross margins, rupesh, if that helps.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
and we don't guide by gross margin. we only guide adjusted ebitda, just as a reminder.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
ok. great. and then maybe just one follow-up. just on the supply chain.
just curious where you guys are on the stock front right now?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so i'll let vivek speak to that. he was just in a meeting on it.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. it's surprising that we're still talking about how are the stocks and where we're on the stocks. but the fact is, it's like whack-a-mole, rupesh. there's -- on any given day, something is out of stock in the store.
but -- so let's talk about how we manage it. now we give customers alternatives, right? if you come in, you may not get exactly what you want when you want it, but you might get an alternative. and if you come in another day, you'll probably find it. and so -- now this comes down to execution.
this comes down to local execution, finding ways to make sure that the store is supplied, finding ways to make sure that the stuff is not in the backroom but at the front. and that's where i'm proud of what the teams are doing, just to be that much, a little bit better than others in what's on the shelf.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
and i'll just add to that, rupesh, for the next three months, fourth quarter holiday, actions that you've seen that are being taken by many of the largest retailers, we have been all over this and have a list of probably 25 things that we are approaching differently this year than we have in the past in order to ensure that we offer our customers the best in stocks we can.

scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. so i wanted to talk about something a little bit more short term, which sharon, i think you always had the reputation of being pretty conservative on the guidance. is that the philosophy you're going to bring to albertsons? should we assume kind of a continuation of that?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. there would be no question that i believe that, especially in the environment that we're operating in today that that would be appropriate. so i couldn't affirm more strongly that i believe that is a good strategy.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
ok. great. and then i know it's a little early to think about '22, but we get a lot of questions on this. and i guess, as you think about it, is it going to be possible to grow earnings next year to a degree? or is that something that's going to be just really hard given the cost pressures on the business, the union contracts and labor and other things going on.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. scott, we will not be talking about 2022 until we get closer to the end of this year. there is so much learning that needs to happen with the changes in the consumer and what's post covid. there is never going to be a post covid, but the next chapter of where this goes.
so when we get into the fourth quarter, and we look at next year, we'll try to give you a lot more color on that. but i think this needs to unfold before we start talking about 2022.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. the only thing i'd add, scott, is that remember, cost on things are a controllable item. we can work that with productivity initiatives. i think the biggest unknown as sharon points out is, where is the consumer? how is consumer behavior going to change? and as we've all seen, i don't know if we predicted what's happening now.
so...
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
perfect. and then if i could slip one last one in, just the philosophy that's -- is there going to be a change? and what's the philosophy on capital efficiency and roic, given that we are going into an investment period a little bit with the company, it sounds like, further investment?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. scott, i would say this. i think it is a philosophy of discipline, but it is a philosophy of ""do it as fast as you can."" time is not your friend. and philosophically, that is very much how we will be moving forward.
we have a lot of opportunity. vivek mentioned earlier, we have brought together a lot of companies. and they've done a good job of getting them solidified onto a similar platform, a common platform. but as we move forward, we still have opportunities in better buying.
we just consolidated some of that. so we have significant opportunities. but by the way, other retailers don't have in their tailwinds. so i think, yes, the diligence around those investments will be high, and we will continue to accelerate to the extent we can over the next 12 to 24 months.

robbie ohmes -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, thanks. vivek and sharon, i will -- ok, for my one question. with the -- i think the guidance implies kind of similar to lower id sales in the back half. and what i was hoping, can you give a little more color on sort of the traffic versus transaction size assumptions in that? and maybe speak to what you're seeing? are you seeing consolidation of trips remain similar? or is that dropping off? i'm just -- in that customer behavior assumption, what do you think is staying the same versus changing, especially on that size of the transaction versus visits to the stores?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. robbie, back in -- when we talked about q1, we have seen that there was -- in-store traffic was going up a lot. we saw digital traffic. while it was higher, the rate was coming down.
what's interesting is that over the last several periods here, the traffic seems to have stabilized in the store. so we're seeing healthy, stable traffic in store. and we've seen a pickup again in digital traffic. so -- and about three weeks into this quarter, we started seeing a pickup in digital traffic.
and we've just launched our new app, and we've started this faster service and so on. so we've seen the digital traffic go up. so i'm predicting that -- to me that we're going to see some stability on those store traffic, people started to get to a new pattern over here. i don't know how thanksgiving changes that, robbie, but i hope that gives you some color.

good morning, everyone. great quarter. if you could comment a little bit on how your prepared foods business evolved during the quarter as some of these new -- excuse me, the old sections of fresh, reopen, and also your progress in meal solutions, please?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. chuck, we were very cautious as we brought those back in, and we saw different take rates in different markets on salad bars, hot bars and such. and the general sense i get now is that customers are back on the fresh side of the store, on the self-service side of the store, and certainly, you could see that in most markets. and then on the meals program, we are excited about what we're doing.
it's a very difficult thing to pull off to develop the meals in store, manage and keep the shrink down, yet keep the offer really fresh. it's a difficult thing to do, and i'm delighted that the team seems to have cracked the code on that, and we've launched it in about four markets already. our plan is to continue to drive that through. chuck, the crazy thing is that the biggest challenge there is equipment.

melissa plaisance -- group vice president, treasury and investor relations
good morning, and thank you for joining us for the albertsons companies' second-quarter 2021 and earnings conference vall. with me today from the company are vivek sankaran, our ceo; and sharon mccollam, our new president and cfo. today, vivek will share insights into our second-quarter results as well as review our progress against our strategic priorities. sharon will then go into the financial details of our second quarter as well as our updated full-year 2021 outlook before handing it back over to vivek for some closing remarks.

vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
thanks, melissa. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. before we get started, i would like to introduce sharon mccollam to any of you that do not know her in a new role as president and cfo at albertsons companies. she will lead all areas of finance, it, real estate, strategy, corporate development and supply chain.
as many of you know, sharon officially joined us on september 7, and now has just over six weeks under her belt. she came out of retirement to join us on our transformation journey, and her prior experience at best buy and with the digital transformation of william sonoma will help us as we move forward. we are very excited that she has joined our team, and i look forward to working with her to accelerate our transformation. we also want to congratulate bob diamond on his retirement and thank him for his seven years of service with albertsons and especially for his contributions to our successful ipo last year.
let me now turn to our second-quarter results. i'm pleased to report that our results for the quarter exceeded our internal plans across all key metrics, increasing our confidence in the business going forward. our id sales increased 1.5% in q2 and 15.3% on a two-year stack basis. we continue to gain market share in food on a one and two-year basis.
and in mulo, we are up on a two-year basis and down only slightly on a one-year basis. in addition, we achieved adjusted ebitda of $965 million and adjusted eps of $0.64 per share ahead of our expectations. again, this quarter, against a backdrop of digital sales growth exceeding 200% in every quarter of 2020, the benefits of our digital and omnichannel investments continue to resonate with our customers. in the quarter, digital sales increased 5% year over year and increased 248% on a two-year stack basis.
our drive up & go and home delivery capabilities, reaching 95% of our customers increased omnichannel households by over four times versus q2 2019 and retention has been strong. omnichannel household growth is a key initiative as these customers spend three times more than any in-store-only shopper. we also continued to drive year-over-year growth in identified households, another key initiative that is foundational to better understanding our customers through data analytics and allowing us to improve our offerings to drive recurring and incremental spend. in our just for u loyalty program, ongoing benefit enhancements continue to accelerate membership growth, which increased 17% year over year to 27.5 million members.
within the program, the number of actively engaged members increased by almost 9%. actively engaged members are those that are redeeming rewards such as fuel or grocery rewards in the current quarter. in addition, we had a 93% retention rate with actively engaged members in q2. remember that actively engaged members spend approximately four times more with us.
we also saw better-than-expected in-store results as traffic in our stores continue to increase versus q2 2020. we believe the increased traffic is being driven by our ongoing efforts to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities and the higher vaccination rates that are helping customers become more comfortable in returning to stores. these results reflect the momentum we are seeing through the execution of our transformation strategy across all channels. the consumer backdrop remains strong throughout the quarter.
i will now take a few minutes to walk through the pillars of our transformation strategy that helped drive these results and provide you with an update on our progress. these pillars include in-store excellence, accelerating our digital and omnichannel capabilities, increasing productivity and strengthening our talent and culture. in-store excellence has been elevated by providing the right assortment in each local market using digital tools to enhance replenishment and in-stock conditions, encouraging friendly customer service and enhancing speed and ease of checkout through frictionless and contactless payments. i will briefly touch on recent progress on two elements of our assortment, fresh and own brands.
in fresh, our efforts to differentiate our offerings have generated elevated demand with fresh growth outpacing center store by approximately 250 basis points year over year. sales in each of our fresh categories remain ahead of pre-pandemic levels as customers continue to consume more meals at home. in own brands, the introduction of new products as well as the rollout of own brands into albertsons legacy divisions has generated strong growth. our q2 sales penetration was 25.2%, up approximately 60 basis points from q2 '20.
during the quarter, we launched 85 new products, including ready-to-eat meals, refrigerated signature reserve pastas and several o organics coffee items. year to date, we have launched over 400 new own brands items and are on track to reach our goal of launching over 800 items this fiscal year. finally, we continue to invest in stores. through the first half of the year, we opened seven new stores and completed 76 upgrade and remodel projects.
our next priority is the acceleration of our digital and omnichannel capabilities. digital transformation is an imperative in our growth strategy, as we aim to provide an array of convenient shopping experience for our customers. to this end, we have expanded our drive up & go locations to over 1,900 and expect to reach approximately 2,000 locations by year-end. underlying the rollout of our digital and omnichannel capabilities is our focus on delivering a superior customer experience as well as improving profitability over time.
for example, in drive up & go, our average wait time for pickup is now down to three minutes. in delivery, we continue to speed up delivery times while reducing delivery cost per order by expanding our third-party delivery store network, and we added doordash one-hour delivery to all divisions with a catalog of 40,000-plus products. and we also announced doubledash allowing customers to combine delivery of a restaurant meal and a grocery delivery in one trip. in micro fulfillment centers, we are improving our productivity in our three existing mfcs, and we have plans for an additional four mfcs before the end of our fiscal year, bringing the total to 7.
this is two less than previously estimated as the launch of two locations has moved into fiscal-year '22, primarily as a result of delays in construction. in loyalty, our integrated loyalty and e-commerce app is now fully rolled out and offers a connected customer experience with redesigned rewards and other new features. to partially offset all of these investments and cost inflation, our third priority is driving productivity. during the quarter, we continued to eliminate waste and improve efficiencies to enhance promotional effectiveness, reductions in indirect spend, labor efficiencies and ongoing efforts to reduce shrink.
we continue to expect to achieve the targeted $1.5 billion in annual gross savings by the end of fiscal-year 2022. our fourth priority is strengthening our talent and culture and supporting the communities we serve. we continue to add talent throughout the company at both the corporate and division level, including the recent appointment of sharon, our outreach through job fairs for retail and distribution employees and the training we have put in place to assist in the success of our new employees and enhance retention. our pharmacy team continues to serve our communities with an array of services, including the covid and flu vaccines.
to date, the pharmacy team has administered over 7.5 million covid vaccine doses. in support of our associates that were impacted and the communities we serve, the albertsons companies donated $500,000 to help provide food to those impacted by hurricane ida and the california wildfires. we also continue to take actions related to esg and sustainability. we recently published our fiscal 2020 esg report, which is available on our company website.
as the next step from our recently refreshed materiality assessment, we will soon release a comprehensive set of goals in areas, including climate action, diversity, equity and inclusion, waste reduction and circularity, and community stewardship. and now i will turn to sharon to provide remarks and cover the details of our second-quarter financial results and outlook.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, vivek, and hello, everyone. i'm thrilled to be here today and couldn't be more excited to have joined this team at such a transformative time in the company's history. what i have found to be the most impressive since joining is the disciplined approach that the company is taking to leveraging the favorable backdrop that the industry is seeing today while at the same time, remaining deeply focused on the strategic priorities that vivek just covered and are foundational to advancing the transformations longer term. consistent with these priorities, where i am currently spending the majority of my time is in the acceleration of our digital and technology initiatives, the strengthening of our omnichannel capabilities and the advancement of our productivity agenda, including identifying opportunities to further rationalize our cost structure, particularly in the technological enablement of our supply chains and our stores.
i look forward to discussing all of these topics further, both today and in our meetings to come. but now we'll turn to the details of our second-quarter results and provide an update on our fiscal '21 outlook. as vivek said earlier, we were extremely pleased with our sales trends as we delivered q2 2021 identical sales growth of 1.5% on top of 13.8% growth in q2 2020 for a two-year stack of 15.3%. total sales in q2 2021 were $16.5 billion compared to $15.8 billion last year and $14.2 billion in q2 2019.
gross profit margin was 28.6% in q2 2021 compared to 29% in q2 2020 and 27.8% in q2 2019. excluding the impact of fuel however, our gross profit margin was flat compared to q2 2020 as higher products, supply chain, and advertising costs were offset by productivity initiatives, favorable product mix and pharmacy margins related to covid-19 vaccine. compared to q2 2019, gross margin increased 85 basis points, primarily driven by improvements in our productivity, shrink expense, sales leverage, and improved pharmacy margins related to covid-19 vaccines, partially offset by investments related to our growth in digital sales. selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 25.6% during the second quarter of fiscal '21 compared to 25.6% in q2 2020 and 26.8% in q2 2019.
excluding the impact of fuel, selling, and administrative expenses increased 55 basis points year over year. this increase was primarily driven by higher employee costs, appreciations, and expenses related to the acceleration of our digital and omnichannel capabilities and other strategic priorities. these increases were partially offset by lower covid-19-related expenses. as it relates to the year-over-year increase in employee costs, labor related to the reopening of certain fresh departments such as deli, bakery and prepared foods, market-driven wage rate increases, and higher equity-based compensation expense contributed to this increase.
on a two-year basis, our selling and administrative expenses were down 120 basis points versus q2 2019. this decrease was driven by strong sales leverage, partially offset by higher employee costs and expenses related to investments in our omnichannel and digital capabilities and other strategic priorities. as a result of opportunistic refinancing transactions as well as continued debt reduction q2 2021 interest expense decreased by $20 million to $109 million versus q2 2020. adjusted ebitda was $965 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $948 million in q2 2020.
this increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to increased sales, partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs. adjusted net income in q2 '21 was $370 million or $0.64 per fully diluted share compared to $356 million or $0.60 per fully diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. i would now like to discuss free cash flow and capital allocation. during the second quarter and year to date, we have generated significant free cash flow driven by better-than-expected operating results as well as lower working capital.
from an investment perspective, capital expenditures year to date were approximately $823 million as we continue to invest in our digital and technology platforms, completed 76 remodels and opened seven stores. for the year, we continue to expect capital spending in the range of approximately $1.9 billion to $2 billion. regarding debt reduction, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we provided notice of redemption of the remaining $200 million of albertsons 5.75% unsecured notes, due in 2025, which will save us $11.5 million per annum in interest expense going forward. and finally, in regards to returning cash to shareholders, we announced today a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.10 to $0.12 per share based on our confidence in future cash flow generation and our strong operating performance.
i will now turn to our updated outlook for fiscal-year 2021. given the outperformance in q2 and recent trends, we have updated and raised our guidance for fiscal-year 2021. we now expect identical sales in fiscal 2021 in the range of negative 2.5% to 3.5% compared to prior guidance of negative 5% to 6%, representing an updated two-year stacked id range of 13.4% to 14.4% compared to prior guidance of 10.9% to 11.9%. we expect adjusted eps in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, up $0.30 from our previous guidance range.
we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion, up $250 million from our previous guidance range. we also expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24% compared to 25% previously. i will now turn the call back over to vivek for some closing remarks.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
thank you, sharon. in summary, i would like to reinforce a few messages. our omnichannel strategy is working with our customers. we're adding customers to our franchise.
they're spending more with us and engaging in more ways with us. we continue to gain market share in dollars and units, and our trends improved with each successive period in the quarter, and especially around holidays. our digital initiatives continue to drive engagement and growth. we remain focused on elevating service, quality and speed.
our productivity initiatives are delivering, strengthening the middle of our p&l. we're also navigating the uncertainties of the times: inflation, product supply, labor challenges to name a few, with agility and creativity. our strong performance year to date and continuing positive trends give us the confidence to raise our full-year 2021 outlook for the id sales, adjusted ebitda and eps. while we celebrate progress, we remind ourselves that we are still in the early innings of our transformation with significantly more potential to capture.
finally, none of this would be possible without the efforts of our 285,000 associates, who take care of our customers and the communities we serve day in and day out. i want to thank each and every one of them for their contributions to our ongoing success. we will now take your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of john heinbockel with guggenheim. please proceed with your question.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
yes. let me start with the market share on the mulo side, right? so that's a shift relatively recently. so when did that occur? how broad-based is that? and what do you think is driving that? is that share gains from restaurants that have accelerated because of covid or for any other reason?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
john, vivek here. so on the market share, you're right. we saw unit share going up and dollar share going up over mulo in q3. and it's a trend that -- it will be the first most negative in q1, better in q2 and then positive in q3 and on a year-on-year basis.
because first is, if you think about the lapse, the lapse were much more difficult in q1 and q2. and what i'll point to in q3 that i am most excited about is our retention rates of customers. they're going steadily up overall from q2 -- q1 to q2 to q3. and as we told you guys before, it's something we put a lot of energy into, the increasing the loyalty base that we have, connecting them more with the pharmacy and connecting them more with e-commerce, and we are seeing that retention.
and i think the fresh portfolio is also playing to our advantage, because you're seeing people eating at home. and our fresh is growing faster than the rest of store.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok. and maybe secondly, right, if you think about -- i don't know what work you've been able to do around wallet share, right, in your -- i don't know if your top decile through the lowest one. but where do you think your wallet share is even with your best customers? and where is the biggest opportunity in '22 among your cohorts?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
john, the wallet share is highest with our top tier of our loyal group, right? so -- and we find that once they engage in our loyalty program, you see that. the second thing that's very promising for us is we gain massive wallet share when people engage with us in omnichannel. and we can see that because there's no reason for a household to suddenly start spending three times, four times, with us than they did before they engaged in omnichannel. and so we still think that that's the upside.
one is keep pushing people up on the loyalty ladder, which we're doing because of the retention; and second, continuing to engage people in omnichannel. and both of those, as you know, we've got plenty of headroom.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok. thank you.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
thanks, john.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of simeon gutman with morgan stanley. please proceed with your question.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone, and nice quarter. my question is on inflation. can you give us some color around volume and price? and then can you talk about the dynamic that's changing? i think sharon mentioned a little more inflationary cost pressure.
is it that the rate of product cost inflation is just overwhelming and you can't pass it through? or are you resisting to pass through because the market dynamics are changing?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
hey, simeon. good morning. here's how i -- let me just provide some context on inflation. first, the cost increases are real, right? we are seeing it in our supply base.
i think they're seeing it in ingredients, packaging, transportation, labor, and we are seeing it in our own business when you think about even our own brands program and such. so the cost inflation is absolutely real. when we think about what we are passing through, the net-net, we have passed through -- the inflation, we have passed through is less than the inflation we've incurred, right? and the way we do that is to make sure that we are judicious about the categories where we pass it through. we don't pass through as much on the essential categories that customers need every day.
and we try to balance that out. now when it comes to unit volume, if you -- our unit volume -- unit share certainly has gone up. but as inflation goes up, you don't see the same degree of unit growth, but it's stable. i'll characterize what we've seen over the last several weeks as very stable in terms of total consumption.
and we just hope that as this -- as the year goes through, right, as the calendar year goes through, this inflation remains at this level, stabilizes. and then hopefully, we get something better in the second half.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
fair enough. my follow-up is a separate -- sorry.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
one sec. sharon, go ahead.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. i would just add one thing to that. we also, simeon, are competing with a very broad set of competitors every day in the market where we compete. we've got the grocery stores, we've got vast merchants, we've got dollar stores, discounted online players, you name it.
so because of that, we have to stay competitive every day to win and retain our customers. so when we think about pass-through, we also have to be very focused on the competitive environment.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
my follow-up is on a separate topic, just the labor inflation. can you just give us a sense or just paint the picture. does the supermarket wages, because of unionization, does that lag where the overall market be? or are you ahead of the curve as far as reacting to state, local and minimum wages?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes, simeon, i think the way to think of it is we incur -- we are incurring more overtime, right? the way we manage it to incur more overtime because of shortages in labor. and then in markets where we don't have necessarily -- in certain markets, we just have to raise the price to get people in, because different markets are different from a competitiveness standpoint. but in general, what you'll find is that we are paying a higher wage level than the -- of the market. and therefore, it gives us a bit of a cushion.
to what extent it lags, it depends on when the contracts and others come up. but we have gone through a few contracts, and we've got some very good settlements quite recently with the union.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of edward kelly with wells fargo. please proceed with your question.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. good morning, everybody. i want to just start by following up on the inflation topic. can you just maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a customer reception currently? and then if we were to look out from here, we are hearing more vendors talk about additional price increases from here.
you can see ppi is well ahead of cpi still. but yet on the consumer front, right, we do have government stimulus rolling off, tax credit stop in january. stat payments are coming down. just curious as to how you are thinking about consumer reaction, the price increases from here to remaining price takers.
how does this dynamic play out? and are you concerned at all from a margin standpoint incrementally?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
ed, let me provide what we know. i mean this is the big question, right? how will the consumer react going forward? as of now, what we are seeing trends, even recently, is that we have a strong consumer. and we haven't seen a dramatic change in their pattern of consumption, still engaging on fresh product and still engaging overall in the store. now what we don't know is if inflation continues to go up, does that behavior change as we go through the calendar 2022? we don't know that.
but if the consumer remains strong, we just -- because they're eating more at home, we think they'll continue to engage with us. what we also don't know is what the reaction will be in the case of a reduction in snap. we don't know those. so the things that we are doing is doing what we can to control things we control, which is internal, right? one is driving retention of customers.
and we are continuing to do that and improving at that. and two is doing all those things. i've always called it margin tailwinds, whether it's mix management, shrink management, the cogs program that we started in late last -- december of last year -- i mean, december 2020, the supply chain initiatives. we've got a lot of different initiatives that are all gross margin tailwinds that continue to provide that cushion in case we need to compete differently for the customer.
so that's how we play it, and there's things we control that we focus down -- focus on pretty hard.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and then just one quick follow-up. your capex this year is coming in, i guess, just slightly below where you initially guided the year. but can you help us in terms of how you're thinking about next year and beyond? sharon, you've talked about investment.
what levels of capex do you think that we may end up seeing here? and maybe refresh us on the priorities on that.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
absolutely. in 2022, my expectation is that what we were not able to receive it this year, because of constraints, we will carry that over into 2022. so that $100 million that we had to wiggle on the guidance for 2021 will carry into 2022. and then when we look at 2022, i would expect that the capex is going to be in the low $2 billion range.
we're not giving guidance on 2022. i'm not giving an outlook for 2022. but i know that this is a very important question, especially in light of my joining the company. so that's where we're thinking about it at this point.
and we'll, of course, give you a bigger update later. but remember, we will carry over into 2022 on top of the 2022 plan. the areas that we will be continuing to invest in are the areas you would expect. acceleration of digital and omnichannel is a top priority, investments in the digital support for our loyalty programs.
vivek spoke earlier about the rmn, the albertsons media collective, we'll be investing behind that in 2022. then, of course, in the supply chain, that will be another area that we will continue to be working on various forms of acceleration of productivity in that space. we'll also be investing in additional productivity initiatives. i know the question will come up today, and i'll just speak to it here, ed, just to preview it.
but on productivity, as vivek mentioned in his comments, we're making great progress on the productivity initiatives that we announced. we have started a full court press on the next generation of productivity initiatives that we'll be working on in 2020, starting in 2022, and moving those into 2023 and 2024, and that's shaping up very nicely. i'll give you more color to that, but feeling very strong about the possibilities in additional productivity to offset some of the headwinds in 2023 and 2024. remember, we still have the productivity initiatives coming in under the $1.5 billion program.
but we'll definitely be announcing something above and beyond that.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of rupesh parikh with oppenheimer. please proceed with your question.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. so my first question has to do with the trends. if you can maybe provide color in terms of the monthly trends during the quarter and then any color on quarter-to-date trends as well.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes, rupesh, the customer is still strong. our trends remain strong, very good start to the quarter, rupesh, is what i can tell you. and more recently, with omicron, i think you're seeing people eating more at home again, and we're all -- so the trends remain very positive from a top line.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok. great. and my follow-up question is as we look toward 2022, i know you guys can't provide any specific guidance today, but is there any general thoughts on your ability to lap over this higher base next year?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. the initiatives we are rolling, i mean, the -- let me frame it this way, rupesh. when we were talking -- let's say, imagine the january call of 2020. we had an e-commerce business that was -- i think dug was in like 150 or 200 stores, something like that, ok? and so if you -- and we were just launching so many of our different initiatives.
if you look at us today, we have a base, we have a base business in e-commerce that's covering -- like we said, 96% is covered with dug, 80% with two-hour dug. we have a new app in place. we have an integrated app with the loyalty program and everything in place. we have 28 million members in our loyalty program.
so we just feel we've got a great foundation now to accelerate those things that are about relationship building and stickiness. that's what we are focusing on. and so when sharon mentioned earlier, investments in digital and such, now it's about driving scale because we've got a great foundation. in addition, we've got programs like the meals program that we'll roll out in 2022, more broadly across our network.
that gives us additional growth as people stay at home. so look at us to accelerate the foundation that we've built across many different fronts over the last few years.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ken goldman with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thanks so much. i wanted to ask a quick follow-up to ed kelly's question. he had mentioned snap.
you had talked about some uncertainty or, at least, you don't really know what the reaction will be from the consumer. are there any early learnings that you have? there are some states where snap, i guess, benefits to the consumer. the dollars received by the consumer have pulled back from the peak. i don't know if you've done any analysis on that or if there's anything you can tell us on that.
i know it's very early, so maybe not. but anything you can see early on that might enlighten us on what the trends might be?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
actually, we haven't seen it, right? and that's the -- so the -- if you look at -- if you -- you should have expected some changes in december, we have not seen that. we still see a strong consumer. we still see -- but there's noise, right? december has also had omicron. and so i wish i could give you an indication, but nothing yet in the numbers for us.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. and then i wanted to ask, we're starting to see -- this is very anecdotal, but some out of stocks across a lot of different categories in supermarkets. how much is that starting to hurt you as you don't necessarily get full truckloads or no truckloads as maybe some of your labor isn't quite as available? is it something probably short term, but are there any departments that you're seeing that in? i just wanted to get a little bit better color on what might be or might not be an out-of-stock situation.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
so let's talk about out of stocks, right? so we have been in a -- we've been -- had a sustained several months of out of stocks in several categories. and i think as a business, we've all learned to manage it. we've all learned to make sure that the stores are still very presentable, give the consumers as much choice as we can get. and we were expecting that supply issues to get more resolved as we go into this period right now.
omicron has put a bit of a dent on that. so there are more supply challenges, and we would expect more supply challenges over the next four to six weeks. but that said, we don't have supply issues that are constraining our business any differently than we did before, right? i think we're managing it. here's the other side of the coin.
the debate we've all -- in the past, we had all said with this degree of supply constraint, there is untapped growth, and we believe that still. we still believe that when supply comes back, there clearly is more growth. on the one hand, you could argue that the customer has probably settled in with a certain pattern of consumption, but it's not zero, right? it's not zero unmet potential. and so we are hoping that part of 2022, as supply comes back, we'll also see growth in some of the categories, especially ones that are more expandable consumption.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you very much. makes sense.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of michael montani with evercore isi. please proceed with your question.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
hi, michael.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
congrats on the quarter. so just to add two areas i wanted to hit on quickly. one was just from a food inflation perspective. if we see kind of food at home roughly 5% to 6% in the quarter, is that kind of the way to think about that? and wondering if you could share any rough estimates of how much the vaccine and booster shots might have contributed to the comp as well.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. michael, i think that you're right, the inflation -- i think cpi inflation was 5.4% or something else. it was just a tad higher than that. now we expect that inflation number to be slightly higher going into the next quarter, right? january, february, march, we expect the inflation to take a bit higher.
and then at least in our assumptions that the inflation will continue till it laps itself. and then we'll hopefully, it gets to a more moderate type of inflation, the normal kind of inflation going forward. that's how we have thought about it. michael, what is your second question again?
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
it's just related to the vaccine that you all have been administering, because you had mentioned in the press release that there was, obviously, a tailwind to id sales from both inflation, but then also the vaccine and booster shots.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. yes, michael, we had -- we've dispensed 11 million vaccines to date, probably one of the highest on a per store basis in the -- from a pharmacy standpoint, 3 million in the quarter. and so that definitely contributes to id sales and gross profit. and that's another consideration we should all be thinking about and we are modeling as we think about the future.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. and then switching gears a little bit just to the margin front. just wanted to check in, vivek, and still see that things are rational in your view, if that's still the case? and also on the central procurement, if you could give us a feeling for how that initiative, in particular, is evolving and how to think about the build there into the fourth quarter?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes, michael, let me talk about the promotion environment first. and i think it is still -- the pricing environment is very rational. here is what i believe will be dramatically different as the world goes back into promotions in the future, and i don't know when that is. but when we all go back into it, we are all more technology-enabled.
we have more data. we have more analytics. we have more precision. we can be more surgical.
and you're going to see the sector coming back that way, in my opinion, focusing on quality rather than quantity of promotions. so that's how i see that. from the initiatives that we talked about, which we had launched to consolidate our buying, it's going extremely well. the biggest reason being it just makes things simpler for a supplier, right? and we act as one entity, and that program is going really well, both from a monetary standpoint, but also from an organizational and culture standpoint.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
and, michael, remember that we are introducing that program on a category-by-category basis so we are seeing benefits. we saw them in the third quarter. we'll see benefit again in the fourth quarter, but that we're rolling it by category. so we -- this will also be a tailwind into 2022 in a substantial way.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. thank you for the update, and good luck.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
thanks, michael.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of paul lejuez with citi. please proceed with your question.
brandon cheatham -- citi -- analyst
hey, everyone. this is brandon cheatham on for paul. wanted to follow up on michael's question around the covid vaccines. just want to see if you wanted to quantify the benefit there on both id sales and gross margin.
and then what is baked into your 4q guidance from the vaccine?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
on the -- we have not quantified the amount of revenue coming from the covid-19 vaccine, and we won't be quantifying that, of course. that's very competitive. but from a q4 perspective, we do anticipate revenues being in line with where they were in q3. and of course, it's hard to know what will happen with boosters going into 2022.
i think we're going to get a lot more visibility to that. certainly, the boosters are proving to be very good for the population and for the people. so we'll see how that plays out going into 2022. and we'll know a lot more, i think, during the fourth quarter.
brandon cheatham -- citi -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then i know it's early days on the retail media initiatives. i was just wondering if you could share any learnings there from november.
and then follow-up to that, i mean what percentage of purchases are completed with the loyalty card? and how has that changed over time? thank you.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. bryan, one, on the retail media initiative. we're launching it officially at the end of february. so we'll share more with you as we get into the next call.
and we're excited about it because we've built it ground up, so that it will appeal to the chief marketing officer of a company, right? so that's the spirit of that, and we'll come back to you on that. now can you just -- bryan, what was your second question again?
brandon cheatham -- citi -- analyst
the percentage of purchases that are completed with a loyalty card.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. substantial, bryan. it's a substantial portion of it is completed within our loyalty program. remember that if you think of our business in two ways, one is sales we can identify with an identifier, which is the majority of our business; and then sales that are on our loyalty card.
so it's a substantial portion of the business. and as the -- as that increases, we get even more through into it.
brandon cheatham -- citi -- analyst
got it. thank you. thank you both.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of robby ohmes with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
robby ohmes -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. great quarter. just two quick follow-ups.
first, i think the guidance implies around like a 2% id for the fourth quarter. the decel is that -- what's in that decel? it sounds like you think inflation is going to maybe be as high, if not higher for you guys in the fourth quarter versus 3q? and is it you expect less vaccines? or is it just maybe conservative given that you've had a strong start? and then maybe the second, i don't know if, vivek or sharon, you can give a little more commentary on just what you think might happen with supply chain. could it ease as you move through calendar 2022? and could those in-stock levels get back to normal for the industry, you think? thanks.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. i will take those. i'm going to break it down. your first question was, as you look at the guidance for the fourth quarter and you back into the id sales in the range of somewhere between on average 3% to 4.5%, why is it less than q3 at 5.2%? and i would tell you that the question that was asked earlier around government support and all of these questions around what is the consumer going to do as these programs start tailing off is one consideration that we put in there, while we have not seen that.
and quarter to date, we're running better than that outlook. we are being thoughtful about the balance of the quarter at this point in time. so that's how to think about that. we do expect, as i said earlier, for our vaccinations to continue in our stores, and quite frankly, are doing everything we can to promote it.
we are trying to be there. we -- vivek said, we have administered 11 million vaccines. when you look at other retailers who have substantially more stores than we do, they are not near those numbers. this has been a major initiative for us, not only from a business perspective, but also from a social perspective.
and we are continuing to promote that in our stores. and i want to point out that when we engage with customers in this way, it deepens their engagement with the brand. this also sets us up into 2022 because as we have pharmacy customers that are coming into our stores, and we are serving them in these ways, it is definitely and we can measure improved engagement and higher customer lifetime value. so participating in this program is socially the right thing to do, but it has also been very beneficial to the overall business.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. and, robby, if i can address the supply chain question. so here's what -- at least, we had imagined just having talked to the supply base. many of them, if you think about what happened through 2020 and '21, were building up capacity.
and a lot of that capacity should be coming on just about now, right? it takes 12 to 18 months to build it up. and so we were expecting a lot of that to come into the market. but i think with omicron, you have the physical. you have the steel in the ground, but you now have call-offs on labor.
and i think that's creating this challenge. and that's why what i expect would happen is that as we get past omicron, we are able to see more of that capacity coming into the market.
robby ohmes -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's really helpful. thanks so much.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
-- robby.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of scott mushkin with r5 capital. please proceed with your question.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
hey. thanks, guys. thanks for taking my questions. so the first one is around the equity action.
and i know management sometimes hesitate on this. but clearly, the performance last year was strong. but also you look at the valuation gap through your largest competitor, it's fairly substantial. so i think as you look at it as a management team and enhancing shareholder value, how should we think about it, especially because you are sitting on a pretty big chunk of cash on the balance sheet that's it's growing? so what do you think you guys could do to enhance shareholder value further?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
scott, thank you. i believe that we need to continue to execute, gain market share, drive the business, deliver on our productivity initiatives. and that's the foundation, right, for creating value. a long-term sustainable performance creates value.
the second, now we'll talk about the balance sheet. we are carrying more cash than we carried in the past. as you know, we have a lot of exciting initiatives that we are investing in right now. we can start with accelerating digital and omnichannel.
we can talk about the digital marketing platform that we're investing in. we can talk about the technology, the supply chain. so i mentioned that we will continue to invest in the growth drivers of the business. as you know, during the quarter, we retired some debt.
we'll continue to also retire debt where it makes sense or refinance debt where it makes sense. and then we are continuing, of course, to pay our dividend. we've put out over $50 million this quarter. we're up to $149 million.
and we'll continue to look at it, scott. we completely hear the question, and we are constantly looking at returning cash and returning other things to our -- shareholders' value to our shareholders. so more to come on that, and we'll give you more of an outlook on that in 2022.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
that's perfect. and so, vivek, i kind of asked something similar last quarter. but obviously, you're just having a blowout year this year. but as you guys think about your planning, which i'm sure you're doing for next year and the years to come, is your expectation as a ceo that ebitda should grow just naturally, even if the year was good? or kind of philosophically, how do you approach the planning process? and what your expectations are for your management team?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. i mean, i'm not giving guidance, scott, but our philosophy is always finding tailwinds for the gross margin, which we've talked about, and we've talked about initiatives there. and then finding ways to drive more productivity below that gross margin line. and sharon told you that we are working on our next tranche of productivity there.
so -- and then if you grow the top line and you do that, those two things i just talked about by definition, you're getting leverage in the business. that's the principle with which we've done this business. and we'll come back to you guys with more on how we think about '22 later in the year.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
hey. perfect, guys. thank you for taking my questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of karen short with barclays. please proceed with your question.
karen short -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
hi. thanks very much. maybe just following up on that a little bit. i wanted to just talk -- if you -- see if you could talk contextually about puts and takes a little bit to gross margin and sg&a in 2022.
and i think maybe more focusing on gross margin because when you think about gross margin this year and into next year, you will have inflation pressures. you'll have supply chain pressures. you will likely be lapping some vaccine benefits depending on what happens with boosters, but -- so those would be your headwinds and then your productivity initiatives. and i've seen private label penetration would be a tailwind.
so i guess i would ask a little more on the gross margin front. do you think you can expand gross margins ex fuel in '22?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. karen, we are not going to give an outlook for 2022 today. i will just say that we do believe that there are going to be puts and takes exactly like you described them in 2022. we do think that inflation is not over in our estimation and based on what we're hearing from the suppliers.
so we think there's going to be continued inflation flowing into 2022, at least, probably through the first half. and then obviously, we will be, at some point, lapping vaccination, assuming that this does not continue. the great news for us is that as vivek mentioned earlier, the winning model, the work that we're doing on the consolidation of procurement is going extremely well. and we are working very well with our vendors.
and i think that's one area where we see tailwind coming into 2022. we also have our other productivity initiatives that will be flowing in there. as you pointed out, we're making good progress now in own brands. supply will be always a little bit tricky, but we are feeling very good about where we're growing in own brands.
so those will be additional tailwinds for 2022. and then the question is, of course, what -- where will the puts and takes happen on the top line. so we'll talk more about it at the end of q4, but the ones that you summarized, i absolutely agree with, and those are the puts and takes we're considering.
karen short -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then just on -- obviously, sharon, you gave the actual comp in the quarter to date or the range for 4q. and you said you were running better than the 3% to 4%.
but specific to snap, are you seeing -- clearly, you've seen reductions in snap penetration already start, i would assume. so i guess what i'm wondering is, could you give what your actual penetration is in snap as a percent of sales? and then how you're thinking about that in 2022 -- or currently and then into '22?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. karen, we haven't given that, but there's a consideration that, i think, has to be put on the table when you're talking about snap, and it's something that we've learned in our analytics here, is that when you have a snap customer, when they have more snap, that means they spend less of their own money, but that doesn't mean necessarily in total that they will spend more. so it's almost a mix shift in tender. and what we're very focused on right now is those analytics and trying to understand that customer.
i will also say that we have made it a top priority this entire year on retention of customers. just for u, special promotions for all the new customers, learning them, finding what inspires them, digitally talking to them. we can talk about -- i could give you personal advertising, video, social media influencer. i mean we have taken the gamut to engage with these customers.
and we are working very, very hard where we have gained these customers to continue to keep them. as vivek said, we are seeing some of the highest retention numbers we've seen. and so just when you think about it, everyone talks about snap as it goes away, but i think we also have to be discussing tender shift.
karen short -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
right. no. i agree with that 100%. i just was curious if you could also give a number, but thanks for that.
that's helpful.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks. two quick questions. one is i was hoping to get a little more clarity on what you were saying about gross margin in fourth quarter, vivek.
it sounded like you're expecting inflation to accelerate. your gross margins have been very steady throughout the year. so are you saying that gross margins can remain steady in fourth quarter? or do you think there's a little more pressure? and then secondarily, on own brands, our nielsen data shows that private label trailed overall grocery throughout 2021. do you need to take extra steps in 2022 for your own brands to merchandise them more aggressively? or do you expect the consumer just to behave differently in 2022 with respect to own brands? how do you think about it?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
sharon, do you want to address the gross margin? yes. thanks.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. i'd be happy to. when you guys think about q4, within the ranges of guidance, i think you should think about it very much in context of q3. we're expecting the quarters to look very similar.
and vivek, i'll just turn to you to take the own brands.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. rob, the first thing, our own brands penetration, if you look at it, is back to where it used to be pre-pandemic, which we like, right? and so -- and to me, there's been, one, a matter of getting stability in supply; and then we continue to introduce a whole bunch of new products. so when we think about our own brands program, we see a lot of potential. and the potential will only be constrained by supply, not consumer uptake, not the innovation, not the merchandising, not what we do on online, because all of those are completely in our control.
and so my sense, when i talk about supply stabilizing earlier, it's not only going to stabilize, i think, for our branded products, but certainly for us, too, as we go forward.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. are your own brands sales -- maybe you provided this, are they growing as fast as your overall store or faster? because you say that they're back to pre-pandemic levels?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
the penetration is back to pre-pandemic levels, right? so it's going slightly faster to catch up with it over this year.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
right. ok. thank you.

welcome to the albertsons companies third quarter 2021 earnings conference call, and thank you for standing by. [operator instructions] this call is being recorded. i would like to hand the call over to melissa plaisance, senior vice president, investor relations, treasury, and risk management. please go ahead.
melissa plaisance -- senior vice president, investor relations, rreasury, and risk management
good morning, and thank you for joining us for the albertsons companies' third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. with me today from the company are vivek sankaran, our ceo; and sharon mccollam, our president and cfo. today, vivek will share insights into our third-quarter results as well as review our progress against our strategic priorities. sharon will then go into the financial details of our third quarter as well as updated full year 2021 outlook, before handing it back over to vivek for some closing remarks.

vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
thanks, melissa. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. before we begin, we want to thank our retail, distribution center, and manufacturing teams for their commitment to safety and passion for serving our customers even as covid-19 cases continue to rise once again. we also want to thank our pharmacy teams who have administered 11 million covid-19 vaccines, including approximately 3 million in quarter 3.
sharon will talk more later about our updated expectations in light of covid-19's developments, continued inflationary pressures, and momentum in our business. but before she does, let me share with you some details from our third quarter. in q3 '21, id sales increased 5.2% and 17.5% on a two-year stacked basis. we also gained unit and dollar market share in food and mulo on both a one- and two-year basis.
in addition, we delivered adjusted ebitda dollars of $1.05 billion and adjusted eps of $0.79 per share, well ahead of our expectations. also during the quarter, we continue to see the benefits from our digital and omnichannel investments, including the ongoing expansion of drive up & go and the opening of our first midwest micro-fulfillment center. q3 '21 digital sales increased 9% year over year and 234% on a two-year stacked basis. omnichannel households decreased by four times versus q3 '19, and sales retention remained strong.
as omnichannel's households spend three times more than in-store-only shoppers, we continue to increase our investments in digital omnichannel and loyalty, which drove increased identified households and higher customer engagement and retention. in the just for u loyalty program, ongoing benefit enhancements continued to accelerate membership growth, which increased 17% year over year to 28 million members, and actively engaged members continued to increase. actively engaged members are defined as those that are redeeming fuel or grocery rewards and, on average, spend four times more than nonactive members. in addition, the retention rate of actively engaged members continues to be over 93%.
collectively, these results demonstrate the momentum being driven by our transformation strategy and the benefits of a strong consumer backdrop. i will now update you on our progress within the four key elements of this strategy: driving in-store excellence; accelerating our digital and omnichannel capabilities; increasing productivity; and strengthening our talent and culture. driving in-store excellence anchors everything else we do, and our commitment to enhancing our customers' experience continues to drive innovation and transformation. this year, as customers consume more meals at home, elevating our fresh offerings and introducing new technologies were a top priority.
to this end, we have been automating production planning and simplifying tasks in our fresh departments, resulting in better quality, higher in stocks and more time for customer interactions. these actions are continuing to drive better-than-expected results in fresh. and during the third quarter, fresh id sales outpaced center store by 500 basis points year over year and over 400 basis points versus two years ago. we're also providing mobile tablets to store management to review daily sales, schematics, orders and provide associate training.
this allows store management to spend more time on the sales floor assisting customers, ensuring improved store conditions and interacting with and training employees. in addition, we also are continuing to invest in our stores, completing 146 remodels and opening 9 new stores through the end of the third quarter. in own brands, the introduction of new products as well as the rollout into albertsons legacy divisions continues to drive strong growth and improved margins. q3 sales penetration increased 15 basis points year over year to 25.1%, with the strongest performance in the flour, deli and foodservice departments.
year to date, we have launched 540 new products, including 143 in the third quarter and are on track to launch over 800 this year. our next priority is the acceleration of our digital and omnichannel capabilities. this digital transformation is designed to fuel our growth as we aim to drive increasing customer engagement, customer satisfaction, and customer retention through an area of convenient shopping experiences. for example, in loyalty, our new unified mobile app consolidates the customer's entire digital experience into one place where they can shop, download deals, request pharmacy services, and utilize gas and grocery rewards.
since the launch, we are seeing increasing downloads, higher traffic, and deeper customer engagement. in drive up & go, we expanded our store count in q3 and now cover 96% of our households with first-party pickup offerings. we also rolled out faster pickup options. and heading into the fourth quarter, over 80% of our households are now able to receive their drive up & go orders in two hours.
in online delivery, we have established several third-party partnerships to meet the differing needs of our customers. through these partnerships, we're able to accelerate the speed of delivery while reducing delivery cost per order and allow customers to combine our delivery with an additional delivery from another retailer or restaurant in one trip through doubledash. we're also testing other new experimental pilots and concepts for last-mile delivery. in parallel to the rollout of our digital and omnichannel capabilities, we are also building a digital marketing platform that will allow our customers to engage with the food and brands they love.
in november, we announced the launch of the albertsons media collective, a retail media network that will offer business partners a digital marketing platform and omnichannel solutions to reach our extensive customer network. to offset the cost of inflation and fund future investment, our next priority is to continue to identify and drive productivity across all disciplines in our business. during the quarter, we continued to benefit from the retail and supply chain operations, merchandising and procurement initiatives that we have previously laid out. and we continue to expect to achieve the targeted $1.5 billion in annual gross savings by the end of fiscal year 2022.
our fourth priority is strengthening our talent and culture and supporting the communities we serve. to find ways to enhance culture, our senior leadership recently conducted listening tours in our stores to personally connect with our frontline associates. in addition, we conducted another associate experience survey across the organization, the other work we are doing well and what we can do to create an even better work environment and culture and are taking actions based on that feedback. our pharmacy team also continues to serve our communities within area of services, including the covid and flu vaccines.
to date, the pharmacy team has administered 11 million covid vaccine doses. to enable the delivery of 37 million healthy breakfast to those in need, we collected $9 million, thanks to the generosity of our customers and the thanksgiving and other 100,000 meals were provided to those in need with the help of one of our third-party delivery partners. due to our efforts in own brands, for the fourth consecutive year, we were awarded the epa safer choice partner award for achievement in the design, manufacture, selection and use of products with safer chemicals. we also earned recognition in transportation as a top green fleet in 2021 from heavy-duty trucking for our 100% zero emissions refrigerated grocery delivery trucks.
we are also continuing to install energy efficiency and refrigeration upgrades and have installed these in over 700 stores through q3 '21. we also continue to take actions related to esg and sustainability and are focused on a comprehensive set of goals in areas, including climate action, waste reduction and circularity, community stewardship and diversity, equity and inclusion. and now i will turn to sharon to provide remarks and cover the details of our third quarter fiscal results and outlook.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, vivek, and happy new year, everyone. it's great to be here today. i'll now share with you the details of our strong third-quarter results and provide an update on our fiscal '21 outlook. as vivek said earlier, we delivered q3 2021 identical sales growth of 5.2% and 17.5% on a two-year stacked basis.
retail price inflation and incremental covid-19 vaccine revenue contributed to these increases as well as unit and dollar market share gains in both food and mulo. gross margin rate was 28.9% in q3 2021, compared to 29.3% in q3 2020 and 28.3% in q3 2019. excluding the impact of fuel, our gross margin rate increased 10 basis points compared to q3 2020, primarily due to productivity initiatives, improved pharmacy margins related to covid-19 vaccine and favorable product mix, including in fresh, where sales outpaced center store by 500 basis points. these increases were largely offset, however, by lower gross margin rate due to the rate impact of increased product costs driven by the current inflationary environment as well as higher supply chain costs.
compared to q3 '19, gross margin rate increased 60 basis points from 28.3% to 28.9%. excluding the impact of fuel, gross margin rate increased by approximately 40 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage, productivity initiatives, and improved pharmacy margins related to covid-19 vaccine, partially offset by investments related to our growth in digital sales and an increase in product and supply chain costs driven by the current inflationary environment. selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 25.4% in q3 2021 versus 28% in q3 2020 and 27% in q2 2019. excluding fuel and a $286 million pension withdrawal charge in q3 2020, selling and administrative expenses decreased 20 basis points versus q3 2020.
this decrease was primarily driven by lower covid-19-related expenses and the benefit of productivity initiatives. these decreases were partially offset by higher employee costs, depreciation, and other expenses related to the acceleration of our digital and omnichannel capabilities and other strategic priorities. the increase in employee costs was primarily driven by market-driven wage rate increases and incremental labor to support the increase in fresh sales. on a two-year basis, selling and administrative expenses decreased 160 basis points from 27% to 25.4% and excluding fuel, decreased 170 basis points.
this decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage and the benefit of productivity initiatives, partially offset by higher employee costs, expenses related to the acceleration of our digital and omnichannel capabilities and other strategic priorities; higher equity-based compensation; and incremental covid-19 expenses. q3 '21 adjusted ebitda dollars were $1.05 billion compared to $968 million in the prior year. this increase was primarily driven by the 5.2% increase in id sales. q3 '21 adjusted net income was $457 million or $0.79 per fully diluted share, compared to $387 million or $0.66 per fully diluted share in q3 2020.
i'd now like to discuss free cash flow and capital allocation. during the third quarter and year to date, we have generated significant free cash flow, driven by strong operating results and lower working capital. from an investment perspective, capital expenditures through the third quarter were $1.2 billion as we continue to invest in our digital and technology platforms, completed 146 story models and opened nine stores. regarding debt reduction.
during the quarter, we retired $330 million of outstanding notes, reducing annual interest expense by approximately $18 million. and finally, during the quarter, we returned $56 million or $0.12 per share in cash dividends to our common shareholders, bringing our year-to-date total to $149 million. i will now turn to our updated outlook. given our outperformance in q3 and recent trends, we are raising our guidance for fiscal '21.
we now expect full-year id sales in the range of negative 0.8% to negative 1.2%, compared to previous guidance of negative 2.5% to negative 3.5%, representing an updated two-year stacked id range of 15.7% to 16.1%, compared to prior guidance of 13.4% to 14.4%. we expect adjusted ebitda dollars in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.3 billion, compared to previous guidance of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion and adjusted eps in the range of $2.90 to $2.95 per share, compared to previous guidance of $2.50 to $2.60 per share. we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 23.5%, compared to a range of 23% to 24% previously. and finally, we expect our capital expenditures to now be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, slightly lower than our previous range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion due to supply related constraints.
i'll now turn the call back over to vivek for some closing remarks.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
thank you, sharon. in closing, i would like to reinforce a few messages. first, our stores continue to be the foundation of our business and now allow us to serve our customers, both in-store and online. our excellent locations near where people live provide us with a competitive advantage.
a new technology is allowing us to take the customer experience to new levels. our digital initiatives continue to drive engagement and growth, and we remain focused on elevating service quality, speed of delivery, and the value of our loyalty offerings. we continue to gain market share in units and dollars and did so in both food and mulo this quarter. our productivity initiatives are delivering and there is more to come to help offset inflation and fund our growth.
and finally, we are navigating challenges like inflation, product supply, and labor shortages with agility and creativity. our strong performance year to date and the continuing positive trends give us the confidence to raise the fiscal 2021 outlook for id sales, adjusted ebitda, and eps that sharon just provided. but none of this would be possible without the dedication and commitment of our 290,000 associates who take care of our customers and the communities we serve every day. we will now open the call for questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question will be coming from the line of robby ohmes with bank of america. please proceed with your questions.
robby ohmes -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. good morning. great quarter. i'll just do my two questions upfront.
the first one is just on the id sales guidance, maybe a little more color. we just had the march food at home inflation came out around 10%. i think, sharon, you said you're seeing sort of mid-single-digit trends to date. that seems like you'd be falling behind the overall food-at-home inflation numbers.
maybe more color on why that may be and some thoughts on that. and then, vivek, you talked about enhancing center store for needs and preferences. i was hoping to get some more color from you on what that means and what you're seeing in center store changing.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
robby, thank you. i'll take your first question on the mid-single-digit comp sales that we're currently seeing. we feel very good about the strength of our business. we have a substantial easter shift.
that's not an albertsons dynamic, that's an industry dynamic because last year, at this time, easter would have already happened, and it won't be happening now for a couple of weeks. so we'll see how the rest of the quarter plays out, but we wanted to make sure that we gave you guys color on where we are at this point in time, and we are running in the mid-single-digit range. so i'll let vivek take the other part of your question.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. and, robby, on the center store, recall, we started this way of buying differently, right? and so now that we have a more consolidated approach to going to the market, especially in the center store, we now also have an opportunity to start taking decisions on categories where we under index. and there are some very meaningful categories that are growing that we under-index in our space. so those are examples of the types of things that we're going to continue to do and we can do that at a national scale so that we can get the best bang for the buck.
so that's primarily around the center store. the other area, i mean, it's not so much at a store, but i don't know where it fits. it's the whole meal solution, right? it kind of fits with what -- when i talked about the layout and optimizing things, those are the types of things we're also working on so that we can allow people to have quick and fast scripts, you'll see it in some of our stores, that are oriented toward those solving for a meal solution for the evening to get in and ou,t, with a few center-store categories but primarily the meals. those are the types of things we're working on, robby.
robby ohmes -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst

the next question comes from the line of edward kelly with wells fargo. please proceed with your questions.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. first, a quick follow-up on inflation. there is a growing sort of consensus concern, i guess, that we could see elevated food price inflation for some time now with the war in ukraine.
i guess what is your expectation for when inflation may peak based upon kind of what you're hearing from vendors in your work? i mean your guidance seems to suggest that maybe you think it's peaking now. and then in terms of elasticity, it's hard to imagine that elasticity stays so low. like robby said, we see 10% food cpi today. what are you seeing from a consumer behavior standpoint? and then what are you expecting from an elasticity standpoint from here?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
first, on inflation, let me just provide a little bit of context there. i hope you guys are able to see that we are managing the inflation very, very well, right? and so when you think about what we're trying to optimize here is we want to make sure that we're competitive. and the way we measure that is market gains, dollar share and unit share both in food and meal. and we've got a nice track record all through the quarter with sustaining a track record of market share gains and at the same time, not compromising gross margins.
so that's the equation that we're trying to work through, and we are doing very well with it because we're giving people choices, customers' choices, they're managing mix, where -- and we are allowing customers to get in a competitive basket, right, by doing that. what we have done is that we have estimated that the current level of inflation, i think q4 cpi was 7.4%, ok? and i just saw news this morning that the inflation overall was 8% or so. we suspect that this rate of inflation will continue until it cycles itself around september, which will be the beginning of our second half. and the assumption we've made is that this inflation will moderate in the second half.
and that's the assumption we made. so you could argue that if you think that what's happening in ukraine will create more inflation, then our assumption there is conservative. but the way we've approached it is assume that the inflation will be lighter and moderate in the second half of the year, deliver the business that way because we're going to drive more productivity and other things over there, right? and if inflation came up, then it gets to your second question. now if the consumer behaves like she's behaving now, where, honestly, we are not seeing a change in behavior well.
we are still seeing the consumers very strong. we're not seeing any meaningful trade down. i'll give you an example. organic sales penetration is up, not down in our business, ok? so we think the consumer is still strong.
whether the consumer will stay that way, even if we go to the second half or past the fall and inflation continues to be at 8%, 9%, i don't know. i would imagine you'd see some elasticities. but that's the approach we've taken. we wanted -- we expect it to moderate in the second half.
i hope that gives you enough color on how we've thought about it, ed.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
yes. no, that's great. and just a quick follow-up, sharon, on the guidance for the gross margin. the compare to 2019 is kind of different throughout the year.
it's much harder in the first half than it is in the back half. how do we think about sort of like first-half gross margins?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so we're not guiding by quarter. i tried to give you a little more color on the gross margins as we walk through the year. one thing to think about is that, just as you think about 2022, as it relates to covid, you're going to see the most significant impacts from covid vaccinations in q1.
and then in q2, our numbers were down last year in covid, then q3 picked up and q4 picked up. so when you think about modeling that, those -- the flow-through on covid is substantial on these vaccinations. so i hope that will get a little more help. i've already talked about the pressure of the covid vaccinations, but that's a pressure that you need to model.
but think about q1, 3, and 4 as being the biggest covid quarters. and honestly, q3 and 4 were the bigger of the 4 quarters.

the next question is coming from the line of john heinbockel with guggenheim. please proceed with your questions.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
guys, first question, can you, in some way, size the dollar opportunity? when i think about your best customers versus maybe the average, right, i would think there is a several hundred dollar annual spend opportunity there. and then with that in mind, if you think about a two to three comp longer term, can you think you drive the vast majority of that just from the best 15% or 20% of your customer base, can you do that?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
john, first, on your first question, it's not several hundred, it's several thousands, ok, for the customers who are most deeply engaged with us. and the way we think about it, if i can give you a little context here, if you go back even to our ipo document, you'll see that we talked about this notion of customers who engage in multiple parts of our business, stay longer with us and spend more with us, ok? that was evident, but it was not at the kind of scale we have today. what do i mean by that? today, we have 30 million customers engaged in our loyalty program. we have one app that they can go through.
and in that 1 app, it's a portal to the whole company, whether -- and it's not the whole yet, but it will be there. where you can go into the pharmacy business, you can engage in e-commerce, you can get content on meals and recipes and so on and so forth. so we've got that. we've got an e-commerce business now that's national, right? with drive up & go and delivery and many, many choices of delivery, we have a revitalized pharmacy business.
and so you put all of these together, it gets us at a scale -- national scale, an ability to create what we call stickiness with our customers. so the first part of your question, yes, it's thousands of dollars, not hundreds of dollars. and the second part of your question, absolutely yes. we imagine driving more and more of our sales from this group of customers.
and the big way to do it is by driving more retention with these customers. and the reason we have retention is all of the touch points we have just become stronger and at scale. does that help, john?
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok. yes. and then maybe secondly, you talked about the $750 million productivity for the next three years that you've just started. i assume you will not finish there.
is it possible or likely that, that ends up being similar to the last three, right, the $1.5 billion? and then your thought process on the new -- if there is a new secular algo versus the old one, right? is this the same on a higher base? or is it possible that this algo is a little higher than the old one?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
let me start with the productivity question. as we said in the prepared remarks, we have just started framing this next phase of productivity over the last six months since i joined. and it's a perpetual productivity engine. so there is absolutely the expectation that over time, that number will continue to grow.
so that's the first question. and then on the second question, vivek, do you want to take that?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes, i think, john, the way i think about it is when we went out -- when we went to the ipo, we were at 2.25%, if i'm right, long-term algorithm. obviously, we've sustained a much higher number than that, not even -- not just on an absolute basis, but on a relative basis, it's been incredibly good. and we put a lot of different things in place. let me put it this way.
i'd be disappointed if that's where we ended up in the long term. but we need to lap what we're going through this year before we can establish a pattern on that.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok. thank you.

the next question coming from the line of ken goldman with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your questions.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good morning. vivek, i think i already know the answer to this based on your tone earlier. but is it fair to say that as you are not seeing any meaningful changes in how the consumer is behaving.
and this is true whether the consumer, as you define it, is considered higher end, lower end. i just wanted to get a little bit of a sense there, given how much sensitivity there is in the market right now to lower-end consumers and their spending?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. ken, i've not seen a big difference yet. we have not seen a big difference yet across income segments, right? the one thing that we have put in our plan is that as snap funds reduce, which we suspect will go down over -- as we go through the year, that lower-end consumer -- or the consumers that were more dependent on snap, let me put it that way. will reduce some spend.
that said, to date, what we've seen is currency shifting. we haven't seen that behavior yet, but we don't want to conclude that and just assume that for the full year. so as we go into the second half, we have assumed that the consumer that was -- depending on snap, will spend less. and it may be just spend less by trading down, right? and we've assumed that behavior going forward, ken.
but we haven't seen that in any of our segments to date.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
and are you seeing a little bit of -- or sorry, does your outlook rather assume a little bit of incremental promotions, incremental discounting to sort of offset some of those pressures that those consumers might feel?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes, it does.vivek sankaranit does, ken.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
all right. and then my follow-up is -- and this is possibly a wasted bullet, but i'll go down this road anyway. can you talk about what the impetus was for the strategic review? it's just so odd to see a company that ipo-ed still recently, performing well fundamentally, adding great c-suite talent to announce something like this, especially given how broad some of the wording is. so i'm just curious if you could talk about sort of what sparked all of this, which has created such noise in the market.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so, ken, it was really sparked by the fact that valuation compared to peers was not reflecting the strength of our performance. and there were reasons in our minds for some of that. our performance has been, as you know, if you put us on the same basis at kroger, we have different quarter ends.
but if you measure us out, we outperformed kroger in q4. we outperformed them for the year, et cetera. so that was originally the catalyst for it. and of course, there was the overhang of the preferred shares that have hit the market, and then, of course, the ipo lockup was coming.
so as opposed to playing whack-a-mole, that's an alternative, right? you could just react to each event, we felt that a much more comprehensive assessment was much more inclusive of all of the alternatives. and that is included. as you know, i don't have to read the press release to you, but the assessment of our balance sheet optimization, any kind of strategic or financial transactions, et cetera. so that's what we're looking at.
and that was the catalyst for it. i said that after we put out that release, the catalyst hasn't changed. that's exactly why we're doing it. and we'll keep you guys updated as we move forward.

the next question comes from the line of scott mushkin with r5 capital. please proceed with your questions.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my questions. and so i just wanted to go back to what robby was talking about in the inflation rate market share. i just want to make sure, you guys are assuming or you're thinking you're going to continue to gain share, volume share and dollar share this year? because looking at the guide, you may think that you think there's some kind of change there.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
no. scott. we're going to -- we have gained -- let me give you the share story. so when we started this year, we were lapping some significant numbers in 2020.
so through the first half of 2021, fiscal '21, we were clearly gaining share in food, but we were not gaining share versus mulo. and because i think with mulo grocery, supermarkets have outperformed the rest of the market in 2020. now the second half of the year, everything turned positive, right? so we've gained share in mulo and in food, on dollars and units, and the rate of share gain continues. it just continues.
so we are expecting to continue to gain share. all of the different things that we're doing, i mean, we watch that, and that is our primary metric.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
ok. perfect. and then -- just figure out which question i want to ask because i have a bunch of them. maybe talk about competition and product availability that you're seeing right now.
is competition changing much? and clearly, we may still have some product availability and actually may get worse. i mean i think chicken is a hard commodity, chicken breast. so how are you guys thinking about that as the year goes on, both competition and product availability?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes, scott, product availability continues to be a challenge, continues to be a little bit of whack-a-mole. and we had imagined back then that by now, we'll see some relief, but it's not the case we are imagining that product availability will continue to be a challenge through most of this calendar year, maybe middle of this year, at least, and maybe start to get some relief in the fall, which is why we also think there might be more supply and that supply might pull down some inflation, right? so that's how we've thought about it. an example is x, right? we're seeing it going into easter. there's the flu and we've got the prices going up on -- costs going up on just the white eggs.
and so we continue to have all those kinds of issues. and we are planning that we need to manage around that. competitively, not a whole lot has changed. i'd say it's still quite stable.
the competent, there is -- it's hard for somebody to get into a massively promotional mindset given the challenges in product availability.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
perfect. thanks, guys.

our next question comes from the line of simeon gutman with morgan stanley. please proceed with your questions.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning, everyone. i'd like to paraphrase something on inflation and units, maybe for the rest of the year, vivek. so if we look at the composition of comp, it looks like it's tracking inflation, which means maybe units are flattish, something like that. and that's different than where it was a year or so ago.
and that's fine. i think that makes sense. it sounds like you're not expecting that dynamic to change even as inflation continues, if i heard that right. but there may be some sensitivity at the low end with snap.
does that mean there's an offset? and then it sounds like -- again, you're not expecting inflation to step up later in the year. we're going to lap it and then inflation sort of normalizes.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
that's right. so we have planned that when we cycle the current level of inflation, inflation will moderate significantly. and that's going to depend on supplies coming in, too, and we think there might be supply in the latter part of the year. but that's exactly how we've thought about it when we have put the guidance forward to you, that the second half will have much more moderated inflation.
and we've also assumed that the lower-end customer, the snap customer will spend less as we go into the second half of our year.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. and this is to clarify, not my follow-up. and this is based on to date, even as inflation has picked up, you're not seeing a further degradation in units? or as it picks up, it is kind of -- it's staying flat and that gives you the confidence that we won't see that elasticity pick --
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
correct. we've not seen a further degradation in units. we're seeing consistent behavior from the customer.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
ok. and then my follow-up, it might be for more sharon-related. and this goes back to what john asked earlier. your ebit, if you look at it relative to 2019, is up about $1 billion, so it's pretty impressive.
this year, the outlook is comps are going to grow, yet, at the midpoint, ebit it looks like it's going to decline. some of it could just be conservatism. we'll see how the year plays out. some of it, there's expenses.
should we think about it as an investment year? and then as an investment year, does it normalize one year later? two years later? i understand there's a little gross margin compare issue regarding vaccines. but how should we think -- because on a 2% to 3% comp, your ebit base probably ought to grow in the future. i think that's probably a fair assumption. but when does that begin?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so when you think about the guidance, there are two major pressures that -- if you go back and look at the transcript, i tried to lay it out for you in the gross margin and the sg&a. on the gross margin side, we are expecting the gross margin, and then that would flow through to the bottom line of covid basically to decline by 65%. and let's put this in comparison to kroger as an example.
they have done 11 million-plus covid vaccinations, and they are basically twice our revenue. and we have 12 million, so actually more covid vaccinations than they've done and it's on half the revenue. so the impact of covid on albertsons is significantly higher demand. so that flow through and that pressure falls through to the bottom line.
and we are talking about a significant number, and you can do the math. we helped you with that last quarter to do the math on that. and then the second thing is, to your point, we are making investments. those investments are exactly where you are seeing the benefit that we're seeing today.
you are seeing those investments in our digital transformation and the albertsons media collective, and another major area is the modernization of our supply chain. that is a big project i talked to you about last quarter that's coming into 2022 and 2023. so those are the three areas that we're making those investments. and of course, all the labor.
we, of course, have substantial increases in labor, like everyone else in the industry. and -- but the productivity has been such a strong tailwind, and that continues to offset that. but it's really covid and these investments.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
to note on productivity. over the last two, three years, we've learned how to deliver productivity at scale. so it gives us more confidence. and so the productivity becomes an engine, right? and as we've said before, there's so much more to explore in our company, given where we were and where -- and given where we began, let me say.
simeon gutman -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks. good luck.

next question comes from the line of rupesh parikh with oppenheimer. please proceed with your questions.
erica eiler -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
good morning. this is actually erica eiler on for rupesh. so first, i mean, it sounds like you're not seeing any signs of trade down to date. but maybe you could talk about your expectations on the private label side this year.
are you expecting, maybe we start to see a shift more toward private label? maybe just any thoughts you can share on private-label penetration this year would be helpful.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. private-label penetration is back up to 25.6%. if i recall, that was what it was the pandemic. so we're right back there.
and i would expect private label to become a bigger and bigger part of the consumers' basket, customers' basket, only because with that, we are offering better price points, better opening price points. now just like everybody else, we do have the supply challenges in private-label brands that the national brands have. and -- but as that comes back and if this inflation holds, it will become a bigger and bigger initiative in our gross margin agenda.
erica eiler -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok. no, that's helpful. and then just switching gears to sg&a. so i mean you highlighted the puts and takes.
maybe you could just dive a little bit more into the latest you're seeing on the wage pressure front with your contracts and labor availability. and then also just in terms of the investments you're making this year. is there anything to call out in terms of cadence? should we think about any of the quarters being more pressured by those investments this year?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so on the sg&a side, obviously, we listed out for you in the prepared remarks, where we have finalized our contracts. northern and southern california are to be ratified, but we have settled there. and then we have -- the other big one in that is going to be jewel, which is in the midwest.
so that -- as we see each of those throughout the year, what you're going to see is gradual and incremental increases coming through the year. they're starting now on all of the big ones that i laid out in the release that have been under negotiation, are happening with us today, and then the rest will come in toward midyear and toward the end of the year. so that's how you should think about it. but again, to that point, i want to go back to productivity.
this is not a surprise. and i know it's not a surprise to any of you on the call and it wasn't a surprise to us. we expected to see substantial increases and as such, have planned productivity accordingly, and we're proactive on productivity in order to address that. so the thing that we're here to say today as well, first of all, we are -- it puts us in a very strong competitive position in the markets that we serve.
while we, of course, nobody likes cost increases, we are investing in our associates. they are important to our mission, and we are moving forward with the highest increases that we've seen, but putting the productivity engine what vivek talked about behind it, and that will be happening throughout the year. so those are the big drivers. and then, of course, we all want us to continue to deliver against these investments in these strategic priorities, including -- and i really want to call out the albertsons media collective.
this is our alternative, whatever in the industry. they're calling it alternative revenue streams. we are several years behind others in that space. we're building it.
we announced it earlier this year. it's something we're really excited about. we have to build the foundation. those investments are going in today, but the returns are going to start happening over the next couple of years, and it's substantial.
so those are areas where investors want to see investment, and that's exactly where the money is going.
erica eiler -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
great. thanks for all the additional color.

karen short -- barclays -- analyst
i wanted to -- then apologies for the short-term orientation of the questions, but could you actually â two questions. could you actually quantify the easter shift impact on comps in the quarter to date? and then my second question is, obviously, you've gotten a lot of questions on your ebitda guide. i'm wondering if you could actually quantify the vaccine dollar benefit to 2021 as well as actual lapping of covid costs in 2021, because that would just help frame the down guide on ebitda for '22.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so, karen, until we see what happens with easter, to quantify the easter shift is harder to do, but we're not going to be guiding weekly sales. so we gave you where we are to date. your second question on vaccination, we have not specifically quantified that number and what that headwind looks like.
we did point out that we expect to be down about 65% on the number of vaccinations that we give. and last quarter, you might recall that in our comp -- after our follow-up call, you found some numbers out there on the internet that helped you sort of put a frame around that. we have arrangements and contracts that we have confidentiality agreements on, so i can't sit here today and give you the exact numbers, but needless to say that it is a substantial earnings headwind going into next year, and we have accounted for that in the ebitda guidance.
karen short -- barclays -- analyst
ok, and the covid --
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
65% of 12 million, karen, right?
karen short -- barclays -- analyst
pardon me?

and karen, on baseline covid cost, i think you had one other piece, which was baseline covid costs.
karen short -- barclays -- analyst
yes.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
and we don't anticipate that changing. covid is not gone. just look at philadelphia that just went back to mass mandate in april. covid's not gone, and we would not anticipate on the covid cost side to see a material change year over year.
the cleanliness in our stores and keeping people, customers, and employees safe is a top priority, and that will not change.
karen short -- barclays -- analyst
ok. and if i just may ask, with respect to the valuation gap versus peers, can you just clarify exactly who you're including in your peer set? i mean i'm assuming it's not just kroger.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer

chuck, one of the things we've observed with customers is that the traffic is up over last year, and it's holding very steady. but what's fascinating is that the baskets, if i compare to 2019, are substantially larger, right, even if you account for inflation. so one of the things that we are observing is i think we've got customers, consolidating shop, that behavior that started during the pandemic, i think it's still sticky, where people have consolidated trips. when fuel prices go up, it leads -- it tends to lead to even more consolidation of trips, ok? and a shift from what might be other channels that are more connected to commuting to people like us where you -- because the price points are better.
so we haven't -- i mean, i'm not saying we're seeing that. i'm not seeing any material change yet because of fuel prices. but there's a new behavior that seems to have become more entrenched. it also could be because people are eating more at home, but it's leading toward more consolidation of trips.
chuck cerankosky -- northcoast research -- analyst
how about in response to the fuel component to the loyalty program. any effect there [inaudible]?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
great point, chuck. great point. the fuel rewards are incredibly powerful. and there has always been, it has always been one of our best returns and one of the biggest drivers of stickiness.
so over the last several weeks, we've increased the number of rewards that we provide for fuel. that will drive -- it will drive more stickiness to us, and it will drive more of that consolidation of the basket to us. you're right.
chuck cerankosky -- northcoast research -- analyst
thank you. good luck.
operator
the next question is from the line of paul lejuez with citi. please proceed with your questions.
brandon cheatham -- citi -- analyst
this is brandon cheatham on for paul. i just wanted to kind of circle back to your price gaps compared to competitors. it sounds like the marketplace is being quite rational right now in passing along price to consumers. on your guidance, i think you mentioned that you expect promotions to kind of increase as the year progresses.
i guess specifically, what do you expect the changes to make the marketplace a little promotional more promotional? and if there is an improvement in supply chain, how could that maybe benefit your margins to help offset some of those promotions?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
right. so the promotions are going to depend completely on supply, right? and we are an operator that does more high low or less edlp. and so we do -- there is a set of customers, an important segment of customers who care about that, and we want to make sure that we are able to serve them. one important difference, though, from the past is that -- recall, go back to the 30 million people who are engaged in our loyalty program.
they get very, very specific personalized promotions. so even as promotions come back in our sector, my belief is that the promotions will come back in an extremely granular -- in an extremely surgical way rather than what was the old approach of promoting -- putting a lot of ads on the front page and driving it out for everybody. so that's how i'd imagine it coming back, which will be good because i think it takes care of the customers that we need to take care of and protects our p&l.
brandon cheatham -- citi -- analyst
great. and then on the media collective, i guess, where are you in launching that? or do you have a full team already hired? and then anything you can share on kind of like the long-term potential of this initiative and what might be considered in '22 guidance?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. you should expect that to follow the pattern that you've seen with many others, right, who started this journey on a media business, if i can call it earlier. we've got -- we've hired a team that has done this before, done this and had a lot of success. we've been patient about building it because we wanted to build it the right way and in a modern way.
and we've launched it in -- on february 27. so this year, it's about building it. it's -- in the following years, it will become more material in our p&l. so -- but we're very -- we feel very comfortable because at the end of the day, this is being built to serve our customers who are most engaged with us in the markets where we are the strongest.
and in those markets and for those customers, we are one of the best vehicles to reach them if you want to market to that.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
and recall in our guidance that we gave you this morning that it was called out as one of the areas where we have significant investment in 2022.
brandon cheatham -- citi -- analyst
got it. thanks, and good luck.

our final question this morning will come from the line of michael montani with evercore isi. please proceed with your questions.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey there. good morning. thanks for taking the questions. just wanted to ask, if i could, first off, on the flow-through rate.
if the comp store sales do end up exceeding your guidance, what's the right flow-through rate to think of, sharon, for every 100 bps of comp beyond the midpoint?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes, i would put that in the range of 15-ish.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
percent of sales.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
of percent of sales.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
sorry, is that for ebitda or ebit?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
ebitda.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
ebitda. ok. and then another follow-up i had was on the gasoline side. obviously, you had mentioned the covid vaccines.
but is there any incremental color you can share in terms of either how much tailwind that could have been last year or how much headwind to think of for this year?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
as it relates to fuel?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
yes. just trying to think of that.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes, vivek, you want to take that? yes.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. the fuel business, michael, for us, is not terribly large. and we would expect -- i think the way we've thought about it is we've -- the volumes will be higher this year, but the margins will be lower this year. that's how we've thought about it.
so it started material headwind, tailwind. let me put it that way. it's kind of going to reflect in total, kind of what we had this year, maybe a little less in terms of profit.
melissa plaisance -- senior vice president, investor relations, treasury, and risk management

vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
thanks, melissa. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. in the fourth quarter, our teams continued to drive top-tier operating and financial performance. we want to recognize and thank all of our retail, distribution, and manufacturing teams for their commitment to, and care of our customers and their communities.
we are proud of the compassion, humility, and passion for excellence they have shown in an exceptionally challenging environment over the last two years. in q4 '21, id sales increased 7.5% and 19.3% on a two-year stack. we also gained unit and dollar market share in food and mulo on both a one- and two-year basis and maintained our no. 1 or no.
2 position in 68% of the 121 msas in which we operate. in addition, we delivered adjusted ebitda of approximately $1.1 billion and adjusted eps of $0.75 per share, well ahead of our expectations. during the quarter, we continued to see a rebound in-store traffic and the benefits from our digital and omnichannel investments, including the expansion of drive up & go and additional micro-fulfillment centers, bringing our total mfcs to seven. omnichannel households spent three times more than in-store-only shoppers.
and during q4, omnichannel households grew by nearly five times versus the fourth quarter of 2019. in addition, as our investments drove increased customer engagement and retention, q4 '21 digital sales increased 5% year over year and 287% on a two-year stacked basis. in the just for u loyalty program, benefit enhancements continued to accelerate membership growth, which increased 18% year over year to nearly 30 million members and is up approximately 45% or over 9 million members since the fourth quarter of 2019. actively engaged members, defined as those redeeming coupons, fuel, or grocery rewards, also continued to increase.
and the redemption rate of these members remained over 90% at the end of the year. remember that on average, actively engaged members spend four times more than non-actively engaged customers. i will now recap our progress against the four key strategic priorities that drove our better-than-expected q4 and 2021 results. driving in-store excellence is the foundation that enables everything we do.
and our commitment to enhancing our customers' experience contributed meaningfully to the 18% year-over-year growth in our just for u members and market share gains. from an inventory and productivity perspective, we simplified tasks and automated production planning in our fresh departments, resulting in higher in-stock conditions and more time for customer interactions. for example, in the deli, we installed auto slicers and stackers and implemented production planning tools that increase product availability while reducing shrink and improved customer service. these changes contributed to the better-than-expected results in fresh.
during the fourth quarter, fresh id sales outpaced center store by 280 basis points year over year and over 500 basis points versus two years ago. in addition, we continue to invest and modernize our store fleet, including adding and upgrading self-checkout, which is now available in over 1,800 stores, and optimizing the layout and design to improve the customer shopping experience. we completed 236 remodels and opened 10 new stores in fiscal 2021. in own brands, we introduced 837 new products and increased adoption in lower-penetrated divisions, driving strong growth and improved margins.
q4 sales penetration reached 25.6% with the strongest performance in floral, deli, and meat. during the year, own brands was awarded four private label manufacturing association awards and one recognition from store brands magazine for innovation private brand marketing. our next priority is the acceleration of our digital and omnichannel capabilities to fuel our growth and increase customer engagement, satisfaction, and retention. in loyalty, we launched and upscale our new unified mobile app, or uma.
87% of our digital orders were being placed in the uma by the end of the fiscal year. we also introduced a meat planning tool that offers recipes, including those that address dietary preferences such as vegetarian or gluten-free. customers can seamlessly add all recipe ingredients to their shopping list or immediately purchase them in the uma. in drive up & go, we reached our goal of over 2,000 stores, serving 99% of our households.
in online delivery, we expanded third-party partnerships to offer more choices and accelerate the speed of delivery. and in both drive up & go and online delivery, we reduced cost per order by adding five additional mfcs and three-way rooms. we're configuring our picking software and staffing models and improving our forecasting algorithms. in digital, we are beginning to capitalize on our rich and proprietary data, recently launching the albertsons media collective, or amc.
amc offers existing business partners for a robust digital marketing platform that reaches our extensive customer network and leverages our strong market share, especially in the 68% of markets where we hold the no. 1 or no. 2 share position. we expect amc to be a leading growth and profit driver over the next several years.
increasing productivity, our next priority, allowed us to continue to fund future growth and offset inflation. in the second year of our three-year $1.5 billion savings program, we enhanced our pricing and promotion capabilities, further rationalized indirect spend, and expanded our national buying initiatives. we expect to achieve our targeted $1.5 billion in savings by the end of fiscal year 2022. and we will not stop there.
later on this call, we will discuss the next phase of our perpetual productivity engine beyond fiscal year '22. our fourth priority is strengthening our talent and culture and supporting the communities we serve. in 2021, we continued to acquire and develop talent to transform the culture, to harness local ownership, leverage scale and support our new omnichannel imperatives. we also recognized the frontline teams for embracing this cultural transformation while delivering exceptional sales to our customers by awarding a discretionary thank you payment in the fourth quarter.
our senior leadership team also focused on amplifying our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy. we are continuing to make progress at the senior levels of the company and are benefiting from the experience and diversity of thought that each of these leaders is bringing to the table. in pharmacy, our teams worked tirelessly to provide covid vaccinations for the communities we serve. to date, we have administered over 12 million vaccinations.
in esg, we increased investment and further developed our goals in the areas of climate action; waste reduction and circularity; community stewardship; and diversity, equity and inclusion. later this month, in conjunction with earth day, we will announce this comprehensive set of goals publicly. we are very pleased with the progress we have made against all our strategic priorities, and there remains significant headroom and a strong foundation to build on in 2022. i will now turn the call over to sharon to cover the details of our fourth quarter and fiscal-year results.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, vivek, and good morning, everyone. it's great to be here with you today. our fourth quarter '21 results were strong across all key metrics. identical sales were up 7.5% and up 19.3% on a two-year stacked basis, with momentum continuing into q1 '22.
retail price inflation, as well as market share gains, contributed to these results. gross margin rate was 28.7% in q4 2021. excluding fuel, the gross margin rate was flat compared to last year. productivity, improved covid-related pharmacy margins, and a favorable product mix were offset by the rate impact of increased product costs driven by the current inflationary environment and higher supply chain and lifo expenses.
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 24.9% in q4 2021. excluding fuel and a favorable pension adjustment, sg&a decreased 30 basis points compared to last year. this decrease was primarily driven by lower covid-19-related expenses and the benefit of productivity initiatives. these decreases were partially offset by market-driven wage rate increases, a discretionary appreciation payment to our frontline associates, expenses related to the acceleration of our digital and omnichannel capabilities and higher depreciation.
q4 '21 adjusted ebitda was $1.074 billion, compared to $917 million last year. this increase was primarily driven by the flow-through from our 7.5% id sales increase and the margin benefit related to administering covid-19 vaccine. q4 '21 adjusted eps was $0.75 per fully diluted share, compared to $0.60 per fully diluted share in q4 2020. turning to full-year fiscal '21.
id sales were near flat and up 16.8% on a two-year stack basis. we also delivered adjusted ebitda of $4.398 billion, as our productivity initiatives and margin benefit from covid-19 vaccines fueled strategic investments and substantially offset product, wage, and other inflationary headwinds. full-year adjusted eps came in at $3.07, nearly three times our 2019 adjusted eps of $1.04. i'll now discuss fiscal '21 cash flow and capital allocation.
strong earnings and temporary reductions in working capital drove better-than-expected cash flow. capital expenditures in fiscal '21 were $1.6 billion, with the majority of investments being made in the modernization of our store fleet and the building of our digital and technology platforms, both of which we expect will continue to fuel our transformation as we enter 2022. we also returned $207 million to our shareholders through common dividends and repaid $330 million in outstanding notes. net debt leverage at the end of fiscal '21 was 1.2 times, compared to 1.5 times in fiscal 2020 and 2.9 times in fiscal 2019.
i'd now like to provide an update on our recent labor relations activities. we have continued to settle labor contracts that provide an overall wage and benefit package that rewards our existing team members for their significant contributions and strengthened our competitive positioning in the markets we serve. during the fourth quarter of 2021, we settled retail contracts in denver, portland, montana, idaho, oregon, and the mid-atlantic. thus far, in the first quarter of 2022, we have also reached tentative settlements in both northern and southern california with retail contracts in seattle, las vegas, shaw's, and jewel left to be negotiated this year.
i will now turn the call back over to vivek to discuss our fiscal '22 priorities.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
thank you, sharon. as we look forward to fiscal '22, we are entering the next phase of our transformation strategy, customers for life. our belief and the evidence is that when we are at our best in the brick-and-mortar and digital world, our customers never leave us and keep spend more of their wallet with us. customers for life is built around this belief that satisfied customers create outsized lifetime value and that everything we do should enable more stickiness.
customers for life is anchored on placing the customer at the center of everything we do, with the ultimate goal of supporting our customers every day, every week, and for a lifetime. we want our customers to interact with us daily, not only to shop, but sometimes to simply consume relevant content about food or planned meals or find information to inspire their well-being. our business model is pivoting to one that is loyalty-based, doubling down on our omnichannel engagement with customers beyond just transactions. we will elevate the in-store experience when they shop with us, expand our services and content-rich offerings and build a set of competitive and timeless capabilities that create a compelling reason for our customers to seek a lifetime relationship with our team members and our banners.
to support this pivot, we will be investing in the following strategic priorities: digitally connecting and engaging all customers through our mobile app and website, so they can enjoy integrated and curated experiences in e-commerce, the community, loyalty, health and media; differentiating our store experience by deepening engagement through the use of technology, removing team member pain points to allow them to focus on customer service versus just tasks; and simplifying the end-to-end shopping journey and evolving store operations to support omnichannel growth; enhancing what we offer by elevating our distinctiveness in fresh, expanding our own brands products and services, including our ready meals program and enhancing product offerings in set of store to address customers' changing needs and preferences; modernizing our capabilities in part through an improved supply chain, enhanced data and data analytics and ongoing productivity, all built on the foundation of being locally great and nationally strong; and finally, further embedding esg throughout our operations. success against these priorities will be measured based on increased digital engagement, expanded merchandise and service offerings, a competitively differentiated omnichannel experience, and an accelerated set of digital and supply chain capabilities. i will now turn the call over to sharon to discuss the financial outlook for 2022.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
as vivek said, we're entering fiscal '22 and the next phase of our transformation with continued momentum and strength in our core business, evidenced by our q1 to date, mid-single-digit id sales increase. we are gaining market share, and the investments we have made in growth and productivity are delivering better-than-expected returns. throughout the pandemic, we capitalized on the opportunity to attract new customers and have entered 2022 with $30 million just for u loyalty members, a 45% increase versus year-end 2019. with that as the backdrop, our fiscal '22 outlook assumes the following we expect fiscal '22 id sales to increase 2% to 3%, driven by continued inflation and market share gains.
in the first half of the year, we expect id sales to be above the full-year range. in the back half, we expect id sales to be below the full-year rate due to cycling heightened inflation in the back half of fiscal '21. we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of $4.15 billion to $4.25 billion, reflecting continued growth in the business and stable gross margins. in fiscal '22, in our core business, excluding fuel, we are expecting gross margin rate expansion, driven by productivity tailwinds.
we are also expecting, however, a 65% decline in covid vaccinations and related margins, the impact of which will be greater than the core business margin rate expansion. therefore, factoring in both drivers, we are expecting the gross margin rate, excluding fuel, to be down slightly in fiscal '22. in selling and administrative expense, we are incrementally investing in our strategic priorities, including our digital transformation, the albertsons media collective, and the modernization of our supply chain, which will increase our sg&a rate in fiscal '22 that drive long-term benefits. productivity tailwinds are also substantially offsetting a significant increase in hourly wages and benefits for our frontline associates.
that brings us to adjusted eps, which we expect will be in the range of $2.70 to $2.85 per share based on our current fully diluted share count. to support this outlook, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $2 billion to $2.1 billion, with more than half of the spending invested in modernization and digitization in our stores and the remaining in the expansion of our digital offerings and optimization of our supply chain. i'd also like to share with you our latest view on additional productivity. by the end of fiscal '22, we will have delivered on our three-year commitment of $1.5 billion in productivity.
as that is coming to a close, we have started framing the next wave of productivity and have already identified $750 million in future savings that we are committing to between fiscal '23 and fiscal '25 in the areas of automation and digital tools, scalable workforce management, modernization of our supply chain and sg&a optimization. i'll now turn the call back over to vivek for closing remarks.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
thank you, sharon. as sharon just mentioned, we are pleased with our 2021 results and the continuing momentum we are seeing as we enter 2022. our relative performance, evidenced by our profitable id sales growth, and market share gains continues to be strong. our strategy is working, and we're executing well against industrywide pressures than the transformation we began before the pandemic has significantly strengthened our company.
and on our stores, we have accelerated remodels, implemented technology-enabled core processes, and advanced our capabilities in fresh. leveraging our store base, we have built a scaled omnichannel capability, including drive up & go and online delivery that is proving to be sticky with customers to engage across channels. we have developed a robust loyalty platform and a unified mobile app that engages customers and personalizes offers for our 30 million just for u members. we have learned to leverage our scale in vital capabilities such as pricing and promotions, merchandising, and supply chain, without compromising agility and local ownership.
we have proven that we can deliver productivity at scale and are adding an incremental wave. all of these foundational capabilities have created a springboard for customers for life and our next phase of growth. while we recognize there are a number of uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, as we enter 2022, we have demonstrated a proven track record in the execution of our strategy and remain confident in our ability to deliver against the 2022 priorities that we laid out for you today. but none of this will be possible without the unwavering commitment of our associates and the ongoing support of our vendor partners and shareholders.
we will now open the call for questions.

thank you. ladies, and gentlemen, thank you for joining us for the albertsons company's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instruction] the first question comes from john heinbockel of guggenheim, please go ahead.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey guys, i want to start with how you think about the market share opportunity from food away from home, in an environment where menu prices continue to go up. anything size that opportunity in your mind, how much of that will be driven by ready meals versus ingredients? and how do you kind of go out and maybe market differently in this environment to educate consumers about your offering?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
hey, john. good morning. john, here's how i characterize what we're seeing in the market. i think i would argue that consumers are still eating a lot at home, and possibly because they're working at home, possibly because of some of the things you point out about inflation outside and in restaurants, sometimes it's hard to get into restaurants.
and the way i see that is because of the portfolio, if your ready meals is doing so well. we just launched a sandwich program, and the sandwich program that sold many sandwiches, they're doing so well, and our convenience salad in our stores are doing so well. so we think there's one of two phenomenon's happening. one is people working at home and picking up things to have lunch at home, do convenient things so that they can have a quick lunch at home.
and we also see the types of things that you would buy if you were cooking at home. the meat programs that we have, our oils, the things that you would use to cook at home. so we still see that trend going, and i think everything we're doing in the app to enable meals, to provide more meals is also working for us. if you go to our app, we just launched a meal capability where you can pick your meal and it populates the items that you want, and we're seeing a lot of traction and things like that, john.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok. great. and then maybe second. totally different topic.
maybe share your philosophy or what you can share the board's philosophy with regard to real estate ownership. you mentioned the $13.7 billion. a lot of big box retailers [inaudible] real estate is a strategic value, for control reasons and a lot of a lot of other factors. what's the philosophy on your end as to ownership.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, john. our philosophy on real estate is exactly the way you described it, which is that we believe that the real estate we have is a strategic asset for the company. there is been a history in the company of occasionally having a transaction where they might do a sale leaseback of a percentage of the real estate that we have. that was about three years ago, i believe the last time they did that, and it was particularly small.
but despite having the real estate appraisal, we are very excited to see how well we've invested in the real estate. you saw that we were up about $2.5 billion, which if you put that on an asset value to the stock price on a pre-tax basis is about $4 a share. so it was an impressive increase in the valuations. but we do recognize the strategic value of the real estate, and we'll be very thoughtful about that as we continue to consider all of the strategic alternatives that we have in front of us.
john heinbockel -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instruction] the next question comes from simeon gutman of morgan stanley.
michael kessler -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi guys. this is michael kessler on for simeon. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to ask first about inflation in units or consumption.
how did both of those trend in the quarter? i guess even sequentially, incrementally versus what you were seeing a few months ago. and then thinking about the pass through of higher costs into retail pricing, how that's going, if there's any change in how you're viewing that past or dynamic, and what you're seeing from the competition. and then any sense of inflation outlook for the rest of this year, and potentially even into next year, as we're starting to hear a little more speculation about maybe some commodity deflation coming in.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
thank you, simeon. first, let me, if you don't mind, let me just give you a little bit about the consumer backdrop that we're seeing, because that's important for me to characterize what we've been seeing with inflation. i don't want to generalize, but i'll say there's two things that we've seen. one is the consumer is clearly trending down.
and so you can think of in rice, beans, oils, buying bouquets, and sort of arrangements, and so on. and so we're seeing that on one hand. but the good news is they're trading down into a lot of our own brands on that front. the second thing i would point out is that we have consumers uncharacterized the consumers.
again, not every segment, but there are consumers who have cash, but are very value conscious,. ok? and so the behavior we see from them is they are buying more, they are trading down on deli meats, but they're also buying a lot of store made sandwiches and meals. they are buying more hamburger, but they're also buying organic meats. they're buying premium beer, and people are buying lower priced beer.
right? and instead of buying one avocado, they're buying bags of avocados. so we're seeing this behavior where people are value conscious, but are willing to spend on the things that they care about. so when we think about your going back to your question, we're seeing the kind of inflation that you would expect in the marketplace that you're seeing in the marketplace. i think retail cpi was like 10.9% or so for the quarter, and when you see the numbers, yes, we are seeing some unit decline.
but i'll also tell you that [inaudible] is better than our units because of the other bag of avocados is one unit, right? instead of three avocados that they're the box in the past. so we're seeing some of that. our expectation on inflation, when we started the year was that the inflation would moderate quite significantly in the back half of our calendar year. and we don't think it's going to moderate as quickly, which is why we've raised our forecast a little bit, as you see on the top line.
but what we're seeing, though, is that the overall behavior of the consumer is that they're engaging on the bookends with us and in the middle. and we are working that. i mean, our assortment allows for that. if somebody wants the higher end of the product, they've got it.
somebody wants an opening price point, they've got it in our stores. and that combination is working well for us in driving units and margins. and as you know, the margins are pretty strong when they start engaging in our own brand portfolio. does that help, simeon?
michael kessler -- morgan stanley -- analyst
it does, yeah, thanks. this is michael, by the way, [inaudible]i but that's helpful, thank you. and maybe a follow-up to actually john's question. you know, he's asking about food away from home, and maybe just a broader one on market share.
there is the component of food away from home, demand shifting into food at home. and then there's a component of people trading down with in-food at home, maybe at a lower price or discount channels. how do you view your positioning, i guess, in the context of those two dynamics, which maybe to a degree are playing out? and if you can maybe speak to where you think the market share gains are coming from. and we heard from one of the largest sellers of food in the country yesterday that they also think they're gaining share.
so curious where you think it's coming from, too. thank you.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yeah. michael i'd say the first thing i note is that our market share is positive in food, and in dollars, and units. and that the last thing i said is very important to us, that we are gaining market share in units. when people are eating more at home, if they're in fact turning other food away from home, turning into food at home, and they're eating more at home, the fresh portfolio really, really matters.
and so we think we are gaining market share first because people are coming in for a broad, fresh portfolio. people are coming in for the bookings of the assortment, if that's what they choose, we've got it. and so, by our observation is that we're gaining market share clearly within the world of retail. and it's going to be very locally from all the competitors that we track locally, michael and i think you know the needs.
michael kessler -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yup. got it. ok. thank you.
appreciate it. good luck.

the next question comes from paul lejuez of citi.
paul lejuez -- citi -- analyst
i just want to be clear of that. in that 6.8% id sales number. how much of that was passing through higher prices to the consumer? and then just ask my follow-up now, performance of own brands. what was the increase overall compared to that id sells number, and you said that it performed on brands, it performed national brands in several categories.
curious where own brands are outperforming versus underperforming, and what you think makes up that difference. thanks.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
paul, here's how on the own brand. what happens in these markets is if you're if a national brand is not a strong national brand, people migrate very quickly to be own brand. so you see it like categories like oils, and shortening, and rice, and beans, and even in some meats, and are deli meats, and so on. we're starting to see people move very quickly to their own brands.
i'll remind you that our own brand portfolio is thousand basis points better margins than national brands. so even a small movement into own brands makes a meaningful difference in the in our gross margins. i think own brand penetration went up 30 [inaudible] this quarter. right? so that's a substantial change, and the contribution to the to the gross margin.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
and now your question, paul, on the 6.8% id sale, clearly, vivek mentioned that retail cpi was in the high ten for the quarter, and we anticipated coming into q1 that we would start seeing some breakage in units as well as government stimulus had been rolling off. so all of that contributed, market share gains contributed to the id sales, as did the opportunity for us to continue to grow the business. we did go up 30 basis points. our penetration on own brands went up from 25.5% last year, up to 25.8% this year, and we expect that to continue going forward.
so that is the answer on your 6.8%. of course, inflation helped drive that number. some of the assets were some breakage in units, and we also saw government stimulus go down.

the next question comes from edward kelly of wells fargo.
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
hi. good morning, everyone. i wanted to go back to the volume question, and the question around sort of elasticity. it does look like this quarter with double digit inflation elasticity picked up a bit, curious as to whether that's what you are seeing as well.
i know you mentioned sort of tonnage, but then as we look forward now, and we think about decelerating inflation, we looks like we could be entering a period where there's very low cost growth. and i'm curious as to how you think the industry acts in that environment from a promotional standpoint and how, if at all, it will change how you act from a promotional standpoint.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yeah. first, and i think the inflation is decelerating, but there's still inflation. but i think we should remember that, and it may not be 10.9%, but remember we've operated a business historically that has been open 1.5 2% inflation. and we think as a business so much stronger than pre-pandemic, that even at 1.5 2% inflation, we're going to have much better comps.
then we went into the pandemic quite so, fundamentally, i think there's more strength in the business to do that. but the inflation is going to be slightly higher than back then, the old number i think. the second thing in terms of elasticities, there are specific, if i go back to my history in this industry, in cpg and so on, the elasticities are so much better than we typically used to see in the past. but that said, there are elasticities, right? i think it's showing up in two ways.
one is maybe people are buying a little less of something, or clearly people trading down? i would expect that if that's the behavior, then people would trade back up, or buy back more if they if the inflation starts dropping. right? so if it goes one way in one direction, it'll go the other way in the other direction. and so my sense is the volumes will also start coming up as the inflation moderates. and then i think the other thing i'd point out is that everything we are doing is driving stickiness.
we are very deliberate about saying when we get a customer, we want to engage them, keep them, get them to spend more with us. and what's helping us do that is the digital engagement that they have in the e-commerce business that continues to grow. once we get them, we're able to personalize and keep them. and that's a market share gain that's working for us.
[inaudible]
edward kelly -- wells fargo securities -- analyst
ok. and then i just wanted to pivot and this question maybe is for you, sharon, but if we look at our opex dollar growth, this quarter was about 5% or so, and i know you're making investments into the business. there's obviously been some stuff that's happening from a labor standpoint on contract renewals. how do we think about both for sort of like the sheer and then even sort of like going forward, with things like labor, rate inflation that gets sort of embedded into contracts, that's like i just kind of curious as to how we should be viewing the growth of that line.
i don't know.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. we do anticipate continuing to invest in several key areas, digital and omnichannel. of course, we're also investing in the albertsons media collective, which of course is a longer term revenue driver for us. but today we are just beginning the investment in the albertsons media collective, and then the modernization of our supply chain, which is going to bring us substantial cost savings in the future.
so those are the big areas where we are investing in sg&a, and in the outlook that i gave on adjusted ebitda for the year, i gave a little color on sg&a, and those were the areas that we said we would invest, and we did expect that in the back half, by the end of the year, that we would have a great deal leverage on sg&a due to those investments. q1, we leverage the rate, but that was heavily driven as it laid out in the press release by significantly lower covid related costs. and those are nothing to do with the vaccine. we're talking about the cost that we incurred in q1 of 21 in our stores.
so that was the rate leverage in q1, and that was q1 last year with our largest quarter of covid store related investments. so i anticipate in the balance of the year to continue to see us make these investments, and i expect these investments, by the way, to bring us returns. now, offsetting that, which i also said in the prepared remarks earlier, is productivity. we saw the highest increases we have seen in frontline labor in our history, quite frankly, in 2022.
and yet our productivity savings that we are continuing to identify and capture have virtually offset that increase this year. and we expect to continue our productivity programs, which i also mentioned, we just announced last quarter another $750 million productivity program from 23 to 25. so while we are making these investments, we are also funding the investments to productivity, and expect to continue to identify increasing productivity. and many of the investments by their very nature will create productivity.

the next question comes from rupesh parikh of oppenheimer.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. so i wanted to touch on the promotional competitive backdrop. are you guys seeing any changes of note right now on the competitive side? and then as the year progresses, just given increased consumer sensitivity, do you expect it to become a more promotional environment later this year?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
hey. good morning, rupesh. no, we're not seeing a material change in the marketplace on that rupesh. but i've said this before, and i think we are not going to come out of this, going back to the old form of promotional intensity.
and the reason behind that is, i think all of us are one better at the use of technology, and we're all much more digitally engaged in promotions, and so yet we are promoting. what we are promoting very deliberately in an extremely targeted fashion to giving people the promotions that matter for them. and you will continue to see that, in my opinion, right as we go forward. the other thing is, i think you should also know that while supply is better, supply is vastly improved, supply is not where it used to be, right? and in many categories, we've all got to a steady state of managing it, and that's also going to throttle promotions, do quite a bit well, or quite an extent over at least the next 6 to 8 months.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
right. and then maybe one final question just on the e-commerce front. one of your competitors called out change in consumer behavior, i think, toward more pickup. are you guys doing the same thing on the e-commerce side? the shifts in consumer purchasing behavior online versus in-store.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
rupesh, did you say pick-up?
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
yeah. more pick-up versus delivery.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. i tell you two things we've always believed in, that pick-up matters and speed matters in delivery. and so the two things that are working for us is, one, we've got more pick-up in our stores, 2075 stores at the end of q1. but we've also expanded to our delivery, and same day delivery, and we're getting tremendous traction with to our delivery, with our customers.
and so the nice thing about that is we're leveraging our stores to do that. sometimes it's just putting a rare room in a store to do that, which is a very low capex. i mean, it's more shelving in the back of the store for the fast moving items, and that those two things are working for us.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
great. thank you. i'll pass along.

the next question comes from ken goldman of j.p. morgan
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. thank you. sharon, do you have an update on how to think about which of your multi-employer pension plans might be backstopped by the government? i think the u.s. recently put out some papers on the subject, but i might need a some kind of advanced degree to fully understand them.
just curious if you have any additional thoughts at this time.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so we do have an update. first of all, what you're what you're speaking to, ken, thank you for bringing it to everybody's attention is the american rescue plan act. it's called arpa, and it was during covid.
it was put out there to provide special assistance to keep these multi employer pension plans solvent. so we participate in about 90% of those plans. now, keep in mind that we do not have liability for these plans. and that is the most important thing to take away from this.
but for those plans that we participate in, in the 10-k, we disclosed that we had about $4.9 billion of there was $4.9 billion of liability in those plans. and after tax, it was about $3.7 billion. and as we look at this, we have already started to receive, we've applied and received funding for that. and we anticipate that liability, about half of it would be covered by arpa, up to about half of it would be covered by arpa.
so, yes, it is out there, it got settled, it's acting, and moving forward. and again, we have 16 plans, which is 90% of our other funding that is in that category.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you. and then, vivek, more of a broader question. you said in your opening comments, and i think you say this consistently, but you said that albertsons faces a challenging operating environment.
and i do appreciate that by nature, right? the industry you are in is professionally challenging. but i guess i'm not quite sure why today should be considered particularly tough. you have rational competition. you have actions that are taking share.
you're offsetting high labor inflation with productivity, low elasticity. i guess one of the questions i get sometimes is why aren't these considered the good old days? all things considered, it wasn't that long ago that supermarkets were losing a lot more share to mass. we had a historically high level of deflation, so sorry to be overly wordy, but i'm just curious what's challenging today relative to prior years in your mind?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
ken, good morning. i think, here's how i characterize it. you're right, i think our sector and we in particular, we are doing really well relative to where we were pre-pandemic. the pandemic and the initiatives that we have in place have accelerated so many different things we're doing, like gaining customers, we're keeping them.
our portfolio is working with better in execution. we're driving stickiness [inaudible] you know, our pharmacy nps scores last year 54, now 81.5. and guess what? we're adding scripts every day in our pharmacy. so there's a lot of things going well.
what's challenging? the challenging part is the uncertainty. and the way we have to deal with that uncertainty is by being incredibly local and incredibly nimble, and i'm so proud of our teams for doing that, right? and that's one challenging piece. the second challenging pieces, ken, we all go that's going away? it's not yet. so we still have the timing around it.
it causes disruptions, it's causing disruptions. and it's not like it was before, but we still have those uncertainties to manage. that's the part that i characterize as challenging. and we don't know where, i mean, this inflation so far, i think because of our portfolio, and the way we're executing, we are managing through this inflation very well.
and i think we all have in the back of our minds what the other consumer might be here if this thing keeps going, right? so those are the types of things we're navigating. it's more the uncertainty than anything else.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
great. thanks so much, vivek.

the next question comes from michael montani of evercore isi.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking the question. i wanted to ask if i could, first off, in terms of the id sales. could you just clarify what the actual number of transactions up or down in the quarter?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yes. in order to drive those id trends, we don't quantify, but transactions were absolutely up.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. got it.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
and we talked about the fact that we are seeing a return, michael, of in-store traffic.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
adding households and adding transactions.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
understood. and then if i could just follow-up on the guidance for a moment. so for the next three quarters, it looks like it's implied about a $200 million decrease in ebitda year-over-year versus the $100 million increase year-over-year in 1q. and understand there's crosscurrents going on, obviously lower id sales as well.
but just help us to walk through that in terms of the productivity agenda sounds good. but then also, you've got basically less incremental volume forecast. so is it consistent promotionally that you're assuming through the year? and then just kind of why is that the right outlook?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. keep in mind, michael, that covid vaccinations, 65% reduction in covid vaccinations in 2022 versus 2021. and recall that there was a big increase that occurred. q2 will be our smallest quarter we're in 2021, but then q3 and q4 started to reescalate, and that is hitting us very hard in q3 and q4.
michael montani -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay. thank you for that.

the next question comes from scott mushkin of r5 capital.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. i guess i wanted to look at when i think about what the push back and owning albertsons, right, really from the ipo pensions, which were covered already and i think was obviously a big plus. you know, the ownership overhang, which i think you guys addressed a little bit. and then the third, it was a major one was pricing.
everyone hasn't come up really that much on the call. but it does seem that you guys continue to invest part of your savings in narrowing the pricing gap, at the same time i wonder how long it's going to last to certain competitors clearly have enormous pressures on their business, whether it be an omnichannel buildout, or a general merchandise problem. so how should we look at this pricing gap as you go forward? do you think it's something you can continue to narrow in kind of, you know, take that off the table as a concern, or is that something you think is going to widen out again when the competitive environment changes?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
good morning, scott. to talk about pricing first, you got to believe that you're going to have gross margins stability in the business. and we've always talked in the past about having tailwinds on gross margin, and for example, assortment. so more on brands, more store made products that you show, the better the gross margins, promotions.
we're putting a lot more technology into our promotions. it's a lot more personalized. that's a gross margin tailwind. operations, reducing our shrink through technology and production, technology and produce ordering, technology at the self-checkout.
we thought we had optimized it, now this technology will really shrink the checkout. cost of good, we are rolling out a lot more merchandizing buying. we're even finding reduced costs in our own brand portfolio, and the supply chain. so the first thing is we need to have a lot of confidence in our gross margin.
by the way, we're also automating our supply chain, so we need to have. now that we have, but we have it. you know, everything i told you are initiatives that are in flight. some are late, some are early.
but we look at the ability to deliver tailwinds as we look into the future. we combine that with being extremely surgical, about where we invest in price. and the metric we're always looking at is are we gaining market share in dollars and units, foot and mulu, and where we feel that that is out of kilter, we invest in price. and so that mechanism will continue only because we have all of this i just talked about to continue to do that, scott.
we don't believe in going and making large scale changes. we just don't think that pays off, and we, by the way, we offer a set of things in our store that we think comprehensively provides value to our customer. and it's that combination that matters.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
and so a little thanks for that. [inaudible] you guys have been gaining share now. gosh, you know, i guess a couple of years, consistently. if you had to kind of say, you know, answer the question, i guess, you know, most investors clearly don't believe it's going to happen because the [inaudible] really want to move up in this valuation is real low, you know, why do you think it's sustainable and why do you think it's happening?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
why is [inaudible] sustainable? well, scott, i think there's a few things working right for us. one is up, it always starts with having a great portfolio, and our portfolio works in many, many different environments. so we are in an inflationary environment. i think that was concerned whether our portfolio would work, actually works because we can give people those bookends.
those who choose to stay with organic meat and buy hamburger, you got it. you got it in our store. the second thing we do, i have to emphasize that, you know, while i'm giving you general statements, the magic is local. you cannot win in this market if you're not working it on a store by store basis, locality by locality basis, and optimizing to it.
and that's a heritage, and the teams are doing that. the third thing is driving stickiness. we did that extremely seriously, which is why we want people to engage more digitally, because we can drive more stickiness, whether it's a loyalty program or an e-commerce program. and the fourth thing is this is underrated, but it's just great everyday execution, right? and the [inaudible] i gave you is just good on everyday execution, just getting better so the customer said, hey, i'd love to come here for my scripts, then somewhere else.
and all of those, we still think we have plenty of headroom, in everything i just said.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
and i would just add to that, that the other thing to keep in mind is at the end of q4, we gave you a metric on our just for you loyalty members that we had gone up 45% to 30 million, just the loyalty members. and then coming into q1, we just increased another million to 31 million just for you loyalty members. and if you go back and reflect on that prepared remarks, what you'll see is that aci just for you loyalty members mature. as an example, when they become omnichannel.
over time, they come to be spending three times more than the in-store-only shoppers, are actively engage, when they become actively engaged with us, they become four times more than an average shopper spenders in our stores. and nobody joins just for you and becomes either one of those immediately. it takes time and it grows over an extended period of time. so as we continue to gain these members, and then we have the pandemic significant increase in those members, and what we have been most pleased with is the retention of those members.
and as we do that, that helps fuel ongoing share gains because these customers become more and more valuable. we continue to gain share of wallet from those customers in addition to attracting new customers to the brand. and that provides a very significant tailwind to the issues that you've mentioned about continuing to gain market share over time. and these are some of the most that we feel like we have been able to build over the last couple of years in order to create the environment that can make that share gain environment sustainable.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
i'll just close that with scott, you know, to do all of this, you need a capacity to invest. and that's where our productivity program comes in. a first 1.0, if i can call it, the 1.5 billion going great. we talk to you about the next tranche of productivity.
it's off to a great start. and so we feel we'll continue to have the ability to drive productivity and invest in the things that drive growth.
scott mushkin -- r5 capital -- analyst
fantastic color, guys. really appreciate that.

the next question comes from robert moskow of credit suisse
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks for the question. i'm maybe trying to get the back into inflation from a different perspective. do you expect sequential inflation in your next quarter? like, do you expect prices to be sequentially higher? and what's driving it? are you still seeing vendors come to you asking for more pricing? and if so, are you more are you less amenable for that, given what's happening in the commodity markets to work or not?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yes. so, rob. here's how i characterize it. the broad answer to you is, yes, we do expect sequential inflation, but it's more moderated levels than we're seeing.
so, if early in the year, we it expected that we [inaudible] that and we [inaudible] it and inflation was moderate very significantly. we are less sure about that now. so if i was to characterize what we're seeing, one on the one hand, you're seeing commodity prices decreasing. but on the other hand, we also expect that things like produce and others will come in a little higher because fertilizer costs are up.
and those are that's the crop that people have already put in the ground. and so when we harvest that, we're going to see some prices. so [inaudible], we're seeing signals on both sides today. but i think some cpgs are coming forward with price increases later in the year.
of course, we will continue to challenge all of that because we do our own clean sheets on what something should cost, and we'll continue to challenge that. but [inaudible] answer is we do expect some sequential inflation, even if moderated through the rest of the year.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. great. last question, i didn't hear anything about supply chain disruption being an issue in the quarter. are you still experiencing that or is that tamped down a lot? and as a result, are your shelves full, or are you still not getting everything you need from your vendors?
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
we are definitely still seeing supply chain disruption, and we still have categories where we are on allocation. so those issues have moderated. they are in no way passed. and from a supply chain operations standpoint, we have been hiring better, and we've been more able to find labor.
i'm not saying it's solved, it seems to have mitigated. and on the transportation side, that continues to be a challenge, but again, moderated but not fixed. so i think all of us, as an industry would say we've seen some relief, but it is not at this point where we would call it being significantly better. it is moderating.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
doesn't make us problem. that's good.
operator
thank you. the final question comes from [inaudible] of wolfe research.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
good morning. this is spencer hanus on for greg. one of your biggest competitors is increasing your taxes and price increases on [inaudible] to manage the markdowns they're taking in general merchandise categories. just curious how you think that would impact the competitive environment in grocery? and do you think your peers are going to take the opportunity to also bring out prices?
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yeah. hey, i don't know. i can't speak about what might be happening in somebody else's business, but i can tell you that i think everybody is feeling that the food business is doing well. you're seeing that across the markets.
even if you saw some of the earnings calls today, you see that the food businesses are doing well. and my sense is that for some of the things i talked about earlier, it'd be really hard to, in this environment to do drive down prices and expect massive uptake in supply in volumes, certainly because if a supply is challenged and people are looking for different things, it's not just about going in and buying a package. good people are looking for a full portfolio to solve their challenges, and meet their needs today.
spencer hanus -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's helpful. and then i totally understand that the [inaudible] main challenge, and that's constraining promotions for now. but if we start to see accelerated and pick-up, and then we see unit changes decelerate further in the second half and into 2023, do you think the promotions remain as rational as they've been over the last 18 months that.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
yeah, it still is rationalized. again, i go back to, if you go back to the past, the old behavior in our sector was that we would all run an eight, ten page ad and blast promotions that didn't give us a return. ok? and that was, what, deluded gross margins in the past? i think there's plenty of technology, and data, and digital access, and so on today to become much more targeted and get a better return on promotions. and so far, i still find it rational, i suspect that by i talk to you about the [inaudible] rates, just to put it in perspective, you know, in some of these categories, we are at 65% service level and feeling good because it's better than 35%, but 65% still sucks.
so i think we've got a long way to go before we get completely comfortable as a sector on supply.
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
and we've said consistently that with the pricing promotion, data analytics investments, that the entire industry has been making over the last several years. we believe that it is the tide that raises all boats. this isn't a specific albertsons discussion, we believe that this discussion applies to most of our sophisticated competitors, that through personalized promotion, it is why the media collectives are doing better that talked about the fact that the suppliers and the retailers together have realized that the effectiveness of promotions can be so much greater when you can personalize and you use data analytics to drive it. and so i think that over the last couple of years, if you take a look at the investments that we've all made in those capabilities, they have changed the game.
and to just give away margin, i just don't see that behavior coming back into the industry in the way that we saw it pre-pandemic.

thank you, melissa. good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. in the first quarter, our teams continued to deliver strong operating and financial performance across all key metrics. we want to thank all of our associates for their ongoing service to our customers and communities.
we are so proud of their resilience, agility, and passion for excellence in this challenging operating environment. in q1, identical sales increased 6.8%, and we continued to gain market share in food and [inaudible]. we also maintained a number one, or number two position in 68% of the 121 msas in which we operate. in addition, we delivered year-over-year adjusted ebitda growth of 9% to $1.42 billion, and adjusted eps of $1 per share.
q1 digital sales increased 28% year-over-year. as our digital offerings continue to resonate with customers, and we further optimized our cost to serve. also in q1, we continue to leverage our digital investments. omnichannel households increased 34% year-over-year, with retention rates over 90%, and they spend three times more than an in-store-only shopper.
at the same time, in-store transactions also increased as we continue to invest in new merchandizing initiatives, and our just for you loyalty offerings. just for you loyalty members increased 16% to 31 million, with actively engaged members reaching an all-time high, and spending four times more than a non actively engaged member. like omnichannel households, retention remained at over 90%. these growth trends affirm a belief that engaged and connected digital and in-store experiences will result in long-lasting customer relationships, and industry-leading growth.
the underpinnings of the next phase of my transformation strategy. customers for life, which we introduced last quarter, is based on placing the customer at the center of everything we do. we want our customers to interact with us daily. not only to shop, but to consume relevant content about food, plan meals, or find information to inspire the well-being.
when we laid out our fiscal 2022 priorities in our last earnings call, we shared that we are investing in four strategic priorities that i will update you on now. first, we are deepening our digital connection and engagement with our customers, which supported our 28% digital growth in the quarter. this growth was driven by an expansion of our services and innovation. for example, we were operating 2075 drugstores, drive-up, and go stores at the end of q1.
a focus on speed is paying off. for example, our express delivery 2 hours or less is now available to 74% of our households. and penetration of this option has increased fivefold versus prior year. during q1, we launched new merchandizing features in our unified mobile app, providing an increasingly personalized and curated digital experience.
since the launch, we have seen significant growth in the number of new users and improvements in ios and android app store ratings. we also saw increased digital engagement driven by our meal planning to launch last quarter. the meal planning capability inspires our customers to engage in our app more frequently, as we plan, shop, and prepare the recipes we offer. which can be filtered by dietary preferences such as carb-conscious, vegetarian, and pescatarian.
in q1, we had over 1.2 million unique visitors explore our meal signing tool, and over 40% of them used to add to shopping list functionality in the app to create a shopping list. we also continued to invest in the albertsons media collective, using industry-leading technologies to build a platform that is easy to use, transparent, modern, and measurable. we transitioned in-house, and while we are in the very early stages of onboarding clients and agency partners, we are pleased with the growth in the business. second, we are differentiating our store experience, but a deepening engagement through the use of technology to automate task management, thus creating more time for our team members to assist our customers despite a difficult staffing environment.
they're also simplifying the end-to-end shopping journey by improving localized assortments, and adjacencies of complementary products, installing more checkouts, and adding grab-and-go sections to ensure a convenient and easy experience. in support of our omnichannel growth, we are evolving store operations, building out staging areas for drive up and go, adding r[inaudible] for easier picking and installing additional nfc. so we are enhancing what we offer, by expanding our own brand products, and elevating our distinctiveness and fresh. we are actively leveraging the strength of our own brands assortment, and our ability to manage fresh hyper-locally to give customers great choices in the inflationary environment we are at.
in own brands, a sales penetration reached an all time high of 25.8%, and own brand sales outpaced national brands in several categories. in the quarter, we launched 59 new items, including new pita options, and we expect to launch a total of approximately 425 new products this year. but much of the growth in own brands is related to increases in underpenetrated markets and product innovation, the breadth of our own brands portfolio, from opening to premium price points, also provides great value to customers who are trying to stretch their budgets. in fresh, our in-store processing capabilities allow us to tailor the selection, to cut, and package sizes to fit local demographics and economic circumstances.
we are giving customers choices with opening price points and large value packs. our innovation too is gaining traction. for example, we now have rolled out our ready meals, ready-to-eat, ready-to-heat, and ready-to-cook meals to approximately 600 stores, and expect to be in more than 1100 stores by our fiscal year end. but we are modernizing our capabilities in part through an improved supply chain, enhance data and data analytics, and ongoing productivity.
all built on the foundation of being locally great and nationally strong. in supply chain, recurrently increasing automation in two of our largest distribution centers, and expect to continue to roll out similar automation across our network over the next several years. we've also begun the progressive rollout of a new enterprisewide warehouse management system, that is expected to be fully implemented networkwide by fiscal 2025. both these initiatives are expected to materially improve our ability to differentiate our fresh quality, improve in-stock conditions, lower our cost to serve, and improve our end-to-end supply chain data analytics capabilities.
in our stores, we are rolling out ai based and machine learning technologies to improve the customer experience and self-checkout, enhance freshness, and product availability, and produce, and reduce shrink. in addition, we've continued to modernize our technology through cloud migration and the upgrade of our edge computing platform. and finally, the further embedding esg throughout our operations. we launched our new esg framework in april.
recipe for change is focused on maximizing the company's positive impact across four pillars for, planet, people, product, and community. we have a long history of driving sustainability within our operations, and are committed to leveraging our resources and expertise to support the communities we serve and the planet we share. also in april, we began utilizing electric terminal tractors in our distribution centers. in place of diesel powered options, and we have plans to expand our fleet later this year.
we continue to support hunger relief in the communities we serve through food bank donations, and the 7.7 million fundraiser supporting our nourishing neighbors initiative. these funds will provide over 30 million meals to people in need. i will now turn the call over to sharon to cover the details of our first quarter, and our updated 2022 outlook. 
sharon mccollam -- president and chief financial officer
thank you, vivek, and good morning, everyone. it is great to be here with you today. our first quarter results were strong across all key metrics. identical sales were up 6.8%, with momentum continuing into q2.
market share gains in both dollars and units, together with inflation, drove these better than expected results. our q1 22 gross margin rate was 28.1%, excluding fuel and lifo expense, the gross margin rate was lower than q1 21 by 27 basis points. this decrease was driven by fewer covid-19 vaccines versus q1 last year. and consistent with our expectations for the quarter, excluding fuel, lifo, and fewer covid vaccines.
our gross margin rate was slightly ahead of the first quarter last year, due to ongoing productivity improvements ,offsetting higher product ,and supply chain costs. our selling in administrative expense rate with 25.2% this quarter. excluding fuel, the sg&a rate decreased 15 basis points compared to last year. this decrease was primarily driven by lower covid related expenses, and the benefit of productivity initiatives.
these decreases were partially offset by investments related to the acceleration of our digital and omnichannel capabilities, market-driven wage rate increases, and higher depreciation. interest expense in q1 22 decreased $14 million to $139 million. this reduction was primarily driven by a lower outstanding debt balance. q1 22 adjusted ebitda with $1.42 billion compared to $1.31 billion last year.
this $110 million increase was primarily driven by the flow through from our 6.8% i.d. sales increase, and benefits from our productivity initiatives. q1 adjusted eps was $1 per fully diluted share compared to $0.89 in q1 21. i'll now discuss q1 22 cash flow and capital allocation.
we ended q1 22 with $3.2 billion in cash, which provides us with significant liquidity to invest in growth, and return cash to our shareholders. capital expenditures in q1 were approximately $614 million, with the majority of our investments being made in the modernization of our store fleet, and ongoing investments in our digital and omni channel transformation. we also returned $63 million to our shareholders through common stock dividends. net debt leverage at the end of the first quarter was 1.0 times compared to 1.5 times in q1 21.
turning to labor relations, we have continued to reach settlements that are providing an overall wage, and benefit package that rewards our team members for their significant contributions, and strengthen our competitive positioning in the markets we serve. during q1, as previously shared, we settled retail contracts in both northern and southern california, seattle, las vegas, and shaw. and earlier this month, we reached a tentative settlement on the retail contract with dual. i'd now like to discuss our financial outlook, as we look forward to q2 and the rollout of our customers for life strategy.
we do so, with continued momentum as evidenced by our q2 to date mid-single digit id sales increases. we are gaining market share, and continue to see signs of a healthy grocery consumer who is engaging broadly. while we and the industry are seeing a bit of trade down within and out of some categories as consumers stretch their budgets, our share gains in price continue. with that as our backdrop, we have raised our fiscal 22 outlook, assuming the following.
we now expect fiscal 22 id sales to increase 3% to 4%, up 100 basis points versus previous guidance of 2% to 3%, driven by continued inflation and market share gains. in the second quarter, we expect id sales to be above the full year range, and in the back half below due to cycling heightened inflation in the back half of fiscal 21. we are also increasing adjusted ebitda by $100 million to the range of $4.25 to $4.35 billion versus previous guidance of $4.15 to $4.25 billion. our gross margin rate, excluding fuel and lifo, we are expecting core business gross margin rate expansion driven by productivity tailwind.
offsetting this, however, is a continued expectation of a 65% decline in covid vaccinations and related margins, the impact of which will be greater than the core business margin rate expansion. therefore, factoring in both drivers, we are expecting the gross margin rate, excluding fuel and lifo to be down slightly in fiscal 22. in selling and administrative expense, we will continue to incrementally invest in our digital transformation, the albertsons media collective, and the modernization of our supply chain, which will increase our sg&a rate in fiscal 22, but drive growth and productivity longer term. as an example, productivity tailwinds are currently substantially offsetting a significant increase in hourly wages and benefits for our front-line associates in this year's outlook.
that brings us to adjusted eps, which we now expect will be in the range of $2.80 to $2.95 per fully diluted share, up $0.10 versus previous guidance of $2.70 to $2.85 per fully diluted share. to support this outlook, we expect capital expenditures to remain in the range of $2 to $2.1 billion. additionally, as it relates to productivity, we are on track to deliver against our three year commitment of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 22, and are already beginning to roll out action plans to deliver the incremental $750 million between fiscal 23 and fiscal 25 that we shared with you last quarter. and finally, i'd like to provide a brief update on our ongoing review of strategic alternatives.
while we have not yet reached that conclusion, we are pleased to share that as part of the review, our third party appraiser has completed our [inaudible] compliant real estate appraisal, and the overall value of our real estate portfolio has increased $2.5 billion to $13.7 billion, representing a $4 per fully diluted share increase in asset value on a pre-tax basis versus the 2019 appraisal at $11.2 billion. i'll turn the call back over to vivek for closing remarks.
vivek sankaran -- chief executive officer
thank you, sharon. we are pleased with our first quarter results and the momentum we're seeing today. as we look ahead to the balance of the year, we are thoughtful about the macro environment and the possible implications it could have on consumer behavior. our top-tier performance over the last several quarters, even with periods of high inflation, has demonstrated a stronger company today than we were pre-pandemic.
and the initiatives that have driven us strong results give us confidence in our future. first, our customers for life strategy is working. we are adapting quickly and we are executing well. we are adding customers and engaging customers more frequently through our loyalty program and our e-commerce offering.
customers spend more with us, and stay longer with us because we're able to tailor assortment and promotional offers for them. we are giving customers great value choices by adapting our fresh offerings literally every week in every market, and through our strong own brands portfolio. our stores are operating more effectively and efficiently as our supply improves, and new technologies take hold, and we are proactively managing our costs. given recently settled collective bargaining agreements, we have visibility into our labor costs into the future, and our productivity programs with all the new continue to allow for investments, and provide the insulation for our earnings commitments in the event the macro situation becomes more challenging.
we believe this puts us in a strong position to continue to gain market share and sustain our track record of sales and earnings growth. i would like to again thank our 290 thousand associates for their loyalty, and dedication to our customers, and communities. they are the ones who make all of this possible. we will now take your questions.
