good day, and welcome to the duolingo third quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to debbie belevan, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
deborah belevan -- head of investor relations
thank you, operator, and welcome to duolingo's third quarter earnings call. today, we released our third quarter results after the market close. you can find our press release and the accompanying presentation on our ir website at investors.duolingo.com. with me on the call today are luis von ahn, co-founder and chief executive officer; and matt skaruppa, chief financial officer.
after our prepared remarks, we will open the call to q&a. first, i'd just like to remind everyone that during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our future events and financial performance, which are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. we caution you to review the risk factors contained in our sec filings. these forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.
additionally, we will present both gaap and non-gaap financial measures on today's call. these non-gaap measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from a substitute for or superior to our gaap results, and we encourage you to consider all measures when analyzing our performance. and with that, i'd now like to turn the call over to luis. 
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, debbie, and welcome, everyone. i want to start this call with the same topic that i start within many of my presentations about the company, our mission, which is to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available. when we launched duolingo 10 years ago, we decided to start with teaching languages because we believe we can impact an enormous number of people's lives by helping them learn a new language to get a better job or getting to school or even just communicate better on a trip. but you'll notice that we don't say in our mission that we want to develop the best language education in the world.
we say we want to develop the best education in the world. so we don't plan on stopping with just languages. we made strong progress on our mission this past quarter, and we have exciting plans for the future. as i said in our s-1, i plan to devote my life to this mission.
now with that, let's get into the results of our third quarter. this was an exceptional quarter for us. we not only went public, but we also delivered record results. as you can see on our highlights page, we continue to grow our users, our paid subscribers, our bookings, and our revenue, hitting record numbers in all these metrics.
our strong mau and dau growth was driven by continued organic word of mouth, some strategic investment in performance marketing and brand awareness campaigns, and a relentless focus on making our product more fun and engaging. our monthly and daily active users grew 13% and 16%, respectively, over the prior year, which was a period when many parts of the world were still locked down due to covid. we also grew bookings 57% year over year as more learners purchased duolingo plus, our subscription product. because of that, we ended the quarter with 2.2 million paid subscribers, a 49% increase year over year.
our subscribers now represent 5.5% of our monthly active users. i'm also pleased to report we exceeded our revenue and bookings estimates, and as a result, have increased our financial year 2021 guidance. matt will cover the financials in further detail as well as our updated guidance. but now i'd like to share with you some highlights for the quarter, specifically the progress we're making toward our strategic initiatives.
i'll start by discussing the progress we've made in growing users. about 95% of our monthly active users, or maus, are learning completely for free. while just over 5% of them pay for a plus subscription, which removes ads and offers additional features to help people learn faster. our monthly active users have been growing steadily since we started the company.
and this growth is overwhelmingly organic. our very high-quality mobile product that is free, fun, and effective, leads people to telling their friends about it, has made our apps synonymous with language learning, and has driven our consistent growth. by now, we have nearly 42 million monthly active users. this chart also shows the impact of the covid lockdowns last year, which drove a spike in new users.
this quarter, we achieved the highest ever maus in our history, even higher than q2 of 2020 when we saw this surge in activity. as we mentioned on the last earnings call, we believe we are back on trend with our pre-covid growth rates as the world has been opening up, and we think that this quarter's user growth further confirms that. i'd also like to highlight the seasonality of our user growth. you can see from the highlighted sections of the chart, the areas with green circles on them, that the past four years have the same trend.
in november and december, our maus declined during the busy holiday season. and then because of new year's resolutions and people's outlook for the new year, we see a large spike in users in january. those are the parts of the graph that have a steep slope and end in the center of each dark green circle. during this time, we also run our new year's promotion, which is primarily advertised in the app and offers a discounted price for an annual subscription.
the timing of this promotion aligns well with the season of resolutions as the new year inspires people to set personal aspirational goals for the coming year, like, for example, learning a new language. it is a great fit between how users are thinking about themselves, their lives, and our brand, which is one of enriching your life through language learning. the new year is the only time of the year we offer a discount. annual subscribers can also renew each year at a discounted price.
so this new year's cohort is particularly sticky in terms of renewals. after the january spike, we see a general downward trend in maus until the summer months where usage flattens out and then rebounds in the fall. our daily active users or daus follow a similar seasonal path, and we achieved a record high this quarter. internally, we are much more focused on daus because learning a language requires consistency and daily practice, and users that come back to our app every day are more likely to achieve their language goals.
this is why we constantly focus on driving daily engagement, and daus is the key metric we use to measure the effectiveness of that focus. on the topic of seasonality, we thought it would be helpful to provide an overview of the various marketing campaigns we have throughout the year that contribute to the variability in user and booking strengths. our biggest and most impactful is our new year's campaign, which i just went through. but we run other nondiscount campaigns in other parts of the year.
our ipo in july, while not an annual event, was very positive given its high visibility, and we believe it drove some increase in users. another one of my favorite initiatives, which drives awareness and user growth is our annual duocon event, the largest gathering of language lovers from all over the world. we held our third annual duocon conference in august, which was a huge success, drawing a record 350,000 viewers and driving valuable impressions across multiple media channels. the goal of duocon is to provide informative talks by feature language experts, highlight exciting new developments on our products, and provide a behind-the-scenes look at the talent and technology that makes duolingo successful.
next year, we hope to have a hybrid format and hold duocon in person once again, this time in brooklyn. stay tuned for updates. and rounding out the year, we will send out our year-end review in december, which is a personalized summary of our learners' accomplishments during 2021. because it drives a lot of buzz and social media sharing, it helps create word-of-mouth growth.
last year, duo-365.the hashtag we set for the year in review became a trending topic on twitter and generated a nice increase in daus. this year, we look to build on this success by expanding our reach through influencers and other targeted pr. another important strategic initiative for us is to teach better, and we are making important strides in this area. as i've said before, a surface-level look at duolingo can be misleading because the app looks so cute and gamified that many people don't realize the amount of sophistication that is in the background and how much personalization there is in the learning experience.
we know every exercise you've done on duolingo, whether you got it right or wrong. and if you got it wrong, we know the most likely piece of practice you need to learn from your mistake. and we use that data to make a model for each user. so when you start a lesson on duolingo, we use artificial intelligence to pick exercises that are just right for you.
and this leads to very positive learning outcomes. in the previous study, we compared duolingo's effectiveness versus traditional university language courses. we ran the study for people learning french and spanish, and we found that duolingo learners who complete unit five about halfway through the french or spanish course are as proficient in reading and writing as a person who has taken four semesters of university classes. in a new study we just released this quarter, we found that seven units of duolingo is equivalent to five university semesters.
and like our previous study, the duolingo units can be accomplished in half the time than the university semesters, with an app, entirely for free. this is something we're very proud of. in addition to improving efficacy, we're constantly working to make the product more engaging. if you use the app, you're already familiar with our diverse cast of characters who guide learners throughout their lessons and cheer them on.
initially, these characters all had the same computerized voice. but we've been making great progress using text-to-speech technology and giving these characters unique voices and personalities in various languages, and that way, bringing them to life. we think of this as an investment in a brand asset as well. since our cast of characters can make appearances in other apps we develop from duolingo abc, where they are already part of the experience to our upcoming math app.as an example, we just finished production of our first in-app animated short with two of our characters explaining the custom of giving [foreign language] or kisses in spanish-speaking countries.
we rolled this out on our social channels last month. and now i'd like to play it for you to give you a sense of how we're bringing our characters to life by not only teaching language but also culture.[commercial break]
i hope you enjoyed that. we plan to roll out more of these animated shorts within the app in coming months. the idea is that this is how we are going to explain culture the duolingo way. instead of making learners read through boring text, our characters will explain the culture of each language through these fun animated videos.
another initiative we've been focused on is making duolingo more social because learning with friends is more fun, especially when friends can cheer each other on. increasing social interactions on our app has also proven to be very effective in driving engagement. today, roughly 40% of our daily active users are following at least one other user on duolingo, and we're working to drive this percentage higher. we have a feature, internally called kudos, which allows users to congratulate their friends for certain achievements, including strict milestones, completing 10 lessons in a day, and getting promoted to the next league in our leaderboards, just to name a few.
this quarter, we saw a 160% increase in the number of kudos sent by users, highlighting the growing popularity of this feature. today, 8% of our daus are sending or receiving kudos on a given day. we also launched the phone contact sync feature, which makes it easy for our learners to add new friends. early results are very promising.
in the first few days, we already have over 500,000 learners that have opted to sync their contacts with us. even better. many of them are following each other and congratulating each other's learning progress through our kudos feature. we're excited to see our app become even more social in the coming months.
growing paid subscribers is another strategic initiative as this drives the majority of our bookings and revenue, which supports the platform and our mission to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available. today, over 5% of our monthly active users subscribe to our plus offering. in addition to having an ad-free experience, we offer other benefits that help users learn faster. we recently launched two new features for duolingo plus.
one, we call legendary where users who reach a certain level in the app, get their skills to change to a different color. and the other is called mistakes inbox, where we capture in one place mistakes you've made while using the app and give you a chance to focus on practicing those skills. we believe that each of these has had a positive impact on our user conversion from free to paid as well as subscriber retention. and speaking of that, we also spent considerable time improving the retention of our subscribers.
we found that annual subscribers are not only more likely to stick with their language goals, but they have two times the lifetime value compared to monthly subscribers because the retention rate is much higher. these learners on our annual plan now make up roughly 80% of our subscribers. in july, we quietly rolled out our family plan on ios for duolingo plus, which allows up to six users to sign up under the same plan. if our experience is similar to other companies who have rolled out a family plan, then this plan will have even higher retention rates than our individual annual plan, which would further increase the lifetime value of our subscribers.
at this point, we are not broadly advertising the family plan just yet, so we believe we're just getting started. our next strategic initiative is to become the language proficiency standard. our duolingo english test, or det, fall under this initiative. and in q3, we achieved some key milestones, including det's five-year anniversary.
i'm very proud to report that our det delivered strong growth this quarter and year to date. given that we are lapping quarters where the det business expanded extremely rapidly due to covid lockdowns. it's all the more impressive. we believe we've maintained our momentum, and are continuing to build on the strong trends from last year.
as of the end of the third quarter, all of the top 25 u.s. universities in terms of international student volume now accept the det as proof of english proficiency for international undergraduate admissions. today, we have over 3,600 programs worldwide that accepted det, and we are excited about the growth we are seeing. before i turn it over to matt, i'd like to quickly touch on the recent news around app store fees.
last month, google reported that on january 1st, 2022, they would be lowering their app store fees on subscription revenues collected from first-tier subscribers from 30% to 15%. this is a very positive development for us, as today, around 20% of our revenue comes from the google play store. as we've said before, we view the app stores as great partners. they enable us to distribute our product globally and they help us monetize via subscriptions with relatively little friction for the user.
this latest development by google allows us to continue that relationship but at a lower cost so we can reinvest these savings back into our products and learners' experience. and now i'll turn it over to matt.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
thanks, luis. i'm excited to talk to you all about our results this quarter. we not only exceeded expectations on several key metrics, but we also achieved all-time highs. as will become common on these calls, before i get to the detailed financials, i'm going to start with a review of our growth framework to put the numbers in a clearer context.
as to our growth framework. first, we have our language learning app, which generates revenue through subscriptions, advertising, and in-app purchases or iap. second, we have our new initiatives, which include the duolingo english test, or det, as well as other new products that we may monetize in the future. subscriptions, which make up a majority of our bookings, is driven by growing the number of free users, converting more of them into plus subscribers, and increasing the lifetime value of those subscribers.
growth in advertising and in-app purchases is also driven by growing users as well as through optimizing our ad and iap revenue per user. the duolingo english test grows by increasing adoption of the test at institutions and with students taking the test. finally, new product growth will be driven by expanding into new areas beyond language learning, like literacy. now i'll present our q3 results.
as you can see, we delivered strong performance compared to the prior year and achieved record results in bookings, revenue, subscribers, mau, dau, and gross profit. total bookings increased 57% year over year to $73.1 million. subscription bookings increased 64% year over year to $55.4 million. and revenue increased 40% year over year to $63.6 million.
now i'll take you through the key drivers of our results. as i mentioned when i was going through our growth framework, how our language learning business grows, as users grow and as we monetize them better. this quarter, our performance was driven by strong user and subscriber trends. mau increased to a record 41.7 million users, and dau increased to a record 9.8 million users.
paid subscribers grew to 2.2 million subscribers, an increase of 49% over the prior year. our subscribers as a percentage of mau now stands at 5.5%, compared to 4.2% a year ago. as for bookings and revenue, this quarter saw strong growth in those financial metrics as well. subscription bookings were driven by a combination of user growth and higher bookings per mau, which was driven by an increase in subscribers on the annual plan in addition to driving more conversions from enhanced plus features.
as luis mentioned earlier, annual subscribers have about two times the lifetime value as compared to monthly subscribers. we are also encouraged to see annual plan subscriber retention increase in q3 year over year. we ended the quarter with the highest september retention we've seen since 2018. our revenue grew 40% year over year.
it grew slower than bookings because as i mentioned, our bookings increased in part because of a mix shift to more annual plan subscriptions. the revenue for the annual plan is recognized over 12 months. and so the revenue for a large portion of our new annual plan bookings hits in later quarters. our gross margin remains strong at 71.6%, which is 50 basis points higher than during the third quarter a year ago.
we did see a slight quarter-over-quarter decline, which was driven by our det business, where we added additional test proctor and resources. moving on to our non-gaap operating expenses. we report three major categories of costs, r&d, or research and development, sales and marketing, and g&a. r&d increased from 34 to 40% of revenue this quarter and s&m decreased from 24 to 23%.
g&a rose from 15 to 17% of revenues this quarter due to additional headcount, professional fees, and other costs, a significant amount of which were related to becoming a public company. as we have discussed, we expect that over time, we will continue to invest in r&d as we build our amazing product through hiring more engineers, product managers, designers, data scientists, and technical experts. we expect to see operating leverage in the other two cost categories, sales and marketing, and g&a. as a reminder, non-gaap operating expenses represent gaap expenses adjusted for depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and one-time expenses.
this quarter, we recognized approximately $21 million in stock-based compensation. a majority of this was the acceleration of shares and expenses driven by the ipo and from the achievement of certain performance hurdles from our founder share grants. you can find a reconciliation of these items in the appendix. our growth in revenue and stable gross margin was offset by a faster increase in costs, which led to a decline in adjusted ebitda to negative $6 million this quarter.
for the remainder of the year, we expect opex to follow a similar seasonal pattern as last year when q4 opex as a percentage of revenue was a few percentage points below that of q3. we added over $430 million in cash to the balance sheet this quarter driven by the net ipo proceeds and strong bookings growth. free cash flow increased from $0.6 million in the year ago quarter to $5.2 million this quarter. before i get into q4 guidance, i would like to remind you all of what we said during the ipo process about how we think about balancing growth and profitability.
we think that we have a long-term sustainable growth path given the underlying growth of our free users, and the room we have to increase subscriber penetration and monetization. we will grow users and subscribers, primarily by investing in r&d to create an ever more engaging and effective product that will lead to higher engagement and efficacy. we will run the business with cash flow discipline as we have historically, but we will continue to reinvest significantly in talent, especially in engineering, product, and design. now turning to guidance.
for q4 2021, we are guiding to 79 to $82 million of bookings or 38 to 44% year-over-year growth, 66.5 to $69.5 million of revenue or 38 to 44% year-over-year growth, and an adjusted ebitda loss of 3.5 to $6.5 million. for the full year 2021, we are raising our guidance on bookings to 282.5 to $285.5 million of bookings or 49 to 50% year-over-year growth. for revenue and adjusted ebitda, we are guiding to 244 to $247 million of revenue or 51 to 53% year-over-year growth, and an adjusted ebitda loss of 5 million to $8 million. before i wrap up, i just want to reiterate what luis mentioned earlier that there is a considerable seasonality to our business.
we expect to see our user metrics fluctuate throughout the year, especially around holidays and associated marketing campaigns, and our guidance reflects this. as we get into the busy holiday season, we anticipate seeing relatively flat user activity in november and early december, followed by a spike coming from our year-end review, and especially our new year's resolutions of our users. this leads to an increase in usage at the end of december that goes through january. we look forward to providing our 2022 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in early march.
and with that, i'll turn it back over to luis for closing comments.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks, matt. to wrap it up, i would like to thank our incredibly talented team that drives our mission forward every day. i started doing with severin because we believe everybody in the world should have access to high-quality education. every employee at duolingo, whether they're making people want to learn more or helping the rest of the organizations succeed, they contribute to a world where education is available to millions of people.
of course, we're not done yet, but with continued hard work, we will make a huge dent in this goal. i look forward to reporting on our progress in the future.

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from mario lu of barclays. please go ahead.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking my question. first one is on marketing. you guys mentioned, you guys increased strategic marketing in the third quarter.
i believe there's channels such as tiktok or social media channels that you guys tapped into. so just curious what you guys saw into entering these new channels. and then there's also other reports that cultural phenomenons like squid games on netflix drove increased users to learning that language. so anything to talk about there in terms of the overall strategy in terms of marketing? thanks.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, mario, for the question. so the first thing i -- just to remind everybody, our main focus is on product, we're a product-driven company. we're going to continue spending most of our efforts on making our product better so that people tell each other. and so that we grow through word of mouth.
we have been doing all kinds of different marketing. as you saw, and as we mentioned, we've had a lot of success with tiktok. with no expenses whatsoever, we grew our tiktok account basically from zero users to about a million followers. and we're getting a lot of media coverage about that about -- just saying, duolingo is the only brand that understands tiktok.
so we're very happy with that. we are seeing an increase in the number of users that signed up to duolingo that say that they came from tiktok or they heard about duolingo from tiktok. so we're pretty happy with that. the other thing -- you mentioned the squid game that is also something else we saw just an increase in the number of people learning korean through the squid game.
so this is a pretty cool thing. so we're -- that's basically the other thing to say about our marketing is -- there's kind of two buckets of our marketing. one is this bucket that we just talked about is kind of like the tiktok stuff, everything -- things where we don't spend any money. there's the other bucket where we spend money.
and generally, what we're doing there, there's kind of two buckets within that bucket. one is we are doing some marketing in certain geographies that were underpenetrated. and that is we do some influencer marketing and some small amounts of performance marketing. and then the other bucket within this bucket is just experiments.
so we've been experimenting a lot. some of the experiments work, some of the experiments don't work so well. but basically, we're still -- with marketing, we're still in the early days. i mean we really only started paying for marketing in the last couple of years.
so we're still in the kind of test-and-learn setting.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then just one follow-up on social. you guys talked about kudos during your presentation.
so just curious over time -- i know ala carte revenue is still a small percentage of total. but as you kind of increased user engagement, is there a greater opportunity to grow the ala carte revenue? or is this social these initiatives mainly to increase retention? thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
that's a great question. so for now, the majority of our social initiatives are to increase retention. that said, we have recently formed a team to do ala carte in our purchases. and so we do think that that is going to be increasing a little faster than half so far.
but i would like to remind everybody that we are mainly a subscription business, and that will continue being the case for the foreseeable future.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, mario.
operator
the next question comes from justin patterson of keybanc. please go ahead.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you very much. luis, i appreciate you starting with your mission and reinforcing your product-driven company. as you look to reinvest around app store changes, how do you think about allocating capital toward the product side versus potentially passing some of those savings on to the users to bring pricing down and just further grow that subscriber base? thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, justin. thank you for the question. so we are -- i think, as matt said, we are going to continue investing a lot on our product. that's our focus.
we really believe there's a lot of runways to make our product better, and we're happy with where we're at, but there's just a lot -- we can teach a lot better. we can make it significantly more engaging. we can also convert a lot more of our users into paying subscribers by adding feature suit to plus. so we think there's a lot of runways there.
in terms of kind of passing savings to our users, the one thing that reminds me of -- one thing that -- one initiative that we're going to be working on, we have -- we're going to continue working on. we have already been working on this regional pricing. right now, the price of duolingo, the majority of countries have the same price, and we understand that is -- that just has to do with the fact that we're relatively early in our monetization. it really shouldn't be the case that users in a country like colombia pay the same amount as users in the united states.
so you're going to see that over the next few months, we are going to continue having a kind of different pricing per country. we already have four countries where we have different prices, and you're going to be seeing that. and sometimes people ask us, why can't we do that just much faster? it turns out this takes a little time. because whenever we do our regional pricing experiments, we need to figure out what it does to our revenue.
and part of seeing that is we have to look at what it does to resubscriptions or just reups and renewals. and so it takes a little bit of time. but that's one place where we do think that we're going to, i guess, pass on savings to the user.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. and if i could squeeze in one quick follow-up. you have a lot of interesting new features roll out from the mistakes inbox, the legendary. could you talk about just any learnings around engagement and conversion from those product updates? thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, generally -- we do have a bunch of new features. we actually have significantly more features in the pipeline. i mean we run hundreds of a/b tests per quarter.
and so you're going to see our product continually change over time, just get better and better because we run so many a/b tests. i mean the general learnings that we have are that we can increase the fraction of people who subscribe. i mean if you see year ago, the percentage of our maus that were subscribers was something like four-ish percent, whereas we are now at about 5.5% of ours mau subscribers, and that is all through basically adding features like mistakes inbox and legendary or other kind of changes like that. we also -- another big learning is that we can move our user retention.
and this is not just subscriber retention, but also free user retention. we look at this number that we call current user retention rate, which is basically the chance that -- a current user is somebody who used the duolingo today and also another day in the last seven days. current user retention is the chance that they use it today and also come back tomorrow if they use it in the last seven days. we know we can increase that, and we've been increasing that over the last couple of years.
it's gone from something like 65% to close to 80% now. and so that keeps going up and up. and that's generally just good for us, not only because it's good for our free users, but also increases the retention of our paying subscribers. so the big learnings is we can move those numbers.
operator
our next question comes from nat schindler of bank of america. please go ahead.
nat schindler -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes. hi, guys. thanks for taking my question. i was actually just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the learnings you might have seen as kids went back to school.
this was probably the first quarter where we saw a really substantial change from the year prior in schooling. and i wanted to know if that had any impact on usage.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, nat. good question. so every year, around back-to-school time. august, this september.
if you look at our monthly active users' graph or daily active users graphs, every year, we do see an increase in usage, a number of users, and also increase in the amount of time that they use to duolingo as people go back to school. we saw that increase again this year. so it was no different than last year. i don't know if it was zero difference, but it was pretty similar to last year, basically, it's just like every year, we see an increase.
so we're doing that. i should say, our belief is that a significant -- at least in the united states, a significant number of language classrooms use duolingo. our belief is that roughly 40% of language classrooms in the united states are using duolingo in one way or another. so we see that in our numbers compared to the summer -- from the summer to going back to school.
so we saw that this year again.
nat schindler -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
but to be clear, no change with covid without covid, with kids actually physically in school versus doing school from home.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
i don't -- no change that popped up to -- for us to really notice. there may be a small change there, but nothing -- basically, it looks -- the graph looks pretty similar to previous years.
nat schindler -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from ralph schackart with william blair. please go ahead.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
good evening. thanks for taking my question. on the paid subscriber number in the quarter was much better than we had modeled. during the prepared remarks, you talked about increases in annual plans and retention.
any way you could provide a little bit more color there? were these marketing-driven programs to market the annual plans or win-back campaigns and retention? any color there, and i have a follow-up.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
no. happy to provide some additional color. so i think the primary drivers were what we already talked about, the product changes. the product changes as luis mentioned, like the legendary rollout, the mistakes inbox, making the app more social.
i think these things, as we mentioned, do increase conversion. and so that's what we saw over the quarter. the shift to annual plan certainly impacts conversion because those experiments impact the conversion to the annual plan as well, but that actually had a more profound impact on the bookings per subscriber, bookings per mau number. so it was kind of a twofer in that regard.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
great. and luis, you talked about, i think you said four countries, you had different pricing programs. maybe just any color on what you're observing there, and sort of does that lead you to more optimism as you rolled out new pricing strategies to other countries in terms of driving conversion. thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean it -- so with these countries that we saw, we saw an increase in total bookings from these countries whenever we change the price. so that's good. i should mention that in many of these countries, there's -- a lot of the countries where we already monetize well, we think that the price is pretty good, like the u.s.
and the u.k., etc, for a lot of times in developing countries where truthfully, our price is just too high right now because it's the same as the prices in the united states. what we're going to see -- what i think we're going to see is we're going to see possibly increase bookings, but i think -- it's not going to be as immediate as you might think. because i think in a lot of cases, this is for many of these countries, lowering the prices isn't necessary, but not sufficient condition for a lot of people -- a lot more people to describe. i think a lot of times just things like -- for example, in many of these countries, people are just not used to paying for digital subscriptions.
so the way we see it is we have to have the right price, and we're going to do that. but over time, i think we're going to see the penetration in a lot of these countries increase a lot as, for example, they started getting netflix. we just don't think that for many of these countries, we're going to be the first subscription that a lot of people get. but once they're used to getting something like netflix, we think we're going to come soon after.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
great. that's helpful. thanks, luis. thanks, matt.

the next question comes from mark mahaney of evercore isi. please go ahead.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. and luis, i think you began this whole conference call talking about how you wanted the company to be a learning application, a learning platform, not just the language learning platform. so given that, can you just talk about the cadence or the timeline you have in terms of getting into learning -- being a platform where people can learn subjects other than language?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. that's a great question, mark, because it's something that i think about a lot. and like you said, i mean, our goal has always been to be -- to develop the best education in the world, and not just language education, and then make it universally available. that's our mission.
that's our goal. so we've started -- and we've been working on languages for this whole time. one of the key things that we know is that a lot of the technology that we have can be applied to teach other subjects. for example, a lot of our gamification where we have technology built for that or also a lot of our personalization systems that try to really figure out what is the best thing to teach to each user at each time.
all of that can be reused to each many not other subjects, maybe not every single subject in the world, but many other subjects. so we are going to be reusing that and making other products. we do have one other project -- product out there called duolingo abc, which we launched last year. we are also working on a product to teach elementary school math.
it's just going to be a mobile app. my best guess is this is going to be launched next year. although i will tell you, i've been working on developing products, digital products for the last 20 years. and it's very hard to give a precise timeline on when this is going to happen.
i think we're going to be able to launch that next year. and then just in -- the other thing that i will say is as you've seen for us as a company, we are not a company that puts out a product and then puts $50 million of marketing behind this product to make it grow from one day to the next. our belief is that really good products should grow by themselves mostly. so we are going to put this out, but i would not expect that next year, for example, our math app suddenly has 50 million users and make $50 million of revenue.
that's unlikely. so i would say, at least for next year, it's not likely that we're going to see any of this affect our revenue, but we're going to be putting these products out and working on them for a while, and having -- growing them through product improvements.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
yep. i got it, luis. and emphasis on leading with product makes a ton of sense. i get that.
the other question i wanted to ask is, i know this is a small part of your revenue stream now advertising. could you talk a little bit of -- double click a little bit on products -- product development for advertisers? and i don't think that's a top priority for you. i think it's really about users and consumers, etc. but just talk about where you are in terms of having marketing solutions that are good for marketers and advertisers on your platform.
thanks.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. it's a great question. i mean as you know, so i don't know the exact numbers, about 10% of our revenue comes from advertising. and a few things to say.
the first thing to say is, as you correctly said, we are mainly focused on subscriptions. we really believe that is the right thing to do. so we're mainly focused on subscriptions. and right now, our ads -- basically, our free users, which is 95% of our users, give or take, see ads.
and most of the ads they see are -- well, all the assets they see our programmatic ads that come from ad networks like google or facebook. that's kind of what we have. a couple of things to say. our ads business has been growing pretty nicely.
i mean it's been growing about as fast as the rest of our businesses. so that's good. and we believe that it will continue growing. it will also grow just naturally as our users grow as business will grow.
we also do have some optimizations to do, for example, trying to figure out which users may just never subscribe to duolingo plus, and then we just would monetize entirely through ads or also trying to figure out if there are users that are more ok with a higher ad load. so there's some optimizations to do. the one thing that i will say is that you should not expect that we will suddenly triple our ad revenue or anything like that because i just don't want to make a free user experience crappier. right now, we feel pretty good with our ad load.
it's not that heavy. and our fear -- and not just that fear, we see it in our numbers. if we suddenly start tripling the ad load or something like that, engagement goes down. so we're -- we like a free user experience, and we're going to keep it that way.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. makes sense. thanks for the tutorial earlier on that [foreign language] tradition cultures. just add in there which countries take two in which countries it takes three kisses.
that always confuses me. thanks so much.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
mark, i am from latin america. i don't know the answer to that question. so yes, that has confused me too.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
the next question comes from aaron kessler of raymond james. please go ahead.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thanks. a couple of questions. maybe just on google play.
matt, you mentioned that how should we think about that starting to impact the model? obviously, we believe it kind of goes from 30% to 15%. but should we start to think about that impacting the model on 2022. do you happen to have the share count for the quarter as well? it's probably in the q, but i didn't see in the release.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yeah. no. glad you asked the question. as luis mentioned, just real quick in the opening remarks, the app store fees are obviously undergoing a lot of change, and we're paying very close attention to that.
but we view them as good partners historically that hopefully continue to be good partners. and so we view this as just a nice tailwind for us. and then the google play fee decrease for subscribers that are less than one year old, that will impact our margins next year, starting in january 1, 2022, on bookings that occur after that date. and so yes, we expect to see a nice tailwind there on the margin side.
and after that, it's anyone's guess what happens outside of google. for the share count, the fully diluted share count is -- depending on the stock price, if it's around 60, it's around 46 fully diluted. the weighted average share count is in the q. so i'm not sure which one you're looking for.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. yep, that's helpful. maybe just quickly on the google play, again. so should we expect the impact to start to impact kind of current revenues in cogs? or is it only when you sign up new subscribers, and then that would flow through?
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yeah. it's only going to be on new flow through -- because yeah, the folks that got bookings this year, for example, like right now, if you signed up for the annual plan, you paid us $80 through the google play store, that's going to be at a 30%. on january 1st, that drops to the 15. so it's really only on go-forward revenue.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. ok. great. thank you.

good day, and welcome to the duolingo fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] after management's opening remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask the question. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to debbie belevan, head of investor relations.
please go ahead.
debbie belevan -- head of investor relations
thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to duolingo's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. today, after market closed, we released a shareholder letter with our results and commentary, which you can find on our ir website at investors.duolingo.com. with me on the call today are luis von ahn, co-founder and ceo; matt skaruppa, cfo; and bob meese, our chief business officer. we'll begin with some brief remarks before opening the call to q&a.
just to remind everyone that during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our future events and financial performance, which are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. we caution you to review the risk factors contained in our sec filings. these forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. additionally, we will present both gaap and non-gaap financial measures on today's call.
these non-gaap measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, a substitute for, or superior to our gaap results, and we encourage you to consider all the measures when analyzing our performance. and with that, i'd now like to turn the call over to luis. 
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, debbie, and welcome, everyone. we are a global company that serves learners in every country in the world. i want to start by acknowledging the horrible situation in ukraine, saying that we stand with all those working toward peace and that our hearts are with the ukrainian people. since our shareholder letter contains an in-depth discussion of our performance, we'll just provide some brief remarks and then get right into q&a.
first, as i always do, i'd like to start out by reminding everyone about our mission. since we started the company, our mission has been to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available. everything we do is guided by this mission. we started out with languages to help reduce economic inequality.
but we are expanding into other areas of education in order to touch even more people's lives. i'm very proud to say that we've made tremendous progress toward our mission, but we are just getting started. i'd also like to congratulate our entire team on the amazing performance they delivered in 2021. not only did we take the company public, but we also delivered incredible user and subscriber growth.
our total bookings and revenue both grew by 55%. our team continued its unwavering focus on creating quality products that are fun and effective. in 2021, we rolled out a number of new product innovations that further increased the user engagement and retention and, ultimately, drove more conversions to our premium subscription. in fact, during the fourth quarter, we had the highest number of daus, maus, and net new subscribers ever.
we also continue to build a beloved brand that is synonymous with language learning. the vast majority of our growth comes organically through word of mouth. as we move into 2022, we'll continue building upon this momentum. we're planning to introduce an entirely new design of the duolingo app home screen that we believe will further drive user engagement.
we'll continue making duolingo more social, with features that allow learners to interact with each other. we'll continue to grow acceptance of the duolingo english test by institutions around the world. we'll refine the duolingo abc app with a fresh design to drive engagement and learning efficacy. and we are excited to launch a math app toward the end of the year.
and now, matt will discuss our outlook for 2022.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
thanks, luis. first, i'd like to reiterate that it was a great year for our business, and we are very proud of our performance. our product and marketing initiatives paid off, and we surpassed our own high expectations, resulting in record metrics and accelerating growth in the fourth quarter. looking ahead to 2022, we plan to continue prioritizing our investment in r&d in order to fuel growth, make our products even better, and increase our monetization opportunities.
for q1 2022, we are guiding to 92 million to 95 million for total bookings, 75.5 million to 78.5 million for revenue, and adjusted ebitda of negative 5.5 million to negative 2.5 million. and for the full year 2022, we are guiding to 372 million to 382 million for total bookings, 332 million to 342 million for revenue, and adjusted ebitda of negative 5 million to negative 1 million. i want to make sure to point out that our full year guidance takes into account our typical bookings seasonality, with q1 and q4 being our strongest quarters. this seasonality was confirmed in the fourth quarter of last year.
we plan to invest significantly in r&d this year, in engineering, product, and design. and for us, that means investing in talent. we believe we have been a beneficiary of the great resignation that started last year, as we have added some very talented new employees to our team while keeping the talent we have. our attrition rate was less than 6% last year.
we believe this trend will continue, and we want to seize the opportunity. we have been able to attract talent because of our mission-driven and fun culture, and we believe that that has helped us grow. this approach to growth through investment in our product is consistent with how we've grown historically, and that's what we plan to do in our language learning app, in the det, abc, and in our math product. on the marketing side, we plan to continue to spend on influencers and innovative brand marketing and under-penetrated markets, and then continue to invest in highly efficient performance marketing like our global dau campaign.
we also plan to expand our marketing efforts related to bringing in new test-takers to the det. as we have since our founding, we plan to continue to manage the business with cost and capital discipline, as we did last year, which is why we are confident in our adjusted ebitda guidance that is nearly breakeven. and now, i'll turn it back to luis.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, matt. before we wrap up, i'd like to take this opportunity to thank each and every team member for all your hard work this year, to thank our learners who put their trust in us, and to thank our shareholders for all your support. we look forward to sharing more with you in the coming quarters. and now, we would be happy to take your questions.

we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and our first question will come from mario lu of barclays. please go ahead.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. so, the first one is on conversion, you know, coming in at 6.2%, it's a pretty big improvement even from the third quarter. just curious if you could, you know, identify what kind of drove this improvement and what conversion percentage is implied in the fiscal '22 guidance? and then secondly, within -- the ebitda margin guidance of flat for '22, matt, i was wondering if you could talk a bit about each of the cost items.
should we expect, you know, leverage in cogs due to the google play changes and also in sales and marketing g&a and that being offset fully by marketing? any color there would help. thanks.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
hi, mario. this is luis. so, you know, first, you ask, you know, what drove the increase in the conversion? you know, as you saw, we increased conversion by about 2 percentage points in the year. and that's -- you know, basically, we've seen increases in conversion ever since we launched, you know, duolingo plus, our subscription package, in 2017.
we were increasing about 1 percentage point per year. we seem to have increased it by about 2 percentage points in the last year. and the way we've been increasing it this whole time is just by running literally hundreds of a/b tests to get more people to convert. the types of -- you know, some of these are very small a/b tests.
they're just things that -- you know, just changes to the purchase page. some of them are bigger things like new features to the premium package. so, it's just basically been a lot of things. a couple of things that were particularly big this year.
one of them was called the legendary feature, which is basically just the change in color, you know, if you -- for some of the skills. so, the red circles in our home screen, they're called skills. and before the legendary, there you can only basically go around that circle five times. we added a sixth time.
and you can only do that if you were a plus subscriber. and that added, you know, more conversion. and so, there's stuff like that drove it. i'll let matt add the -- answer the couple of other questions, including, you know, what's the implied rate?
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yeah, thanks, mario, for that. when it comes to cost and gross margin, as you mentioned, there were -- as we mentioned on the last call, we're still expecting, you know, about 150-basis-points improvement mainly from the google play and shift in costs. so, that still holds from last call. and then to your point around operating leverage, you know, as we've mentioned multiple times before, we plan to continue to invest in r&d.
so, you should not expect to see operating leverage in that as a percentage of revenue. however, in sales and marketing, we do expect operating leverage over the course of the year. and on g&a, just given this is our first full year being public, it'll be, you know, pretty close. not a ton of operating leverage there than this year.
so, thanks. yeah, that's a good question.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks, luis, and thanks, matt.
operator
the next question comes from eric sheridan of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
eric sheridan -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you so much for taking the questions. two, if i could. maybe following up on mario's question about the margins, can you help unpack where some of the dollars on the marketing side might be aimed, either from a qualitative or quantitative standpoint? you talked a little bit about under-penetrated markets and sort of driving greater product adoption, but maybe we can get a little more granular on where those dollars get spent and how you think about the return of those dollars, not just in 2022, but as the platform continues to scale in 2023? thanks so much.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, eric, for your question. so, you know, the first thing to know is the vast majority of our growth is organic, so most of our growth comes from word of mouth. though we are spending some in marketing. i mean, what we've decided to do is, you know, we take -- we have a number of markets that are just less penetrated.
in particular, asia is the fastest-growing market, but it is less penetrated than all our other markets like, you know, europe and the americas. so, we're -- what we do is we typically pick a country. there's a few that we target. and then we try to decide which are the best ways to market.
we have found that influencer marketing works pretty well in certain countries like india and japan, for example. and then, you know, we spend some money. the amount that we spend per country is not a lot. so, a country the size of japan is probably -- you know, we would spend maybe 1 million or 2 million in the year.
and then what that does is that it gets our organic flywheel going, the word of mouth going, and then that just takes up -- takes us up. another example -- and by the way, this is kind of the paid marketing, but actually, a lot of our marketing effort has also gone on just things that are not paid, for example, our tiktok, you know, for those of you who have seen it. i mean, this is -- we don't spend money on that. this is entirely organic.
and our tiktok, you know, have gotten literally over 500 million views just because, you know, our brand is so strong that we're able to really appeal to, you know, all the tiktok users. so, this is the type of stuff that we do.
eric sheridan -- goldman sachs -- analyst
great. thank you so much for the color, appreciate it.
operator
the next question comes from aaron kessler of raymond james. please go ahead.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. a couple of questions. my first, if you can update us on the regional pricing initiative, kind of the progress you're making there.
maybe along the same lines, maybe if you can give us an updated breakout of u.s. versus international for revenues or bookings and paid subs? and then maybe finally, just duolingo for schools. are you starting to see this effort also drive kind of increased subscriptions as well for at-home usage? thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
great questions. so, you know, the -- in terms of regional pricing, you know, just to give some background. when we ipo-ed or right before we ipo-ed, we have the same price in every single country in the world. we knew, of course, that was not optimal.
and what we've done since then, we started trying different prices in a few countries. and so far, there are four countries where we've launched different prices. and we are working on doing it basically for every country in the world. the reason you can't change this super fast is because everything we do, of course, we a/b test.
and these a/b tests take a little while to run because, you know, whenever we run a new price on something, first of all, we try multiple prices. and then what we're doing is it takes a while for people to know. whenever they sign up on duolingo, it takes a while for them to subscribe for some of them. and also, we are -- we have to measure renewal rates, which take a while to measure.
so, some of this is, you know, if -- you know, it takes some time. but i think, throughout this year, we are going to basically -- you know, probably have different prices in every single country. now, what i will say is this is just one of many levers that we have for increasing conversion and also increasing bookings. you know, ultimately, the way we increase our bookings and our penetration of paid subscribers is by running, again, hundreds of a/b tests.
this is just one of those levers. and i will say the other thing about regional pricing is we believe that this will have an impact. however, it's not -- probably not going to have this insane impact that some people may believe where like, you know, it's going to double revenue or something because what's happening is that, you know, the countries that we get most of our bookings from usually are the developed countries. so, you know, the u.s., western europe, etc.
in those places, the prices are unlikely to change too much. now, in the places where the prices are likely to change more, these are usually more, you know, kind of developing countries or whether the gdp per capita is lower. there -- and so, we will change -- our product is probably too expensive, so we will probably lower the prices, what will end up happening. but there's more than one barrier in many of those countries for people to subscribe.
probably, you know, the price is one. another one, it's just that, in many of these countries, digital subscriptions are just not that mature as they are in a country like the u.s. or in western europe. so, we see regional pricing as something that is a necessary condition for us to really, you know, make a lot more bookings from any of these countries, but not necessarily a sufficient condition.
so, that's just something that is important. i will also answer -- you asked about schools, the schools initiative. so, just also to give you some context, we have this thing called duolingo for schools. it is a dashboard that teachers can use when their students -- so their students are using just the normal duolingo app.
and duolingo for schools is a dashboard that teachers can use to track their students' progress. we relaunched duolingo for schools in 2021. that did really well, and we're seeing it definitely get more and more adoption in schools. right now, our best belief -- by the way, we don't know exactly how many schools use us because they don't have to tell us necessarily that they use us.
so, you know, our best belief is that about 40% of u.s. language teachers use duolingo for schools, and that's in the u.s. there's, you know, other numbers internationally. so, we're seeing that it help with adoptions.
so far, you know, we don't have any reports on what exactly this does for our subscriptions. but, you know, we are assuming that many of these students in the end ultimately are subscribing as well. so, the main thing that is helping with is growing our user base.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
and then, aaron, just to jump in there on one of your questions on u.s. versus the rest of world. it didn't change materially from 2020, which -- in 2021, it was about 44%, 45% u.s., and the remainder, rest of the world. so, that stayed pretty consistent.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
and that's bookings?
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
revenue.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
revenue. that's revenue.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst

our next question comes from ralph schackart of william blair. please go ahead.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
good evening, thanks for taking the question. on the family plan, in the letter, you talked about seeing some early results that you were encouraged by and increasing the visibility of that this year. just curious what you're seeing, and it's probably early, but just any thoughts on that product and thoughts on conversion and how that might impact you in 2022 and going forward?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, family plan. thank you, ralph, for your question, by the way. that's something that we're very excited about. i do want to remind you and everyone that, you know, family plan is one of many, many levers that we have to pull.
you know, regional pricing is another one. but it's just -- ultimately, the way we grow our bookings is just by running hundreds and hundreds of a/b tests. family plan is one we're very excited about. it's in its early days right now.
i mean, it's in -- you know, low percentage points of all our subscribers are in the family plan, but it is growing pretty fast actually. and we're very excited by it for two reasons. the first one is that it really seems to increase lifetime value of our subscribers because what ends up happening is, you, you know, subscribe for a family plan for your family, but also, you know, your significant other is in that family plan and maybe your son and your daughter in that family plan. and maybe you stopped using duolingo.
but as long as anybody in your family is still using it, you still keep paying. so, we have data that really shows that those who are in the family plan just have significantly better retention in terms of payers. so, we're very excited by that. this should help with our retention quite a bit.
and then the other reason why i'm personally excited, and this is more in the long term, the more we can have people in our family plan, the more we know, you know, they're a family. and, you know, a lot of the products that we're working on, for example, we're working on a math app for elementary school math. we launched the duolingo abc already, which is our literacy app for, you know, kids to learn how to read ages, call it, three to six. those are people who belong in a family.
and the more we have, you know, people in our family plan subscription on duolingo, the more we'll be able to cross-promote these other products there. so, the way we see it -- i mean, we're not yet doing that. but the way we see our family plan is going to be a really strong glue for many of our new products. so, this is why we're excited by it.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
great. thanks for this. maybe -- i just had one more, just as, you know, you talked about broadening out beyond languages, maybe specifically math. just curious how the testing is going? i know you do quite a bit of testing.
and just curious just in terms of the rollout, how -- why that will be -- will it be focused on certain geographic areas? but just the way you plan to roll that out would be helpful to know. thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
great. so, yes, the math app, we're working on it. you know, of course, i'm biased, but it looks beautiful. but we're working on it.
we have not released that yet. we're going to release it this year. i cannot comment yet on exactly what the rollout plan is because we haven't quite decided on that. but, you know, pretty likely, that's going to be, at least, you know, in english-speaking countries.
i don't know if we're going to localize it to other english on -- at the very beginning, on day one. but yeah, we're going to roll that out, and that's something that we're pretty excited by it. i should say one thing that i think is important for people to understand. we're going to roll it out, and it's going to be great.
but the way we do product at duolingo is we have our products grow organically. so, we're going to put it out, and it's going to take some time for it to really start growing. and then after it has grown to a reasonable size, then we're going to start monetizing it in some sort of freemium manner because that is what we do at duolingo, and that's going to take some time. so, my sense is, you know, if you're expecting the math app to give any kind of meaningful revenue this year, basically, that's not something you should expect.
and probably not even next year. my sense is we're going to launch this year. we're going to use next year to grow the user base quite a bit, and then probably have meaningful revenue, you know, after that.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
makes sense. thanks, luis. really helpful.
operator
the next question comes from justin patterson of keybanc. please go ahead.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you very much. luis, it sounds like a meaningful year for innovation in the core language app. how do you think about the impact, the redesign, and more social features could have upon engagement and conversion versus prior future rollouts like hearts and legendary? and then for matt, the transition to more annual memberships has been very positive toward ltv.
given that dynamic, how do you think about the pace of reinvestment across marketing and engineering? thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, justin. these are great questions. i mean this because i love to, you know, talk about our innovation. so, yes, we're very excited about a number of features that we're pulling out this year.
one is this redesign of the home screen. again, i think it looks beautiful. we're going to start testing it. and i think it's going to have a number of, you know, good effects.
i think -- our hope is that it's going to improve user retention, free user retention, in particular. we also think it's going to help us teach better. i mean, the new redesign has been really done with a lot of input from our learning scientists. so, i think it's going to help us teach better.
and i also think it's going to simplify the app quite a bit. you know, one of the things about the duolingo app is, you know, as we become more mature, it's become more and more complex. and, you know, we like simplification. i think that's going to help quite a bit.
so, we have a lot of things. you know, that's just one thing. but we're doing a number of other features that you'll see, you know, and you should probably just download the app and see how much it changes over the year. i think, matt, the next question. 
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, justin. it's a great point about the focus on ltv. i'm just glad you asked that question in that way because it gives me a chance to just echo something luis has already said, which is, you know, we run a bunch of tests, hundreds of tests every quarter and every year to experiment with ways to increase subscriber ltv.
you mentioned hearts and health, which is a great improver of ltv. the annual plan is one. family plan is another. but these are just examples of some of the ways that we are continually focused on improving ltv over time.
and that's really how we think about our growth opportunities. we have growth opportunities in the main language learning app. we have growth opportunities in assessment, in literacy, and in math, as luis just mentioned. and so, we're excited to deploy capital against those opportunities because we think there's high returns there.
and specifically, to go back to something i've mentioned, and i'm a bit of a broken record on, we really like to invest our capital into talent, and specifically talent in r&d, so that they can execute against all those experiments and capitalize on the opportunities we see to have, those high rois. that's why this year, again, you should not expect to see operating leverage in our r&d line. and while we've gotten much more efficient in marketing, and we have really innovative playbooks, especially in the developing markets, and we're going to spend an absolute dollar more in marketing, we will expect or we do expect to see operating leverage in marketing as opposed to r&d.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you.

the next question comes from nat schindler of bank of america. please go ahead.
nat schindler -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yes, hi, guys. thanks for this. and you guys did such a great job increasing your conversion to paying this year, obviously. can you walk us through and maybe break that number down a little bit by, you know, maybe a little bit by region? i assume that's much higher in the u.s.
and europe, and the developed world. and i wanted to know when do we hit a what you think is a functional barrier? where is the pay -- where could it go?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
well, thank you for this question, nat. i think -- so -- ok, there's a couple of things. so, you're right. generally, payer conversion is higher in, well, wealthier countries.
but that's generally the case. we don't think we are anywhere near a kind of a wall. you know, as you saw, there's actually an acceleration of -- you know, by percentage points of how we're growing there. it's very hard to say how high we can get.
i mean, basically, the way we grow this, again, is by basically just running, you know, hundreds of a/b tests that get more and more people to subscribe. we have a long list of a/b tests still to run over the next, you know, several years. we have a lot of levers that we can pull. and so, we think that that's going to continue growing.
but it's very hard for us to know, you know, how much it's going to grow. i mean, right now, we're around 6%, 6.2% or something like that of our monthly active users are paying subscribers. you know, you could look at comps. so, our business model is pretty similar to the dating apps.
and, you know, there are -- they -- those are at around 12%. our business model is also pretty similar to spotify, which is, you know, around 50%. i don't actually think we're going to get to 50%. but i don't -- i see no reason why we can't get to something like where the dating apps are.
but again, i really want to caution here, saying, ultimately, i don't know how high it can get. this is just something that we're going to continue increasing over the next few years. you know, the last thing i would say, even though duolingo has been around for about 10 years, our monetization is still pretty early. i mean, we only started monetizing in, you know, 2017, kind of, you know, toward the end of 2017 that we started in earnest.
so, you know, there's just a lot that we don't know and a lot of opportunity still.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yeah. and, nat, the only thing i would add to that is just to go back to what i said on the last earnings call about our growth framework. and so, it's not just user penetration. obviously, that's an important metric that we track, and we're driving that up.
but remember, we saw a return to pre-covid level user growth rates. we saw a reacceleration of user growth as well. so, we have multiple ways to increase our monetization. user growth, obviously, growing nicely is great.
and we're heartened by that. the other two things that are really underlying that metric are retention and conversion, both of which we saw really strong trends in q4 that we believe will continue on. so, you know, it's really on all three of those dimensions: user growth, retention -- sorry, user growth, conversion, and retention, we're just doing really well on.
nat schindler -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok, then to just follow up on this, just a tiny bit. on top of just the demographic shift toward -- the geographic shift of payers versus nonpayers, so it's heavily in first-world countries. not surprising. isn't there also a demographic shift? i'll tell you your family plan.
do many of those kids who are doing this for school pay or is it mostly adults who are using it [audio gap] self-improvement or learning before they go on a trip or something?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, that's a great question. you know, one of the interesting things about working on duolingo is that, you know, our user base is just so wide. we really have -- you know, we really have kids aged six using duolingo to, you know, adults aged literally 100, like we get stories from.
and it's pretty much just -- the main thing that tells you whether somebody is going to pay or not so far, is, you know, kind of how much money they have. that's basically it. but yeah, i don't think there's a much of a -- i don't think we have seen much in terms of, you know, kind of age, distributions, etc.
nat schindler -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
the next question comes from andrew boone of jmp securities. please go ahead.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst
good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking my question. two, please. following up on justin's questions, can you guys offer some compelling metrics in the growth of congratulatory messages? can you talk about increasing social interaction on the platform and just help us understand the benefits that that brings? is that usage, engagement, or anything else? and then question number two is just talk about the impact from omicron in december and january. is there anything to call out there and is there anything else to think about as we think about additional variants or just broadly the reopening? thanks so much.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
great, andrew. thank you for the questions. ok. so, social -- i mean, social, as i said in the shareholder letter, social is one of the things i'm most excited about.
we've been -- we really started working on social in earnest over roughly the last year. you know, we have a team behind it, but it's a very high-performing team. and, you know, what they've done is, well, they've added basically a social layer behind duolingo where people can follow each other and send congratulatory messages. we've had a lot of growth on that.
i mean, like i said in our shareholder letter, at the beginning of the year, we probably have -- had about 1% of our daily active users were sending congratulatory messages to each other. by now, it's about 10%. we also have -- the number of people that follow at least -- the number of daily active users that follow at least three other learners on duolingo is now 25%. so, we really are a much more social app than we were, you know, even a year ago.
that's going to continue happening. and the way we're going to continue increasing that is by basically, you know, letting people do more with their connections. so -- and, you know, i can't really tell you exactly what these things are because we're testing, you know, a lot of different things, but we're going to be letting them do more things with, you know, with their friends. and we've seen that that actually moves our kpi.
it gets people to spend more time on the app. it gets people to come back to the app more, you know, more days. so, it increases user retention. and it also -- you know, because they're spending more time and retaining better, are also -- it's also increasing the fraction of people that actually pay for a subscription.
so, the social component really is having an impact on the kpi. the other thing that i really like about the social component is that it adds network effects. so, it's something that, you know, now that your friends are also on duolingo, you know, duolingo just gets better the more people that use it. and then that's something that we're very proud of.
and then you also asked -- so that's for social. you asked about omicron? you know, honestly, we didn't see much of that. you know, for us, we're not -- you know, there's some products or something that got humungous quadruple boom or something whenever there was, you know, covid. we did get a boom at -- you know, in 2021, there was, you know, the first kind of wave of covid.
after that, you know, unless there's like really strict lockdowns, we don't see much of an impact. so, you know, what has happened to our growth rate is we were growing organically before covid. and just as we're growing this whole time, then covid came in. for the first, you know, two or three months of covid, we did see an increase.
then after that, we saw a slight decrease when the world opened back up. and since then, we've basically been going back to pre-covid growth rates, and this is what we're observing now. and this is why you saw, for example, an acceleration of the growth rate of our maus and daus in the fourth quarter because, basically, we're now back to pre-covid growth rates.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] and our next question will come from mark mahaney of evercore isi. please go ahead.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. two questions, please. first, maybe you covered it earlier, i didn't hear. they -- in the quarter, you added -- there were 700,000 maus.
that seemed like a big number. the last two december quarters, you actually had a sequential decline. so, just talk through that. like what is -- was there something unusual in the corner -- quarter that causes mau growth to be so strong and just thinking about how we want to extrapolate that going forward? and maybe it's just we shouldn't rely on the prior years because you -- the company was too small.
but just is there any color behind that 700,000?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a great question. you know, it's just a lot of things that are working really well. one of the things that i think is unique to the fourth quarter, but i think we're going to see it in every fourth quarter going forward, is our year in review campaign. that is something that we, you know, kind of discovered, you know, over the last couple of years where the idea is that, you know, around, call it, december 15, there's a thing that basically shows up in your app that tells you that here's how you did the whole year, and then you can share that.
it turns out a lot of people like sharing this because they feel good, telling everybody that this year they learned italian or they learned german or something. so, it's some -- it's like a feel-good thing. so, when we put that out there, it really -- you know, we got literally millions and millions of shares in social media. we became a top 10 trending topic on twitter, duolingo hashtag, you know, duolingo 365 or something became a trending topic on twitter because of that.
so, it's a specific fourth quarter thing that we are probably going to be seeing there. another thing that has worked really well for us in the fourth quarter was our tiktok. again, this is a completely unpaid, you know, marketing thing. it's just basically we have a tiktok channel, and because our brand is so strong and we really have -- you know, we've done a lot of really good stuff with our mascot in tiktok, it appeals to a lot of people, and with essentially no marketing spend.
i mean, we're not spending any marketing other than, you know, the salary of the people who were doing this. you know, we've gotten over 500 million video views on tiktok. and, you know, as far as i know, we're probably the brand that gets the most interactions on tiktok of all brands. so, i think that's another thing that has been, you know, pretty, pretty good.
and in addition to that, of course, the thing that always helps us, which is just continuous product improvements.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
and, mark, you asked about extrapolation just on a go forward. you know, we have said historically our pre-covid mau growth rate was about, you know, anywhere between 10% and 15%, and our dau growth rate was around 20%, plus or minus, and that's kind of what we're seeing. and so, as you think about that before where, you know, we don't have any reason to believe we're not back at those levels of growth. and then our historical seasonality is probably at play as well.
you know, the 2020 and some of 2021 seasonality was a little bit, you know, muddled because of the covid spikes. but we think we're back to the normal, not only growth rates but also seasonality throughout the course of the year. 
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. and if i could ask one more question on the math product. so, luis, what -- can you just give us just a tease of what this thing is? i mean, are we doing basic elementary math? are we doing, you know, calculus? are we doing sophisticated wall street math? that was a joke. but just like, who's the market going to be for this math product when it comes out?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
mark, it is a slide ruler. i'm kidding. [inaudible] so, it's an app, of course. that's what we do.
you know, we're going to start with elementary school math. so, think of -- actually, you know, i use the app every single day because, you know, i test it every single day. i've gotten very good at fractions. i will tell you.
so, it's basically elementary school math.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. if i could just put in a request. if you could -- if you were going to launch it, do it before september. i'm just asking on behalf of a friend.
but that's when this [inaudible]
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
ok.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
appreciate that.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
on behalf of a third grader that you may know. got it.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
yeah, thank you. i'm good.

2022-Q1,DUOL,2022-05-12 17:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, and welcome to the duolingo first quarter 2022 earnings call. all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. in consideration of time, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question.
[operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to debbie belevan, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
debbie belevan -- head of investor relations
thank you, operator, and welcome to duolingo's first quarter 2022 earnings call. today, after market close, we released a shareholder letter with our q1 results and commentary, which you can find on our ir website at investors.duolingo.com. today's call will be led by luis von ahn, our co-founder and ceo; matt skaruppa, our cfo; and bob meese, our chief business officer. we'll begin with some brief remarks before opening the call to q&a.
just to remind everyone, during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding future events and our financial performance, which are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. some of these risks have been set forth in the risk factors of our periodic reports filed with the sec. these forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. additionally, we will present both gaap and non-gaap financial measures on today's call.
these non-gaap measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, a substitute for or superior to our gaap results, and we encourage you to consider all measures when analyzing our performance. and with that, i'll turn the call over to luis. 
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, debbie, and welcome, everyone. as usual, i want to kick off the call by reminding you of our mission, which is to develop the best education in the world and make it universally available. we work to achieve this mission by continually innovating and improving our products so that they are fun and effective. now on to our first quarter results.
since a shareholder letter contains an in-depth discussion of this quarter's performance, matt and i will provide some brief remarks and then get right into q&a. q1 of 2022 was our best quarter yet. we achieved new highs on nearly every metric. in fact, we surpassed our own performance expectations, which led us to raise our full year guidance.
we are now projecting full year bookings growth well above 30% and also expect to be profitable for the year on an adjusted ebitda basis. the reason behind this stellar performance is clear: our product-focused strategy is working. thousands of a/b tests that we run to make our products better are materializing in the form of stronger word-of-mouth user growth, stronger paying subscriber conversion rates, and higher overall retention. our user growth accelerated from the previous quarter.
we converted a record number of new paid subscribers, and we retained more of our previous subscribers. all of this resulted in total bookings growth of 55% this quarter compared to q1 of last year. and now matt will discuss our updated outlook for 2022.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
thank you, luis. as luis just highlighted, we had a tremendous quarter, and because of that, we are announcing that we are raising our full year guidance. for q2 2022, we are guiding to $86 million to $89 million in total bookings, $84 million to $87 million in revenue, and an adjusted ebitda of negative $4 million to negative $1 million. for the full year 2022, we are increasing our guidance to $388 million to $397 million in total bookings, $349 million to $358 million in revenue, and an adjusted ebitda of zero to positive $3 million.
our full year bookings guidance reflects 32% to 35% year-over-year growth, up from the 26% to 30% year-over-year growth we guided to on our last earnings call. in terms of our q2 guidance, i'd like to point out that this is seasonally our softest quarter in terms of absolute bookings because we don't have our new year's promotion or other big marketing events as we do in q1, q3, and q4. we plan to continue managing the business with strong cost and capital discipline. for the full year, we expect to be profitable on an adjusted ebitda basis even while we continue to invest in r&d as we have done historically.
we expect that non-gaap r&d as a percentage of revenue should be roughly flat compared to last year. while we expect to continue to get leverage in non-gaap sales and marketing through more efficient spend, we will see some deleveraging in non-gaap g&a, primarily driven by our expanded office footprint and the fact that 2022 is our first full year as a public company. and now i'll turn it back to luis.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, matt. before going to q&a, i'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their dedication to delivering on our mission. i'd like to thank our learners who spread the word of our products to their friends and family, and i'd like to thank you, our shareholders, for your support. we look forward to sharing more with you in the coming quarters.
and now we will be happy to take your questions.
",":
operator
we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] at this time, we'll now pause momentarily to assemble our rosters. your first question comes from eric sheridan from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
eric sheridan -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. maybe staying focused on the investment commentary in your opening remarks. can you remind us some of the key priorities on the product side that you're investing against in 2022 and how we should be thinking about that product roadmap beyond just the next 12 months but over the next couple of years? thanks so much.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you for the question, eric. can you hear me ok? all right. i welcome you, again. so, thank you for the question.
so, you know, the most important thing to understand is that we're going to be investing the majority of our resources on our language learning app. we think language learning is a massive opportunity. i mean it's about a $50 billion market, which is mostly shifting online, and we are the largest player online. so we're going to be investing mostly in our language learning app.
there, you know, we run [technical difficulty] metrics, and that's kind of the main thing for the next couple of years. also, as we said in the shareholder letter, most of the changes that we make are relatively small changes, but we are working on a pretty large change that is going to be live in the next few months, which is a redesign of the home screen of the app. hello?
operator
thank you. your next -- i'm sorry.
debbie belevan -- head of investor relations
operator, can you hear us?
operator
yes, we can hear you. your next question comes from justin patterson from keybanc. please go ahead.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great, thank you. perhaps for luis and matt can tack on to this, how should we think about the potential impact to users and monetization from super duolingo and the new home screen versus past changes to the app like hearts? and then i have one follow-up.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
sorry, justin, can you hear me ok?
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yeah, i can hear you, although you did cut out a little bit in your response to eric.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
ok. hopefully, i mean, i think we're having a little bit of phone trouble, but hopefully if i cut out, you can just ask again. but ok. so we're making some pretty big changes, i mean, the biggest one was the home screen on the app.
there's also a super duolingo. in terms of super duolingo, we don't think that, by itself, is going to have a pretty major impact on metrics. super duolingo, the main reason we're doing the redesign of what our subscription product looks like because we think it really fits in a lot more with our kind of gamify brand. in terms of the reason on the home screen of the app, we do think that's going to really set us up for pretty big improvements into our metrics, mainly in terms of engagement and teaching better.
so those are two things that we're going to be looking for. i should say also, for the redesign of the home screen, we've done -- we run thousands of a/b tests. we've done some pretty major redesigns roughly every three or four years, so we have experience doing this type of redesign. and there's a couple of things to say there.
the first one is we're going to really be looking at our metrics to make sure that everything increases when we launch it. by the time we launch the redesign, we will have a lot of confidence that the metrics will have increased. but one thing that i should kind of mention to people is that people don't like change, the users don't like change, and this is a pretty major change to the home screen of the app. so even though we know -- once we launch it, we'll know that our metrics are positive, we may see some negative sentiment here and there, but that's something that we're prepared for.
but that's something else, but these are two major changes we talked about in the shareholder letter.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok, perfect. and then for my follow-up, i just wanted to hit on social features. it sounds like you're having some success there, even helping users find love. i guess you could probably spin that as a duolingo love language app down the road.
but i'm curious to hear as to how those social features are benefiting the kpis, whether it's daily engagement or just better conversion over time, less churn on the app. thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. the social features, the beautiful thing about social features is that they help every single metric. really what they do is they get users to come back more often because their friends who are on duolingo contact them on duolingo, so we get users to come back more often. they get users to spend more time on the app.
they increase user retention. and because people spend more time on the app, they also learn more and also subscribe more and actually pay us more. so it really -- the social metrics really increase everything and this is why we're investing in them.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from mario lu from barclays. please go ahead.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking question. so the first one is on the strong bookings number this quarter. i believe you came in 9 points above your guidance at the midpoint.
so just curious if you could provide more color in terms of what led to the outperformance. you guys mentioned the new year's campaign, but anything else to kind of point to that led to this? thanks.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. great question, mario. i mean, the result of our performance, it really is the -- our outperformance really is the result of just hundreds of a/b tests that we've been running -- i mean, thousands, actually, of a/b tests that we've been running over the last couple of years, and it's just a compounding effect. i mean, if you look at the outperformance on revenue, that comes from basically increased users, also increased conversion to paying subscribers, and also increased retention of paying subscribers.
so basically, all our kpis are up. and it really is just the result of compounding effects from just [inaudible]. we had a good new year's campaign, but in addition to that, the month after that, it's also continue outperforming.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks, luis. and then just a follow-up on the full year guide, that's great. i guess how should we think about that raise in the context of the first quarter peak? and then any embedded impact from fx or impacts from russia that you guys can call out?
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yeah, thanks. i'm happy to answer that. so obviously, the full year guide takes into account the results of q1 patch rolls. the outperformance that luis was talking about is really broad-based, as we've mentioned so it's not just any one thing in the business.
it's improved user growth, conversion, and retention. and so the guide takes into account all of those things. now i just do want to mention that the world is obviously an uncertain place, and we're obviously paying very close attention to what's going on with the war you mentioned in ukraine, inflation, interest rates, and all those things. and so we've taken a prudent approach to the guide for the rest of the year, just knowing that there is a lot of uncertainty out there.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
got it. thanks, matt. [technical difficulty]
debbie belevan -- head of investor relations
operator, are you there?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
everybody, i think you can all still hear us. it seems like the operator essentially disappeared, so we are trying to figure out what to do with the operator for now. sorry about that. this is luis again.
i think we just lost the operator. how about i tell some jokes? i'm kidding. [technical difficulty]
operator
excuse me, but one moment. we'll go ahead and proceed with q&a here. and it looks like we currently still have mario lu within the question queue.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
mario, can you hear us?
operator
mr. lu?
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
yeah, i can hear them. i think i'm good for now. i'll just jump back in the queue.
operator
ok. i do apologize, everyone. it looks like we were experiencing technical difficulties. mr.
lu, we'll then remove you from the queue, sir. appreciate it. and next, we will take ralph schackart of william blair.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
thanks for taking the question. but luis, if you have a joke, first, that you wanted to say, feel free.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
i got many, but let's do this.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
just in terms of subscription revenue growth in the shareholder letter, obviously, you talked about new and renewing paid users. maybe just kind of zeroing in on the renewing paid users. did you change anything maybe on the testing side or product side? just kind of curious how you're bringing back previous subscribers. and then i have a follow-up.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. i mean we're always running a/b tests to try to continue increasing our number of subscribers. one of the main things that we have been doing to increase renewal rates is increasing the fraction of people that get into the family plan. the family plan is really good for retention because if you think about it, if you're -- if you have a family plan and you're using duolingo and also your significant other is using duolingo and also your child is using duolingo, as long as anybody is still using it, you're going to continue paying.
so that's something that we've been -- the fraction of people that are on the family plan keeps going up. it's, in fact, doubled since the beginning of the year, and that's really helped us with renewal rates. but other than that, we just continue making the app more and more engaging and that just gets more and more people to subscribe and stay subscribed.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
great. maybe a follow-up. just as travel continues to return, just curious how is that impacting engagement and user and subscriber growth. is that sort of a primary use case? just kind of curious how that's impacting the quarter and the sub base.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
travel is one of the many use cases for duolingo if not the primary use case, and it really, of course, depends on the geography, in some places a little bigger than others, but it's a minority use case. and we do see it, but i don't think that's having -- it's not something that we're keeping an eye on in terms of having a major impact on. so we know people are traveling more. and we do see it, but i just don't think that's had a major impact on our numbers.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
ok. thanks, luis.
operator
and next, we have andrew boone of jmp securities.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions. to start, can we have an update on local pricing, just the testing that you were doing around, i think, it was four countries? and then secondly, in the letter, you talked about expanding the language learning market. can you talk about, just given the fact that we just saw users kind of accelerate through 1q, how are you going about expanding the top of the funnel to just be more inclusive and bring more users into duolingo? thanks so much.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. great question. let me first talk about expanding the language learning market. i mean this is something that we've noticed in many of our markets.
actually, in the united states, when we asked our users, approximately 80% of our users in the united states were not in the language learning market before duolingo. so they were not learning a language before us. and so, in certain countries, we really are just expanding the market. and i think the reason that happens is we just have -- we have a really iconic brand that a lot of people talk about.
and it's also -- it's just really easy to learn with duolingo. and people tell that to each other. i mean the main way in which we grow is through word of mouth. and the things that people say to each other are just like, ""oh, have you tried duolingo? it's really easy."" and i think that's basically how we're expanding the market.
that was one question. what was the other question?
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
regional pricing.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
regional pricing. yeah, regional pricing question. yes, so with regional pricing, we continue making progress. we are changing prices in more and more countries.
by the way, just for reference, we talked about regional pricing during the ipo. before the ipo, we really just had one price in every single country. we understand that is not optimal. over the last few months, we have been changing the prices in countries.
in the majority of countries, that means reducing the price because the price that we had made a lot of sense for the united states, but the united states is kind of one of the wealthier countries in the world. so the majority of countries, we've been testing reducing prices, and that's been happening. and it is having an impact. but the thing that i really want to emphasize about regional pricing is it's just one of literally dozens of levers that we have.
and that's -- it is having an impact but it's not a massive impact, like it's not like, oh, because the price is cheaper in some countries, we're suddenly doubling our revenue or anything like that. it's a modest impact. and the reason it's a modest impact is because in most of these countries that we're changing the price, these are countries where also digital subscriptions are not very mature. so now the price makes sense but we still probably -- some time has to pass for people to really become used to digital subscription.
so that -- so the way we see the regional pricing is it's something that -- it's a necessary condition to really increase our penetration of subscribers in these countries but not a sufficient condition.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question we have will come from mark mahaney of evercore isi.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok, thanks. two questions. so you had this record number of maus or new users. could you provide a little bit -- and i understand all the a/b testing that helped convert them and helped retain them.
but could you just talk about how you brought them in, in the first place? and maybe more color, was it particular markets where you're starting to really break through in markets like india or something like that? just more color on where this record number of new users came from. thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. hi, mark. so, ok, the first thing to say is that we're growing in every single region. we are growing a little faster in certain regions.
asia, in particular, and india, of course, is one of our fastest-growing countries, but we're also growing pretty fast in the united states. so we're growing in pretty much every region. and you asked how they came in. the vast majority of our users come in through word of mouth, and that's how they're coming in.
and historically, that's been the case for duolingo, it's organic growth. we have had some marketing campaigns that have been pretty efficient. in particular, in asian countries, we have found that influencers -- paid influencers really work. and it's not like we've spent a ton of money on that, but that has been really good for us.
the other thing that has been really good for us in bringing new users is our use of social media, in particular, our tiktok has been -- at least for english-speaking countries like the u.s. and the u.k., our tiktok has been pretty good at getting the word out. but still, the vast majority of our growth comes from word of mouth.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. and then to date, you've -- just kind of state the obvious question, you've been a language learning app and a really interesting one. and your goal here is much broader than that when you're talking about education. so just talk about the timeline and let's set some expectations.
remind us of when math is coming out, the duolingo math product. and then there's obviously a lot more to education than just math and language. so just what else should we -- what else could we see and when could we see it? thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a great question. and it's true, our ambitions are pretty large. i mean we really do want to do all of education. i do want to say a couple of things.
the first is the language learning market is humongous, and we are still -- there's still a lot of runway there. we're just getting started in our monetization and we're just getting started in penetrating the market. so for the foreseeable future, you will see the majority of our growth and certainly of our revenue come from language learning. we are working on these other apps.
we already launched duolingo abc, which is for literacy. we are going to have a public beta of our math app later this year, and that's going to happen. and that's going to grow from there. in terms of contributions to revenue, i don't think you should expect anything this year or even next year.
and if there's any, it will be minimal. and the majority -- the main reason for that is just our language learning product is growing so much that it's going to take some time to catch up for that to become meaningful.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok, that makes sense. thank you very much, luis.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, mark.
operator
again, everyone, i do apologize for the technical delay earlier. [operator instructions] the next question we have comes from arvind ramnani of piper.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi, and thanks for taking my question. yeah. i just wanted to ask, when i look at some of the other sort of digital learning firms, clearly, very different business models but many of them are facing various sort of headwinds. and it kind of looks like you all haven't got any -- you haven't got a memo on kind of the post-pandemic sort of slowdown.
in fact, you're kind of seeing pretty good growth. just wanted to get a sense of maybe from a high-level perspective, like what is so unique about the model where you're not seeing any slowdown? or is it -- or should we expect a slowdown in the next two or three quarters?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
we have no reason to believe there's going to be a slowdown. in fact, our user -- our growth numbers are accelerating for now. we just -- it's a number of things. the first thing to say is that we really are not.
i think when you see a lot of, particularly education things, they really were a covid story. we are not. if you look at our growth numbers, our user numbers, and basically, we had an organic growth rate before covid. then the early kind of lockdown around 2020 of march through may, we did see an increase in demand.
but after that, we were back to the kind of pre-covid growth rates. so i think just kind of for us, covid was just not what it was for some other companies. that's one thing. i think another thing that is important to say is we are mainly a product-driven company.
and if you look at a lot of education companies or many of these other companies, they spend a lot of their resources on marketing, etc. we spend the vast majority of our resources on just making a really excellent product that works, that grows through word of mouth. and i think the results are just showing. i mean, basically, the compounding of thousands of a/b tests is making it so the product is just better and better.
i just want to say one other thing, which additionally, we also just -- language learning is interesting. i mean it is a huge, huge market. and the fact that we're just -- we really are just getting started with this market, with not only with the user growth but also with monetization. i think we're just in a point of the curve that you just continue seeing growth.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
terrific. and just from a product perspective, some of the other ancillary -- not ancillary, sort of like tangential like learning, that's repetitive in nature, for example, math, is there like a timeline you'll have that you're able to share? or is it kind of things like math not in the near future.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
sorry, can you hear me?
operator
we can hear you. i do apologize.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
sorry, can you -- ok. so i was going to say, so with math, we should see -- we're probably going to release -- not probably, we are going to release a public beta version of the math app later this year. so it'll be there. but one of the things that i wanted to emphasize again is just that you should not expect any meaningful revenue contribution from the math app or from these other things, mainly because our language learning is just growing so much that over the next few years, that's where the contribution is going to come from mainly.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
terrific. thank you very much.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and next, we have a question from nat schindler of bank of america.
nat schindler -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. hi, guys. i just wanted to follow up on that math comment. i can understand that you're not looking to monetize very quickly.
and -- but more what are your thoughts? most of your subscribers have not been children. there've been adult users historically for duolingo. people do language learning their whole life. i don't see a lot of people -- and i'm an engineer and a geek, and i don't see a lot of people who sit and do math learning later in life.
so is there a real market for adults paying for math learning?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
that's a great question. i mean so the first thing to say is this is -- these are new products and we're going to develop them. we're very bullish on math because we think this is something that pretty much everybody needs to learn. the majority of the people that are going to be using it are probably not going to be adults, although we think that there's some market for adults related to brain training.
but we think it's going to be mainly children. now the thing to say about that is this is what -- we have a lot of children users of duolingo. and in addition to that, this is one of the reasons why we're so excited about our family plan. we're increasing the fraction of our subscribers that are in the family plan, and the idea is going to be to bundle the multiple learning products into this family plan.
and that's something that we think will be very successful.
nat schindler -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
well, at this time, we're showing no further questions. i will then plan to conclude today's q&a. at this time, i'd like to hand the conference back over to the management team for any closing remarks. sir?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
just thank you. thank you very much, everybody, for the great questions. and yeah, we look forward to speaking again next quarter, and sorry about the operator dropping off. they probably went and got addicted to duolingo.
ok, bye.

2022-Q2,DUOL,2022-08-04 17:30:00,"prepared remarks:
debbie belevan
good afternoon and welcome to duolingo's second quarter 2022 earnings webcast. today after market close, we released our quarterly shareholder letter with our q2 results and commentary which you can find on our ir website at investors.duolingo.com. with me today are luis von ahn, our co-founder and ceo; matt skaruppa, cfo; and bob meese, our chief business officer. they'll begin with some brief remarks before opening the call to q&.
[operator instructions] please note that this event is being recorded. and just a reminder that we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and financial performance, which are subject to material risks and uncertainties and have been set forth in the risk factors of our sec filings. these forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of today, and we have no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. and additionally, we will present both gaap and non-gaap financial measures on today's call.
these non-gaap measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, a substitute for or superior to our gaap results, and we encourage you to consider all measures when analyzing our performance. and with that, i will turn the call over to luis. 
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, debbie, and welcome, everyone. so we went public just over a year ago. and as part of that process, i wrote a letter to lay out my vision for what this company will do. it was a short letter and the whole thing said this.
i'm just going to read it. ""the main thing you need to know is that i plan to dedicate my life to building a future in which through technology, every person on this planet has access to the best quality of education. and not only that, but a future in which people want to spend their time learning. duolingo is the platform for building that future, and we are just getting started."" since i worked that letter, we have made a lot of progress toward that vision.
we have increased our user base substantially. when we went public last year, we had about 9 million daily active users. now, we have over 13 million. we had about 38 million monthly active users.
now, we have nearly 50 million. we had less than 2 million paying subscribers, and now we have 3.3 million. in the first half of last year, we had about $130 million in bookings. and in the first half of this year, we had nearly $200 million.
as these numbers show, we've executed well and achieved or surpassed our targets. but the spirit of my ipo letter was that we are at the beginning of our journey, and i believe in that message now more than ever. we want to build a company that is iconic and durable. we want to build a company that last 100 years.
so while we pay attention to the near-term macro environment, we always stay focused on the long term and on the future. and with that, i'll turn it over to matt to talk about our financial outlook.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
thank you, luis. we delivered strong results in the second quarter, beating expectations. we grew the top line at over 50%, and we were profitable on an adjusted ebitda basis. it was also our fourth consecutive quarter with accelerating user growth.
this gives us the confidence to increase our full year guidance while remaining appropriately prudent given the current uncertainty in the macro environment. so our guidance for q3 2022 is $94 million to $97 million in total bookings, $93 million to $96 million in revenue, and an adjusted ebitda of negative $4.5 million to negative $1.5 million. for the full year 2022, we are increasing our guidance to $404 million to $410 million in total bookings, $361 million to $367 million in revenue and an adjusted ebitda of positive $4 million to $7 million. our full year bookings guidance reflects 37% to 39% year-over-year growth, up from the 32% to 35% year-over-year growth that we guided to on our last earnings call.
i also want to discuss foreign exchange rates and how they impact our guidance. we estimate that on a constant currency basis compared to q2 of last year, our q2 2022 bookings would have been just over 4% higher. this is a result of the dollar strengthening nearly 9% over the past year against the basket of currencies that make up our bookings and the fact that just over half of our bookings come from outside the u.s. our updated guidance takes into account the strengthening of the dollar in the first half of the year and assumes current prevailing foreign exchange rates.
note that every 1% increase in the value of the dollar versus our basket of currencies would have about a $1 million impact on total bookings in the second half of the year. we continue to manage the business with fiscal discipline as we have since our founding. in the second half of 2022, we anticipate that r&d as a percentage of revenue will increase starting in q3 as it does most years as we bring on new university hires. sales and marketing will increase slightly as a percent of revenue in q3.
and then, in q4, we'll settle back down to where it has been year-to-date. and we should start seeing some slight leverage in g&a in the back half of the year. finally, i want to note that we are on track to hit our dilution guidance of 2% to 3% for the year and that we ended the quarter with approximately 47.4 million fully diluted shares outstanding using the average q2 closing price. and now i'll turn it back to luis.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, matt. before we take your questions, i'd like to express my gratitude to our talented group of employees who put their collective hearts into our mission every day in order to serve our learners and change their lives through education. i guess i'm also supposed to remind everyone to do their duolingo lessons today. i got it.
i got it. ok. we're going to do our lessons, ok? ok. anyways, i'd also like to remind everyone to watch duocon on august 26, which is our annual conference for all things duolingo.
and now we would be happy to take your questions. i'll turn it back to debbie to manage the queue.
debbie belevan
all right. thanks, luis. so your first question comes from andrew boone of jmp securities.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi, guys. congrats on the strong results and thanks for taking my question. can we just start with the outperformance in mau and dau, i'd love to understand that. and then, just stepping back as we think about kind of growth on a go-forward basis, and we start to look at 2023 with a little bit finer of point of pencil.
is it fair to think about 20% to 25% for dau growth and kind of 10% to 15% for mau growth, which i think was kind of the soft guidance at the point of the ipo.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
well, thank you, andrew, for your question. i mean, i'll talk a little bit about our current outperformance, and then i'm going to let matt talk about our guidance. so for the outperformance i mean look, it's a number of factors, but i think if you ask me, the main factor is just something we've said from the time we ipo-ed, which is we're still in the early days of our journey. we're still in the early days of our dau growth.
we're still in the early days of our revenue growth. and so, we're still in a nice part of the curve. and so, there's that. i should say one thing, which is that -- the macro environment is pretty crazy, as you know.
so far, we have seen no weakness in our numbers whatsoever, and we expect pretty strong numbers. but things are crazy. and i can't tell you that we're going to be immune forever to whatever is going on in the macro environment. but so far, no weakness in our numbers.
i don't know, matt, if you want to talk about the guidance.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yes, for sure. yes. so andrew, we don't guide to mau or dau explicitly. when we went public, we did mention that historically, looking back, mau grew between 10% and 15% and dau grew between 20% and 25%.
and as you've seen earlier this year, we've outperformed those numbers. but those numbers are pretty long dated times years data. so i don't think that those numbers are fundamentally changed. we've had nice outperformance here.
but again, we're not going to guide formally to it, but if you just look at the long times years of data, those numbers are certainly in the range.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst
and then you guys now are live again in china. can you just speak to the opportunity there and what that could possibly mean for the business over maybe three to five years, right, not near term, but kind of more medium.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. thanks for the question about china. so we said in the shareholder letter, we're back live in china. so what happened in china was that we were taken down from the app stores a few months ago.
and what that meant was that current users could still use duolingo, but new users couldn't download it. we are back in the app stores, and we're back to the dau and revenue levels that we had before we had been taken down. now, china is an interesting country. there's a lot of potential in china, but it's still a small market for us, and it's about 1% to 2% of our daus and maus and a little under 1% of our revenue.
i think the thing to say about china is -- of course, it's the largest language learning market in the world, in particular, for learning english. but it is very hard for western companies to do well there. so the way we see it is we're investing in it. we're not betting the company on it.
and my guess is as good as yours about what's going to happen with the chinese landscape.
debbie belevan
ok, great. and your next question comes from eric sheridan of goldman sachs.
eric sheridan -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for taking the question, and great to see everyone. i'm always intrigued when you put the stuff in the letter on the ab testing. anything to highlight there where you've seen elements of the ab testing move out of testing mode and into the app that you're the most excited about either they're driving on the usage side or the monetization side. just can we get a better sense of some of the bridging from testing into implementation in the business? that would be number one.
and number two, any update on math as a product, both on the investment cycle behind it and how you think about launching it more widely as we move out into future quarters?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, eric, for the questions. ok. so first of all, in terms of ab testing, as we mentioned in the letter, we run about 500 ab tests per quarter. so we're really testing all kinds of things.
some things are pretty tiny. some of the ab tests are just like one word of change in some button and some are pretty large features. two of that we highlighted in the letter that i'm particularly pretty excited about. one, is the quests tab.
so it's a whole tab in the app. that's basically going to induce users to do certain actions and generally is to use the app more. and the thing about using the app more is, they use it more days in a row, every day that they use it, they spend more time on it. and we know that people who use the app more also are more likely to subscribe.
so we really like that. that's one that we're really excited about. another one that we mentioned in the letter that also, i'm particularly excited about is this thing called side quests, which are -- in the new home screen of the app, you're going to be able to tap on the animated characters and that's going to give you kind of these fun little mini games obviously to practice your language. now, to play them, you're going to have to pay with gems.
and the gem economy on duolingo is something that we're very excited about because it's going to help us with in-app purchases, which is something that we're going to be investing on for the next few years. right now, our revenue for in-app purchases is relatively small. it's just a couple of percentage points. but we think we can grow that quite a bit.
and we think that's pretty interesting, particularly in certain geographies where people don't love paying for recurring subscriptions. so that's kind of an ab test. and you asked about math and thank you for the question. that's something that we're very excited about.
but i -- when people ask us about math or duolingo abc, which is our literacy app, i'd like to remind everyone that for the foreseeable future, i mean, certainly, this year, next year and even the year after that, we are primarily a language learning company. language learning is a massive opportunity. we're still really only scratching the surface. so the majority of our investment and the majority of our revenues are going to come from language learning for the next, call it, three to five years.
now, with the math app, we're -- i have it on my phone. i use it every single day. it turns out it's pretty fun. it turns out practicing third and fourth grade math is pretty fun, at least for nerds like me.
so we have it. we're likely to -- the plan is still going according to plan, and we're going to put it out -- we're going to put a beta version of the app to the whole world this year. so it's still going according to plan. and i'm particularly excited about it.
debbie belevan
ok, great. and your next question comes from ralph schackart of william blair.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the question, and also good to see everybody. just two if i could. just in terms of the home screen, you talked about the excitement there to really improve engagement.
maybe just an update what you're seeing there with the testing. and then, just an additional question on regional pricing, how is that effort going? when are you moving from your test to the price regime and also the willingness of some of the geographies [inaudible]?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, ralph. ok. so you asked -- the first question was about the home screen. so the home screen just to remind everyone, we are completely changing the home screen of duolingo, which is a pretty large change.
so the home screen used to be this thing that we call the tree where users had a lot of options about where -- what to learn next to a linear path that where users -- we're basically going to be guiding users what to learn next. and we've talked about this. this is something that we're currently -- it's currently being still tested. we're being very careful with such large changes, we usually are pretty careful with them.
so we're testing it, but it's currently live for a fraction of our users on iphones, androids and web. so on all our platforms, it's currently live. the results so far are great in that it's exactly what we expected. and just to remind everyone with what we expected with these results.
this is a brand-new version of the home screen. the previous home screen was there for years. i don't know how many years, five, six years or something like that. and it was hugely optimized.
this new version is a brand-new version that hasn't been optimized. and all we were looking for when we put this there is parity of metrics. if we're able to achieve parity of metrics with an unoptimized home screen versus the highly optimized sort of local maximum thing that we had before, then this is a really good position to be in because we can take the unoptimized one and then optimize it like crazy. and so, far, it's looking like that.
so far, it's looking like the metrics that we have pretty much parity of metrics. and so, it's exactly what we wanted. my estimate is that we're going to be rolling it out to all our users like really, basically, there will be no users that don't have it by the end of the quarter. that's my estimate.
and so, we're looking pretty good with the home screen. the regional pricing, again, this is something else just to remind everyone, when we ipo-ed, we had the same price in every single geography. and that really was the price -- that was a good price for the united states and maybe western europe, but it was not a great price for most countries in the world. over the last year, we've basically changed the prices in most countries.
we've regionalized prices. it took us a while to do this because when we run the experiment to change the prices, we really are trying to measure what that's going to do for our long-term bookings and kind of we're looking for lifetime value of users and we're trying to see what it does for recurring digital subscriptions, so renewals and everything. so it took us a while to do this. but by now, the prices are pretty good for most countries as in they are what you would expect given the gdp of each country, for example.
now, what that did is for countries like the u.s., the prices didn't change all that much, so that's good. and then, most of the big changes were usually for poor countries, the prices went down quite a bit. and we see that as a first step of many that need to be taken to monetize the poor countries. so we obviously monetize countries like the u.s.
or western europe. we monetize a lot better there than we would monetize in a country like brazil or like peru or vietnam or something like that. and in order to really monetize well in those countries -- in the poor countries, i think just a number of things need to happen. the first step is that your price needs to be right.
we did that. and so, that was a win, and it increased -- it was an increase in bookings, but it wasn't like a 10 times, like sometimes people think, oh, now you have the right price. so you're just going to 10 times bookings in brazil or something not what happened and that we didn't expect that to happen because a number of other things need to happen in places like brazil or like in india or something like that. for example, just people are not as used to paying for recurring digital subscriptions.
so another thing that we need to do is probably we need to work on kind of more à la carte in-app purchases. to improve that, we also need to probably improve forms of payment that sometimes people just don't have the right form of payment. so this is just a number of things that we need to do, and this was step no. 1.
ralph schackart -- william blair -- analyst
thanks, luis.
debbie belevan
great. and your next question comes from ryan macdonald of needham.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions. luis, i wanted to first start with duolingo english test. obviously, some really strong growth that accelerated on a year-over-year basis.
i'm curious what you're seeing there between whether it's just a mix of stronger international enrollments back in the ir domestically? or if this is a result of sort of the increase in number of universities that you have on the platform?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. thank you for asking about the duolingo english test because it's something -- it's a project that is very near and dear to my heart, and it's something that we're very excited about. just kind of again to set the stage and to remind everyone because not as many people know about the duolingo english test. so this is our second largest product.
most people know us for our language learning app. the duolingo english test is the second largest product. it's a standardized english proficiency exam. so you go to our website and you take a test and it tells you how good your english is.
it turns out, those are used for a lot of things, the standardized english exam. one of the main users, not the no. 1 users, but one of the main uses for standardized english exams is university admissions. so for foreign students.
so when people want to come to the u.s. to study say, stanford or duke or something, they have to apply and they have to prove that they can speak english. so they can take the duolingo english test to prove that they can speak english. that business is growing really, really nicely for us.
and the main place where it's growing. it's just -- we're just getting a lot more adoption of institutions, accepting our test. so it means -- and it's mainly universities. historically, we started with u.s.
universities. and by now, depending on how you measure, but about 80% of u.s. universities are accepting our test. we are increasing our efforts in the u.s., obviously, to get to 100%, that's what we'd like to get.
but also we're increasing our efforts in other big markets of english proficiency exams, that's canada, the u.k. and australia. and those were increasing again. and so, the combo of just a lot more institutions accepting our test is what has led to more people taking the test.
the other thing that has led to that is because now -- in the u.s., we just have quite a bit of acceptance. if you apply to u.s., for example, the top 25 universities in the u.s. in terms of international student enrollment 100% of them, 25 of the top 25 accepted duolingo english test. so by now, if you're applying to the u.s.
it is likely that those universities will take the duolingo english test. so the other thing that we're doing is just getting the word out that this is the case, and this has helped quite a bit in countries like india or china which is where most of the test takers are just getting the word out that we are as accepted as the other tests has helped quite a bit. and i think that that will continue happening.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
super helpful color. and then, maybe just from a follow-up perspective. on the core language learning app, obviously, it's great to see no macro negative impacts thus far. as we think about potential recession or a tightening of the consumer discretionary budget, do you do much research on where your users are coming from? and i ask the reason of is there a potential here of seeing an acceleration in the shift from offline language learning to online, given that it's $30 to $60 an hour for a language tutor in person versus obviously, that's nearly the price of an annual subscription.
just curious your thoughts there.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes, that's a really good hypothesis, one that i wish were true. and i don't know if it's going to be true or not. i mean, because we just haven't really hit the recession, at least for that. but i think we believe that.
we believe that -- not just a recession. i actually think, over time, we believe that the market is going to shift more online. and just to remind you, in terms of the language learning market, the language learning market is about $60 billion a year. the vast majority of it is still offline, where people are basically paying to take night classes in brazil to learn english or something like that.
like that's the majority of the market. over the years, we've seen a slightly shift online. and by the way, we've basically helped a lot with the online shift. we're hoping that this will continue happening.
and it's a good question about whether the recession is going to help with that just because off-line language learning is a lot more expensive. the honest answer is i don't know if that will be the case, but it stands the reason that it will, but i'm just -- i don't know.
thanks for the color. congrats again.
thank you.
debbie belevan
and your next question comes from justin patterson of keybanc.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
great. thank you very much. perhaps as a variance of eric's question, it looks like there's been a lot more iteration on more products, consumer user-facing features recently. i'd love to hear about just how the pace of innovation has improved as that dau and mau base as it assisted more a/b test.
and then, secondly, you mentioned duocon, luis, anything you're particularly excited about coming up?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
ok. so first, in terms of the pace of innovation. so two things affect our pace of innovation. one is the number of users that we have to experiment with.
as they increase, we can run more experiments at a time. that helps. the other thing that helps, of course, is the number of people working on the product. and so, the number of engineers, the number of product managers and the number of designers that we have working on the product help us run more experiments.
and so, that's basically what's happening. we are hiring more and more people. of course, we are hiring prudently. you're not going to see us doing layoffs or anything like that.
we're hiring pretty prudently as we have for the whole time. but that's basically what increases the pace of innovation. and so, you are right, we are running more ab tests. every quarter -- it's pretty much the case that every quarter, we run more ab test than the previous quarter.
and it's just we have more people working on them. so that's the a/b testing. and in terms of duocon, you should just tune in. there's a lot of really cool stuff coming in -- coming up.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
you missed a great opportunity for duo to just lock in behind you again.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
duo has a very hard job. it's like santa claus. he has to be everywhere at once, reminding everybody to do their lessons. so i don't know where he is.
justin patterson -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
debbie belevan
all right. and the next question comes from aaron kessler of raymond james.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you. one, you shared some nice marketing leverage in the quarter. can you just talk about that? should we expect a little bit maybe deleverage in the back half on the marketing side and maybe with kind of ad rates are apparently coming down a bit.
just wondering if that's helping you on the marketing efficiency side. on the other hand, are you seeing any negative implications on your advertising revenues from kind of lower performance-based advertising that we've seen this quarter?
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yes, i'm happy to take that. so part of the advertising leverage this quarter was driven by just a shift in spend. so we were going to spend it this quarter. we're going to spend it next quarter.
that's about -- it will shake out to be between around $1 million to $2 million. so there's some of that. but in the back half of the year, we would expect to see some deleveraging in q3 because of what i just said that shift. but then in q4 it should be right back to kind of where it was this quarter-ish.
so nothing kind of seminal or crazy going on in the s&m line. the second part of your question is true. we did see average revenue per dau go down on the marketing side of the business, just like i think other folks who are taking in marketing dollars saw. the good news for us was that if that went down in the order because daus went up so much, the net effect turned out to be -- that advertising dollars still grew relatively nicely for the quarter.
so we're still monitoring that. that does seem to be something that could persist throughout the rest of the year is that average revenue per dau going down. but like i said, with user growth, we can offset that.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
average revenue per dau on advertising.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
on advertising. yes, exactly.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thank you.
debbie belevan
and your next question comes from mario lu of barclays.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. so the first one is on the booking fee in the second quarter. i believe you beat your guide by 11% at the midpoint.
so just wondering if you could provide some color into what were the main drivers for the outperformance. any user acquisition channels you can call out that affect that one?
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yeah. so the beat on the guide was driven in part by the fact that when we issued that guide, we were early on in the quarter, there was a lot of macro uncertainty, and so we were being appropriately prudent. there was also outperformance even over internal expectations on certain metrics like user growth we performed really well on conversion and retention. and so, those are really the core components of what led to the bookings beat.
and then, when we look to guidance going forward, we're taking all those outperformance into account for the rest of the year. but then also, we're still layering on a prudent outlook given there is so much uncertainty, as luis mentioned.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
got it. and then, just a follow-up on the side quests and quests. those look very exciting. i guess just at a high level, you said side quests is to increase revenue, quests is to increase engagement.
but i guess, in terms of being a language app, i guess can you remind us what incentive users have in order to kind of spin more gems or is that still being tested?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
in terms of spending more gems, it's just the whole gamification of duolingo. people really get into it. and it's a pretty complex ecosystem. so one of the things that happens is the user journey would be something like this.
a user is using duolingo, and they get really into the leaderboards. the leaderboards, by the way, are these kind of groups of people or 50 random people you're there. and if you're in the top -- well, it's actually 30 random people. and if you're in the top 10, you increase to the next league, etc.
they get really into that. and then, they're really trying to figure out how to get more and more x fee per minute, more points per minute. and then, it turns out that things like side quests give a good number of x fee, so people try them and then they really enjoy that. and so, they enjoy it and also gives them a lot of x fees.
so that will get them to spend gems. so it's stuff like that that gets people to really do this. so it's basically kind of a tight gamification loop.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. well, just don't make it too much pay-to-win, like some games.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
don't worry. we spend a lot of effort on that. we really do want to make sure that everything that we do is really good for learning in the end, too. i mean, this is -- we spend a lot of effort making sure that the side quests that basically, when you're earning x fee, we try to make it so that you're learning proportional to how many x fee you're getting.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you.
debbie belevan
all right. and the next question comes from arvind ramnani at piper sandler.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey. thanks, guys. so just a couple of questions. certainly, this is the first time you're talking about potential impact of macro.
and i'm not sure if you'll have seen this prior sort of macro cycle. so maybe when you did you were a different company or private company at that time. but assuming that we see some impact on the business from a macro perspective, do you think the impact will be more on the mid-teen top of the funnel growth or more on the conversion to -- where do you anticipate kind of the first sort of hit to be?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
arvind, great question. i don't know. i mean, it's very hard to know. i mean, so far, we have seen no weakness in our numbers.
and so, it's hard to know if i could think about it and theorize about it, for example, my guess is that free users are not going to -- like basically, our free user growth is going to continue equally. and then, probably if people are having real tough time economically, they may be less likely to subscribe. now, one thing that i should say is that this is just a hypothesis, by the way, about why we are a little less immune by this. i don't know if this is true or not.
but the fact that we're a freemium model and that our free product is so good. what it means is that already the people that are paying or the people that are not paying, a lot of them -- or the people that are having trouble, sorry, paying a lot of them, anyways, were just using the product for free. and that may be the case of -- and we have users everywhere in the world, in poor countries, a country like india or something, just very few people are paying us and they're just using duolingo for free. now, we don't mind that because that's actually good for us because people tell their friends, and this is how we grow.
and also when people use duolingo, we have more users and we can run more ab test and make the whole product better, etc. so we don't mind that. but it's -- ultimately, it's just very hard to know what's going to happen. so far, we have seen no weakness in our numbers though.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. and then, from a pricing perspective, like you even go back like two years when you are private -- you had kind of one pricing model. now, you have multiple -- you're starting to introduce more pricing models. i think kind of the family plan is kind of probably the newest pricing model.
how should we think about your pricing models? are they going to be like additional ones coming about, like, i mean, as you anticipate potentially some macro headwinds, are you being a little bit more creative on pricing? should we expect some of that over the next six months or so?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
so the first thing to say about pricing is that we're always experimenting not only -- in terms of pricing and in different geographies and in terms of packages, what is the relative price of the family plan versus the individual plan versus the year levers, the monthly, we're always experimenting. so you're going to see us continue experimenting. and if we see something that wins, and by the way, wins means not just short-term wins, but long term. so whenever we do the experiments, we really try to see that they actually increase the lifetime value of users.
whenever something wins, you'll see us change it, but it's very hard to say what will happen in the next six months. i don't think you'll see anything -- i don't think you'll see any new fundamentally different packages because we're not working on anything like that. i mean, the actual packages that we have, there's the monthly, the yearly and annual plan, which could be monthly or yearly. i don't think you're going to see any fundamentally new thing, but you may see kind of different prices.
and it's just very hard to say what will happen because we're just going to continue experimenting.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. and just last question. certainly, you've, i think, 450, 500 ab sort of testing. of those, which one do you think has sort of the biggest potential part to impact your revenue or your margins?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
out of all the 500 tests that we're running, which do you think the single one has the most potential? i don't know. i mean, the two that i'm most excited about are the ones that i put in our shareholder letter. i'm most excited about those two, side quests and the quests tab. but i am sometimes good at predicting what's going to be really big.
and sometimes, i'm actually really bad predicting what's going to be really big. those are the ones that i put there that i like.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
all right. perfect. looking forward to seeing you all at duocon -- tuning into duocon rather.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
it's going to be good.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah, i'm sure. thanks.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thanks, arvind.
debbie belevan
all right. the next question comes from mark mahaney at evercore.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
just two questions, please. one on where you think penetration rates can go for subscribers as a percentage of maus. i asked the question because i think at the time of the ipo a couple of years ago, maybe you thought i could -- looking at some of the dating app, maybe you could get to double digits. i don't know if you said that or the market certainly thought something like that.
if you look at that chart that you have in your shareholder letter, that curve looks pretty darn good. like i don't know -- my guess is that it may even be going faster than you would have thought. so i don't know, just new thoughts you may have on where that penetration could go long term? and then secondly, i just want to ask about two markets, china and india. i know somebody already asked you about india, but i want to phrase the question this way.
the risk reward there seems so asymmetric to me. i don't think you -- i think you've talked about country launches before not necessarily being dramatically capital intensive. you've had viral growth in so many markets. but the number of potential maus and subscribers out of china just would seem to be dramatic, especially for what you're offering.
and so, i wanted to just ask you to talk about that a little bit. i understand all the volatility about being allowed and not allowed in but just seems so asymmetric the opportunity there. and just give us a quick update on india, where things are because i think that's been one of your better markets. but i also think growth markets, but i also think you may have had some regulatory issues there.
so any update on that. so those are the three questions.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
great. ok. so penetration. so you're right.
i'd say our penetration of the fraction of paying subscribers to maus has definitely outperformed what i thought would happen. when we ipo-ed, we had been seeing kind of a 1 percentage point growth per year. so each year, it would go from like 3% to 4%, from 4% to 5%. the last couple -- since ipo, it seems we're up to about 2 percentage points per year.
so it is more than i expected. and i think that we're very happy with that. and your question is how high can i get? we still don't know. i don't see a reason why this can't get to the mid-teens.
i don't see a reason why this can't happen. but it's very hard to say. now, i'll say one other thing, which i think a lot of people concentrate on this metric of percentage of paying subscribers versus maus. this is not a metric that we inside the company operate against.
we don't have a team trying to improve this metric. we're not trying to do that. and part of the reason is because what we're really trying to improve is kind of long-term bookings. and for some stuff, one easy way to increase that metric, for example, is to lower our price significantly.
and that metric could go up quite a bit. but we may be making less revenues. so it's not clear exactly what will happen. there are some experiments.
certainly, when we did a regional pricing, that probably made it go a little faster because we lowered our price in many countries, and that made it go a little faster. so stuff like that. but it's just -- it's not something that we necessarily obsessed about, but it is something that it seems like certainly, wall street seems to care about. so we talk about it.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yes, one second on that penetration rate. so mark, part of that acceleration that you're seeing, and it is an acceleration came from the fact that we have a higher mix of annual plans now. so over the past four quarters, we've increased the annual plan mix because of what luis mentioned, which is we view that as a two times -- two times as big ltv as the monthly plan. and so, part of that penetration rate going from 1% to 2% was the natural impact of that mix shift.
and so, over time, since we're now almost at 90% annual plan you would expect that to trend back toward the middle of that 1% to 2% range. so i think that's an example of what luis is talking about, which is the metric we care about is ltv and it has these derivative effects which are increasing the paid penetration. but the metric is ltv.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
 great. so then your next question was about china and india. let me talk about india first because i think it's a little easier. so we haven't had any regulatory issues in india.
that's just not something that we've ever had. india. india has been very nice to us. so india is a very interesting market for us.
it is one of our fastest -- at times, it is the fastest. i don't know if today it is the fastest, but at times, it is the fastest-growing country in the whole world for us in terms of daily active users. it keeps growing. it is now one of our top five markets.
a while ago, it wasn't even in the top 20. and there's just a ton of people in india -- now the thing with india is that it has been great for user growth, free user growth in particular. for revenue, we have not monetized it. and in fact, for a while, we actually had revenue turned off in india.
and we're in the process of turning it back on. and i'll tell you the reason why we have turned it off. it just turns out that the indian consumers are just not very used to freemium models. and so, when we would give the offer to subscribe, they thought that it was a hard paywall and they would stop using duolingo.
they were like, we're getting out of here. so what we did is temporarily turned that off. and so, we were making no money from india for a while. and we're back -- we're either -- like either we're already back -- we're about to be back.
this is one of those things we're experimenting on to be making money in india. but so far, i think it's a lot of users. there's a lot of great opportunity. and i think -- but i think the challenge with india is just getting people to pay is -- i think a lot of companies have a hard time with that.
so that's india. china. so we have an office in china. we have an office in beijing.
they are very high performing. the reason we originally opened that office was to grow in china. and they did a really good job. i mean, we really started growing quite a bit in china before we got turned off in the app stores as china was our fastest-growing market.
the other nice thing about china is that consumers actually also pay and it is the largest english learning market in the world. so it is something we're going to continue investing in, but we're prudent. i mean, i think it would be foolish for us just having seen what has happened to all the majority of western companies that invest a lot in china, i think it will be foolish for us to suddenly invest $200 million to grow in china, that's just unlikely to happen. but we're going to continue investing and it will continue growing.
now, the nice thing about duolingo is that it grows organically. so we haven't needed to go and spend $50 million in a given market to grow or anything. it just -- we do something where we spend maybe $1 million on some influencer marketing or something and from then on the flywheel takes over. so the nice thing is we don't have to spend that much and then we're going to see -- we're hopefully going to see it grow.
so i think it's a pretty nice -- we're very excited about china, but we're cautious about it. and i think it will be foolish not to be cautious about it. thanks, mark.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks, luis. thanks, matt. thanks, debbie.
debbie belevan
great. and it looks like there are no other questions. so i'll just turn it back to luis.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
well, i think that's it. thank you so much. thank you for all the questions. and just once again, please watch duocon on august 26.
and remember to do your lessons otherwise, duo's going to come back here and kidnap my family.

2022-Q3,DUOL,2022-11-10 17:30:00,"prepared remarks:
debbie belevan
good afternoon, and welcome to duolingo's third quarter 2022 earnings webcast. all attendees are in listen-only mode. today, after market close, we released our quarterly shareholder letter with our q3 results and commentary, which you can find on our ir website at investor.duolingo.com. on today's call, we have luis von ahn, our co-founder and ceo; and matt skaruppa, our cfo.
they will begin with some prepared remarks before opening the call to questions. [operator instructions] please note that this event is being recorded. just a reminder that we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and financial performance, which are subject to material risks and uncertainties. some of these risks have been set forth in the risk factors in our filings with the sec.
these forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of today, and we have no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. additionally, we will present both gaap and non-gaap financial measures on today's call. these non-gaap measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, a substitute for, or superior to our gaap results, and we encourage you consider all measures when analyzing our performance. and with that, i'll turn it over to luis. 
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, debbie, and welcome, everyone. i'm pleased to report that we delivered another strong quarter, continuing the momentum we've seen all year. we saw accelerating user growth with daily active users increasing 51% year over year. we also saw bookings grow 41% year over year, which came from growth in conversion year over year and from steady retention rates.
we're not seeing any signs of consumer softness in our subscription metrics. and as a result, we're raising our full-year guidance again. i want to spend a little more time talking about our user growth because it's so important for our business. daily and monthly active users continue to accelerate for the fifth quarter in a row, reaching all-time highs in this third quarter.
of course, we can't expect this acceleration to go on forever, but the trend this year is evidence that our focus on organic growth, coupled with modest and efficient marketing spend is an effective strategy. this is why we continue to invest in r&d to make our products even more fun and engaging, which is what drives word-of-mouth growth. and our strong user growth this year will also help drive bookings growth in the future because we have a great free product without a paywall, a good portion of the learners that have joined us this year will convert to paying subscribers in the coming quarters, providing a tailwind for subscription bookings. as to other parts of our business, you all know that the digital advertising market has faced headwinds this quarter.
and while this impacted our ad revenue, the overall impact to our business has been small because ad monetization isn't a major focus for us. rather than actively seeking to grow this revenue stream, ads have served more of a strategic purpose for us, which is to help give learners a reason to convert to paying subscribers. on the other hand, in-app purchase revenue is a priority for us, as we believe it's a bigger opportunity than ad revenue. today, iaps or in-app purchases only make up about 5% of revenues, up from 3% last year.
but we believe we have plenty of room to increase this as we experiment with new features that encourage learners to make a la carte in-app purchases. overall, we continue to maintain our financial discipline and manage our costs prudently. while our headcount continues to grow, we have never gone nuts on hiring. and because of that, we don't have to implement cost controls like layoffs or hiring freezes in order to achieve profitability.
as i reflect on 2022, it's been a stellar three quarters for our business even as the macro situation has gotten more uncertain. and the fourth quarter is a busy and fun quarter for us. we have just launched our new home screen to most users, launched our new math app, and we launched our new year's promotion in late december. i'm excited about these efforts and look forward to all the energy and innovation that a new year brings.
and with that, i'll turn it over to matt to talk about our financial outlook.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
thanks, luis. we had another exceptional quarter, outperforming our expectations on the top line and on profitability. and given our outperformance, we are raising our full-year guidance. during the third quarter, we delivered total bookings growth of 41% year over year.
and as a reminder, over half of our revenue comes from outside the u.s. so, on a constant-currency basis, bookings growth would have been nearly 50%. as to our guidance, for q4 2022, we are guiding to $112 million to $115 million in total bookings, $98 million to $101 million in revenue, and an adjusted ebitda of negative $3 million to breakeven. for the full year 2022, we are increasing our guidance to $414 million to $417 million in total bookings, $364 million to $367 million in revenue, and an adjusted ebitda of positive $7 million to $10 million.
our full-year bookings guidance reflects 41% to 42% year-over-year growth, up from the 37% to 39% year-over-year growth we guided to on our last earnings call. our updated guidance assumes current foreign exchange rates, and note that every 1% increase in the value of the dollar versus our basket of currencies has about $0.5 million impact on bookings in the final quarter of the year. as luis mentioned above, we continue to be disciplined in how we manage our expenses. in the fourth quarter, we expect non-gaap r&d will increase as a percent of revenue as we continue to invest in making our products more fun, engaging, and effective.
our non-gaap sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue is expected to increase slightly and non-gaap g&a should stay roughly flat. for the full year, we expect to achieve approximately two to three points of operating leverage compared to last year. we ended q3 with approximately 47.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding using the average q3 closing price, and we expect to end the year with approximately 3% dilution from equity issued to employees. we will provide our full-year 2023 guidance on our fourth-quarter earnings call.
but in the meantime, i'd like to remind everyone that we believe we are still early in our monetization efforts and believe we have strong top-line growth ahead of us. we will continue to invest in r&d to drive user growth and monetization, and we will invest more in early stage efforts like the duolingo english test, duolingo abc, and duolingo math. but even as we do that, we will stay focused on making measurable progress each year to our long-term profitability target of 30% to 35% adjusted ebitda margins. and with that, i'll turn it back to luis.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
before we get into q&a, i'd like to thank the entire team who continue to deliver excellence in everything they do, creating engaging apps that are fun and effective, helping our learners reach their goals on converting more subscribers who ultimately support our mission. and now, we would be happy to take your questions. i'll turn it back to debbie to manage the queue.
debbie belevan
all right. thank you, luis. [operator instructions] and the first question comes from andrew boone at jmp securities. go ahead, andrew.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks so much for taking my question. i'd like to go to localized pricing. bookings on our numbers was down 16% year-over-year bookings per -- sorry, it was down 16% year over year.
can you just break that out versus fx versus the shift to localized pricing? and then just update us in terms of what you guys are seeing as you roll that out in terms of conversion benefits. and then secondly, as we think about profitability going forward, matt, you mentioned this in your remarks in terms of driving toward those long-term margins. is there any way you can help us think about that though as just there's been a greater shift toward the focused profitability, how you guys are thinking about just expanding margins and more of a steady cadence there? thanks so much.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. so, on your first question on regional pricing, just to remind everyone, we rolled out localized pricing starting last year, but really more broadly in q2 of this year because we saw it as a first step toward better international monetization, getting the pricing more akin to what's the purchasing power in the local markets. and when we did that, we were testing that thoroughly for a long period of time to make sure that the net impact of lowering the price was an increase in bookings and ultimately, an increase in lifetime value of those subscribers.
and we feel confident when we roll those out, but that was true. so, while that probably has an impact on our preferred metric of pricing, which is revenue per subscriber, not bookings, the ultimate impact will be a bigger ltv over time. this past quarter, to your point, our bookings per quarter and then flowing through the revenue was impacted by fx. so, that was another headwind to revenue per subscriber.
so, on that, we feel confident that we're making the right choices for the long-term ltv of the business even if pricing goes down in any particular quarter. as to your second point around profitability, the good news is it's actually not a shift in how we run the business. the businesses forever have been run disciplined so that we weren't burning through cash. and so, there really is no change.
the fact of the matter is we're going to continue to increase revenue faster than expenses. the operating leverage will flow through to the bottom line and will become more profitable over time.
andrew boone -- jmp securities -- analyst
thank you.
debbie belevan
all right. thanks, andrew. and your next question comes from ralph schackart william blair.
ralph schackart -- william blair and company -- analyst
good evening. thanks for taking the question. first question on macro. luis, i know you said you haven't seen it -- or at least broadly.
but just curious if you're seeing it even on the edges or any small signals. and i guess maybe give us a sense of sort of the durability in the use case for the product that might be able to continue to help it grow. should there be stiffening macro headwinds? and then i have a follow-up. thanks.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. so, of course, we're aware of the macro situation. so, we've been looking for our subscriptions product, we just haven't seen anything even if you say geographically. i mean, we just haven't seen any softness in the numbers.
like i said, in terms of ad revenue, we've seen that, but it's small for us. so, our main -- we're mainly a subscription product, and we just have seen no softness. and we just feel pretty good about it in terms -- and like also like i said, in terms of -- this year, we just have seen a pretty strong user growth, and that usually will convert over the next several quarters will convert in pretty strong bookings growth. so far, so good.
i mean, of course, like i've been saying also in every single call, i don't know what will happen in terms of if there's a major recession or anything because we, as a company, have never gone through a major recession, but so far, we just haven't seen any softness.
ralph schackart -- william blair and company -- analyst
great. and then in terms of in-app purchases, it seems like you're having some success there with i think gems you called out in the shareholder letter. maybe give us a sense, is this sort of an added focus for the company? are you merchandising more? is this just gems just sort of an exceptional product? just give us a sense there would be helpful. thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, that's a great question. we are spending more effort on in-app purchases. that's something that we really -- it wasn't until recently that we had a team really focused on that. and when we're growing at this point, where about 5% of our revenues are in-app purchases, sometimes people ask us how big can that be as a subtraction of our revenue.
and the honest answer is i don't know. but if you look at comparables, something like tinder has about 30% of the revenue from in-app purchases. so, we think there's a lot of room to grow from 5%. the main way in which we're going to be doing in-app purchases is through this gem economy, which is a virtual currency for duolingo.
and mainly, we're going to be building more and more features that encourage users. these are usually gamified features that encourage users to spend their gems. and you're going to see us building a lot more of those over the next several years.
ralph schackart -- william blair and company -- analyst
all right. thanks. appreciate it.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you.
debbie belevan
thanks, ralph. and your next question comes from ryan macdonald at needham.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter here. i want to start with international. obviously, that's been a big focal point for the business with earlier this year reentering china. but i thought it was interesting as well that duocon you talked about sort of two new launches.
one cantonese from mandarin speakers and then english for bengali speakers, which really unlocks two large learner populations in india and china. so, just curious what progress you're seeing internationally in the quarter and maybe how those new languages really drove that business or what's happening there.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah. thank you for the question because it's something that we are spending a lot of effort on. just to remind everyone, we are, again, mainly a subscriptions business. and about half of our revenue comes from english-speaking countries, u.s., u.k., etc.
we think there's a lot of room to grow internationally. if you look at the language learning market, like the off-line language learning market, the vast majority of it, the spend is internationally, in particular, learning english, which is -- we're a little different. we are -- because we are online, we're an app. we're still getting a lot of the spend come from places like the u.s.
or the u.k., but off-line, you would see the majority of the spend internationally. so, we think there's a major opportunity. and that's going to be a focus for us over the next several quarters. we're doing exactly what you said.
we are not only adding courses to -- typically courses to teach english to different populations, but not only adding them but, more importantly, expanding those courses and really making them teach to more advanced users. we're spending a lot of effort on that. and things like in-app purchases are going to be helping us for that also because there are certain regions where subscriptions are not preferred. so, kind of one-time payments are probably going to be helping us for that.
so, i mean, the main thing that i would say is this is a major focus for us, and we're going to be working on that again for the c.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
that's really helpful. and maybe then on marketing and advertising campaigns, this an area where you've been really efficient. it was great to see the nice progress you made off of the game of thrones collaboration. but there's a major sporting event coming up at the end of the month that brings millions of people together from all different languages.
it seems like a potential natural opportunity for duolingo to maybe capitalize on that. just curious here, are you doing anything around this event? and perhaps previously when we look at olympics or other major soccer tournaments like has that -- have you seen sort of that as a catalyst to drive more learners to the platform? thanks.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yeah, it's a great question. so, we definitely have a lot of stuff planned, particularly our social media. i mean, if you've been following our social media, we're quite good at social media. i mean, we do -- we really kind of strike a chord with it.
so, there's just a lot of stuff planned. certainly, you'll see our mascot duo doing silly things with -- in soccer fields. so, we have a lot of stuff planned for that. you're not going to see us do things like sponsor the entire world cup or something like that that would, in our view, not be very efficient marketing.
but i think we're going to be able to capitalize a lot on this. we're also doing these things where -- that allows -- that are going to allow people to send either cheers or insults to -- well, i mean, these are clean insults. they're not like terrible insults to teams in other languages. so, we have marketing campaigns like that on social media.
so, we're going to be -- it's pretty cool. so, i'm pretty excited about that.
ryan macdonald -- needham and company -- analyst
that was great. well, congrats again. thanks for taking the questions.
debbie belevan
thanks, ryan. and the next question comes from mario lu at barclays.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thanks for taking the questions. the first one is on the in-app purchases. as you continue to build out these new features like match madness, how do you strike a balance between optimizing for learning efficiency and monetization?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
you know, that's a great question. for every feature that we build, we try to do three things -- well, there's three things that we're really looking at, whether it's engaging, whether it helps with monetization and whether it helps with teaching. and in all cases, usually, each feature helps with one thing, but what we try to do is that it does not hurt the others. so, for in-app purchase stuff, most of the features that we're going to be building are probably going to be mainly helping with monetization, but we just want to make sure that they don't hurt engagement and also don't hurt learning.
so, generally, whenever we put something out there, even if it's like what may seem like a silly game like match madness, there's actually quite a bit of learning value there from the time aspect to it, basically tries to get the words kind of more cemented in your head. so, we're going to be trying just to make sure that it does not decrease any learning outcomes.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. and then maybe one on the new year's promo. it seems from the shareholder letter, you guys are pretty excited about it this time around, especially after last year's success.
anything to really look out for this time around that may be different that we should monitor?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
you know, it's -- we've done the new year's promotion several years in a row, we've gotten quite good at it. we know when to start it. we know which day to start, it's like basically december 28, that's the best day to start. we've a/b tested the hell out of all of these.
and so, we're pretty excited because every year, it worked out pretty well. where you're going to see -- one thing, of course, it looks different than previous years because we changed the look and feel of our subscription. it used to be called duolingo plus now it's called super duolingo with much better graphics. it's going to look different.
and we're going to try a new a/b -- a number of new a/b tests, for example, we're also going to be including the family plan, whereas in previous years, we hadn't included the family plan. so, there's stuff like that. but generally, we're just excited because it is a really exciting time of growth for duolingo. and we see it every year during new year.
not only do we get an influx of users because of new year's resolutions, but the new year's promotion allows us to really capitalize in terms of money for that. so, we're pretty excited by it.
mario lu -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you.
debbie belevan
ok. and your next question comes from mark mahaney at evercore. go ahead, mark.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. i think the -- one of the most interesting things in the print is this number of maus. i think 7 million. i think that's a record high.
so, could you tell us what the source of those maus were? and any early read into whether they are likely to convert into subscribers as well with the lifetime value of these record-high maus is? thanks.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
so, yes, so this quarter, i mean, basically, we've seen accelerated both dau and mau growth. and so, we're very happy with that. the source is -- the same thing that's been throughout -- basically most of our growth is organic through word of mouth. and we just keep -- the flywheel just keeps getting better and better, i think, mainly because the product keeps better -- is getting better and better.
we're able to retain uses more, and they tell their friends more when we add more social features and stuff like that. so, there's that. in terms of how likely they are to convert. our conversion rates are staying pretty steady or increasing over time.
so, they're about as likely to convert as all the ones that have been in the past. so, this is why we think for us, we're very excited with general user growth because it's kind of the top of the funnel that gets us more users, which then gets us more subscribers, which, you know, makes us more revenue.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
and then two more questions. just anything interesting geographically wise in terms of where those maus came from? is that like 6.5 million people from beijing? just -- it's a big number, so i'm just asking where those people came from? and then can i switch over to duo math, though? so, i've downloaded the app, but i haven't used it enough yet. i'll do it. just talk, if you don't mind about the monetization path forward, not how quickly you want to monetize it.
but do you think that the path is there to monetize it, as well as you've done language? math is a critical skill. and i saw you have adult stuff and stuff for early training. it's a critical skill arguably may be more critical than language, i don't know. but just talk about how you think about the path of getting it out there, monetizing it.
do you think it will be just as organic in its growth as duolingo has been as a language app to date? thanks a lot.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
sure. ok. so, the first question is in terms of geography and where are the kind of the new maus coming from and kind of the geographic spread. generally, we're seeing that we're growing across all geographies.
of course, some are growing faster than others. asia continues to be our fastest-growing place. it's not china. i mean, china has been growing some, but i mean, it's countries like india, vietnam, etc.
but that's the fastest-growing region. we're actually seeing above-average growth in countries where we monetize really well. so, u.s., u.k., western europe are all growing above average for us -- above the average, i guess, 51% dau growth or whatever, 35% mau growth. u.s.
and u.k. are growing above that. so, it's across all regions, but there's a few regions that are doing a little better. the -- in terms of math and monetization.
so, first of all, we launched this app two weeks ago. we're very happy with the launch so far. everything has gone as expected or better than expected. we're very happy with the product.
as you noticed, we have stuff for adults and also for children, one of the things that is interesting. so, the content there so far, the content is basically third and fourth-grade math. and if you have forgotten what that means, it's fractions, multiplication, angles, area of certain geometric shapes, perimeter of certain geometric shapes, etc. it turns out that adults really like this.
and if you actually look at it, we have more adult users than we have children users in the math app so far. again, it's only been two weeks, so it's early, but i think this app is going to be used more by adults than children. and that's kind of what i think. in terms of monetization, i'm pretty confident we'll be able to monetize this app pretty similarly to duolingo.
and i think what will happen -- and again, this is -- i'm talking about something that's going to happen quite in the future. so, take it with a grain of salt. but i think what we'll end up doing is we'll probably end up putting an ad at the end of a lesson, and then we're going to have the super duolingo subscription, which is going to be shared across our apps to help monetize this. we think that the family plan is going to help with this, but we also think that the math app by itself is going to stand on its own.
mark mahaney -- evercore isi -- analyst
ok. thank you, luis.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
sure.
debbie belevan
thanks, mark. and the next question comes from eric sheridan at goldman sachs.
eric sheridan -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks so much for taking the questions. maybe i'll follow up on that discussion you just had with mark about math, but broaden out a little bit. when you think about the long term and building more and more experiences and more and more apps and building out a platform, how should we be thinking about you utilizing the core duolingo user today to potentially mine for additional use cases and additional platform strength and growth or leaning into virality, which you did with the original duolingo app? how do we think about the platform strength building versus elements of outing to maybe spend more marketing there are individual use cases by apps? and then to bring matt into the question as well, how should we think about that in terms of like what you had to invest in '22 against the product mobile app and as we get into '23 and '24 and layer more monetization on top of those investments, how should we think about margin lift over the medium to long term? thanks, guys.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, eric. thank you for the question. so, ok, the first thing to say is, and it's something that i think we need to emphasize in every earnings call. for the foreseeable future, the majority of our business is going to continue being language learning.
i mean, language learning is -- we have a lot of room to grow in language learning. we really only believe we're scratching the surface, and we're early in our monetization days. and as you can see, our app is -- the growth is actually accelerating for the language learning app. so, for the foreseeable future, call it, the next two, three years, at least it will be mainly language learning.
now, of course, we're working on other apps. the math app is the first one. we have -- we're probably going to be releasing other ones. and we are going to be working quite a bit on cross-promotion to be able to send some of our users to the new apps.
now we want to do it in such a way -- by the way, games are very good at this. we want to do it in such a way that we spend some of our users from duolingo to, for example, the math app such that we also don't lose the duolingo users. so, they stay. it's kind of like a double win there.
they stay on duolingo, but we send them to also start using the math app, we think that will be able to seed that quite well. we're starting a team that is exactly doing that. and we think we have quite a bit of potential for cross-promotion here. but this is early, and we'll see what happens over the next we'll see over the next year to year and a half how that goes in terms of growth.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yeah. and then, eric, on the second part of your question around the investment. so, i think one of the really special things about the duolingo platform is that we were able to not only launch math faster than we otherwise would have been if we were kind of a de novo app. but all of the learnings that we've had from what makes an app engaging and effective port really nicely from language learning into math.
and so, when you ask about our 2022 investment and the investment that we'll be making over time, it's primarily engineers, product managers, and designers. but we're able to launch these with very small teams because they're leveraging all of the mechanics that we've built, and it's just incredibly scalable. so, for me, when i think about the margin impact, it's not been very much, and i don't think it will be that much more in 2023. and then when you think about marketing, again, we fully expect these to be organically grown apps.
in fact, that's what -- that's our goal with them. and so, the marketing impact will be small as well. so, that's the power of the platform that we've built.
eric sheridan -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks for the color.
debbie belevan
ok. the next question comes from aaron kessler at raymond james.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you. two questions. first, just maybe if you can update us on the family plan adoption and kind of what that's doing for retention rates? second, you talked a little bit about shifting some of the ad supply from more internal promotion. just curious if you're seeing the results thus far in terms of that driving more subscriptions.
as well as i guess third question would be just any macro softness you're seeing on advertising overall. thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
ok. so -- sorry, the first question. what was the first question?
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
family plan.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
yes. family plan. so, family plan is growing quite nicely. we've -- we now, i think, are -- last time we spoke, family plan was in the single digits, we've crossed double digits.
and it keeps growing, growing quite nicely. and of course, the really nice thing about family plan is that retention of people in the family plan is much higher. again, because if you're paying and as long as any of them -- any other people in your family are still using it, you're going to continue paying. so, we feel very good about that.
in terms of the exact -- what exactly has done to our overall retention, i don't actually know off the top of my head, i'm sure matt does, but i'm not sure if we release that. but i'll let matt answer that one. i don't know.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yeah, for sure. so, i mean, i think the way to think about retention, there's two types of the retention that we measure. so, on user retention, user retention is continuing to grow nicely for us. your focus -- your question was primarily around subscriber retention.
so, when you look at the platform level, so take all of the subscribers we have and how are they retaining, that retention rate has gone up dramatically over the past year or two because we've seen a real big mix shift from monthly to annual plan, and the annual plan retains better. family plan is a subset of that that retains even better. and so, while it's probably not like the biggest material platform level shift, we expect the cohort level retention to be improved for some time and even more as we increase the family plan percentage. so, we're really happy with how that's retaining and how that's going to impact the ltv of the platform.
your next question was on ads. and so, the ad revenue, as you can see from our financials, was impacted, we think, by what looks to be a kind of industrywide advertising slowdown. so, i don't think there's anything super surprising in that. i think there was some foreign currency impact as well because a lot of our ad business comes on android outside the u.s.
but again, ads to us, again, as luis mentioned, they're not a material part of our business. they're not strategic outside of the fact that they help us convert free users to subscribers. so, we saw it, but we think it's just not that big of a deal for our business going forward.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
part of your question, i think, was also that we -- whether we've tried switching some of our ads to subscribe. and yes, we keep running experiments to do that. there's some optimal mix, and we keep trying to find it. so, yes, we are always running experiments to see what is the right mix.
it turns out the mix depends on the user. there are some users that are a lot more likely to subscribe for them, it's probably a lot better to give them ads to describe where there are some users that are just essentially never going to subscribe. and for them, the best thing we can do is just probably give them programmatic apps.
aaron kessler -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. thank you.
debbie belevan
thanks, aaron. and the next question comes from nat schindler of bank of america.
nat schindler -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. hi, guys. a couple of questions. first, on the user numbers.
just digging in a little bit there. q3, at least in the northern hemisphere is when school starts. so, was there any new promotions and pushes to get school children using the product that would have helped that number? or is this just, i don't know, viral?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
well, it's a good question. so, yes, in the northern hemisphere, school starts in q3 usually. and every year, we see a growth that has to do with back-to-school. we do -- we run some -- we don't do a promotion, but we run some kind of very efficient marketing that is either on our social media or a little bit of paid acquisition that is related to schools.
we also have a schools product, which is duolingo for schools. what it is, it's a dashboard for teachers. so, the students use the normal duolingo, but the teachers have a dashboard that tracks what the students are doing as opposed to having to go and look at every phone kind of in person. so, we have that product.
but we've had that product for a couple of years. and so, we see this growth every year. we -- but this year, we see accelerated growth is, i guess, we're doing even better than the previous years, not just with back-to-school. my guess is that had something to do with it, but more of it was just organic growth that keeps getting better and better.
nat schindler -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. and second question, has there been any change, or can you give us any clarity on what the -- where you are on the duration of your average booking, what you're selling? i think last time you were around 90% annuals. has that changed? and can you tell us what it was like over the last few quarters so that we can be aware when this is -- how it's been affecting numbers?
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yeah, it's a great question. and so, nat, the answer is we are roughly still around 90% annual plan. and i think when you look back a year ago, the number was in the 70s. so, as we've gone through the course of the past, call it, four to six quarters, the percentage of that the annual plan has gone up quite substantially.
it can't go up the same amount anymore, right? if it went from 70% to 90%, it can't go from 90% to 110%. so, the way we're extending the retention of it, luis, [inaudible] question now.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
maybe it could go above a 100%, i don't know.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
but the way we're extending the kind of the synthetic duration, i guess, to use a bad phrase is through things like the family plan, right? that's how you actually extend the lifetime of the subscribers longer as you increase the retention to things like that.
nat schindler -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
no, not -- it's not just a problem for the extending the lifetime. that's great, too. but i assume when you -- if everybody is looking at bookings growth, if you're increasing the amount of annuals, you're selling 12 months instead of one month, one and a half months, i guess, in a quarter on average, that can have a pretty big effect. is there a quarter where we should really watch for that, the difference is big year over year.
matt skaruppa -- chief financial officer
yeah. over the course of 2023, we will see some impact from that. but there's not going to be one particular quarter. and in general, we still feel that we'll be able to lap those quarters as well in terms of growth.
nat schindler -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thank you.
debbie belevan
the next question comes from arvind ramnani at piper sandler.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to ask a couple of questions on math. it's still early days for math, and it's too early to kind of say, you know, where this is going to go.
but i know you're going to kind of track data by the hour, by the day, certainly. so, these early days, like how is the adoption numbers if you have? and if you don't have the -- don't want to share numbers, like maybe i think, can you give us cohorts, right? like existing language users, folks who are paying users of duolingo, or these fresh greenfield users? like just give us a nature of the cohort of customers have signed up for the math product. thank you.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
thank you, arvind, for the question. so, there's a number of things to say. so, yes, first of all, early days. it's not like we even know that much.
i mean, obviously, we have all the data, you are right. we track it by the hour. we really look at it a lot, but it's very early days. and our experience is that when you launch an app, it just takes a while to -- for things to settle for you to really figure out what are, and we just have had this for two weeks.
i can tell you a few things. one, if you look at the retention of the users of the math app, so far, it looks actually quite good. it's not as good as duolingo, but duolingo is an app that's been optimized for 10 years. so, it's hard to compete with, but it is certainly a lot better than the initial retention of duolingo when we launched duolingo 10 years ago.
so, it's a lot better. so, we feel pretty good about a completely new app having such good retention. we feel good about that. in terms of the users, we haven't done much -- i mean, it's not like we've done any paid advertising.
we've not done any marketing campaign or anything. so, where the users would come from now is our social media pushes that we've done and some of the press that was written around it, and some of the word of mouth that has happened. but there's just not a lot of time that has -- for word of mouth to happen. there's only been two weeks.
so, so far, we know that more than half of the users of the math app have a duolingo account. we know that. but other than that, there's just not -- we don't know much more than that.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. and then, you know, from a product perspective, just kind of looking at initial feedback, have there been any like big product enhancements that we need to see? or you feel like -- because kind of the product is never done, right? like duolingo you've 10 years and changing. so, i understand there will be an enhancement in math, but have there been any sort of big sort of like flaws in terms of design, product, anything else that you've identified? or you feel pretty good about kind of keeping things going at its own gradual pace?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
i mean, the truth is we feel pretty good. before launching, we knew what the road map is for the next several years, and the road map remains the same given all the user feedback. and it's just going to be like -- it's going to be like duolingo, like you said, over the last 10 years, duolingo is still getting better every single quarter, even though we've been working on it for the last 10 years, i think it's going to be the same for the math app. we have 10 more years of work to do.
similarly, i know there's been a lot of questions about math, but i just really want to remind people language learning is our main thing right now, and it's going to take a while for math to catch up. i mean, it took 10 years for duolingo to make whatever revenue we're making these days, roughly $100 million a quarter. it's going to -- hopefully won't take 10 years for the math app to get there, but it will take several years to get there just. and we just have -- and in terms of the road map, we know we need to add more content.
i mean, we have third and fourth grade-type of content. we're probably going to go to fifth and sixth-grade type of content. so, we're going to add more content, and we have a number of other things that we just know we need to add that are -- that come from duolingo. so, for example, the streak in the math app is not as sophisticated as the streak in duolingo the other day, we were looking at our streak mechanic for duolingo.
that thing is so sophisticated. like you would be surprised how sophisticated is to make sure that users don't lose their streak because losing your streak is like a terrible thing. whereas the math app has a pretty simplistic version of the streak. so, we're -- stuff like that, there's all these things that we know from duolingo that we just need to start putting into the math app what we haven't yet.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst
yeah. just one last question on math. you know, when i look at duolingo language, there's no other product. there's no user base.
you kind of have to kind of build this brick by brick. math, you have this massive user base and actively engaging. is there a plan to kind of use this -- i would say, kind of the core application to promote math? i mean, have you started to do that, like [inaudible]?
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
100%. we plan to do that. we have not started that at all, we will. and the type of integration -- you can actually get really good at this type of integration.
this is the type of stuff we've talked about. so, the simplest thing in which -- we haven't even done the simplest thing. the simplest thing is just at the end of a duolingo lesson, put an ad that says, hey, by the way, we have a math app. that's the simplest thing.
but you can get more sophisticated. so, slightly more sophisticated is your ad could be playable. so, you can write there be like ""oh, try it for a second."" and then you can go to the app. but then you can start getting much more integrated.
for example, on duolingo, we have these things called daily quests where you have to do certain things like complete three lessons or do a story on duolingo, etc. we can make one of the quests be, go do a math lesson, or you can make it so that now your streak on duolingo and the duolingo language learning app could be extended by doing math. so, you can do just much better integrations. and so, you'll see us do that.
we're going to try all these things over the next, however, long this takes. we're going to be trying all these things.
arvind ramnani -- piper sandler -- analyst

debbie belevan
great. thanks, arvind. and i'm showing no further questions. so, i'll turn it back to you, luis, for any closing remarks.
luis von ahn -- co-founder and chief executive officer
just thank you for all the questions and keep learning languages or math if you want. but yes, remember, spanish or vanish.
debbie belevan
