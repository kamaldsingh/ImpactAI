james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
thank you bill, and thank you all for joining our call this evening, to review our third quarter performance and business outlook. i am pleased to report that we continued to experience strong market conditions in the third quarter. the repair and remodeling sector for outdoor living remains on a positive trajectory and continues to expand. the demand for trex residential decking products remains robust reflecting their appealing aesthetics and performance, as well as the value proposition that our brand represents. net sales increased 17% year-on-year, with residential up 24%. we achieved a strong performance despite customer delays of commercial orders to future quarters and delayed shipment of produced residential orders that caused third quarter consolidated sales to be below our expectations. this was a very positive quarter for trex, both in terms of financial performance, and the progress we have made on our production output.
startup costs associated with our new enhance basics and natural products are largely behind us. additionally, improved manufacturing throughput at both our winchester and fernley facility, along with added capacity at fernley has increased our ability to meet the strong demand for our products. in addition we have begun the process of removing material from our new enhance product line. while the improvements are modest to date, i am pleased that the path forward to our original design has begun. this will provide us additional throughput as well as a modest cost reduction in the near term. trex residential gross margin improved 170 basis points sequentially in the third quarter reflecting improved production performance, as well as cost savings and higher capacity utilization. thanks to the combination of strong growth in residential products sales, manufacturing efficiencies and cost management, we were able to achieve significant operating leverage in the third quarter, driving a 44% year-on-year increase in consolidated diluted eps.
net sales contribution from commercial products was below our expectations in part due to market conditions and in part due to the uneven nature of that business, as some large customer orders were pushed out into future quarters. we saw gross margin improvement, both sequentially and year over year, reflective of our strategic shift to add more semi custom products to the portfolio and exiting an unprofitable product line. we continue to see benefits from this acquisition, which has added significant engineering capabilities. also, we are pleased that the newly launched ascent windscreen system by trex commercial products captured top honors in the 2019 glass magazine awards. the innovative glass windscreen was chosen by voters as this year's best product hardware or system. trex transcend continues to be in high demand and is recognized for its unparalleled quality and aesthetics. it is the brand of choice for top remodeler professionals, and earned a spot on the professional remodelers list of top 100 products for 2019.
this recognition reinforces trexs position as the go-to decking brand for trade professionals. trex enhance basics and naturals have exceeded our expectations and have expanded our addressable market thanks to its appeal to consumers who previously have not considered composites. while accurate third-party market data is not available, we are confident that the level of sales growth that trex continues to achieve is a clear indication that there is an accelerated conversion of our products from wood. in order to keep pace with demand, we have a multi-year capacity expansion program underway that will increase our capacity by at least 70% in 2021 and bring further manufacturing efficiencies to our production operations. in the third quarter we installed two additional lines in our fernley facility. and three lines will begin ramping up in the second quarter of 2020. one additional production line will be in operation in the winchester facility in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the new building being constructed in winchester will start ramping up production by early 2021 at the latest. all of this speaks to the confidence we have in the consumer demand for trex products and our ability to capture a greater share of the wood market in 2020 and beyond.
now i would like to turn the call over to our cfo bryan fairbanks for the third quarter financial review. bryan?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jim. good evening everyone. consolidated net sales for the quarter increased 17% year-over-year to $195 million. while growth was robust consolidated performance was below our expectations for two reasons: first we had lower-than-expected contribution from trex commercial products due to customers pushing out orders to future quarters; and at trex residential, delayed shipment of completed orders pushed shipments into the first week of october. trex residential products net sales increased 24% year-over-year to $183 million. this performance was driven by continued strong demand for our decking products and due to constrained supply earlier in the year. trex commercial products contributed $12 million to consolidated net sales in the third quarter compared to $19 million in the year ago quarter, mainly due to fewer large projects and to several projects planned for the third quarter being shifted to future quarters. adjusted gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 42.4%.
trex residential gross margin expanded 110 basis points to 43.4%. however, please keep in mind that net sales and gross margin in the comparable quarter last year were negatively impacted by a $6 million charge related to expanded product stocking positions in residential sales channels. sequentially, trex residential gross margin expanded 170 basis points as start-up costs are behind us. we continued to absorb increased material cost presently needed to maintain higher throughput levels for our enhance products. while we have begun to reduce material from the product to generate increased throughput and reduce costs, we expect this will continue over the next 12 to 18 months. commercial products gross margin expanded 60 basis points year-over-year to 26.5% as the adverse impact of legacy products rolled off and benefits related to improved project management were realized. sg&a was $27 million compared to $28 million reported in the third quarter of 2019.
as a percentage of net -- percentage of net sales, sg&a was 14.1%. the year-over-year decrease was related to personnel related expenses. our third quarter tax rate was 24.7% compared to 25% in the year ago quarter. net income was $42 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, increasing 42% and 44% respectively, from the comparable quarter last year. adjusted for last years $6 million charge, earnings per share increased 26%. to briefly sum up our performance year-to-date, we reported a 7% increase in consolidated net sales to $581 million. trex residential product sales were up 10% to $542 million and consolidated net income amounted to $109 million or $1.86 per diluted share. our year-to-date operating cash flows were $99 million. our capital expenditures were $37 million, compared to $22 million in the year ago period, mainly due to our investments and improved throughput and spending related to our announced capacity expansion. this quarter, we repurchase approximately 125,000 shares of our outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase program for a total outlay of approximately $10 million.
under the program to-date, we've repurchased approximately 835,000 shares. we have approximately 5 million shares available for repurchase left under our program. for financial modeling purposes, please note the following items. we reaffirm our expectation for second half 2019 consolidated incremental gross margin of approximately 45%. weve revised our full year capital expenditure guidance from -- to $65 million to $70 million compared to our prior estimate of $75 million to $80 million. the decrease is due to timing of actual cash payments related to our capacity expansion project.
now i will turn the call back to jim for his closing remarks.
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bryan. market conditions continue to be positive for trex. the strong demand for the residential products lineup and an expanding addressable market position trex for strong double-digit growth in 2020. trex continues to benefit from key competitive advantages. we are the leading brand in our industry and a clear market leader with approximately 50% share of composites. we have the best distribution and dealer network in the business and are a best-seller at the major home improvement retailers. traffic to our website continues to expand nicely and we are making ongoing investments in tools that guide the consumer through the entire deck design and building process. in addition to the sustainability appeal of our products the fact that 95% of our input materials are derived from recycled material is a major cost advantage.
we have a track record of driving gross margin expansion and expect to continue to drive improvement in that regard in the upcoming quarters. taken together these attributes underpin our confidence heading into 2020. 2019 has been a challenging year. i would like to thank our channel partners for their hard work and continued support in 2019. their effort and support is greatly appreciated and has positioned our collective businesses well for a strong growth in 2020 and beyond. in the near-term, we expect this year's fourth quarter to be another period of double-digit sales growth with consolidated net sales of approximately $160 million and a modest sequential expansion in gross margin. this will be driven by expanded residential sales due to the delayed shipments from september and continued strong consumer demand in the fourth quarter. this will be partially offset by lower sales for residential products sold under our early buy program compared to december of last year.
in december of 2018 early buy demand was quite strong as distributors and dealers placed orders in advance of an announced price increase on certain products. we expect the sales from december for the early buy to move into the first quarter of 2020. commercial sales will be down year-over-year due to customer delays and softer demand similar to the third quarter. during the fourth quarter we will experience downtime in both virginia and nevada to enable certain infrastructure modifications related to our expansion projects. this planned downtime will reduce throughput and will pressure margin during the fourth quarter.
this has all been included in the sales and incremental margin guidance which bryan provided. operator, i'd now like to open the call up for questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question will come from john baugh of stifel. please go ahead.
john baugh -- stifel -- analyst
thank you. good evening. few questions to lead off here. one, is there any color, jim, you can provide maybe year-to-date on how transcend has performed in units and pricing? and i fully recognize and feel free to throw it in there if you want the december shipments probably should be in '19 in that kind of calculation?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
yes, john. there was a significant amount of transcend sales that were shipped in the fourth quarter of 2019, i am sorry 2018 to avoid the price increase that i mentioned earlier. we have seen a small amount of cannibalization on that product. but quite frankly it's a little bit early to tell because the availability of our product in the marketplace suffered due to our ability to produce our entire product offering. as we were trying to give a full representation of our product across all channels, we struggled to get the mix right on the product. so i would say, at this point, we believe it's going to be approximately what we had anticipated. and further than that i don't think i can give you further guidance.
john baugh -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then maybe a clarification on all these line additions. so you added two lines in fernley. and then you expect to add an additional line in winchester here in q4 and then there's three more lines coming on in q2 '20. i assume those will be at fernley?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct. those three additional lines will be at fernley. and we'll start ramping those up in the second quarter of 2020. the one new line is the one in winchester. we found a way to take a line and insert it into our existing facility. really had to shoehorn it in but we were able to get it in. it will not be as strong from a performance standpoint as a full line but it will give us additional throughput that i know our business partners will appreciate.
john baugh -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then lastly, i'll defer to others. but anything, distributor meeting, anything that we should look for that's new in '20 versus '19? or we did enough this past year and it's kind of steady as she goes?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
there are very few new products. they are primarily in the railing category but nothing of significance in the decking side of the business.
john baugh -- stifel -- analyst
anything with distribution changes?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
no distribution changes of any significance. we did have a minor change in distribution out in the denver market where an existing distributor, we modified that relationship and moved to another existing distributor. but that's the only change for trex. competitors did have a couple of changes that took place. and i think the word is out publicly that fiberon picked up a west coast distributor by the name of orepac.
john baugh -- stifel -- analyst
great. thanks, appreciate it.
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
you bet.
operator
and the next question will come from ryan merkel of william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
hey, thanks. couple of questions. first off on the enhance line, how close are you to fully satisfying channel demand and when do you expect to be fully caught up?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
i would say, in the month of november we will be caught up with channel demand. we made significant progress in september. we will make a lot more in october. and i would guess we're going to be very close to having the inventory in place that would be a normalized inventory sometime late october, early november.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
november tends to be the low point for distributor inventory over the course of the year. so we'll be actively shipping. and with our present plant, as we expect they get back, roughly in line with their normalized inventory for the end of november.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
got it. good to hear. okay. and then next, any chance you can quantify to push sales in the quarter for both commercial and residential?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so compared to our guidance that we provided of 205 million to 210 million share, we look at last year the amount of shipments that we had available to ship versus what we had last year available to ship. it increased by about $7 million. the remainder of that would be related to the commercial division.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
okay. and then just lastly on sg&a, 14.1% is a big improvement year-over-year. what drove this? and is it sustainable?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
a much higher demand in the third quarter than we would normally see because of the deferred demand and the lower inventories that were in the channel leading into the second quarter. so seasonally speaking it was a much larger quarter than what you would normally have. and that really drove it from a percentage perspective.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
got it. that's enough, thanks.
operator
the next question will come from kurt yinger of d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah. great. good afternoon, jim. and brian, thanks for taking my questions. first of all, this year has been a bit abnormal as far as the quarterly sales cadence. if we look back in the last couple of years, call it, 55% to 60% of revenue has kind of come in the first half. is there any reason to think that would be different in 2020? or should we expect i guess a typical quarterly cadence?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i would expect, as we look out into next year you get back to more of a typical cadence. what can change that is the timing of the busy part of the season kicking off. sometimes that could be the end of march, sometimes it's the second week of april. you don't know until you actually get out into that timeframe but it can't move the sales from quarter to quarter. but i would expect that you will see a much more normalized-type seasonality to our revenue next year versus what you saw this year.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then i appreciate the timeline for the additional capacity. maybe can you put a little bit of thought around how you're thinking about potential costs associated with additional training or labor or lower fixed cost absorption or anything like that?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think we discussed in prior calls we will have some headwinds as we bring labor on before the lines are actually ramped up. we will need to train those individuals. we will need to have maintenance staffing on hand. so there will be some headwind to bringing that labor on before it's absolutely necessary for production. offsetting that, as we move back into next year, we've taken a bit of a pause on our cost-saving project programs this year, mostly as we're focused on improving the throughput to get more product available for our customers. as we get into next year, there is a number of projects that we see that are available to us that will help to offset those labor headwinds.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thanks, bryan. and then just lastly, i know residential railing isn't the top growth priority. but is there anything worth calling out there as far as opportunities to maybe accelerate growth or perhaps increase the attach rate with your decking sales?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we continue to have good cooperation with our commercial division and using their engineering expertise to allow us to come to market rapidly with new railing profiles that our marketing team has desired for some time. we've got a total of three product lines that have now been launched using the engineering capability of our commercial division and then commercializing it within residential. so we see additional opportunity to be able to fill areas of the market that were not hitting today with our existing product lines.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great, thanks very much. i'll turn it over.
operator
our next question will come from matt mccall of seaport global securities. please go ahead.
matt mccall -- seaport global securities -- analyst
thanks, good afternoon guys.
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
afternoon.
matt mccall -- seaport global securities -- analyst
so maybe as i roll down the list here, so weve got reduced throughput, drag from new lines, you've got some maintenance downtime, increased material costs, i guess, total. and then bryan i think you just talked about you've kind of delayed some of the cost savings. is there any way to kind of combine all that and give us an idea of what the impact has been or is it expected to be on '19? and then more importantly, what the opportunity is maybe if some of those pressures subside as we move on to '20? what could that mean from a gross margin or gross contribution margin perspective?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we've not provided guidance out to 2020 as of yet on margin. but as the management team we are very focused on margin and providing continuous improvement. we recognize those headwinds that are out there with the additional capacity that's coming on, but we also see the opportunities and the cost-saving programs that we have and other efficiencies within our plants to be able to improve the margin along the way.
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
yes. one thing to remember matt. year-over-year we had a pretty horrific first quarter. the drag on that was primarily start-up-related and we don't expect to see a repeat of that kind of drag. so by definition we're going to start out a little bit stronger from an operation standpoint.
matt mccall -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. all right. and i think you quantified the delayed shipments in resi at $7 million, if i heard that correctly. what about the early, the impact of the early buy in q4? how much -- i don't think you said a number there. what do you think the impact is on a year-over-year basis from the early buy that's not expected to occur? did i say -- did i hear you say that more of it was going to show up in q1?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. the portion of the early buy that does not occur in typically december, for example, last year, what we shipped out in december didn't appear in the first quarter. this year we will go back to a more normal cadence where you have a more normal december for early buy with the remainder of that product being ordered january through march.
matt mccall -- seaport global securities -- analyst
and what was the abnormal dollars last year? can you quantify it?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i can but we're not going to get down to that level at this time.
matt mccall -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. last question i had. i thought you said something about exiting an unprofitable product line in commercial. was there any impact on revenue? is there -- was there any impact on gross margin? is there any impact on gross margin as you move forward? or was it kind of a small deal?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
it's a smaller piece of the business but it was quite impactful in an adverse manner over the last 2 years on their gross profit. it was a fully customized product offering that as we got into it, we determined it was not something that made sense for us. we offered them alternatives which they believed would be a better approach to the market. so we're going off the market a little bit different way. the reason it's probably important is, as you exit a certain strategy and begin the new one, you would love it to be a direct replacement but it's not. so there's a portion of that business that we'll lose for about 1.5 years as we start building the new products and putting the new products in their place. so what we saw as a ramping down of demand this year, it will be lower demand than what we saw 2 years ago for this product category, albeit the new product is substantially higher profit than the old is.
matt mccall -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay, all right, thank you jim.
operator
our next question will come from alex maroccia of berenberg. please go ahead.
alex maroccia -- berenberg -- analyst
hey, good afternoon guys. thanks for taking my questions. so the first one is on raw material pricing. based on some industry data i've been reading recently, it looks like recycled polyethylene was up pretty drastically this month. do you know why this was and how you're mitigating it for q4?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
we have an experience an increase in -- price increases in raw polyethylene. we have seen a little bit of an increase in wood fibers that we buy. but as far as it relates to the polyethylene it's been flat to slightly down.
alex maroccia -- berenberg -- analyst
okay. good enough. and then the second one is on international strategy. doesnt look like youve spoken about it in the past couple of quarters. but can you just discuss a little bit about the demand you're seeing there and how you're starting to shift some of the newer products to those geographies?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
the new products are certainly attractive in some of those international locations specifically in europe. they like the new products. right now we are heavily focused on north america. we are expanding the shipments into europe in particular, primarily focused on the consumer side of the business as opposed to commercial at this point. as we roll out into the latter part of 2020 and 2021, we will start opening the door a little bit further at that point and service the entire demand for that. we see that as a really nice growth opportunity. so we see the interest, we see the demand but at this point we're going to focus most of our throughput to support the north american market.
alex maroccia -- berenberg -- analyst
okay, got it. thanks a lot.
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
the next question will come from phil ng of jefferies. please go ahead.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, guys. you mentioned that resi was a little weaker because of delayed shipments. can you provide a little color what drove that delay? was it -- did it have anything to do with like your production ability?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it really was the timing of completions of the order were later in the month. and typically this time of the year, at the end of september, we're able to basically pool those shipments together and get them out. and we ended up having a fairly large amount of orders that had been released that didn't get on trucks. and its nothing more complicated than that. they basically all got out, i would say, virtually all of them got out in the first week to 10 days of october.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and then you mentioned in the fourth quarter you're planning to take some downtime. how much is that? does that have any impact on your sales for the fourth quarter? and i think you mentioned that it could have an impact on profitability. is that enough to pressure gross margins on resi to be down year-over-year?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. so within our guidance, the guidance implies increased margin. we just wanted people to understand that we have been running our lines hard over the past 6 months. we talked about running everything in the fourth quarter which we will do. but we are taking reasonable steps to make sure that we do the appropriate maintenance and do the upgrades required on the lines that we have. i don't see that as bearing any impact on our sales in the fourth quarter, just more of a let the market know how we're going about managing this period of time where we're running our operations at extremely high utilization levels.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. it sounds pretty manageable.
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
yes. there are certain plant shutdowns we have to do to be able to support the new production hauls and production lines that are going up. so each plant needs to take several days to shut down so that they can, for example, put new electrical lines across to the -- where the new building site will be in winchester. and as we do that, it just means that we have less production. it's all included in that sales projection that we provided and the incremental margin numbers that bryan provided earlier.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. okay. and just one last one for me. the commercial business is obviously newer for most of us. you're lapping some tough comps and some of this business got pushed out. but obviously when we look at some of the macro commercial indicators suggest the market is falling a bit. just curious how your conversations are shaping up with your customers? and when you look out at 2020, do you expect that business to grow year-over-year?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
i think there are two things you need to remember. this business, as we said all along, will be very lumpy. last year we had two major stadium/arena projects that basically were on high gear. we did not have a repeat of that this year. so that by itself is a drag. with regard to your other question, do we expect to see year-over-year sales expansion? the answer is yes, but not a dramatic sales expansion.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thank you. appreciate the color.
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
you bet.
operator
and the next question will come from keith hughes of suntrust. please go ahead.
keith hughes -- suntrust -- analyst
thank you. on the gross margin guidance, 45% consolidated in the second half. it's good bit above that in the third thus implying it will be below the 45% in the fourth. i'm trying to reconcile that with some of your comments on gross margin up year-over-year in residential. i think i'm missing some numbers here. can you just go over that one more time?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so the 45% incremental, that's for the back half of the year. and that's on a consolidated basis not just a residential basis.
keith hughes -- suntrust -- analyst
right. okay. so that would imply that our assumed margins, it's going to be lower than in the fourth. so that would assume margins would sequentially move down on a consolidated basis?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
on a consolidated -- looking at it, i'm sorry, on an adjusted basis. so you have to adjust for the $6 million in the third quarter that we had in the third quarter of 2018.
keith hughes -- suntrust -- analyst
okay. so that's what i was missing. okay. so that's adjusted for the $6 million. okay. that answers that. and i guess as you look at inventory levels, you talked about a little bit. but specifically looking at enhance, do you think you will have the inventory levels of enhance you want to have by november to get ready for the, particularly the first quarter, as distributors start buying for the season?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
yes. we've basically seen an improvement in our ability to supply, in particular, for example, when you look at the west coast. as you are aware we are on allocation on the west coast. there were distributors that did not take their full allocation beginning in the month of september for example. we do see production ramping up at both locations. and we are filling up the gaps in the inventory at distribution. and we think between the inventory, we will build and the inventory that they have we should be in good shape for the start of the season.
keith hughes -- suntrust -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
our next question will come from alex rygiel of b. riley fbr. please go ahead.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thank you. bryan were there any one-time items that impacted sg&a in the third quarter?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. the only thing that we really had was a little bit lower personnel spending that we had last year. that's the largest variance of it. we talked earlier about why the percentage is lower than what you would normally see and that's just purely because of the high nature of the seasonality we had in the third quarter of 2019.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
and any chance you could quantify the cost pressure in the third quarter within the residential business?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we have not provided guidance on the additional material usage that we've had within the product line. we kept it to a higher level including those costs as well as other opportunities that we've been able to offset some of that along the way. but we've not gotten into what their exact material cost is or margin impact at this point.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
maybe i can ask the question in a different way. well id get the same answer but let me try. you've referenced that you'll have some cost pressure headwinds until call it year-end 2020. how should we think about what your -- i guess your overall pressure is from that standpoint? or maybe what your target margin is at that point in time?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well jim mentioned that we've got the three lines coming on at our nevada facility. so labor will come on in advance of those lines and we'll be bringing on labor at our virginia facility later in the year to support the 2021 lines that are here. i mentioned earlier we are very margin-focused organization. we see opportunities for further cost reduction being able to improve throughput on the lines that we have. so continued focus on margin improvement is what this management team will be going after.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thank you very much.

so just a few left for me here. on sg&a, kind of looking at it going into 4q, i mean you usually don't see much of a change from 3q to 4q from an absolute dollar standpoint. is there any reason that wouldn't be the case this year as we look in 4q?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
generally, that's probably a good way to look at it not a significant difference.
trey grooms -- stephens -- analyst
yes. okay. so nothing unusual that will take place this year. and then on the commercial side, you had pretty good margins on that business and you mentioned that the top line sales will be down year-over-year in commercial and the margins can swing around, it seems like, quite a bit in the 4q. is there any way that we can maybe try to quantify or give us some direction on how we should be thinking about that given the kind of unique situation i guess where you're having down year-over-year volume and/or sales in that division?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i wouldn't expect a significant margin difference quarter-over-quarter. i think it's in the ballpark of the third. so we -- in the first half of the year we had some pretty significant expenses associated with contracts that were underwater that product line that we exited. and i think we pretty much have all of that behind us now. i think there is one minor contract that was wrapped up in i guess october that will no longer have that kind of drag going forward.
trey grooms -- stephens -- analyst
i got you. okay. that's helpful. and then kind of sticking with commercial. you mentioned that there was some business that was delayed there. and it doesn't -- at least it doesn't look like from the guidance that that would pick up in the 4q. so is that something that would be pushed into maybe 1q of next year? or when the -- delayed projects, when does that usually come back to you?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
yes. it's not a business that you normally see with trex because our lead times are usually pretty tight. these actually can be pushed out quarters, not one quarter or two quarter, but multiple quarters. some of these projects have been pushed out longer than 6 months. so we'll pick them up eventually but we aren't going to see any of those projects. and some of those projects had work that was planned that would have been recorded in sales in the fourth quarter. we're pushing that out also because we don't expect that they're going to come back in the hopper until sometime late into next year.
trey grooms -- stephens -- analyst
got it. okay. and then last one for me. and this is maybe a little more high level. but jim, i know you mentioned today and i think you've mentioned in the past expectation for strong double-digit type growth in 2020. can you talk about your outlook just kind of for the core market, the underlying growth of the composite market as you look into next year? and just trying to kind of pace back and forth from what you guys are expecting as in your business versus the market? and where the rest of the growth will come from as far as market share gains and capacity increases?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
yes. historically, if you go back to last couple of years, we've seen mid- to upper single-digit overall growth in the decking and railing market. trex has been fortunate and we have participated at a much higher level. if you go back to last 4 or 5 years, you'd see that our average compound growth is closer to 15% incremental sales. last year we had two competitors that disclosed their growth. it was under 10% and we grew very nicely. in 2019 because we were unable to deliver product, some of those customers should have expanded their sales to something i would guess in low-single digit. the fact that i mentioned for the first time any guidance on the top line growth i think is noteworthy.
i think what i said was that we plan to have solid double-digit growth in 2020. the demand we've got and what we see is very strong. even though we couldn't deliver a lot of that demand this year it is continuing and we expect that we'll be able to drive demand through our branding activities. so we're pretty comfortable that we can drive demand as a lot of other consumer product companies do. and it's with that branding ability and having a product that is desired in the marketplace, as we've seen this past year that we believe we continue to see a strong double-digit growth.
trey grooms -- stephens -- analyst
all right, well, thanks a lot for the color. it's encouraging. keep up the good work. thanks.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks. appreciate it, trey.

[operator instructions] our next question will come from yves bromehead with exane bnp paribas. please go ahead.
yves bromehead -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
good evening gentlemen. i have two questions if i may. the first one, could you give us more color on your comments regarding material costs which you said that you expect to come down in the next 12 to 18 months? just wanted to understand what magnitude we are talking about and whether or not you can roll this out to your other product lines and then this -- the new enhance products?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
well, all of our decking products which is the core of our product offering are made primarily of two things: waste polyethylene; and waste wood fibers. the waste polyethylene over the last several years, we have seen a reduction in cost either due to the fact that the market -- underlying market has been going down or we've been able to find other sources of polyethylene -- waste polyethylene that was cheaper. this past year that reduction has slowed and we expect 2020 to again be a very slow reduction, not of significance, a much lower cost reduction on that material. wood fiber on the other hand has seen an increase in cost, primarily due to the fact that you have to go further to get the quantities that we need, which means transportation becomes a bigger part of the product cost. in aggregate, when you combine all those, it looks to me like our cost structure is basically flat year-over-year.
yves bromehead -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
yes. so and the second question. so do you have an idea of the addressable market in europe? and i'm  id be interested to understand what is the market share of composite decks versus conventional materials probably ceramics tiles and wood?
james e. cline -- president and chief executive officer
yes, yves the addressable market size is fairly challenging here in north america. we've got some good estimates for it. it gets more complicated as we move into the overseas markets. we believe at a very high level, about 60% of the market is north america, 40% of it is in the overseas marketplaces. all of that being said, there is a large market opportunity for trex to go after. we're a very small share of the overall market, albeit a nicely growing one in some of the larger economies with a larger gdp. so something that we're excited about. as we become a more meaningful share within those markets, we'll be spending some additional time in studying and understand exactly where our share is against the composite players, as well as the conversion opportunity against wood in those marketplaces.
yves bromehead -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
great, thank you very much for your answers.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

operator
good afternoon, and welcome to the trex company fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to viktoriia nakhla. please go ahead.
viktoriia nakhla -- director of investor relations
thank you, eilee. and thank you all for joining us today. with us on the call are jim cline, president and chief executive officer; and bryan fairbanks, executive vice president and chief financial officer. joining jim and bryan is bill gupp, senior vice president, general counsel and secretary, as well as other members of trex management. the company issued a press release today after market close containing financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. this release is also available on the company's website. this conference call is also being webcast and will be available on the investor relations page of the company's website for 30 days.
i would now like to turn the call over to bill gupp. bill? thank you, victoria. before we begin, let me remind everyone that statements on this call regarding the company's expected future performance and conditions constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. for a discussion of such risks and uncertainties, please see our most recent form 10-k and form 10-qs as well as our 1933 and other 1934 act filings with the sec. the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether it was a result of new information, future events or otherwise. additionally, ebitda will be referenced in this call and is considered a non-gaap metric. a reconciliation of ebitda to net income can be found in our earnings press release to trex.com.
with that introduction, i will turn the call over to jim cline.
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, bill. and thank you all for joining the call this afternoon to review our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 performance and our business outlook. the fourth quarter marked a strong finish to a challenging year for trex as we worked to meet exceptional demand for trex decking, all of which is made from 95% recycled content. despite significant start-up costs, we were able to convert high-single-digit sales growth and to a similar increase in earnings per share. thus 2019 was respectable year by most measures and importantly, set the stage for a strong 2020.
both consolidated and residential sales increased at a strong double-digit rate in the fourth quarter, which is impressive as it compares favorably to a very strong early buying season we experienced at the end of 2018. this positive momentum continues as we headed into 2020. additionally, our fourth quarter performance reflected the production improvements that have enabled us to progressively convert strong demand trends into meaningful sales gains. consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter improved by 80 basis points sequentially and residential gross profit margin expanded by 120 basis points from the third quarter levels. this progressive combined -- progressively combined with lower sg&a spend drove significant operating leverage, resulting in a 41% earnings growth on an 18% consolidated sales growth for the quarter.
the launch of the trex-enhanced products has given us access to a sizable untapped market as it has significantly narrowed the price gap between wood and trex composite decking. we estimate the composites account for 19% of the north american total decking market and that the enhanced products have further expanded our addressable market to about 60% of the overall decking market, currently dominated by pressure treated lumber. this gives trex a substantial runway for growth over at least the next 10 years. there are considerable aesthetic differences between our enhanced basics and natural decking products that provide us an advantage and penetrating this large market. enhanced basics, solid color targets, the most value conscious buyer while enhanced naturals features very variegated colors that look more like natural wood.
similar to the consumer patterns, we have experienced in the past. within our decking lineups, we are seeing early signs that many consumers are having -- are having made the decision to invest in low maintenance composite decking, are willing to spend more time and consider natural looking aesthetics offered in a high-priced naturals and transcend products. we also continue to see strong support for our flagship transcend decking. this product appeals to the buyer who demands a market-leading aesthetics, durability and overall performance that is anonymous with trex transcend.
as consumers invest more in their outdoor living areas, we continue to innovate bringing to market new railing options for our top and trex signature railing. through to trex's ecofriendly legacy, the aluminum used to manufacture signature railing is made from 50% recyclable aluminum and is a 100% recyclable. beyond the variety of design options ranging from horizontal rails to glass to mesh panels, trex is also committed to making installation easier with preassembled railing panels for most of the popular signature railing options that reduce the typical installation time by up to 50%.
additionally, trex introduced several new products at the international builders' show in las vegas last month, namely high-performance cladding using trex transcend deck boards ideal for both commercial and residential applications. and trex has also entered into two new licensing agreements. first, trex outdoor fire & water, a collection of stylish and durable outdoor fire features and water elements and second, a line of trex-branded stainless steel cabinetry solutions that further enhance the function of outdoor living spaces. for those of you who attended this year's home builders show, you know that the mood was very bullish, and there was clearly tremendous interest in composite decking. with the most extensive and integrated product line and our industry-leading brand, trex has positioned to benefit from this positive trend.
we remain focused on delivering best-in-class products officially expanding our production capacity and driving accelerated conversion from the wood decking market.
before i turn the call over to bryan for a financial review, i'd like to comment on the succession release that we issued simultaneously with our earnings this afternoon. as you are seeing, the board has appointed bryan fairbanks, president and chief executive officer of trex effective upon my retirement from those positions on april 29 of this year. i couldn't be happier with this choice as bryan and i have worked together closely since i asked him to assume the cfo role in 2015 when i was named ceo. we have had a great partnership since then and have worked in tandem with the key operating executives to accelerate the company's growth and deliver significant value for shareholders and all stakeholders.
i'm also pleased with the board's decision to appoint me as chairman, giving me the opportunity to continue to work closely with bryan and the rest of the trex management team. now, i'd like to turn the call over to bryan for the fourth quarter and full-year financial review and discussion of our capital expansion program. bryan?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thank you, jim. i appreciated those kind words. i look forward to working with jim and our leadership team to drive the company's continued growth and success as i move into this new role. thank you all for joining this afternoon's call. i'm pleased to report on our strong fourth quarter performance, which resulted in another year of record sales and earnings, reflecting high demand for trex products that has continued into 2020.
fourth quarter 2019 consolidated net sales were $165 million, 18% above the comparable quarter in 2018. this growth was led by a 25% sales increase in trex residential products to $153 million. strong year-on-year growth was driven by several factors, namely our brand leadership, coupled with the lasting beauty, minimal maintenance and long-term value of our high-quality trex outdoor products. it also demonstrates the accelerating conversion from the wood markets that jim spoke about earlier. trex commercial products contributed $12 million to consolidated net sales in the quarter, compared to $18 million in the year ago quarter, mainly due to fewer large projects and timing of completion on those projects.
consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter increased 40 basis points year-over-year to 43.2% compared to 42.8% reported in the prior year quarter. trex residential products gross margin was 44.6%, a sequential improvement of 120 basis points although below the 46.4% reported in the 2018 quarter. i'm pleased to report that in february, we started to remove the added material from the enhanced product and we will continue until we meet the original design target now projected to be largely complete by the end of the third quarter of 2020. due to equipment investments required, we expect this change will primarily benefit the second half of 2020. most importantly, this change will expand our throughput beginning in the second quarter. trex commercial growth product -- trex commercial products gross margin increased to 26.3% from 18.4% as legacy low-margin contracts rolled off and the commercial group drove improvement in overall project execution.
let me spend a moment on commercial performance. while improvements have been made, our expectations for increased levels of profitability have not yet been attained. new leadership is in place since the beginning of this year, and we are working closely with the team to drive sales growth and overall profitability. trex commercial has an excellent reputation as a trusted provider of commercial railing systems for installation and some of the largest and most complex environments. we also have strong relationships with many national architects, developers and installers. these capabilities and relationships are being leveraged to win less extensive projects such as office buildings, residential high rise, retail complexes and public projects. we believe there is a greater opportunity to translate the trex commercial product brand, project performance and relationship equity into improved financial results. additionally, the engineering and design expertise in our commercial area is enabling us to offer new residential railing options that are aesthetically appealing and efficiently produced.
sg&a expenses in the fourth quarter of 2019 were $25 million compared to $28 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. as a percentage of net sales, sg&a declined to 15.2%. net income was $35 million or $0.61 per diluted share, up 41% and 42% respectively from $25 million or $0.43 per diluted share reported in the fourth quarter of 2018. ebitda was up 40% to $49.9 million, while ebitda margin increased to 30.3% from 25.5%.
now, let me comment on our performance for full-year 2019. sales were $745 million representing a 9% increase from 2018 and led by a 13% increase in trex residential product sales to $694 million. full-year 2019 consolidated gross margin was 41.1% compared to 43.1% in 2018. trex residential products gross margin declined 320 basis points to 42.4%. this margin decline was attributable to certain factors, of which most will not reoccur in 2020. the primary factor is manufacturing efficiencies associated with the slower-than-anticipated production ramp-up of enhanced decking in the first half of 2019. as discussed earlier, we will also work to remove the material from the enhanced decking back to the original design providing the p&l benefit, due to material reductions. recall, this benefit will be weighted to the second half of the year. trex commercial products margin expanded 170 basis points to 23.5%. consolidated sg&a expenses for 2019 were $118 million, flat year-over-year. as a percentage of sales, sg&a declined by 140 basis points to 15.9%. the significant leverage in sg&a was driven by higher volume in our entry level enhanced product line, which does not carry the same level of branding spend and further spending efficiencies across the organization.
the effective tax rate for 2019 was 23.7%, slightly below the 23.9% of a year ago. net income for the full year was $145 million or $2.47 per diluted share, representing a year-over-year increase of 8%. full-year ebitda was up 5% to $202 million, while ebitda margin decreased from 28.2% to 27.1% mainly due to lower gross margin in the first part of the year. our full-year operating cash flow was $156 million, 13% ahead of 2018.
capital expenditures amounted to $67 million with the majority of it related to our announced capacity expansion plans. this compares to $28 million in 2018. as you know, we announced the multi-year capacity expansion program in june 2019, which is progressing as planned. we already have added two lines in our nevada facility and an additional line in our virginia facility. late in the second quarter of 2020, we will bring online and ramp up three additional lines at the nevada facility and an additional line in virginia. the quarterly trajectory of strong double-digit sales growth that we're expecting for full-year 2020 is tied to this ramp-up of additional capacity. at the same time, there will be some gross margin headwinds as we hire and train employees in advance of the capacity ramp-up. as announced in november 2019, we already have broken ground to construct a new building in winchester, virginia adjacent to our existing facility and expect the new line to start ramping up in early 2021. today, our engineering team notified us that pouring of the cement staff lab has started at the building site.
while our capacity expansion program remains a capital allocation priority, we continue to pursue further capital opportunities with our share repurchase program. in 2019, the company repurchased 500,000 shares of our outstanding common stock at an average price of $77 per share, totaling $38 million. for financial modeling purposes, our expectations for full-year 2020 are as follows. incremental gross margin is estimated at 50%. slight improvement of sg&a, as a percentage of sales compared to 2019, is expected. we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. capital spending is projected at approximately $140 million to $160 million with the majority earmarked for our expansion program and other cost reduction projects beginning to build in the second half of this year. we also anticipate higher dsos in the second and third quarter of 2020 as we extend more favorable payment terms as a part of our distributor program this year. but for the full year, working capital will normalize to more historical levels.
now, i will turn the call back to jim for his closing remarks.
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, bryan. i'd like to express my thanks to our dealers, retailers, distributors and contractors who continue to drive growth and ensure that our products are easy to buy and install for all trex customers. the economic outlook and projections for repair and remodeling spend are firmly in positive territory, and consumer confidence remains high. with this as a backdrop to our capacity expansion plans as well as the expanded opportunity to take share from wood, we expect strong double-digit revenue growth in 2020. as many of you may recall, december through march is generally considered a stocking period when the channel is sold at both distribution and dealer levels to ensure that product is readily available for the start of the spring building season. for the first quarter of 2020, we expect consolidated sales of approximately $200 million, an increase of 11% from the same period last year. as bryan mentioned, the cadence of the sales growth for the full-year 2020 will be closely tied to the increased capacity.
operator, i'd like to now open the call up for questions.
",":
operator
we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from john baugh with stifel.
john baugh -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
thank you. congratulations both jim and bryan for the transition.
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, john.
john baugh -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
let's see. i'll start out with the capacity, the additional line in virginia is planned, i think, you said start operating late q2, was that -- was that in the expectation and is that a full line of production?
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
that was included in our expectation, and these lines that are going into winchester prior to the full capacity ramp-up are allowed to move some of our accessory products that don't run at the same rates that our decking products run out. so, it allows us to use our largest and most efficient assets to run those decking profiles, while we can use a couple of these newer smaller lines to run some of the lower volume skus that don't run at the same level of efficiency.
john baugh -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
okay. and bryan, any help with d&a as we go through '20 and then, maybe even '21? i assume that will start ramping.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
so the d&a, it's inclusive in the 50% incremental margin. we haven't provided anything for 2021. let me take a look and see if there's any additional flavor we can provide behind that.
john baugh -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
okay. and was there anything in the receivables being down year-over-year? is just timing?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
really just timing. when we look at last year, there was a significant buy ahead on transcend due to the price increase. this year, there is no price increase, and we didn't see that level of purchases in december. there was more evenly loaded throughout the quarter.
john baugh -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
okay. and i appreciate the 50% help. i mean, obviously, a bunch of moving pieces more than normal in '20 in that calculation. and i don't know what if any granularity you'd share with us about the puts and the takes. you mentioned obviously training going up and d&a is going to go up. so i don't know if you can help us at all. think about that.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah. the biggest drivers are going to be lack of the start-up expenses that we had in the first quarter -- excuse me, in the first half of the year. we expect to start reducing the material in our enhanced product lines a little bit in the first quarter, some in the second, but we'll see that pretty well completed as we get out into the third quarter of the year. so those are both on the positive side. on the unfavorable side, we will have higher depreciation. you can see that our capital spending did increase significantly in 2019, as well as the ramp of hiring before we get these lines up and going. we need to make sure the employees are well trained, so that they can be efficient on day one.
john baugh -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
is there any comment on volumes and product mix as it relates to gross margin?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
we are pleased with the overall product mix that we're selling into the channel. it's in line with the expectations that we had. we've not historically provided any splits on the product lines except to say that it's in line with our expectations.
john baugh -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
okay. thank you and good luck.
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
thanks a lot, john.
operator
our next question comes from ryan merkel with william blair.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey, thanks. let me also offer my congratulations to both of you on the new role.
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
thank you. appreciate it.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
so let me start with sales. i had two questions. first of all, on the first quarter, sales up 11%. is that constrained by capacity? is that the reason why growth isn't stronger and then related to that, it sounds like the plan is for sales growth to accelerate through the year and that's tied to capacity coming online? did i hear that right?
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
yes. the first quarter is normally just to fill in. and it typically does not have a large percentage growth in it because you just aren't getting the takeaway at that point. it's called out usually, and you don't see the consumer and their buying. we did see this year due to the milder-than-normal weather a little bit of activity there that is giving us a little bit of tailwind. last year, we had a fair amount of product that was sold in the fourth quarter to beat a price increase and that's why that was depressed in that year. but i would expect the cadence to pick up in q2 and more importantly, probably q3 and also in q4.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then, i had a question on gross margin. i'm not sure if i'm thinking about this right, but if i add back the $16 million of one-time costs to 2019, the gross margin was about 43.3% and then your guidance implies gross margin at 42.4% roughly, so down roughly 100 basis points. and you mentioned d&a, you mentioned some hiring. is there anything else? am i thinking about that the right way?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i think you're thinking about the right way. we've not treated those start-up costs as an one-time in giving that margin guidance.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
okay. i guess lastly for me, can you quantify sort of the impact of hiring and sort of initial under-absorption of the new lines. and i guess what i'm sort of getting at is, is the right read that 2021, we would see gross margins starting to expand year-over-year?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
so that guidance is inclusive of the 50% incremental margin guidance. as we look out to 2021, we continue to see a roadmap where we can drive improved margins both at the gross margin level also at the ebitda level.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
got it. all right. thanks. that's [indecipherable].
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
our next question comes from keith hughes with suntrust.
keith hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
thank you. on the revenue guidance for the first quarter, can you give us any sort of field between residential and commercial, which we're expecting in the period?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
so we haven't split the two out. if we see where we were from a commercial perspective last year, we were down significantly over the quarter -- over the course of the year. we are starting to see improved bookings looking into 2020. we do expect growth within that organization. larger growth will come through the residential side of the business, both for the quarter as well as for the year.
keith hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
okay. and if we take your residential guidance, i've always kind of done half year -- six-month periods of time. if i do that in residential for the fourth and the first, is that -- does that give an idea of where you are in terms of a run rate or is there too much noise here in the off-season to use that?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
there is a lot more noise right now than what we would normally have. recall that at the end of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter is historically an inventory build time period. so from that perspective, it doesn't always indicate what the growth rate is going to be for the year, due to our capacity constraints that had a little bit of additional complexity to the situation. jim mentioned that we would see that sales growth come in line with the capacity coming on starting in the second quarter. so we see higher sales growth numbers in the outer part of the year.
keith hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
okay. and final question on the 50% gross contribution margin, it sounds like from your comments probably below that in the first half and above in the second half. is that directionally correct?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
what we said was it would build over the course of the year as we bring that capacity on. and as we start to remove the material from enhance and in a large scale, that's the right way to look at it.
keith hughes -- suntrust robinson humphrey -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from kurt yinger with d.a. davidson.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yes. good morning -- good afternoon, jim and bryan. thanks for taking my question.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
hi, kurt.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
just first of all, so the two additional firmly lines and the one at winchester, where would you kind of say production is on those at this point? has it gone to plan and are there any learnings that you're kind of taking away from those that you can apply to kind of the next wave in the second quarter?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
so for winchester, we've got one that's fully up and running and one that's in the investment stage that we expect to have up by the end of the second quarter. and finally, excuse me, nevada, all of those lines are up and running.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. and has it gone pretty smoothly? are they up to producing a target at this point?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. and it looks like you guys were able to build a bit of inventory sort of in the year-end. do you kind of -- do you feel comfortable with where that's at now, or is it still really just producing as much as you can and opening you build that up a little bit as the year goes on?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
we are still running our capacity at 100%. we would have preferred to have more inventory on the ground at year-end.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. and a lot of sg&a leverage in the quarter. it sounds like perhaps 2020 won't be that substantial. i mean you talked about the enhanced products having kind of a lower overall spend across the organization. do you think beyond 2020 sg&a leverage can potentially be a lot greater than it has in the past just given that enhance seems like a large sort of portion of the growth opportunity going forward?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i think it's important to note that yes, enhance is a large growth opportunity. it's not just of that entry level basic. it's both basics and higher priced enhance naturals product, but we do see ongoing opportunities to leverage sg&a. i think it's fair to say that some of those reductions were pulled into 2020 as we limited some of our branding spend to be able to manage the demand in the marketplace.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. makes sense. and then just lastly on the last quarter call, you touched a bit on cannibalization in regards to the new enhance lines and potentially transcend, but i'm just wondering with 2019 in the books, whether there were any sort of big takeaways from the data that's available to you all or if it was just generally in line with expectations?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
it was generally in line with expectations. there were some favorable surprises to us, but they weren't material in nature, because the products that they were being sold against carry reasonably similar margins.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thank you very much and good luck in the upcoming year.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thank you. appreciate it.

our next question comes from phil ng with jefferies.
philip ng -- jefferies llc -- analyst
hey, guys. congratulations jim and brian in your new roles. i guess, any way to help us contextualize the impact on margins once you have the remodification done with using less material in the back half and any risk or headwinds at least to start the year as you kind of retrofit your lines?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. that modification is inclusive of the guidance that we've provided. we think that the headwinds are accurately reflected in that number as well as the opportunity to remove that material. we would love to be able to make the changes immediately and run the product that our engineers have now shown us that we can do, but there will be some changes we need to make to our lines to be able to get that product to run that way as well as the additional throughput and that will take a little bit of time because we are running at full capacity.
philip ng -- jefferies llc -- analyst
got it. it sounds like you're running pretty full out still. can you give us a sense where your lead times are with your customers and given some of the capacity ramping up, do you expect to recapture some of the share that you may have ceded early last year?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
all of our customers know the capacity situation that we have. they know what's available to them on a monthly basis, and we are managing that supply with them to ensure that they have the product that they need.
philip ng -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay. and just one last one for me. it's helpful that you gave us the 50% incremental margin target for the full year. any more color on how to think about the shape of the year? i know from first half, it might be a little more depressed, but any more color would be really helpful.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
we will see the highest part of the benefit from the enhance material reductions in the second half of the year. we do have the labor headwinds that will hit us in the early part for our nevada facility. but then, we also have labor headwinds that will hit us in the second half of the year as we get ready to start ramping up the winchester facility in the beginning of 2020. then we also have the non-recurrence of the start-up costs. so as other analysts have mentioned, there are quite a few moving parts within there. to simplify it, the way we've shown it is that we see more of that benefit happens later in the year, but we are still looking at year-over-year improvements on a quarterly basis.
philip ng -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay. great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from trey grooms with stephens. trey, your line is open.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
sorry, can you hear me now?
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
i got you, trey.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
well, i was having a great conversation with myself. jim, i want to congratulate you on your retirement. i've enjoyed working with you. and bryan, congratulations on your new role as well.
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, trey.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
so, most of my questions have been asked, but do you have just a couple more? one is bryan, when you were talking about some of the capex that -- some of the things in capex that you're going to be seeing this year, one being, of course, the capacity, but you mentioned some other things, some other maybe more internal projects to reduce costs. so you're dedicating some capital to this year. any more color there on maybe what those are and what that could mean for cost savings?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, there is a number of projects that we're working on. and as we get to the back half of the year, some of our engineering capabilities will free up as the nevada lines come up into operations. one of the things that we will be pursuing, which we've taken -- it's probably fair to say a little bit of a pause on. we've talked about additional output on our existing lines. so there are lines that still we have the opportunity to convert to gain additional output and improve our cost position, as well as continuing to develop technologies to allow us to improve the overall yields on the lines that we're running. so, there'll be more focus on that in the back half of the year.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and these would be things that i guess could maybe benefit next year, or could you see some benefits in the back half of '20?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
and we'll see some of those benefits this year, but more of it will be next year.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. okay. and then on the lines that you are going to be rolling out here over the next few quarters, how quickly can these lines gets fully ramped. is there any learning curve there or is it fairly seamless? it seems like some of the other ones that you've rolled out to date have been pretty quick to get up and rolling.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah, it takes a number of weeks to shake out to new equipment. none of this is unknown technology to the trex company. all of our plant teams are aware of how to run this equipment. they will be trained on it, so that we ensure they're ready to go on day one. so we have a high level of confidence that they'll be able to get that up and running quickly after a quick shakeout period.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. and so, in the guidance and i know seasonality can play a role depending on when these kind of come out and they get through that few [phonetic] week process there, but is it your assumption that you'll be pretty well running these out -- full out as well post the expansions. once they are fully up and running, will you be running them at full capacity as well?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i would expect so.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay. and then lastly for me is on new products. you mentioned you rolled out a few at the builders' show. one you mentioned cladding specifically and then some other products, but what's the reception been there for some of those? and on the cladding piece, is that using existing lines or is that something else that you invest or have invested in for new lines there?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah. the cladding opportunity is an opportunity to be used in existing product on a -- for an exciting application. so it's run on the same assets. it's used out of the same inventories that our distributors carry today. it's a new code-listed application for a look that is becoming very popular and a lot of commercial entities, but we're also starting to see a small amount on the residential side as well.
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
and there is a fair amount of excitement over. clearly, it's being received well based on what we've seen. we actually have seen cladding being used probably as far back as five or six years ago, but it really has been taking on a new market, i think all of the composite manufacturers have seen the benefit and are trying to drive their piece of the sales on it. so we're pretty excited of the fact that we've got it out there and got the code listing on.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. well, that's it for me, and thanks for taking my questions and good luck.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, trey.

our next question comes from alex rygiel with b. riley.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr financial company -- analyst
thank you. good evening, gentlemen.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
hi, alex.
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
good evening, alex.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr financial company -- analyst
two quick questions. can you explain the more favorable payment terms that you're expecting in 2q and 3q? and then any thoughts or comments on inventory out in the channel as you see it today?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yes. so when we look at what our distributor programs are going to be, it's usually late in the third quarter of -- in this case, 2019 deciding what those programs are going to be. it's a mix of dating discounts, rebates, loyalty programs, things like that. and it does shift from time to time. there are certain years where we tend to focus on longer dating. there is outer years where it has increased discounts. this year, when we talked with our distributors, we felt the most prudent program included additional dating to ensure that material was in the channel as early as possible to service the peak months when they arrive.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr financial company -- analyst
is in your comment on the inventory out in the channel?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
all right. i'm sorry. inventory in the channel, it continues to run at levels we would expect for this time of year. first quarter does tend to be an inventory build time frame. we have seen good weather across a significant portion of the us. so the sell-through has been reasonably high for this time of year, maybe we'll see some snow come through, which will put us back in more of a normalized place for the winter months here, but they continue to build, and we expect to be at reasonable levels as we get through the end of the first quarter.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr financial company -- analyst
thank you, and congratulations to both of you.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer

our next question comes from alex maroccia with berenberg.
alex maroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hey. good evening, guys and congratulations on the new roles. and thanks for taking my questions. can you discuss the dynamics of timing around the completion of the virginia facility versus the capacity that's needed to fulfill early spring orders in 2021 barring any delays?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
yeah. we expect that capacity to start ramping up in early 2021. it is a significant amount of capacity coming on in a brand new building. so there will be more shakeout time. while all of that equipment is familiar to us, it has all-new support equipment. we have to make sure that the building everything is functioning the way it needs to. so that will probably be a little bit slower. it will take a little longer to bring those up. but those will ramp up over the course of the first quarter and a little bit even into the second quarter of next year.
alex maroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
got it. okay. and then secondly earlier, you talked about the legacy lines in virginia and nevada and how you want to upgrade some of those? how material could these initiatives be from a margin standpoint, and where do you think gross margins could be on a run rate, if you take into consideration the normal capacity from the new plant and then, efficiency among these legacy lines?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
i think the best way to look at that is look at what we've done historically. the focus that this management team has on gross margin as well as we move forward and we've talked about leveraging sg&a with our enhance product lines and branding being able to see more leverage at that ebitda than we've seen historically. so we're excited about the opportunities with the additional capacity coming on, but we're not going to get into a long-term run rate guidance on it.
alex maroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay, no worries. thanks a lot guys.
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from seldon clarke with deutsche bank.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey guys. thanks for the question, and congrats on the transition.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
thanks.
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
you talked about revenue growth this year ramping alongside capacity investments. could you just give us a sense of when you think that will start -- revenue will start to outpace capacity growth? i mean when you'll see utilization dropped below 100%.
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
we've got the capacity as we mentioned in the nevada facility coming on during the second quarter. we've talked about seeing that growth come in line with when capacity is available to us. and next year, we've got the capacity coming on during the -- mostly during the first and early of the second quarter 2021. we will be able to build more inventory once we get all of capacity in line. i would expect we'll run that pretty heavily as we build our own inventories back to normal working levels and then, bring that back down later in the year. we can start doing more of our normalized upgrades to other equipment. i talked about some of those projects that we have being able to take a little bit more time to do that.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. so if we think about sort of capital intensity past back half of 2021 or into 2022, what's kind of the more normalized level to think about to sustain that double-digit growth rate?
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
next year will be a less capital-intensive year. but as we go forward and we look at the growth opportunities and the conversion of wood opportunity, there will be additional capital down the road for capacity.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. any sense of how to think about that in terms of sales or...
bryan h. fairbanks -- executive vice president & chief financial officer
not at this time.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. and then, are there just clarification -- are there any start-up costs in 2020 you have baked into that your guidance?
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
absolutely. these lines do require a training of the personnel. it requires a learning curve and a debugging process. as you bring the lines up, that is all baked into that 50% incremental margin.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
did you give any like number there or sense of how to think about just quantify that number?
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
we didn't because we included in the 50% incremental margin. and from that, i think it gives you the ability to do your model based on that margin expansion.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
all right. i appreciate the questions. thanks.

this concludes our question-and-answer session. i would like to turn the conference back over to jim cline for any closing remarks.
james e. cline -- president & chief executive officer
again, i'd like to thank everyone for calling in today. we've got a lot of news out there, a lot of good things happening with the company. one of the things i think that i'd like you to go away with is that we just completed our strategic planning session with the board of directors this past week. it is on a consistent glide path, not surprising. the entire management team is involved in the development of that strategic planning model. so the course that we have set over the last several years continues to be the same course. the timing of the capex spend relative to capacity was the one wrinkle that changed in our planning process. so again, thank you for your interest in trex. we look forward to talking with you further about trex at our next earnings call. thank you and goodbye.

operator
good afternoon, and welcome to the trex company first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] after today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [operator instructions] please note this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to viktoriia nakhla. please go ahead.
viktoriia nakhla -- investor relations

with that introduction, i will turn the call over to jim cline.
james e. cline -- chairman
thank you, bill, and thank you all for joining us this afternoon to discuss our first quarter results and to review our business outlook. these are certainly unprecedented times. i am pleased that trex was able to report an outstanding first quarter and that our facilities have remained operational during this crisis. our employees and leadership teams have done an excellent job in deploying our business continuity plans quickly and efficiently.
part of strong business planning is a focus on succession, and even with the crisis at hand, i'm extremely confident in the current transition that we have under way with bryan stepping into his new role as president and chief executive officer. bryan will review the first quarter results and provide additional color on our strategy, operational results and outlook in a few minutes.
i would like to focus my remarks on what i think matters most in times of uncertainty and that is leadership. trex is unique in that we offer leadership strengths in many important areas, namely people, the trex brand, low-cost manufacturing and innovation. these leadership strengths will enable trex to not only weather this period of economic uncertainty, but to emerge from it as even stronger market leader. trex is clearly the brand leader and in the growing composite decking arena, with market -- with leading market share in the industry and strategies to accelerate conversion of the large wood market.
further supporting this brand leadership, trex recently swept the annual awards from builder magazine brand use study, receiving the most votes for brand familiarity, brand used most in the last two years, brand used most and highest in overall quality. in addition, trex was awarded greenest decking by green builders media readers' choice awards. these awards reinforce the reputation for product performance, ease of installation, sustainability and best-in-class channel relationships.
from a low-cost manufacturing perspective, we saw significant year-over-year improvements and the start of the process to remove the material from enhance to hit our original design intent. tying this all together are the people at trex and our leaders, most of whom have worked together for the past 10 years and are responsible for making trex the resilient company it is today. it has been a privilege to lead this talented group of people, and i look forward to continuing to work with the trex team in my new role as chairman.
and i am proud to turn this call over and the ceo role to bryan fairbanks. bryan?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jim. before i begin my remarks in the quarter, i'd like to follow up on jim's comments by commending the trex team for their tremendous dedication and recognizing the excellent job that our employees have done in deploying our business continuity plans quickly and efficiently. we are being prudent in taking actions beyond cdc recommendations, including physical distancing at all facilities, deployment of temperature scanners, remote working and many other precautions.
not only have we focused on the safety of our people, we've also looked for ways we can help in our communities. our r&d team produced face shields for medical use to help our local hospital, and we made monetary donations to local and national charities. i'm proud of the way our entire organization has responded and how quickly they have adapted to the changes in the way we need to operate today.
while the last 60 days have brought unprecedented change to the business landscape, trex continues to focus on our strategic initiatives, including providing leading products for the outdoor living market, furthering our cost leadership by engineering our enhanced products back to original design parameters, building capacity to support market demand and continuing our efforts to convert the large wood market to trex composite products.
first quarter results were strong. key highlights included a 12% increase in consolidated revenue, led by a 13% sales growth in trex residential products. we also expanded consolidated ebitda margin by 570 basis points to 29.4% and deployed $23 million in capital, primarily related to our expansion, in line with our expectations.
the first quarter results reflected broad-based demand across all product lines and channels. traffic to trex.com and decks.com indicates that the consumer is engaged with our brand and with deck planning, design and purchase decisions even during these challenging times. compared to the prior year, site visits were up over 15% during the quarter. these growth numbers indicate that the conversion from wood continues to accelerate, thanks in part to the launch of enhance basics and naturals decking, which has significantly expanded the size of our addressable market and the popularity of transcend, which continues to take market share.
while our revenue growth was strong, our gross margin performance demonstrated our operational excellence, advancing by 620 basis points to 44.8%. this exceptional improvement resulted from production efficiencies, the absence of enhanced start-up costs and the early stage benefits of removing material from our enhanced profile to achieve the original design intent. we estimate that enhance will return to its original design before the end of this year's third quarter.
however, as we continue to expand our capacity, we will experience headwinds from additional labor and costs with associated start-up of the new capacity, along with unplanned incremental costs related to covid-19. we expect to offset much of these costs through additional operational improvements.
with respect to trex commercial products, revenues were similar to last year, and ebitda margin increased to 15.1% from 3.7% last year, reflecting roll-off of prior year lower-margin projects, improvements in overall execution and favorable project mix. production efficiencies, stable raw material costs and spending controls drove strong operating leverage in the first quarter, resulting in 39% consolidated ebitda growth and a 35% increase in diluted earnings per share.
now i would like to discuss how we are working through the covid-19 crisis and our business outlook. our facilities have remained fully operational through the crisis, and we have been able to continue production in a safe and effective manner to meet demand for trex products. we are confident in our sourcing strategy and are well positioned to meet customer demand with no sourcing issues and ample safety stocks of raw material inventories, which we believe will protect us against any potential short-term supply chain disruptions.
our sales teams are maintaining close contact with our distributors, dealers and retailers to understand the impact of the crisis on their business and gauge the status of market demand in different geographies so that we can support them most effectively. my discussions with many of our channel partners and the trex sales team confirm that we are doing all of the right things to support them. we are mindful of the impact this pandemic has on our own team and business partners. i am proud of the way our teams have remained focused and supportive our partners' needs as we collectively work to navigate the current environment.
while our production and sales volumes for april were in line with our internal plans, we have experienced lower demand in certain geographies. specifically, we're seeing the greatest impact in new jersey, new york and pennsylvania tri-state areas as well as michigan and washington. we entered this period with -- of uncertainty with a growing demand for composites in most geographies and a customer base that's increasingly more educated on the benefits of composites.
as a reminder, over 90% of our demand comes from the remodeling sector rather than newbuild. and public data shows that less than 10% of deck replacements and additions are funded by refinancing or home equity loans. and in fact, fewer than 10% of the contractors on our website offer financing, which speaks to the resilience of our market sector in times when credit may tighten.
we are pleased with the results we have seen in april, and unless current conditions substantially change, we are projecting second quarter sales of $180 million to $190 million. given the uncertainty of closures and their duration and the further impact of covid-19 economic pressures, we are temporarily suspending all previously provided full year guidance.
despite this uncertainty, we continue to experience strong traffic on trex.com and decks.com. we believe that stay-at-home consumers are prioritizing home improvement projects, especially those that will add lasting value, enhance enjoyment and minimize maintenance. we see this as a positive trend for our business as our product lines, especially trex enhance, meets the needs of our more cost-conscious diy consumers.
additionally, trex has entered this crisis in an extremely strong financial position. this is the result of our conservative financial management practices as we generally only carry short-term seasonal debt. our balance sheet remains very healthy with ample liquidity, including $221 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and healthy annual operating cash flows, which together, provides more than enough funds to execute our strategy and continue our capital investments.
during the quarter, we repurchased 442,000 shares for $39 million as part of the share buyback program approved by the board of directors. due to economic uncertainty and market volatility, we have temporarily halted our repurchase program. when the economy recovers, we expect to see significant increases in home improvement spending, specifically in the outdoor living category.
in addition to our flagship products of transcend and select decking and railing, the enhance product line considerably expands our ability to drive further market share gains from wood in the coming years. this confidence in future growth is reflected in our decision to proceed with our capital expansion program to support robust consumer demand for our products that we anticipate and will continue as economic conditions improve.
as previously announced, the ramp-up of three additional lines to the nevada facility and an additional line in virginia will be completed by the end of the second quarter of this year. meanwhile, the construction of the building for a new virginia facility is well under way and on schedule.
before closing, i want to thank jim cline for his dedication to building the trex company and delivering a strong team that will continue to drive growth and shareholder value. working under jim's leadership has been a rewarding experience for us all, and i look forward to continuing our teamwork as he assumes the role of chairman of the board. jim led the trex team to gains in revenue, ebitda, market capitalization, all well ahead of market indices.
as impressive as this performance has been, there remains significant opportunities ahead of us. trex is in the early innings of the wood conversion opportunity, with approximately 80% of the decking market available for conversion to composites. our expanded capacity will empower trex to aggressively gain share within the industry. we have built strong operations, engineering and r&d teams, which continue to drive product innovation, throughput increases and cost saving opportunities for years to come.
finally, we have a strong leadership team with many years of experience and with the proven skill to drive customer satisfaction and shareholder value. also, i'm pleased to announce the newest member of the trex team, dennis schemm. dennis was appointed vice president and chief financial officer of the trex company. his extensive industry knowledge, financial experience and collaborative style make him an excellent business and cultural fit for trex. i look forward to working closely with him and together with our leadership team in executing on our strategic growth plans.
in summary, though we face a difficult economic environment, know that as a leader in a growing market, we are confident that trex is strongly positioned to effectively navigate tough times, thanks to our people, channel partners, brand leadership, low-cost manufacturing and strong financials. the entire trex team hopes that you and your family stay safe.
operator, i'd like to now open the call for questions.

operator
we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and our first question comes from john baugh of stifel. please go ahead.
john baugh -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
good afternoon. congratulations on a great first quarter, and welcome, dennis to the team. a few things. first quarter, i believe the gross margin of 44.8% matches from two years ago first quarter, and yet you've got the enhance board still has more material, i think, than you want and of course, the enhance product has a lower margin, i assume, and it's a meaningful part of the mix. so i'm curious, what in those two-year time frame has enabled to readjust to those factors, gross margins to go up?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. if you look at over that couple of year time frame, we have continued to see benefit in our raw material sourcing with recycled polyethylene, also other operational improvements. we've talked about our cost projects over the years. also, a lot of work has been done over the past two years. during the first quarter of this year, we did start to see material rolling out primarily from our virginia facility with the lighter weight design, so we saw a little bit of benefit from that. we will see more of that through the second quarter and then be fully implemented as we get through the third quarter of this year.
john baugh -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
got it. and could you tell us kind of what you're seeing in your typical two-step versus, say, the diy -- more oriented diy home center business in april -- march and april, maybe?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i've been trying to stay as close to that as possible, talking with our sales team on a regular basis as well as folks within the pro channel. regularly been hearing, there was about a two-week slowdown where the phones were ringing a little bit less. but the phones are really starting to ring now, and those contractors are starting to build their backlog through the summer months again. so there's not really the panic that they potentially thought there was going to be looking back 30 days.
people are still actively engaged in shopping for trex products, whether they're doing it from a diy perspective or whether they're working with a contractor. and we're excited about that, even though there are challenges out in the marketplace.
john baugh -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
and finally, my last question and i'll defer. in the states that were essentially closed to construction that you mentioned, is there a way to delineate the business sort of ex those states?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we haven't provided any geographic guidance on it. all of those states are significant states for the growth of the trex company. all of those states are in various process of reopening. at this point, michigan has reopened their lumber distributors as well as dealers. washington is slowly reopening. there are parts of new jersey and pennsylvania, mostly in the further northeast side that still may be closed at this point. but i kind of look at our overall volume from a population perspective, where you have the largest population centers in the suburbs, you tend to find the largest sales.
john baugh -- stifel, nicolaus & company -- analyst
great. thanks. good luck.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, john. i appreciate it.

our next question comes from ryan merkel of william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
hey, guys. let me also say congrats on a nice quarter. so first off, 2q sales down 10% is a little bit better than i was thinking. can you just share with us some of the assumptions that you're making? it sounds like you had positive growth in april. so i'm wondering how much do you think sales will decline in may and june? and then are you assuming any recovery in the states with harsher restrictions in the guide?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, ryan, for the comments. we are seeing primarily weakness in those states that i already talked about. we do expect that, that will come back again and there will be some pent-up demand within those marketplaces. given that we're only 60 days in and there are still a lot of uncertainty of what's going to happen in these hardest hit marketplaces, we've not been too aggressive on assuming large backlogs in those marketplaces. but what we're hearing has been positive thus far, and all of those considerations are baked into the guidance that we provided at this point.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
yeah, that's what i thought you'd say. i figured you'd stay pretty conservative, which makes sense. second question, i know you won't give numbers, but have you seen any big differences in sell-through for transcend versus enhance starting in late march? and what i'm getting at is, are you seeing the high end hold up better? or is there any trade down with softer consumer demand?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
it's very early still. we are still seeing a very balanced portfolio across all of our product lines. and the first quarter came in line with our expectations, the month of april was also in line with our expectations, and the orders that we have at this point for may continue along that line. so we are not seeing a significant demand shift. we may see more of that as we go through it later in the summer. but right now, everything is in line with what we expected going into the year.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
got it, ok. just lastly on raws. have you seen recycled plastic prices decline recently? and could this be a tailwind later this year?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we've seen stability in that marketplace. those materials do sell at a pretty low price at this point, so you don't see the same benefit flow through on recycled material that you might in the virgin marketplace. we do use a little bit of virgin in some of our products so we will see a benefit on that part of it. but we have not really seen much of a shift on the recycled materials we're buying. we may get a little bit more later in the year on that. we'll talk about that as we see what happens in the marketplace.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
all right. thanks, bryan. i'll pass it on.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.

our next question comes from tim wojs of baird. please go ahead.
tim wojs -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. and nice job on q1.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, tim. welcome.
tim wojs -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
thank you. thank you. maybe just on margins. just want to kind of understand the comments. so you should see some benefits on a year-over-year basis from enhance, from the enhance material improving as well as some start-up costs, but it does sound like there'll be some absorption and some labor and things. so should we think of gross margins being kind of flattish relative to last year as you kind of look over the next three quarters? or how would you kind of frame that for us?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yes. let me -- i'll step back to the comments we made in the last call, where we said that we would see there'd be some front-loading of the incremental margin improvement because we would start to see more of those costs flow into our nevada plant in the second quarter as we're bringing on employees and add additional cost in the back half of the year as we start ramping employees for our virginia facility. neither of those things have changed at this point. we have withdrawn that guidance on a full year basis as we wait to see what happens when the market settles out over the coming months.
tim wojs -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
okay, ok. thanks. and then how would you think about sg&a in terms of managing that relative to your prior expectations? do you think there's more leverage opportunity there if shares are a little more volatile? or do you think you'll continue to invest at the same speed that you were investing prior?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we'll continue to invest in the branding programs as well as building the personnel to support the growth of the organization. i think looking at it out over the long term is a better way. as we've talked about in the past, our enhance basics product line does not carry the same sg&a load that our higher-end products carry. those higher-end products are going to carry a branding load along with them, which we don't spend for enhance basics. so as we move out into the future, i would expect to see continued operating leverage on the sg&a side of the business, driving the overall profitability of the company.
tim wojs -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
okay. okay. that's what i have good luck on the rest of the year. and thank you.

our next question comes from alex rygiel of b. riley fbr. please go ahead.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thank you. good evening, bryan.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
hi alex.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
two quick questions. first, can you comment on commercial bidding activity and maybe comment on the status of your backlog? i know you don't quantify it, but at least the status of it.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
right now, the status is quite strong. we recently just booked a $4 million project in the office building space. that was booked well after the covid-19 crisis started. that doesn't mean that there won't potentially be weakness in that sector as we move forward. we all know the abi numbers came out at a record low. that tends to impact much farther out sales. so 2021-2022, we'll be keeping a close eye on that to understand if projects are being deferred within the existing backlog and what overall bookings look like. but thus far, we've continued to see a nice level of bookings in line with our expectations.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
and then secondly, how would you gauge inventory on hand and in the channel?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
first quarter weather was pretty darn good. so most of the channel was selling product that they were bringing in that if you had bad weather, they're just building inventories for the second quarter. so inventories are in good shape to be able to support the season, but they're far from overstocked. i think if we would have seen a bad weather first quarter across most of the country, my answer to this question probably would be very different right now. but sell-through has remained strong for the first three months of the year.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thank you. great quarter. and jim, enjoy your new role.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, alex.
james e. cline -- chairman
thank you. i appreciate it.
operator
our next question comes from phil ng of jefferies. please go ahead.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, guys. any way to kind of parse out how we should think about demand for 2q? you gave us some color down 10% as the midpoint. how much of that sell-through demand versus destocking? any issues on the channel partner front being able to supply product?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
i'm not hearing anybody use the word destocking in the channel. we are going into what is the busiest time, the second and third quarter of the year for composite decking. so will there be some economic challenges during that time period? absolutely. but we're going into what's normally a strong period anyways. so the distributors are ensuring that they have appropriate inventories to be able to support the market.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. so whatever the guidance for 2q at least seems like a pretty good read for sell-through demand? because it -- i mean, it sounds like your channel partners, some of them may have some issues, but it doesn't sound like it's too material.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
well, remember, we tend to build inventories in the channel going into the end of the first quarter. and then those channel inventories will tend to decline through the end of the third quarter. so i expect the sell-through, that there will be lower channel inventories coming out of the second quarter and there will be higher sell-through than what we have. and that's always going to be a timing difference that you have with trex, given the seasonal nature of the business and the fact that we need to get inventory out to the market before the season starts.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and given some of those states you called out, they're big states, and hopefully, we ramp back up in terms of being able to be proactive outdoors and whatnot, do you kind of view 2q as a trough quarter for you from a sales standpoint?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we withdrew guidance because we just don't have the visibility in the market to be able to answer that question.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
that's fair enough. and then i guess lastly for me. how much flexibility do you have to kind of scale back some of the capacity you're ramping up? i know initially, the target was 70% expansion. the greenfield piece is what i'm trying to get a better pulse on in terms of how much of that can you throttle back. and what kind of incremental margins would you be able to sustain at whatever operating rates, in that 40 -- i guess if you sustain that mid-45% incremental margin, what kind of op rates would you need to keep it at those levels?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so the building is well under way and we will be putting equipment in that building. we do have the ability to pull back on some of that investment later in the year for additional lines if we see that they aren't necessarily needed at this time. i think when you look at incremental margin and even probably more importantly going forward, with the impact of enhance basics and naturals is going to be ebitda margin. so focused on the gross margin as well as the leverage that we have with sg&a as we continue to grow the organization.
and looking historically, this is a management team that is focused on margin, whether it's ebitda margin or gross margin, we don't have an intent to start dropping things backward, but we also know that we will need that additional capacity to be able to support the market demand that's out there. times like this can be opportunities for organizations that have the capital to be able to set themselves up coming out the other end to even be more successful.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. thanks a lot. i appreciate the color.

keith hughes -- suntrust -- analyst
question on production rates. second quarter production rates, how are they going to compare to the second quarter last year?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we will be continuing to run all of our lines, so it's similar to last year. we have a little bit more capacity in place at this point. really, the biggest difference is our throughput will be up because we are not facing the same start-up difficulties. the first quarter was clearly the most difficult quarter last year for start-up. we lost a lot of throughput in both of our plants. second quarter, it was much less of an impact but there was still an impact. we will get all of that back and more with throughput this year.
keith hughes -- suntrust -- analyst

our next question comes from kurt yinger of d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah. good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
hi, kurt.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, i just wanted to circle back to winchester. and could you just talk about the thought process there pushing ahead? i mean, it seems like from a longer-term perspective, the opportunity costs have been cut short on capacity outweighs that risk of having [indecipherable] capacity over the near term. but any color there about how you're thinking about that would be helpful.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
well, you hit it spot on. there's definitely the opportunity to continue moving forward with that capacity. we know that demand will be there as we continue to grow the company. the strategy of going after wood, converting more of that market has been successful. it started before the launch of enhance, but it really took off with that strategy of allowing there to be more price points to be attractive to a larger portion of the overall buying public. we have the ability to get the construction labor out there at this point and things continue to move on. so we strongly believe that building that capacity so that we are prepared to serve all of our customer needs as we come out the other side is much more important than pulling back in the short term to save a few dollars of capital right now.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
right, right. okay, that makes sense. and just quickly, on the branding and advertising piece within sg&a, could you maybe just provide some color about how you were thinking about that coming into the year from kind of a growth in dollars or percentage terms and then maybe how you might be reconsidering that spend?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so branding during the first quarter, we pulled back on some of our spend because we saw such good weather across most of the country in that people were continuing to buy decks. when we look at our branding, we want to be in front of the consumer when they're making the majority of those buying decisions. that tends to be a little bit later in the year. so we pulled back on some of that in the early part of the year. but we are still well prepared to execute that branding spend this year to ensure that consumers are engaged with trex.com.
i think it's also important to note that the decks.com investment is really paying many dividends with the company here. it is a great on ramp for those consumers that are starting in the marketplace to upgrade their decking. they're able to get the information about how do they build the deck, what does the builder material look like. but also as they're doing that, they're receiving hints that there are products out there that are affordable, both with the basics product and then products with a little higher-level aesthetics that will meet the needs they have and still be very affordable. we are seeing very strong traffic across both of those sites, and we'll continue to support our branding to drive people there as well as engage with consumers where they're making the buying decision.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. appreciate the color, bryan. i'll turn it over.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.

our next question comes from alex maroccia of berenberg. please go ahead.
alex maroccia -- berenberg -- analyst
hey, good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. do you have any visibility into consumer behaviors at the end of march and april? and then people have started accelerating their spending on outdoor projects, given the stay-in-place orders in many states?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we have some visibility through the month of april because we do track sell-through at our various channel partners. we do not have really a whole lot of that data moving into may or what those expectations are. now we do have enough based on what our channel partners have shared with us that we're able to provide the guidance that we did for the second quarter. but really, what that longer-term expectation the consumer has is really too easy to say. and that's really more of a third quarter call than it is the second quarter.
alex maroccia -- berenberg -- analyst
okay. that all makes sense. and then my second question is focused on the inventory. what kind of flexibility do you have to bleed down the existing inventories since they ended the quarter a bit higher than last year? and that's what the understanding that the end of march was probably a bit slower than what you expected.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
i'd like to actually see a little bit more inventory on the ground, especially in our decking products. we tend to come out of the first quarter with a much higher railing inventory because second and third quarter tend to be much higher demand for that, so there's more safety stock there. but i would like to build some more decking inventory to support the marketplace. so right now, i have no concerns with where our inventories are.
alex maroccia -- berenberg -- analyst
all right. that's great. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from reuben garner of the benchmark company. please go ahead.
reuben garner -- the benchmark company -- analyst
thanks. good evening, everybody. congrats again to jim, bryan and dennis, you too. nice to see a familiar face or name. most of my questions have been answered. the one i wanted to follow up on is the comments you made about the over 90% of your business is remodeling and less than 10% are funded by refi or heloc. i thought that was very interesting.
do you have any more statistics on what percentage of decks are either diy, what percentage of your decks are just -- or what percentage of your business is just a rephase of a deck rather than having to build a new structure off the house? just getting at how much of your business can the consumer actually just go to home depot or lowe's pick up deck boards and do themselves versus needing labor at their house?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so that's one of the real advantages with our channel partners is that we have over 6,700 locations where the consumer can get our product, and they can shop at whatever type of retail outlet that they're most interested in shopping at. when we look at the split of diy versus contractor, trex historically has been about 60% contractor installed, 40% diy. with the launch of enhance, we expect to see that shift probably more to a 50-50 type level.
if you look at the wood marketplace, it's the opposite from trex. approximately 60% is diy and 40% is contractor. so over time, i expect that we'll see more of a convergence to a 50-50. and we're seeing some of that right now, with people being very interested in home improvement projects that they can do while they're at home. i expect in the short term, some of that diy and they're shopping throughout our entire channel, that that percentage is changing. and longer term, i expect we'll see that converge.
reuben garner -- the benchmark company -- analyst
very helpful, bryan. and just a quick follow-up on that. so the portion of your business that's just rephrasing a deck versus the whole structure, any idea there, just given that you hear folks calling out the cost of doing a deck? it's obviously a lot cheaper if you're just resurfacing it than if you're having to build a whole new structure. do you have any stats there?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. for a diy customer, clearly, resurfacing is going to be much easier. you need a much higher level of technical skill to be able to build the substructure, potentially sync post, deal with all of the code listings that need to be done. so it's much easier to do a resurfacing, where -- when you have a full deck contractor. i don't have any great numbers out there that are able to provide more insight on that.
reuben garner -- the benchmark company -- analyst
that's all right. thanks guys, and congrats on the quarter and good luck navigating through all those.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, reuben. appreciate it.

[operator instructions] and our next question will come from seldon clarke of deutsche bank. please go ahead.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, good afternoon and thanks for the question. how should we think about the moving pieces as it relates to decremental margins in the second quarter, just kind of given the speed and uniqueness of the slowdown alongside the ramp in some of these capacity investments that you're making?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we haven't provided the margin guidance for the rest of the year, but we will be continuing to run our assets at 100% along the way. so i don't really see there being any decrement because we are taking capacity down at this point. as i mentioned earlier, we will start bringing labor in early ahead of time, so that we can ramp up those lines out in nevada.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. were there any of those start-up costs as it relates to sg&a that were supposed to happen in the first quarter, delayed in the second quarter, anything along those lines?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
there were some personnel costs, mostly out in our nevada facility as we were bringing them on, but it was minimal in the first quarter.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, got it. and just a longer-term question. if you do decide to forego some of these capacity investments that you have planned for later in the year, how quickly can you sort of ramp those back up if demand starts to pick up a little bit faster than you would have expected in 2021 or later this year?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
well, that's always the key question. once you stop with something, how long does it take to get those contractors reengaged again and moving things forward? that's why part of the reason we're continuing to move forward with that capacity, we want to be sure that we can service all of the market demand out there. might that mean there's a couple lines that we decide to back off on at some point? sure, it's possible. but we'll still be moving forward with the building as well as lines in those buildings so we can support market demand.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
all right. appreciate the time. thanks, guys.

bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bill, and good evening. thank you all for joining us on today's call to review trex company fourth quarter full year 2020 results and discuss our business outlook. i want to start by thanking the entire trex organization and our extended family of retailers, dealers, contractors and distributors who enabled our company to distinguish itself during one of the most difficult periods in recent history. their dedication and collaboration were essential to our ability to remain operational throughout 2020 and overcome many covid-related challenges and to report record results ending the year with exceptional fourth quarter sales growth.
demand for trex products continues to benefit from strong secular trends including growth in the outdoor living category, renewed focused on the home, the shift in population from urban to suburban and smaller metropolitan areas and consumers increasing preference for environmentally sustainable products. as the recognized leader and product performance aesthetics, quality, and the use of 95% recycled content, trex experienced robust demand achieving broad based growth across all of our residential product lines. nowhere was that demand more apparent than in our usually slower fourth quarter. sales of trex residential products increased 40% year-on-year. as you will recall from the past our fourth quarter growth tends to be lower as it's generally more of an inventory infill part of the season.
as our new capacity is completed and inventories get back to standard levels, our seasonality is expected to normalize where we tend to see higher growth in the second and third quarters. the fourth quarter performance was driven by continued success of our premium select and transcend decking and railings and strong sell through of our enhanced product line that has a specific focus on the more cost conscious consumer who may otherwise choose wood. as anticipated, we experienced increased costs in the fourth quarter related to our capacity expansion program and covid-related costs. despite these costs we reported significant double-digit growth across all key profitability metrics.
trex commercial performed in line with our expectations in the fourth quarter hosting improved revenue as we continue to provide innovative solutions in the commercial railing space. our full year and fourth quarter residential products sales growth are clear indicators we continue to benefit from our long term strategy to convert consumers from wood decking to our eco-friendly trex decking. the trend is not only continuing but accelerating. we estimate that composites gained approximately 200 basis points of share from the traditional wood market in 2020 and we are looking ahead to similar, if not faster conversion rates in future years. trex's tremendous brand equity of leading product lines and unparalleled network of distribution, dealer, retail sales channel, and contractors furthers our confidence in our ability to continue to lead the conversion opportunity.
importantly, the conversion from wood is still in the early stages, providing us with a significant runway. with the gains in 2020, it's estimated that composite products have approximately 22% share of the decking market in linear foot volume terms leaving significant conversion opportunity. to support that demand, our capacity expansion investment program continues on schedule. the timing of this new capacity furthers our industry leadership position allowing trex to capture additional growth. dennis will provide detail on the cadence of the production ramp up scheduled for our virginia facility this year. 2020 was another record year for trex and one in which we were able to convert 18% sales growth into an increase of 28% in adjusted ebitda and 26% in adjusted eps showing the continued leverage opportunity in our business model.
we see this as especially strong performance given that we absorb start-up costs associated with our capacity expansion program as well as covid-19 management costs. given the experience we've gained in managing operations during the covid pandemic, we expect 2021 covid costs to be less, but will still cause certain production inefficiencies and higher costs as we prioritize the health and safety of our employees. we are guiding to full-year incremental ebitda margin of 35% to 40% on strong double-digit sales growth. during the october call, we announced that we would be taking a mid-single-digit price increase effective with january orders on certain product lines.
as expected at that time, we have seen inflationary pressures, but the actual to-date and forward projected impact are within our prior projections. as this year progresses and our capacity increases, we will be reinvigorating our international sales initiatives in key markets where sales of trex products historically have outpaced our domestic sales growth. additionally, innovation continues to be a key part of our strategy. and you can expect to see more product development and launches from the trex team moving forward. trex company has long been known as a great place to work. and we recently received recognitions by two widely respected publications, fortune magazine and forbes naming us among the fastest growing companies worldwide and the best mid-sized company in the u.s., respectively.
also we are appreciative of the industry recognitions that we receive regularly, which honor our organization for the appeal and quality of trex products, our ongoing commitment to sustainability and our reputation within the industry. as proud as i am of our outstanding accomplishments in 2020, i'm equally proud of the work we are doing to deliver consistent and sustainable financial performance for the future. as an example, our initiative to accelerate conversion from wood decking to sustainable trex decking will result in more plastic being diverted from landfills and allow us to employ more people, which will in turn benefit the communities in which we operate.
the company was founded almost 30 years ago on the premise that we can extract value from what was once seen as waste. and today, we are not only one of the largest recyclers of polyethylene in north america but also a proof-of-concept for building a successful business model based on recycled and reclaimed materials. sustainability has been in our dna since the beginning and our recognized environmental impact together with our initiatives around fairness in the workplace and corporate responsibility are aimed at leading the highest esg standards.
now, i will turn the call over to dennis schemm, our chief financial officer for a financial review of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, and officially congratulate him on his promotion to senior vice president. dennis?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, bryan, and good afternoon. i am pleased to review our record fourth quarter and full year financial performance, the progress of our capacity expansion program and our expectations for 2021. fourth quarter consolidated net sales increased 39% to $228 million, led by 40% growth in trex residential products. this robust top line growth reflects sustained broad-based demand across all of our product lines in what is usually a seasonally slower quarter. trex commercial products had a positive showing this quarter, with sales increasing 20% year-on-year to $15 million. consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter was 40.5% compared to 43.2% in the year-ago quarter.
trex residential products gross margin was 41.3% compared to 44.6% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the hiring, training and initial start-up costs at trex residential in advance of our capacity ramp up at the virginia facility, along with cost of managing our business to respond to covid-19 pandemic that amounted to approximately $2 million this quarter. we also saw higher inflation and logistics costs associated with our raw materials as we noted during our third quarter conference call. gross margin at trex commercial expanded 170 basis points to 28% due to our execution of higher margin projects this quarter, as well as our continued focus on operational improvements. sg&a expenses increased $9 million to $34 million primarily due to the timing of incentive compensation.
on a percentage of sales basis sg&a decreased 20 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year quarter. our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 25.8%. net income was $43 million or $0.37 per diluted share, up 22% and 19% respectively from the $35 million or $0.31 per diluted share reported in the fourth quarter of 2019 adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split distributed on september 14. ebitda increased 28% to $64 million and ebitda margin was 27.9%. for the full-year 2020, consolidated net sales were up 18% to $881 million. trex residential net sales increased 19% to $828 million. net income was $176 million or $1.51 per diluted share, up 21% and 22% respectively from $145 million or $1.24 per diluted share adjusted for the 2-for-1 stock split in 2020. ebitda up was up 24% to $250 million while ebitda margin was 28.6%.
in the third quarter, we recognized a one-time $6.5 million charge to the trex residential warranty reserve related to legacy surface flaking issue that affected a portion of the products manufactured at our nevada plant prior to 2007. excluding the warranty charge, net income was $180 million or a $1.55 per diluted share, up 25% and 26% respectively. ebitda increased 28% to $258 million and ebitda margin was 29.3%. we generated record cash from operations of $187 million in 2020 allowing us to self-finance our capital expenditures of $173 million. the majority of our capex spend was related to our expansion program. as recently announced production in our new virginia facility started in january of 2021 and we will continue to add lines throughout the first half of 2021.
in addition to our new virginia plant we also added lines to our nevada plant during 2020. when our capacity expansion is completed by the end of june this year, these investments together will increase production capacity by approximately 70% when compared to 2019 volume levels. looking ahead, we are pleased to provide guidance for our full year 2021 performance that points to another year of strong double-digit growth for trex. we expect first quarter consolidated net sales to range from $235 million to $245 million representing year-on-year growth of 20% at the midpoint.
we expect growth to expand in the second quarter as our capacity and capabilities increase and in the third quarter as we backfill channel inventory. for the full year 2021, we anticipate incremental ebitda margin to be between 35% to 40% inclusive of start-up related expenses, which will continue as we ramp up production at our virginia facility, higher inflation, and more normalized sg&a spending partially offset by cost saving projects. our tax rate is anticipated at approximately 25%. depreciation will range from $35 million to $40 million increasing throughout the year and we expect full year spending on capex to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million.
now, i will turn the call back to bryan for his closing remarks.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dennis. we expect to demonstrate strong financial and operational performance in 2021 underpinned by growth in the outdoor living category and demand for our trex products. we continue to be encouraged by key demand indicators from our contractors, dealers, distributors, and the consumers interacting with our websites and those features. with the conversion opportunity ahead we continue to be confident in our business strategy for growth.
operator, i'd now like to open the call for questions.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from stanley elliott with stifel. please go ahead.
stanley elliott -- stifel nicolaus and company -- analyst
hey, bryan. hey, dennis. thank you guys for taking the question. hey, quick questions we're thinking about this year and how it might unfold. you talk about 3q kind of backfilling some of the channel inventory, with the expectation to that point still be that the inventory is a little bit light within the chain on terms of product just given how strong demand is shaping up to be over the course of the year?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
that's our expectation presently. i expect that we will be able to build some channel inventories as we move through q1 and q2. but normally channel inventories do decline in q2 and then they start building up through the back half of the year to a much higher level by the end of the year. so i do expect that there will be channel fill occurring in the third quarter.
stanley elliott -- stifel nicolaus and company -- analyst
okay. thanks.
operator
the next question is from ryan merkel with william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey everyone. so my question was on incremental ebitda margin guidance of 35% to 40%. should we think of this level as normal or does it include some extra costs that get absorbed as the virginia facility ramps such that in 2022 it might be a little bit higher?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think that this would be considered normal for this year 35% to 40% because what we're dealing with in the first half of the year specifically are twofold. we have covid costs that are in play right now that we did not have in q1. so that will be bringing down margins in the first quarter. plus we also have start-up costs throughout the first half of this year that will be much heavier as we continue to add people in advance of the lines coming on. so i think those are the two major influencers that we're seeing on the incremental guidance of 35% to 40%. the final one will be sg&a, and sg&a i'd characterize this as a return to more normal spending because sg&a was depressed last year because of covid, right? we pulled back on our branding expenses and then in later on in the year we had to pull back on travel and we pulled back on medical and so in q2 those costs will be coming back throughout the full year. we're going to be experiencing that headwind as those sg&a costs come back in.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
without those couple of items you would see that incrementally being higher than where it is at this point. but i think it's a good rough planning estimate.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from nishu sood with ubs. please go ahead.
nishu sood -- ubs equities -- analyst
thanks. so looking at the sales guide for 1q, the $235 million to $245 million; if we take out commercial, it implies around $225 million for residential, call it. that would seem to indicate that capacity will still be an issue in 1q. so i'm just trying to reconcile that with the opening of virginia, which would have seemed to have been a pretty big step change in capacity. is it that the capacity will more come on toward the end of 1q, just trying to reconcile those two?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
consistent with what we've talked about as this capacity comes online, it will increase as we move through the first half of the year. so we announced in january that the first set of lines will come up. we'll have additional lines coming up later in first quarter and that continues to build until that entire building will be up and running by the end of the second quarter. so by definition, there's a lot more capacity available to us as we get out into the second quarter and then even more available during the third quarter as all of that capacity is installed and ready to go.
nishu sood -- ubs equities -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from matthew bouley with barclays. please go ahead.
matthew bouley -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking the question. the comment you made bryan that inflation is -- i think you said it was in line with your initial expectations. is the second round of price increases realistic if inflation moves a little further or does it need to get a fair bit worse from here?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we always take a look at where we stand in the marketplace, how we're doing against inflation along the way. i don't see a need for that. it's within the projections that we have at this point. who knows as we go through later on the year where the economy goes along the way, but those are discussions that we would take very seriously before implementing something further during the course of the busy season.
matthew bouley -- barclays -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
the next question is from keith hughes with truist. please go ahead. mr. hughes, your line is open on our end. it is possibly muted on yours.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
hello. can you hear me now?
operator
yes, we can sir.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. sorry. we're having a connection issue here. going to the incremental ebitda margin you discussed in the release. is that going to build throughout the year as this capacity comes online, and i guess can you give us any sort of feel if that is the case how it would look first half versus second?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
keith, that's -- it's a great point, great question. so that is absolutely our expectation. i think the first quarter will be muted just because the lines are not all up and running yet. and we're dealing with those heavier gross margin pressures of inflation, the covid management costs and the start-up costs. as we move into q2, more capacity comes online, we would expect the ebitda margin to increase. as we're getting more and more leverage into q3, we would expect the same. we would see the full power of our capacity in line. and so that should help with margins as well. so that's how i would think about it. i think your question is spot on.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. just one other quick one too on the d&a of course going up throughout the year as you highlighted. by the time we get to the fourth quarter, will we hit a run rate of what d&a will be going into '22 or that accelerate further with capital you're spending?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
so you bring up another great point. so we're going from $17 million of depreciation in 2020 to a guide of between $35 million and $40 million for 2021. and so, i would expect that depreciation to increase throughout the year, especially as those lines come online in our virginia facility and then we'll have a half year of depreciation relative to the virginia facility. so that will be an incremental headwind coming back into 2022 as well.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. thank you.
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
oh, you're welcome.
operator
the next question is from ketan mamtora with bmo capital. please go ahead.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you. i was just wondering with this huge rally that we've seen in lumber prices, are you seeing any acceleration in share gains from wood? i know your value proposition is not based on just lumber prices, but i'm just curious if this unprecedented run is changing any customer conversations?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we've seen that that run occurred midway through last year. again, we've seen the price of lumber take off at this point and we see people coming in looking for composite products. the higher price, it doesn't hurt us, but it's not the primary thing that we're looking at. we've always said that that conversion opportunity starts at two times the price of wood and we're not going to be adjusting up and down because of temporary swings. it may drop down to $0.65, it may go up to a $1.05 linear foot for wood. we're going to be on average about two times the price to step into our basics product and then of course the move up product enhance naturals at about three times the price of wood, which is the key part of the strategy those two product lines working hand-in-hand. bring them in the door, show them the higher level aesthetics along the way and that improves revenue product.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
the next question is from alex maroccia with berenberg. please go ahead.
alex maroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
hi. good afternoon guys.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
hey alex.
alex maroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. i noticed in the 10-k that you no longer break out the sales materiality per customer and this mainly applies to both the u.s. lumber and lowes. can you just give us a sense of where the retail versus pro channel split sits today and how you expect it to change after capacity fully comes online?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
well, our over 10% customers are similar to what they were last year and this year obviously was a strong year for diy especially in the middle of the year or actually middle to the early part when diy was open and many of the pro-channel locations were not. as we got to later in the year and the entire channel was reopened again that percentage split went back to more normalized where we would expect it to be and that's exactly what we expect for 2021 as well.
alex maroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. thank you.
operator
the next question is from phil ng with jefferies. please go ahead.
philip ng -- jefferies llc -- analyst
hey guys. your capex guidance for 2021 is a bit more elevated than we would have expected. any color on any incremental projects you're embarking on? and then on the sg&a side, dennis, appreciate you're expecting a more normalized year. is there any help that we should think about that is that from a dollar perspective or percentage of sales? just kind of give us some guidepost, that'd be really helpful.
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so from a capacity or a capex perspective, we are going to continue to have capacity capex running through the first-half of this year. in addition to that, we've got a bunch of cost out projects lined up for the second-half of the year. so we're going to be looking at automation type projects. we'll be looking at support system projects to make our capacity even work that much more effective. so, that's some of the spend that you'll be seeing in 2021. when you asked about the sg&a question, i think that's a great, great question to talk about because when i look at sg&a i look at it from two storylines. one is 2021 and one is the longer term. and in 2021, i would characterize this as the return to more normalcy after a year impacted and constrained by covid.
we definitely plan on supporting the brand and returning the brand spend to more normal levels. as you recall during the second quarter, we pulled back on branding significantly at the height of the pandemic. we clearly will be moving forward to support it in 2021. also in 2020, we had savings from travel and medical. already in 2021, we're seeing travel expenses more or less return to normal and we're seeing medical expenses return to more normalcy as well. so that's the 2021 story. for the longer term, the sg&a story is all going to be about operating leverage while we will continue to support our growth judiciously and disciplined manner. as enhanced continues to grow, we'll see leverage on that sg&a line as we don't need to spend on branding for enhanced at the same levels that we do for transcend and select. hope that answers your question.
philip ng -- jefferies llc -- analyst
yeah. that's really helpful. and what kind of return are you expecting until these cost take out projects? it sounds really exciting. i know your history from your previous firm and you guys were really diligent on that. it'd be helpful to get a little color on the return profile?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we've got significant return expectations from the cost projects. we've been away from those projects as our primary focus from our engineers has been on the capacity. but as we work through those capacity and start lining up those cost outs, we'll start to see the benefit in the second half of the year and into next year. but i can assure you that there're significant returns. but we don't provide the actual numbers.
philip ng -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay, great. thank you, guys.
operator
the next question is from kurt yinger with d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. good afternoon, everyone. just a two parter on the outlook. first, kind of a clarifying point when you talk about growth expanding from the first quarter, i assume that's year-over-year growth accelerating, is that right? and then secondly, could you just maybe talk a little bit about what's embedded within that outlook in terms of underlying growth first incremental benefit of backfilling some of that inventory?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
so that would be on a year-over-year basis, the percentage growth that we would be referring to. i guess to a certain extent you can say sequentially as well too. it relates to the infill piece of it. that's a little bit more difficult to answer as the demand in the marketplace continues to be extremely strong. the customers that are coming directly to trex.com and interacting with dex.com, really at unprecedented levels for the month of january and february. so the consumer demand is out there and the question will be when does that inventory start filling in to a meaningful degree? i will be able to provide a little bit better insight on that as we move through the year.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer

operator
the next question is from tim wojs with baird. please go ahead.
timothy ronald wojs -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
hey, guys. nice job. i have two kind of capacity related question. so the first is i think you're six or eight months now up with the new lines and firmly. and so just any sort of kind of update how those are running relative to expectations. and then secondly, just on installation capacity, i mean have you -- as you talk to some of your contractors and the distributors are you hearing deck builders actually add crews, so i'm just trying to understand if there's that kind of a natural limitation how many decks can be put up this year?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yes, you're right on the front lines have been running since june july of last year. those are the first new lines this company brought up since the mid 2000, 2005-2006 timeframe. we are getting our expectations out of those lines at this point and probably what excites me the most about those lines is the learnings on what we need to do for those start-ups so that we could then bring our virginia lines up much more quickly. and we absolutely saw that as we brought up the first sets of lines all of those learnings along the way. and i expect that we'll even get more efficient as we bring up the additional lines beyond that. and could you repeat your second one again?
timothy ronald wojs -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
yeah. yeah. just on -- as you talk to contractors and maybe dealers do you get the sense that -- just decking contractors are adding crews in terms of just the amount of decking capacity that's out there for installation, if that's going to grow in 2021?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, contractors are feeling good about where the marketplaces and their ability to be able to support crews. like everybody else finding good skilled labor is a challenge for contractors. those that are able to find it and have strong business backlogs are adding where possible along the way.
timothy ronald wojs -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
okay. okay great. well, good luck on this year guys. thanks.

alex rygiel -- b. riley securities -- analyst
thank you. nice quarter, gentlemen.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, alex.
alex rygiel -- b. riley securities -- analyst
have you made any inroads in expanding your presence into the new home builder market and more broadly the international markets?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so related to new homes, we do continue to see that as an opportunity. as we bring up that additional capacity, we do have individuals that are focused on working directly with the new home builders. so i think there'll be some news on that probably as we move through later into the year. as it relates to international, i absolutely see that as a ongoing growth opportunity. and again as that capacity becomes available, we can refocus and be able to provide the material at the levels necessary for the growth that these markets demand. over the past couple of years because of our capacity constraints, we've not allowed those markets to grow where they potentially could have. but we absolutely have the plans in place at this point to focus on that. and that will carry out over a number of years.
alex rygiel -- b. riley securities -- analyst

the next question is from reuben garner with benchmark company. please go ahead.
reuben garner -- the benchmark co. llc -- analyst
thank you. good evening, and congrats on the finish to 2020. maybe dennis, any way to kind of or i guess bryan -- either of you obviously can answer this. any way to frame the level of start-up and covid costs that you incurred in 2020 relative to what you're baking into your outlook for 2021? will they be kind of similar, in other words are they offsetting each other because your costs from last year don't recur and you're going have new ones this year that are a similar rate or are they higher or lower? thanks for taking the question.
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so reuben great question on the start up. so we've been experiencing higher start up costs now since q3 of 2020 as we prepare to open up the virginia facility, it was more intense in q4. q1 very, very strong start up expenses going now, especially because not only are we adding people and advances of all the lines coming on, but now we're shaking out those lines, right? and so we're moving from good product to excellent performance and so as you're shaking out those lines, there's some additional costs that are going on there.
we'll expect those costs to continue through q2; probably be largely behind us by the middle of q3. that's when you would expect those start up costs to abet. relative to covid management, in q1 definitely they are headwinds because we did not have covid management expenses in q1 of the prior year and as bryan said though, we're getting better at managing covid now going forward. we have no idea what to expect if we're going to see further spikes or further hiccups here, but we are doing better managing and dealing better with crew management as a result.
reuben garner -- the benchmark co. llc -- analyst
good. thank you guys.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer

the next question is from trey grooms with stephens. please go ahead.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking my questions. good job on the quarter.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
hey trey. thanks.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
so one for me and we've -- you've talked about this in the past, but really trying to get maybe a update here, but as the mix of composite has taken more share from wood and your entry level products have gotten much better as well over time. did you guys see any change to that product mix in '20 given that accelerated kind of share shift and then maybe more entry level versus higher end or vice versa and maybe your expectations around mix as you see the composite share continuing to accelerate?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
i think there's really, there's two parts to that. by introducing enhance basics and naturals basics of course, was all new to the marketplace 2019, so that was the second year that we had it, it grew, and in all new market segments, so by definition that had a larger percentage of growth than some of the other product lines. but when we look at how is the overall portfolio doing? it's in line with exactly what we expected when we launched the product. individuals coming in that are interested in wood and being able to get them to trade up to our enhance naturals product and then more of the pro and the customer looking for those higher end aesthetics, sticking with our select product or moving up to transcend along the way. so the mix has ended up being exactly where we expected it to be in both of those years. we did a lot of research before moving in to the enhanced product line to understand what that consumer behavior would be along the way. so i don't see concerns with it.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yeah. okay. thanks. and one if i could just housekeeping or maybe even a follow-up to one of dennis' responses earlier. and it's clear that 1q is going to be more muted in speaking of ebitda margin, incremental ebitda margins, but you're looking for 35$to 40% for the full year inclusive of a lot of these start-up expenses and things like that. so is it fair for us to consider maybe 4q, it should accelerate as we go through the year, but as you get to the 4q that you could be at the high end or maybe even above the high end of that range for kind of a run rate as we exit '21?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
so, i think you're spot on. i think what you're going to see is a muted incremental ebitda margins in q1 because of the cost pressures. as more capacity comes online you will see ebitda or incremental ebitda margins increase in q2, they'll grow in q3. and yes, i would think that our ebitda margins in q4 would be some of the best.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
perfect. thanks for the color guys. good luck.

the next question is from yves bromehead with exane bnp paribas. please go ahead.
yves bromehead -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
good afternoon dennis and bryan. thank you for taking my question. if i could i have two. number one is could you give us a bit of color on the backlog that you're seeing in the commercial segment? and two, coming back to the international expansion opportunities given the more fragmented supply base in europe, would the strategy still be to export and gain share before setting up a greenfield or could you look at m&a opportunities as a means to become or fast-forward your presence in europe and become a leader there?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
so around the international opportunity, we probably will continue to export for considerable time as we move forward. there may be opportunities that are advantageous and things that we would take a look at but right now given our cost position, we have the ability to be able to continue exporting in that workflow. and related to the commercial backlog, commercial has been a side of the business. it's less than 10% of our overall company and has been more impacted by covid and the changes in how the commercial industry is operating, whether it be the larger arenas that we work with, many of the college stages, things like that. so we have seen some more challenges there with the abi coming down along the way. we do see that we do get back to growth again as that market returns we're confident in the strategy. but of that side of business, there probably will be some additional headwinds there from covid management perspective.
yves bromehead -- exane bnp paribas -- analyst
great. thank you so much.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question is a follow up from kurt yinger with d.a. davidson. please go ahead.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah, thank you. i just wanted to follow up on the last question. could you just remind us kind of the big areas of the international business at present? how the markets you play in look relative to the u.s. here and what you think is kind of most important in terms of taking that business to the next stage.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we tend to look at the markets that have higher gdp, relatively high family income and an interest in outdoor living along the way. so that tends to be your larger economies in europe and australia. we ship product to over 40 countries around the world. so it's not limited just to those large economies, some of the smaller countries once you add them all up together in central and south america ends up becoming a very nice business for trex along the way. but because we are small players in most of these countries today we see the opportunity to be able to significantly increase our penetration in those markets by using some of the same tools that we use in north america, building contractor networks, giving everybody access to high quality websites where they can learn about the product and where to go get the product. make it easy for them to buy.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst

bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bill, and good evening, everyone. thank you for joining us on today's call to review trex company's first quarter performance and business outlook. sustained broad-based demand for trex residential products and accelerated market share gains from wood drove first quarter growth. demand was driven by continued strong secular trends across the outdoor living products as well as increase in consumer preference for environmentally sustainable products with proven high performance, aesthetics and quality. as a result, trex residential sales grew 25% year-over-year in the first quarter. this strong performance underscores the accelerated pace at which we are taking share from the traditional wood market, particularly as wood prices increased.
our analysis indicates that a 1 percentage point market share gain from would translate to over $50 million of annual sales. consumer demand for our outdoor living products remained strong. traffic to trex.com and decks.com in march and april reached the levels more typically seen in june and july, our seasonally strongest months. our websites engage with the consumer at every step of the deck purchasing process, helping the consumer dream and design their deck, estimate costs, ruin purchase samples and then finally finding a contractor or partner where to buy our products.
together, our sites are a powerful source of intelligence into consumer decision-making with respect to residential decking and railing, creating a unique and valuable resource for the company to inform design for future products and digital experiences. in addition to consolidated the sales growth of 23% in the first quarter, we reported strong ebitda margin of 28.9% and first quarter earnings per share of $0.42. earnings growth was impacted by start-up costs from our capacity expansion program, higher raw material inflation and transportation costs, as well as the impact from the march fire in one of our buildings at our virginia manufacturing campus. dennis will review these impacts in his commentary.
these inflationary pressures led us to announce a mid single-digit price increase on most products. to minimize the short-term impact on our distributors, dealers, retailers, contractors, and consumers, this pricing action will take effect on august 1, 2021, providing 90 days of advance notice. this quarter was strong for trex, not just in terms of our financial performance, but also with respect to tremendous progress with our capacity expansion program at the new manufacturing facility in virginia. we expect all lines in new facility to be fully operational by the end of may, 30 days ahead of schedule. also, we are pleased with the performance of the installed line and believe the additional capacity further reinforces our position as the industry leader and most efficient manufacturer of high performance wood alternative decking and railing.
this capacity will provide us with an important competitive advantage in today's dynamic composite decking marketplace as demand for high performance, low maintenance decking continues to gain momentum. the additional capacity will also allow us to resume and pursue numerous growth initiatives, such as new product development in furthering international sales in key markets for future sales growth is poised to outpace our domestic growth. in addition, we will more vigorously pursue our continuous improvement projects that have historically contributed to improving margins.
trex company also remains fully committed to improving our environmental footprint and using recycled and reclaimed raw materials. more than ever, consumers are focused on eco-friendly products, and our best-in-class decking boards utilizing 95% recycled and reclaimed material offers a compelling alternative to wood decking and other competing products. furthermore, trex continues to create an enhanced recycling solutions for plastic waste. recently, we introduced the nextrex packaging label initiative, which allows for packaging to be branded with an official certification at the plastic has been tested and verified as acceptable for recycling into high performance trex decking. as part of this initiative, trex also will work with brand owners and companies to encourage promotion and participation at the retail level by positioning nextrex spend and signage in stores to drive awareness and engagement in the plastic drop off program.
furthering on our esg heritage, trex will be issuing our third annual esg report later in the second quarter. we've incorporated many new improvements to our reporting since our last issuance. we are pleased about trex' continued success in garnering industry orders. the trex brand earned numerous orders this quarter. for the 14th consecutive year, trex' top builder magazine's brand use study for brand familiarity, brand used most and brand used most in the past two years. for the 11th consecutive year, trex has been named the greenest decking in the industry by readers of green builder magazine. we are particularly proud of these awards because they evidence the strength and leadership of the trex brand from those who use our products in their own business.
now, i will turn the call over to our cfo, dennis schemm for the first quarter financial review. dennis?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, bryan. i'm pleased to review our 2021 first quarter results and share our expectations for the second quarter and full year 2021. consolidated sales in the first quarter were $246 million, reflecting a 23% year-over-year increase driven by a strong 25% growth in trex residential products, despite the temporary interruption due to the fire at one of our manufacturing buildings at our virginia facility and tightness in the labor and freight markets. this strong performance was driven by sustained broad-based demand across all trex channel partners as well as continued strong secular growth trends across our outdoor living products portfolio. trex commercial products contributed $13 million to consolidated sales in the first quarter of 2021.
gross margin was 39% compared to 44.8%, reflecting inflationary pressures on raw materials and transportation costs, the impact of start-up cost, increased depreciation related to our capital expansion program and reduced overhead absorption due to the fire at the virginia facility. as bryan mentioned, we recently announced price increases on most products effective august 1st to offset the higher inflation that we are experiencing. the timing of the increase will not benefit q2 margin, but reflects our commitment to maintaining strong channel partner relationships, which is a key element of trex' long term success. trex residential products gross margin was 40.2% compared to 45.6% in the year ago quarter. trex commercial products gross margin was 17.2% due to product mix, timing of certain projects and lower absorption. but we expect both revenue and margin in commercial products to recover in the second quarter.
sg&a expenses decreased $3 million to $31 million over the prior year quarter. as a percentage of sales, sg&a decreased 450 basis points to 12.8% in the first quarter compared to 17.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to timing of spend on branding and reduced travel and entertainment expenses because of the covid pandemic. our effective tax rate for the first quarter 2021 was 24.7% and in line with expectations. net income was $49 million or $0.42 per diluted share, up 14% and 17%, respectively, from the $42 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. ebitda increased 20% to $71 million and ebitda margin was 28.9% compared to 29.4% in the comparable quarter of 2020. capital expenditures were $58 million with the majority supporting the capacity expansion program.
in the first quarter, we continued to add lines to the new virginia facility. when completed at the end of the month, the capacity expansion program will provide 70% more capacity when compared to 2019 volume levels. we repurchased over 500,000 shares of trex outstanding common stock at an average price of $90 per share, totaling $46 million under the share buyback program during the 2021 first quarter. we have repurchased a total of 3.3 million shares under the current program as of the end of the first quarter. our strong first quarter puts us firmly on track to have another year of strong double-digit growth despite the estimated sales loss of $12 million to $13 million through the end of june year-to-date because of the fire at our virginia facility.
we expect second quarter consolidated net sales to range from $295 million to $305 million, representing year-on-year growth of 36% at the midpoint. this is in line with our previous expectation of sales growth in the second quarter as our additional capacity is fully operational and in the third quarter as we back fill channel inventory before returning to more normalized seasonal patterns in the fourth quarter. we are also reaffirming the guidance for full year 2021 incremental ebitda margin up between 35% and 40% as the positive impact of the august price increase and cost savings projects drive additional gross margin leverage in the second half of 2021, amid more normalized sg&a spending. our tax rate is anticipated at approximately 25%. depreciation will range from $35 million to $40 million, increasing throughout the year and we expect full year cap -- full year spending on capex to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million.
now, i will turn the call back to bryan for his closing remarks.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dennis. our first quarter performance has laid the foundation for continued strong double-digit growth in 2021 against the backdrop of strong consumer demand and completion of our capacity expansion program. the timing of our capacity additions, overall strength of the market and the wood conversion opportunity is demonstrated by the mid-point sales guidance of 36% growth in the second quarter. i want to thank the entire trex team for their hard work as well as our dealers, retailers, distributors and contractors whose continued support has been essential to our growth.
operator, i'd now like to open the call for questions.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from ryan merkel with william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking the question. first off, can you talk about lumber prices if you've seen stronger conversion as a result, and if so, has the growth been boosted at the low end or is it broad based?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
sure, ryan. good to talk to you this evening. we have seen higher lumber prices diy or reasonable quality pressure treated is selling for about a $1.60, and as you're aware, our entry level is about $1.75 at the enhance basics product. but what we're seeing is a broad-based demand across all of our products. so i would expect for that consumer who is primarily intending wood, it's easier for them to make that conversion at this point given how close that price is, but we're not seeing a shift toward that opening price point. we continue to see the growth across all of our product line. people see that they are able to afford the enhance basics product line, recognize the aesthetics of the enhance naturals will give them more of the look that they want and those that are looking for the more premium products and aesthetics are still tending toward the select and transcend products.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
that's great to hear. bryan, thanks. and then for my follow-up on sg&a, should we be assuming that brand spend comes back gradually through the year such that you're exiting 4q maybe $8 million, $10 million higher than 1q?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we definitely said that we would be reinvesting in the brand more heavily this year and we will continue on that path. we said that this would be a more normalized year and after the first quarter we were certainly lower than than last year as expected and we would gradually see this start to increase throughout the remainder of the year.
ryan merkel -- william blair & company -- analyst
all right, fair enough, thanks. great quarter.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ryan.
operator
and our next question comes from tim wojs with baird. please go ahead.
timothy wojs -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
hey, everybody. good morning or good afternoon, sorry. thanks. so i guess my first question just on input costs. could you maybe talk about what you're seeing now in terms of inflation and how that might be trending relative to your initial expectations earlier this year?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we are seeing broad based inflation across the organization. going into the year, we had expected inflation to pick up. it's fair to say that it is coming higher -- coming in higher than what those expectations were. it was important that we recognize how the channel operates and many decks are sold 90, 120 days in advance so we wanted to give enough time for the channel to work through that, allow contractors to finish their jobs and then pass along the price increase. so with that inflation coming in and the pricing we're taking, we're able to hold our incremental ebitda margin guidance.
timothy wojs -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
okay, ok, that's good. and then could you just remind us how your recycled inputs move relative to the version to the virgin, yeah, to the virgin counterparts.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we talked about that a little bit in some of our prior calls. the biggest move that we're seeing with the recycled inputs right now is the higher volume that we're purchasing. so we're having to go further and of course transportation we're seeing significant increases and that's the biggest driver of the increased cost and polyethylene right now.
timothy wojs -- robert w. baird & co., inc. -- analyst
okay. okay, great. i'll hop back in queue. nice job, guys.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
and our next question today comes from ketan mamtora with bmo capital. please go ahead.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you. i'm just curious, what are you guys seeing in terms of channel inventories for this time of the year given demand has been so strong?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
channel inventories continue to be lower than where we would like. normally coming out of the first quarter, we would have peak inventories. we're not seeing that right now because of the demand that's in the marketplace and that's why dennis mentioned that we expected we would be back to building capacity, building inventory in the channel during the third quarter as all of our capacity is online by that time frame.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then can you just remind us what is left by way of repurchase authorization?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
there is significant amounts left for us. it's a relatively 8.2 million shares are left.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
got it. very helpful. i'll jump back in the queue. thank you.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer

operator
and our next question comes from keith hughes with truist. please go ahead.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. you talked about in the release and in the prepared statements about some cost pressures in the quarter around the fire and the ramp-up of the capacity. can you give us an idea how much of that -- how much of those two items were numbers in the quarter.
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. keith, that's -- it's a great question and despite all of these issues, dealing with inflation, start-up expense, the fire, we're still very proud that our incrementals for the full year will remain unchanged at between 35% and 40%. but that when you take a look at the gross margin degradation in the quarter about 200 basis points of that was inflation and i'd say another 200 was relative to the start-up expenses.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
does that 200 basis points include the higher d&a or is that more just dollar cost outs, let's say?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
it does, it include some of the higher d&a as well.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
and does all that d&a come in as cost of goods -- assuming cost of sales or some of it end up in sg&a?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
there is a little bit in sg&a, but the major capex is of course in the cogs line.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
okay. and then final question on the, excuse me, on the price release, assuming on the price increase, is that across the entire trex product portfolio that those increases are coming in?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
it's across most of our products.
keith hughes -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, thank you.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, keith.
operator
and our next question today comes from stanley elliott with stifel. please go ahead.
stanley elliott -- stifel nicolaus and company -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you all for taking the question. in terms of the 2q guidance, very impressive. it feels like this is really true demand instead of any sort of restock ahead of the price increase, but would love to get some color around that, especially in the context of the high web traffic that you're seeing.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
you're spot on with your comments, it is demand driven. i would prefer to be saying that there is some inventory build that will occur in the second quarter. but as of now, we expect that all going to be demand and we'll get into some of that inventory building in the third quarter, and then back to more of a normal seasonal type demand pattern in the fourth quarter.
stanley elliott -- stifel nicolaus and company -- analyst
great. and with the expansion coming online faster than what you all had targeted, you mentioned a handful of kind of wish list growth projects, how quickly can you start moving on those once you get completed with the expansion in may?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we've got a number of projects that are in the queue at this point, some are down the path of our -- where we already have investment. there is other parts of it, where they are still in the pipeline. i think, you'll start to see some more of those come on once we're done with that capacity piece of it. we could go back a number of years ago. we talked about increasing the output on our existing manufacturing lines. that's still an opportunity ahead of us, but we need to be able to get the downtime to be able to replace some of those assets.
stanley elliott -- stifel nicolaus and company -- analyst
thanks, guys. appreciated and best of luck.

and our next question today comes from matthew bouley with barclays. please go ahead.
matthew bouley -- barclays -- analyst
good evening, everyone. follow-up to that last question, on the capacity being fully operational by the end of may. just number one, what does that suggest around, i don't know the utilization, how you want to define that, because it does sound like you think you'll have additional room to go after these growth initiatives. but then my broader question is really given the strength of demand, at what point does it make sense or you actually need to think about the next, actually the next waves of capacity. thank you, bryan.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, thanks. we have a sophisticated supply chain group and they are looking at 5, 7 and 10 years for what our sales growth expectations are and from there making determinations as to what we need to do with capacity. so it's something that we talk about regularly here. as we talk about utilization right now, utilization is at a 100%. we are running all of the assets we have and getting every single linear foot of decking and railing out to the marketplace.
matthew bouley -- barclays -- analyst
okay, understood. second one kind of along the same lines, but as you scale this quickly, you're obviously going to need to source more and more material, it sounds like you've got some interesting efforts here with the nextrex that you mentioned. just as you scale up this quickly, does the ability to actually source recycled plastics become a constraint at all. thank you.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we've been working to scale for some time now, recognizing that the growth is out there and the size of the conversion opportunity. so, while there are some challenges related to it. a lot of it related to freight right now. there is plentiful supplies of the market. and as more companies look at their own esg principles and as more homeowners want to do what's right for the environment that supply of plastic increases.
matthew bouley -- barclays -- analyst
wonderful. well, thank you for the details, bryan, and good luck.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, matt. appreciated.
operator
and our next question comes from jeff stevenson with loop capital. please go ahead.
jeffrey stevenson -- loop capital -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my questions today. my first one is, how should we think about the cadence of incremental ebitda margin as the year progresses? should it still be back half weighted to get to the 35% or 40% range or will it be sooner now that the capacity program is complete earlier than our original expectation?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
it's a great question, jeff. and q2 margins will be a little dampened because of the inflation that we're seeing and our price increase does not go into effect until august 1st. so you will definitely see this, the ebitda margin expansion be more of a back half. q3 will definitely be higher than q2 that's because all of our lines will be up and running fully and we expect to be running full out, and then q4 will -- should even be higher. so that's how the ramp should occur.
jeffrey stevenson -- loop capital -- analyst
okay, great. and just as far as demand goes, i just wondered about the exit rate from march heading into april and whether how much pent-up demand was the result of the fire at the virginia plant and also winter storm uri and how that could impact the second quarter?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
i wouldn't say that that drove the pent-up demand. they were orders that we could have filled. during the quarter, we were unable to do that. and as i mentioned earlier, the inventories in the channel are low. at this point, we'd like to have more out there. and as a capacity comes on, we'll work to fill those orders.
jeffrey stevenson -- loop capital -- analyst
got it. thank you.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, jeff.

and our next question today comes from michael rehaut with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
michael rehaut -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, everyone. congrats on the results.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon. thank you.
michael rehaut -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
first question i had was on the, how to think about revenue in the back half? obviously, in the second quarter you gave your guidance and in part that's based on the continued ramping capacity. demand obviously does it remain -- is not a problem. it's continues to be a backdrop where you can just sell as much as we can make. so from that standpoint, as you look at further lines coming up and being fully operational by the end of may, how should we think about the run rate in 3q and 4q? again just, let's say, for argument sake that seasonality isn't as much of a factor as was the case last year.
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, we feel really good about growth for the entire year after clipping off the 23% growth rate here in q1, move into a 6% growth rate at the midpoint for q2, it gives us a lot of momentum. i expect q3 to even be bigger than q2, as all of our lines will be fully operational and q2 only sees a part of that, right. so q3 should be bigger than q2, and then things will start to return to more normalized seasonal levels for q4.
michael rehaut -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
all right. that's great, thank you for that. very helpful. on the second question, just kind of going back to the gross margin cadence, and also to a degree, i mean, you talked about sg&a, obviously improving, i believe, on a dollar basis sequentially throughout the year. i'm wondering, if we should still be expecting leverage on a full year basis, it would seem to be the case. but also on the gross margin side, you talked about, obviously, flipping positive into the back half as the price increases kick in. should 2q, should we be seeing a similar type of year-over-year decline or as some of those start-up costs moderate and you have the better top line, we should be thinking about something less. so kind of a two part of their, sorry for the -- for both this.
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
no, no problem at all. so relative to sg&a. so just to be really clear, we are going to be increasing sg&a throughout the year. so q2 will actually be a headwind year-over-year, right, because last year there was significant pull back because of covid. so q2, q3, q4 we were pulled back pretty significantly because of reduced travel and entertainment. we pulled back on the branding as well, because demand was so strong. in q2, we're definitely going to be throttling up the sg&a spend in q3 and q4. so we'll be returning to more normalized levels of sg&a as we move through the year. we fully expected q1 to be light, because it was covid impacted. relative -- and so long story too right. so over the longer term here, we clearly expect to sg&a to be a leverage story. we will get leverage this year as well.
relative to gross margin, we talked about q2 being a little muted. despite the lines coming on, we still have start-up expenses and we have higher inflation and so our price increase does not take into -- come into effect until august, 1, so q2 will be exposed. but as we move into q3, we'll have the price increase behind us and in q4 as well. also with q3 you're going to have -- we're expecting to be running full out, so capacity utilization will be very, very strong as well. so q3 and q4, you'll see ratable increases in our gross margin performance.
michael rehaut -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
just -- appreciate that. just to clarify on the q2 versus q1 on the gross margin, appreciate that the raw material inflation impact will still be solid perhaps similarly given the price increases don't kick in yet. what about the start-up costs that 200 bps drag from higher start-up costs and depreciation, would that moderate given the higher sales and the continued ramp in 2q and should therefore that be -- the 2q gross margins be better than than 1q?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
well, i'm not going to comment specific guidance on the margins, but start-up expenses should start to come down. we are going to be at full capacity for our new building by the end of may. so we should start to see those start-up expenses decrease and we definitely saw the full component of the start-up expenses in q1 of this year.
michael rehaut -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you.

and our next question today comes from phil ng with jefferies. please go ahead.
philip ng -- jefferies llc -- analyst
hey guys, congrats on another strong quarter.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, phil.
philip ng -- jefferies llc -- analyst
great to, hey, bryan, great to see the new capacity come on ahead of schedule. so, if demand is there and you run full out, just curious how much bandwidth you have from a supply standpoint on a year-over-year basis for 2q in the back half, appreciating some of that 70% incremental capacity did come on last year already.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we haven't provided specific numbers. i think when you look at the sales growth that we're showing, it's an indication of that capacity coming on. so we will have the full quarter for the lines that have already come up and then of course we will have two full let's say two full months of the additional lines that will come up through the quarter. and by the third quarter, as dennis mentioned, that increase is from a revenue perspective, because we now have all of that capacity available to us.
philip ng -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay. but your general view is that given that the demand backdrop you'll be kind of caught up from inventory standpoint for the channel by 3q, 4q will kind of return back to more normal.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. we expect we'll be building inventory in the third quarter. where the market goes at that point, it's tough to say whether whether we were fully back there. but it's our expectation at this point with the capacity that we have, we will be able to get a large way there -- large way -- part of the way there.
philip ng -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay. and then with some of the new capacity you're bringing on, you talked about it providing an opportunity for you to pursue to international market a new products. what about new construction? i'm just trying to get there, just because housing is actually really strong right now. so is that a less attractive opportunity versus international from a margin standpoint? thanks a lot.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
it's a good point. that is something that we have a team that's focused on. we already have relationships with some of the largest national builders that are out there and working with them to let them know when that product will consistently be available so that they can offer that as upgrades in their homes.
philip ng -- jefferies llc -- analyst
okay, all right, sounds good. that's exciting.

our next question today comes from alex maroccia with berenberg. please go ahead.
alex maroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
good afternoon, guys. thanks for taking my questions. just looking to get more information around these price increases in august. for timing, is this at the start or end of the month? and then in terms of the accounting of it, how does the price increase work with sales that can be booked until they're shipped from dcs to retail?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
the price increase will take effect on august 1st. and from an accounting perspective out of our plant, it is our fob manufacturing plant and for our retail customers, it's when the product ships from their distribution center to the store.
alex maroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay, got it. and then as we get past the price increase in the event that input costs begin normalizing in the back half of the year, how much of the cost savings would you capture in fy '21 versus '22?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
can you repeat that question again? sorry, you came across a little broken up.
alex maroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
yeah, no worries. as we get past this price increase in the event that input cost start normalizing in the second half, how much of the savings from those cost declines would you capture in fy '21 versus '22?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
oh geez.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think we would have to make some real assumptions there at this point regarding what of those cost changes would be flowing through. so i don't think that's one we can provide you a good answer for at this time.
alex maroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst
okay, no worries. i was just trying to gauge the timing of when you're purchasing the raw materials versus when they would actually get booked.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
the raw material in many cases 30 to 60 day supply depending upon what it is, some are longer, some are shorter, but there is -- i don't think is an easy way to get to even a rough number for you for this purpose.
alex maroccia -- berenberg capital markets -- analyst

reuben garner -- the benchmark co. -- analyst
so maybe just a follow-up from an earlier question, dennis you sounded -- it sounds like you're suggesting the third quarter growth rate could be even stronger than the second quarter. i know that you guys are planning on the built -- building some inventory. can you talk about like how much, i guess, to get back to normal levels, like how much business would you get just from restocking to normal levels in the third quarter assuming that way if we think the market, underlying market is growing 20% for you guys, you can add in whatever restock there is, is that a good way to look at that?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we see the overall growth is inclusive in the double-digit top line number we're talking about. i know it doesn't give you exactly what you're looking for. we do expect the third quarter to grow beyond where the second quarter is with the availability of that capacity, supplying market demand as well as back filling inventory.
reuben garner -- the benchmark co. -- analyst
okay. and then a follow-up on the polyethylene conversation. has -- a handful of years ago, i know you guys were in the pellet business with virgin prices. i think they were north of $1 or pound deck when you were doing that. i don't know exactly where they stand today, but i got to imagine that they're pretty close. i mean, is there any thought for you guys into doing some business there to take advantage of your capabilities in turning the cheaper inputs into a quality product that oems can uses.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
the growth opportunity for us in the outdoor living marketplace is much more attractive than commodity pellets.
reuben garner -- the benchmark co. -- analyst
okay. so it would use the same capacity. it's not a separate manufacturing process that would use the same capacity that you do for decking?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
that's correct, unless we've built additional capacity to service that market specifically, but right now our strategy is focused on serving the growing outdoor living marketplace.
reuben garner -- the benchmark co. -- analyst
got it. very helpful. thank you, guys, and congrats again.
operator
and our next question today comes from kurt yinger with d.a. davidson since. please go ahead.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great, thank you. i'm just curious when you talk to contractors as part of your program, what are you hearing in terms of labor and that perhaps being a constraint in any way to projects and demand as the market is quite hot right now.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
the labor is a challenge for everybody in the channel, whether it'd be the retailer, trying to get enough people to make sure they're registered in the lumber aisle, our staff or the pro-channel, making sure that they have the right skilled people to be able to sell the premium products that they carry. for our contractors, it's no different. many of the employees that these contractors have have been with them for some time now and they have been fully employed through the entire pandemic period. so they're not having to be bringing people back off of unemployment into these jobs again. i'm sure, much like virtually everybody else in the economy, they'd be happy to have more people coming off of those roles at a quicker pace along the way. but right now they have the staffing that they need to be able to meet their own backlogs.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay, makes sense. and then my second one, obviously, the conversion story right now is very strong and i think it's a real critical part of the long-term narrative. i'm just curious as you look out over the next two, three, five years, what do you think is most important in terms of your role in continuing that accelerated rate of conversion?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
there's 40 million to 50 million wood desks just in north america alone. on an average age 8 to 10 years on those decks, so i would expect between the next five to seven years on average those decks will need to be replace. composites, trex composites specifically are much more well known in the market than any other products that are out there and we will gain more than our fair share of those sales as they come along. so even though we have a tightened the marketplace between wood and composites right now, if it goes right back to where it was tomorrow we are highly confident in our strategy to continue that conversion.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. all right. i appreciate the color, bryan, and good luck here in q2 guys.
operator
and our next question comes from the line of alex rygiel with b. riley fbr. please go ahead.
alex rygiel -- b. riley securities -- analyst
hi guys. thank you. very nice quarter, bryan.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, alex.
alex rygiel -- b. riley securities -- analyst
bryan, you've been in the business for a long time. can you talk a little bit about the correlation between new home construction cycles and then the sort of lagging demand drivers to building a deck in composite decking. how many years is that...
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
i think you just said, great heritage didn't you. yeah. i have been around for a while on this.
alex rygiel -- b. riley securities -- analyst
not at all.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
the demand patterns on new home building, because we are 95% repair and remodel, there's not a significant correlation between trex and homebuilding cycle that you see out there. i think, as we move forward and there is the expansion in new home building over the next couple of years. and as we build those relationships, further build on them and have product available to it, there probably be a little bit more of a correlation, but i'd be -- it's never going to become a dominant part of our business.
alex rygiel -- b. riley securities -- analyst
maybe let me clarify the question. clearly a lot of homes are built without a deck. what kind of sort of lagging benefit have you seen after a big housing cycle? when does the cycle for building those deck been develop?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i got you now. it's usually going to be 24 -- 12 to 24 months after that home is built, where the homeowners have spent most of their upgrade money on their counter tops or floors or fixtures. they get into the house, then they realize they want the deck. so, it's generally one to two years after the house has been closed.
alex rygiel -- b. riley securities -- analyst
thank you.

[operator instruction] today's next question comes from trey grooms with stephens. please go ahead.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, good afternoon and congrats. great quarter.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, trey.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
so i guess this one is just kind of around the incrementals kind of revisiting that some of the commentary there. the 35% to 40% incremental ebitda margin it sounds like you're ramp through the year. and if i understood right, 4q would be your highest incremental quarter, incremental margin quarter of the year, if i understood that right. and so i guess the question is, with the puts and takes around the price cost catch up that you're seeing in the 4q, but also if you returning back to normal kind of capacity utilization or maybe more normal seasonal patterns in the 4q, with those puts and takes at hand here and looking at exiting the year at the highest incremental ebitda margin, how do we think about longer term incrementals going forward exiting this year? is that a good run rate? is there more to come above and beyond that? how should we be thinking about it longer term, bryan?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
well, i think over the longer term, we're going to continue to find ways in which to improve our cost position. that is one of the things trex is known for historically. and so we're -- our focus right now is on the capacity expansion, but as bryan talked about earlier, we're going to quickly pivot and we're in the start looking at cost out projects as well and we'll be focused on those for the back half of the year and then into the future. and so as we continue to grow, we have all of our lines behind us. sg&a becomes a greater leverage story as well as we're not having to invest dollar for dollar, if you will, from a branding perspective and enhance, because enhance does not require the same level of branding spend. so clearly, it can be higher than the range that we have given you.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
yeah, got that. thank you for that. and then that sg&a ramp, i guess as follow-on, that sg&a ramp that you're talking about back to something more normal, is that -- can you give us any better way of kind of thinking about kind of where you see maybe exiting the year this year, dennis? is it a kind of a linear kind of ramp up to 4q? and then that's -- or is it more lumpy, is there more step functions there?
dennis c. schemm -- vice president and chief financial officer
no, it's not lumpy at all. in fact, i would consider this to be a little more linear now. so, q1 was definitely going to be the lightest, because it was covid impacted. when you start stepping into q2 and q3, q4, we're going to continue on with our branding spend, and you're going to see more and more travel start to kick in. so i think that you'll see q3 be a little higher than q2 and i think you'll see q4 be a little higher than q3 from a travel and entertainment perspective, because we'll be out on the road more, we will be attending conferences more and meeting with customers.
trey grooms -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. that's helpful, thanks a lot. i'll pass it on. good luck.

with that introduction, i will turn the call over to bryan fairbanks.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bill, and good evening everyone. thank you for joining us today to review trex company's second quarter results and year-to-date performance along with our business outlook. this was another very strong quarter with record revenues of $312 million led by 43% sales growth at trex residential. demand remains robust across all trex residential outdoor living product lines in both diy and pro channels.
the success of our $200 million capacity expansion program, which became fully operational one month ahead of schedule, has enabled us to take advantage of the appeal of trex branded products and increased conversion from the large wood market. this expansion is the largest in the company's history and increases our production levels by 70% compared to 2019 year-end levels. however, labor constraints impacted to the extent to which we could utilize this capacity to meet the higher demand.
our new virginia plant is highly efficient and designed for maximum output with an emphasis on quality control and energy-efficient operations. with the capacity expansion plan largely behind us, we are pivoting our focus to cost reduction projects and continuous improvement opportunities to drive margin improvement. these efforts will be focused on automation, energy efficiency and raw material processing. one such cost reduction project is poised to reduce the processing cost of our plastics by generating higher productivity and allowing for a wider use of low cost recycled material streams.
in addition, thanks to the tireless efforts of our engineering team and their continuous improvement mindset, we are pleased to announce that by the end of the year, we will install incremental decking capacity within the new virginia facility that will further increase our production capability and improve our cost position. as a result of this initiative, trex will have even more opportunity to pursue further growth as we've been unable to fully realize due to capacity constraints.
we will be positioned to take advantage of the product development work being done by our r&d team, expand our international sales and penetrate the new home construction market. while we continue to make significant strides with our additional capacity, we remain pleased with the continued success of our tiered product strategy, which supports consumer decision making by providing a range of product aesthetics, features and price points that have broad-based appeal and distinct competitive advantages over wood. the winning mix of products, makes it easy for the consumer to choose trex and we see strong growth across all price points.
like many other companies and industries during the second quarter, trex experienced labor challenges and inflationary pressures from higher raw materials and logistics costs. as a result of the inflationary pressures, trex took a mid single-digit price increase on most products effective august 1, with the full impact to be seen later in the third quarter. we deliberately chose the timing of our price increase to give ample notice to our channel partners in order to minimize the impact during the peak decking season. this action is example of the importance we place on our partnerships with distributors, dealers and contractors and doing right by them.
dennis will provide more detail around our financial results and inflationary impacts, but i want to highlight that despite inflationary headwinds, ebitda grew by 36% during the second quarter and produced a 29% increase in diluted earnings per share. while we focus on profitable company growth, expansion and continuous improvement, we continue to do so in a sustainable manner. sustainability has always been a part of trex's dna since exception. trex is and has always been one of north america's largest recyclers of plastic film.
in 2020 we upcycled more than 900 million pounds of plastic film and reclaimed wood. most of which would otherwise be destined for landfills. at our plants scrap boards are recycled back into the manufacturing process as well. additionally, our ongoing efforts to improve energy and resource efficiency in our plants help reduce the company's energy use related to cooling by approximately 40% in 2020 and the addition of closed loop chilled water systems significantly reduced water usage. for a more detailed description of our ongoing esg efforts, i encourage you to review our third annual 2020 esg report on our website, which includes our first disclosure of scope 1 and 2 annual carbon emissions and establishes a baseline for future efforts to reduce carbon emissions. the report was issued at the end of june '21 and recaps a year of building a better tomorrow together for our customers, employees, communities, investors and the environment.
dennis schemm will now share details on our second quarter financial performance. dennis?
dennis c. schemm -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, bryan. i'm pleased to highlight the drivers of our strong second quarter results and year-to-date performance as well as our expectations for the third quarter and full year 2021. consolidated sales were $312 million in the second quarter compared to $221 million in the same quarter last year. the 41% increase was driven by substantial volume growth across all trex residential product lines. trex residential sales of $299 million outpaced sales of $209 million year-over-year by 43% resulting from sustained broad-based demand and market share gains from wood. trex commercial products contributed $13 million to consolidated sales in the second quarter of 2021.
consolidated gross margin for the second quarter was 38%, after absorbing an approximately 400 basis point impact related to start-up costs and inflationary pressures on key raw materials and transportation versus 41.9% in the prior year quarter. gross margin was also impacted by increased depreciation expense of $5 million, related to the capacity expansion program at trex residential and labor constraints. labor constraints resulted in lower sales and margins by under-utilizing expanded capacity. cost savings initiatives increased production and the impact of the january price increase, partially offset the unfavorable impacts. gross margins for trex residential and trex commercial were 38.7% and 21.6% respectively compared to 42.5% and 30.7% respectively in the year ago quarter.
sg&a expenses were $36 million, an increase of 24% compared to $29 million in the prior year quarter. the primary drivers of the increase were personnel related expenses, higher branding spending and a resumption of travel and entertainment expenses as covid related impacts eased. as a percentage of net sales, however, sg&a decreased by 170 basis points to 11.5% in the second quarter compared to 13.2% in the prior year quarter, reflecting disciplined cost management and leverage in our operating model as we rapidly grew our sales. despite the inflationary and start-up costs, we incurred during the quarter, we delivered 30% growth in net income to $61 million or $0.53 per diluted share, up from the $47 million or $0.41 per diluted share in last year's second quarter.
the steady focus on our strategic initiatives and our increased production capacity resulted in a 36% growth in ebitda to $92 million and an ebitda margin of 29.4%. the continued strength of the repair and remodel sector, trex brand leadership and increased capacity drove our impressive year-to-date performance. consolidated net sales year-to-date increased 32% to $557 million compared to $421 million in the prior year period. higher net sales were primarily driven by a 34% increase in trex residential sales to $532 million compared to $396 million in the same period last year. net income was $110 million or $0.95 per share compared to $90 million or $0.77 per diluted share year-to-date in 2020.
ebitda grew 29% to $163 million compared to $126 million and ebitda margin remained relatively stable at 29.2% compared to 30% for the same period in 2020. year-to-date capital expenditures were $95 million with the majority supporting the capacity expansion program completed in may. in addition, year-to-date, we repurchased 49 million of trex outstanding common stock at an average price of $91 per share under the share buyback program. trex has an approved buyback program for up to 8.3 million shares.
looking ahead, we expect third quarter consolidated net sales to range from $320 million to $330 million, representing year-on-year growth of 40% at the midpoint and reflecting continued strong consumer demand from our channel partners. we expect continued inflationary pressures in the coming quarter as the tailwind from the august 1, 2021 price increase will not take effect until sometime in september, as we are fulfilling orders approximately 30 days later than expected because of labor constraints. as we navigate these challenges, we anticipate incremental ebitda margin will be at the low end of the range of 35% to 40% for the full year. we expect to return to more normalized ebitda margins in the first quarter of 2022 as we are past the start-up phase of our capacity expansion and as our price increase and strong cost reduction and continuous improvement initiatives take effect.
our tax rate is anticipated to be approximately 25%, depreciation will range from $35 million to $40 million, increasing throughout the remainder of the year. full year spending on capex is expected to be in the range of $130 million to $150 million, which includes the installation of additional decking production lines to further boost our capacity.
now i will turn the call back to bryan for his closing remarks.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dennis. our year-to-date performance places us firmly on track to achieve our stated expectation for strong double-digit growth in 2021 and the success of our capital expansion program along with the additional capacity investments position trex for ongoing growth and enhanced value creation for our stakeholders. most importantly, i want to recognize the hard work and dedication of the entire trex team as well as the continued support of our dealers, retailers, distributors and contractors who continue to be great partners and key to our growth trex's extraordinary success is due at large part to all of you.
operator, we can now take questions.
",":
operator
thank you. and we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question today will come from jeff stevenson with loop capital. please go ahead.
jeff stevenson -- loop capital -- analyst
all right, thanks for taking my question. my first one is, has raw material inflation peaked in the second quarter? do you expect any incremental inflation in the back half of the year? and then following up on that, do you believe the august mid single-digit increase will be enough offset these higher inflation pressures or do you think you'll need incremental pricing in the second half?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
well, we've not seen any of the raw material start to come down in the market as of yet. we continue to receive new notifications of increases in price. so, i expect the third quarter to be a higher impact than the second quarter, but of course, we've got the pricing coming in. as we look forward, it's too early to predict what inflation is going to do out in 2022. but in order of priority, we will continue to focus on continuous improvement, cost reduction, and of course we will look at pricing as appropriate to make sure that we're offsetting any new cost that flow through to trex related to inflation.
jeff stevenson -- loop capital -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then just on the new virginia capacity addition, can you give any more color on how incremental this is, the capital investment and potential impact on margin like the prior expansion? any more color there would be helpful.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
sure. if you compare it to what we provided last time it was 70% increasing capacity. this will be approximately 15% additional capacity. we haven't been as specific on the actual investment. but it is included within the guidance for the capital spending we provided for 2021.
jeff stevenson -- loop capital -- analyst
got it. thanks for your help and all the best.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
great, thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from keith hughes with truist. please go ahead.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
good evening keith.
keith hughes -- truist -- analyst
thank you. how are you all? a couple of questions. one, you had listed off the drivers of the 400 basis points down in gross margin. can you kind of put magnitude on those. what was the biggest hit, second biggest hit, things of that nature?
dennis c. schemm -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, so if i were to rank order these right? so, i would first start with inflation. clearly that is where most of the margin pressure is coming from. then as you walk it down, start-up costs were clearly pretty significant in the quarter as well as, we had april and may with start-up cost as we completed the expansion program in late may. from there, i would look at depreciation expense as well as that had a significant impact to and then we also had labor shortages impact us as well, because of the tight labor market, we weren't able to run all of our lines as much as we would have liked. and as a result we have absorption impact from that. if we -- we want to go back into the inflation for a little bit more detail, right, i would look at it as raw material inflation and then from a transportation perspective, we were hit with higher logistics costs. so those would be the two drivers within inflation that were the biggest impact.
keith hughes -- truist -- analyst
okay. and as you look at the inflation moving into the third kind of calling it to peak in the third, is that still a function of transportation costs still moving up. and i'm referring to translation within raw material getting to your facilities. is that what's changing or is that the actual base material itself?
dennis c. schemm -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
no, what we're actually seeing more is the base material starting to rise on some of the key raw materials and so the transportation market still remains high, but it's really on the base level of the materials.
keith hughes -- truist -- analyst
okay, thank you.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks keith.
operator
and our next question will come from ryan merkel with william blair. please go ahead.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
hey guys. thanks for taking the question.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
hey ryan.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
so i guess, first off, you mentioned labor constraints hurt production. what solutions are you working on and have you seen any improvement?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yes, sure. so there has been -- there have been quite a few things that we have implemented at our manufacturing environments to improve our ability to run all of our lines. we have changed the wage structure for a number of the positions that we have. it hasn't been across the board, but there have been certain areas where we have increased wages. second thing, as it relates to over time, we have put some additional incentive programs in place to encourage more people to work the over time that we need with the additional lines. and then the last is a much broader focus on recruiting. so getting more people through the doors that we can help run our lines. one example is that we've moved heavily into this year is what we call our level up program.
for most of trex's history, we've hired people at the entry level and then we train them through all of our manufacturing processes as they move up through manufacturing. we recognize there are highly skilled capable people available in our local economies and we've gone ahead and started recruiting directly for those individuals. of course, paying about a higher wage rate than just coming into trex as a newer and unfamiliar employee along the way. we continue to look for new ideas out there. we hope that with the change in government benefits as we move through september, the number of people that are coming back into the market increase further from what we've already seen, and of course we operate in states where we continue to pay the higher level of unemployment benefits for the full statutory period of time.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
got it. all right. that's going to be important given the new capacity. and then secondly, just how should we think about gross margins in the second half at this point. i know you're going to be at the lower end of the incremental margins, but it sounds like what's the improvement. just a little bit slower than expected and then in the fourth quarter presumably would be kind of the best quarter. is that fair?
dennis c. schemm -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i think that's a real fair way to look at it. the way i'm thinking about this is, the gross margin pressures in my mind are more transitory in nature. so if you think about these, i'll take each one that i talked about earlier. inflation, we took our price increase with the 90-day advance notice. and then on top of that, because of labor constraints, we're fulfilling july orders essentially in the september timeframe right. so this is making it harder for us to get our price increase out there. so that's one. and more obviously, our price increase will take effect more significantly in the september timeframe that will address the inflation. the start-up costs are behind us at this point. so we won't be seeing that recur in q3.
labor shortages eventually are going to get rided [phonetic]. bryan talked a lot about some of the initiatives that we're working here internally which are seeing positive impact, but over the longer term that's going to ride [phonetic] itself as well. and then finally depreciation will lap that in q3 of next year. so all of these issues are transitory in nature. and then as you think about the back half, we're going to start pivoting to these cost reduction and continuous improvement projects that will help to elevate our gross margins going forward. we're predicting to see trex standard margins right, the gross margins that you are all used to back in q1 of 2022.
ryan merkel -- william blair -- analyst
all right, very helpful. thanks.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ryan.
operator
and our next question will come from michael rehaut with jpmorgan. please go ahead. hello, perhaps your line is muted michael.
michael rehaut -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yes. sorry about that. hi, good afternoon, everyone.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
hi michael.
michael rehaut -- jpmorgan -- analyst
first question, just wanted to make sure i understood it right, or how to think about it. you kind of gave some puts and takes on the gross margins. and in terms of maybe expecting a little bit of improvement from the second quarter where you have the 38%. am i to kind of take away that you'll see a little bit more material inflation, you will see less start-up costs, i don't know if they would offset each other. but then the reason you're seeing -- you're expecting some improvement off the 38%, is that if you have some costs alleviating some cost increasing, but then on top of that, you have the price increases coming through in september. is that the right way to think about it?
dennis c. schemm -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i think you've pretty much hit everything there, with the price increase will come through in september, that will be a month later than we had originally intended. we'll continue to see some of the raw material cost climb throughout the third quarter. i hope that third quarter ends up being the peak period and things level out from that perspective. the start-up costs are behind us in the third quarter. so that's a -- one of the -- the favorability is that we see on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
michael rehaut -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay, that's great. thank you. and then just a follow-up. i guess, shifting to the topline. you came in a little bit above i believe guidance for this quarter, kind of hit our number, at least the high end of your range hit our number for the third quarter. as we think about the fourth quarter, obviously, you haven't given guidance yet, but how should we think about, obviously you have a lot more capacity now, it's fully up and running, but at the same time, i think you talked about maybe eventually taking some of it offline at points which is to do improvements, maybe some downtime, obviously there is still a very strong demand backdrop and you can operate at a higher sales rate. but should we be expecting some type of pullback decline at least sequentially 4q versus 3q, just more from either a maintenance or retooling standpoint?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
i would expect a similar production number in the fourth quarter and it's really all dependent upon how much of the channel inventories and our own can get filled during the third quarter. we do see some evidence of that at least in certain channels. inventory is being filled at this point and then there's other channels where we have quite a few backlogs that still need to be addressed. so as we move through the quarter we'll have better visibility on that, i would expect that we'll continue running the capacity and build the inventory necessary to give our customers the confidence that we have everything that they need, and then we'd be in a position to start taking lines down for a little bit longer period, if we get out into next year and we've got the inventory throughout the channel. we can do the maintenance that we wanted to do as well as improve some of the assets for improved cost positions.

and our next question will come from matthew bouley with barclays. please go ahead.
matthew bouley -- barclays -- analyst
hey, good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions. so on the q3 revenue guide, obviously the prior commentary i think was for q3 revenue growth to be i think stronger than that of q2, and correct me if i'm wrong. obviously q2 came in stronger than the prior guide and you've been very clear that these labor shortages here are probably another piece, but obviously what i'm getting at is it kind of begs the question, if there is anything in the demand picture that is perhaps any less robust than what you were thinking three months ago. anything in diy or retail? just help, obviously you can clarify some of that commentary. thank you.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think it's a great question. our guidance is more based on the labor constraints that we see in the marketplace. the base market, the consumer demand through all of our channels continues to be very strong. we've got no concerns about changes that are there and i fully expect that. i think with the volume we have, we are moving through the peak part of the decking season that we will start to see some inventories build, but we're not seeing a fall-off in consumer demand from a growth perspective.
matthew bouley -- barclays -- analyst
okay. wonderful. thank you for that color. second one is, you continue to highlight the builder market is not the first time you've said something along those lines. i'm just curious as you're now again looking at additional capacity coming online. where do you see those opportunities? is it geographically, production builders, nationally versus custom builders. how do you kind of dip your toe into that market? thank you.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
i would say with the custom builders, we already have pretty decent relationships, because they tend to be the higher end homes that are already looking for composite decking. so i'd say this will be mostly focused on the production builders and showing the builders the case for them to earn a higher level of profitability and of course, less call-backs on a deck. most wood decks when their built are going to have a warranty call back within that first 12 months. so that small amount of additional costs that they're willing to put it and can then charge the customer for having a trex deck will offset their longer term risk for them. we see it as a great opportunity with the new capacity that we have and somewhat of a market that hasn't been tapped to the potential available.
matthew bouley -- barclays -- analyst
great. well, thank you for that color bryan. good luck.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer

and our next question will come from ketan mamtora with bmo capital. please go ahead.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital -- analyst
good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. maybe coming back to the discussion around inventory, can you give us some sense of where you think channel inventories are at this point? i know you've been trying to rebuild that. you think as you exit q3 you would have gotten to a point that you feel more comfortable with where they are?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
i think we will feel more comfortable, the question is to what degree of comfort that we'll feel at that point. inventories are not where we would like them to be in the channel or on our ground at this point. so we have some work to do to get everything back to a normalized environment.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital -- analyst
understood. and the other thing you also talked about in your release, sort of expanding on the international side. maybe talk a little bit about kind of where you see the most opportunity and how you see that kind of playing out over the next two, four years?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we've seen significant growth in the international markets this year as we've had the additional capacity available to serve. so everything with that strategy continues as we have expected. when we look out over the next four to five years, and we can supply everything that's needed, it's mostly going to be the larger markets with a higher gdp and an interest in outdoor living. we have distribution relationships already built in most of these economies and we're still really just very much in the first inning of opportunity in those marketplaces. so we're pretty excited about it as another opportunity for growth.
ketan mamtora -- bmo capital -- analyst
thank you.

and our next question will come from tim wojs with baird. please go ahead.
tim wojs -- baird -- analyst
hey guys, good afternoon.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
good evening. how are you?
tim wojs -- baird -- analyst
i'm good. thank you. maybe just thinking about 2022 at this point, any leading indicators, whether it's employing or website traffic or decks.com traffic that you could kind of site that gives you confidence into visibility around demand heading into next year?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i wouldn't say that we have necessarily anything within our own systems that indicate 2022 demand, but as we look at where the marketplace is, consumer confidence continues to be at a high level. there is still a lot of capital out in the marketplace. even though we've seen many of our consumers start moving to spending more money on travel, really hasn't impacted the spending on repair and remodel. so we expect a very robust repair and remodel moving into next year.
tim wojs -- baird -- analyst
okay. okay. and then when you think about price just mathematically given the realizations, will you actually have more price from the '21 increases next year than this year?
dennis c. schemm -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i would expect that we would, given that we will have a delayed impact of our august 1 price increase more hitting that september timeframe. so, yes, that's how i would see it.
tim wojs -- baird -- analyst
okay. okay, great. well good luck on the back half of the year guys. thanks for everything.
dennis c. schemm -- senior vice president and chief financial officer

and our next question will come from stanley elliott with stifel. please go ahead.
stanley elliott -- stifel -- analyst
hey, bryan, dennis, thank you guys for taking the question. as it relates to pricing in the back half, i mean, you've got the august price increase, is this impacting your thoughts around early order programs in terms of what you want to do there to get product out in the marketplace at higher price points?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we always look at our year-end program in relation to the inventories that are in the market, the capacity we have available to serve and the dynamics that are occurring as part of the general marketplace and with the consumer. that's something that our sales team spends a lot of time working on generally during the third quarter and that's the effort still to be completed here. so i think the answer is yes, because it's always part of the impact and how we look at pricing and it might -- how it might flow into those programs is something that will be considered.
stanley elliott -- stifel -- analyst
when we think about kind of margins returning 1q 2022 to kind of some of the more normal margins, more incrementals, is that really just the pricing kind of catching up. i'm curious how long it's going to take for some of these cost reduction programs, continuous improvement programs to roll through. is that going to be more of a benefit into the latter part of the year?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
i see, by then, we start moving through the noise of the capacity expansion that we've been experiencing over the last year. so we won't have the start-up costs moving into beginning of next year. we will see some of these cost improvement programs that we're going after come into play. and then of course there will be the pricing that dennis talked about.
stanley elliott -- stifel -- analyst
great, guys. thank you very much and best of luck.

and our next question will come from trey grooms with stephens inc. please go ahead.
trey grooms -- stephens inc -- analyst
hey, bryan and dennis. hope you're all doing well?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
great, thanks trey.
trey grooms -- stephens inc -- analyst
so just touching on the cost improvement initiatives. you talked about just a minute ago, and you kind of lined out or laid out, excuse me, focus on automation, energy efficiency, raw material processing, is there any way to maybe help us understand what the impact here could be. i know this is something you guys are continuously going after. so will this be a step function and any comments you could give us on the timing there?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
the size of the trex company is very different from where we were five years ago. i see this as a continuous improvement where we will get back to having a pipeline of projects that will drive cost savings to the organization and they will come in over the course of the year.
trey grooms -- stephens inc -- analyst
okay. the course of '22 primarily?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we'll start to see them coming in, in the back half of this year. now that we're through capacity and that additional into next year and more of that cost saving benefits as we will have a full year of anything that comes in this year.
trey grooms -- stephens inc -- analyst
perfect, perfect. thank you for that. and then on the labor constraints. i know we've touched on several times on the call, but -- and i know you guys are seeing some of it. you mentioned that, but as you look across, is it -- is this more than just on your side or this also some labor constraints in the channel, or at the installer level or just across the board as far as labor goes? and are you hearing if it is, outside of just you guys, so i assume it is probably. are you hearing any improvement out there outside of just trex only, but further out into the channel?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
so labor constraints have impacted our suppliers, our raw material. we've been able to work through that having appropriate level of safety stocks on the ground. the same labor impacts have impacted our contractors, where if they can put additional crews on, they absolutely would to try to reduce their time to the marketplace, but it's very difficult to find those individuals and then train them to appropriately build a deck.
as i get out and talk with the folks in our selling channel, same issues there. it's just very difficult to bring new people in and many cases they've got longtime employees that really know the business very well. there hasn't been turnover from that perspective, but bringing new individuals in to manage the growth has been a challenge.
trey grooms -- stephens inc -- analyst
yes. all right understand. i'll leave it there. thanks guys and good luck.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
thanks trey.

and our next question will come from phil ng with jefferies. please go ahead.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, guys. i guess a question for dennis. you mentioned -- first of all you guys saw a really good sg&a leverage in the quarter. so curious from a ebitda margin standpoint, when do you expect ebitda margins to inflect positively? was it tied to that 1q timeframe as well dennis?
dennis c. schemm -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, it will start to pick up here more in the latter half of the year for sure. and then it will follow suit of course, with the gross margin improvement. so you'll continue to see this leverage story play out in a very significant way. i think we have that near term and longer term in play, right. so near term, we're going to see more of a normal spending pattern for sg&a right. so medical is coming back. we have travel and entertainment coming back. we're reinvesting in the brand, all of which we pulled back in 2020. then longer term as we move into 2021, you're going to see that leverage story really start to play out, because we don't have to advertise and brand as much or enhance and as enhance becomes a greater part of our product mix, then that leverage really starts to take off.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. okay, that's helpful. and then a question for you, bryan. so in the comments you were talking about in terms of expanding into the new construction side and international with the capacity freeing up. any wins that you could call out on the production builder side. you don't have to give me the company but any noticable wins and then to kind of really drive growth here, are you making any real investments, whether it's on the sales force side or anything else that we should be mindful of?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
well, from an investment perspective, yes, we're making investments in a number of different areas within the organization, including sales, and specifically on the new builder side. as it relates to specific wins that are out there, probably a bit too early to get into that discussion, because we need to make sure that our channels are filled with products. so discussions are being had at this point, that's really at the early stage of it and as we begin to fill that channel and get back to more normalized operating parameters, i think we'll be in a good shape to be able to talk about some of those contract wins.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
is it going to be noticable enough that we'll see it in on the volume side in a noticable fashion, call it like back half of next year or is going to be really more of a 2023 event?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
difficult to say right now. i'm not sure that that initiative on its own, i'll be in a position to call out here is what the specific growth from it. we'll understand as it comes into the -- our sales opportunities along the way, but we'll have to wait as we look at what next year's growth opportunities are and where we stand on inventories coming into the end of the year that will really be a key determinant.
phil ng -- jefferies -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.

and our next question will come from reuben garner with the benchmark company. please go ahead.
reuben garner -- the benchmark company -- analyst
thanks. good evening, bryan and dennis.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
hey, reuben.
reuben garner -- the benchmark company -- analyst
most of my questions have been answered. i just have a follow-up on the sg&a front. dennis, you mentioned expenses normalize in q2. i think historically, it's been kind of a high watermark for sg&a dollars. are you guys still kind of ramping some of the marketing costs and travel and other things that were taken out temporarily last year and that $36 million roughly that you spent in q2 might not be the high watermark for the year as a result?
dennis c. schemm -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so what we saw, last year, we had about what $29 million in sg&a, we ramped it to $6 million here in q2. so $7 million pick-up. i think it's a pretty high watermark for us yet, i still think we're going to see a little more spend here in q3 just because there will be more travel. there is we're predicting a little bit more medical and some branding as well. so i would expect things to be normalized to rate around this level. i don't think it's going to be much higher.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
i think as you look out at next year, the percentages by quarter will probably normalize if you go back to pre-pandemic timeframe. we get back to having builder show. we get back to normal advertise timing. we get back to having distributor meetings. normal travel and entertainment from our sales team. so i expect next year to look like a much more normalized environment, whereas this year we still have the impacts from the pandemic, some things of which we're spending on, other things we're not spending as much on. but that will build as we go through the year and then normalize for next year.
reuben garner -- the benchmark company -- analyst
perfect. thank you, guys. and congrats on the results. good luck.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer

[operator instructions] our next question will come from alex rygiel with b. riley fbr. please go ahead.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr -- analyst
thank you. bryan, can you comment on the significant volatility in lumber prices broadly and how that sort of helped demand and how it might change demand as lumber prices pulled back here? and then can you also comment on the higher end wood product sort of marketplace that you compete with and what pricing looks like and availability looks like there as a lot of that product is sourced internationally?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
okay, so for the standard lumber business, of course, the future shot up earlier this year. all of those, while the futures have come back down again, the actual prices in the marketplace have not returned back to those same level. let's call it about $0.80, $0.85 a linear foot for lumber. so it definitely has been a help in this marketplace as people come in and understand that i could spend $1.60 on buying a piece of lumber. i can spend $1.60 a foot and by trex or maybe $2.50 and move up to the enhanced product. so it's been a bit of a tailwind for us. as we look out over the longer term, i don't expect lumber from a retail perspective to drop back down to that $0.85 again. so there will be a tightened spread between our pricing and where lumber is, and we'll continue to pursue the same marketing strategy that we have for the past few years, converting those lumber buyers at roughly a 2 times price premium to move up to trex.
as it relates to the higher end part of the marketplace. i'm not as familiar with the pricing out there in visiting a few dealers earlier this month, i think noted a couple of the species are very difficult to get because they are coming internationally. in some cases they are coming from in endangered rainforests. so it's more and more difficult to be able to get those types of materials. and those consumers often now are looking to do the right thing environmentally and moving over to our trex transcend high product is a pretty easy sale for the dealer or the contractor to make. and our product tends to be easier to work with than some of the hardwood -- the exotic hardwoods as well.
alex rygiel -- b. riley fbr -- analyst

kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great, thanks and good afternoon bryan and dennis.
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
good afternoon.
dennis c. schemm -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good afternoon.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
i guess, ignoring the labor constraints and the channel inventory for a minute, it does seem like you're in a pretty good place relative to the rest of the industry in terms of having incremental capacity to respond to demand. i'm just curious if that plays into your messaging or sales strategy with your channel partners and whether you think that's something that can be a transitory or more lasting advantage in terms of market share?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
we expect that the capacity that we put on and we'll continue to add through the end of this year will give us an advantage. and i expect over time we will need additional capacity. last, we talked, i think we said this gives us a couple of years of capacity. if the market continues growing at this level, it will probably be a little bit shorter of time, but these are regular discussions that the management team has with each other as well as our board of directors and we'll ensure that we stay ahead of the market.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. okay. that makes sense. and then just going back to the inflation topic. i guess on recycled films specifically, in the past, i think that was pretty correlated with virgin resin prices for the last couple of years, it's coupled. are we back to the point where those two are moving in the same direction again and any color you could provide in terms of expectations for pricing there?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yes, it's -- so the answer is yes and no. there is more correlation than there has been over the past few years. past few years, the two markets were completely separate. as we've seen the virgin marketplace go over a $1 a pound, we have seen some correlation creep back into the market. we've seen some of the recycled materials price increase has been in the mid-teens type level on a year-over-year basis. so when we talked about increasing costs in the third quarter, i think that's something that we'll continue to see. historically, generally the recycled market tends to move six to nine months after the virgin marketplace and that's basically what we're seeing at this point.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. and just one more quickly. i mean is that something where as you consume more recycled material and perhaps has to move out further, you would expect pricing generally to increase or do you think you can offset that by expanding some of these lower quality materials that otherwise wouldn't have a home?
bryan h. fairbanks -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think we'll be able to expand the uses of material and some of these lower priced opportunities that are not being taken advantage of today in the marketplace. so we talked, i guess it was the end of last year coming into this year, that we were going to be going further for that material. and with that comes additional logistics cost. so we'll continue to see that as we move through this year and into next.
kurt yinger -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it, ok. well appreciate all the color. and good luck in the back half.
