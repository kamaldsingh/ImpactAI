thank you very much, sir. ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question is from the line of nitin padmanabhan from investec. please go ahead.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec india -- analyst
yeah. hi, good evening, and thanks for taking my questions. so first, i just wanted your thoughts on the price cuts, the cut in discretionary and extended payment terms. now, if you could just give some clarity there in terms of, one, what proportion of clients do you think will end up asking for such concessions? and do you think these concessions are even on a price cut basis is it very temporary? two, is there any vertical specific cuts where you think it's more sort of prevalent? and finally, do you think something like an ims also will bear those price cuts, if it were to occur?
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
so, nitin, we are seeing both -- there are certain verticals and certain organizations in those verticals who have a fundamental question mark on the business model and there, we are seeing a relatively more permanent impact i believe, but a lot of requests we are getting is near-term postponement or deferment of discretionary spend. and on the run side of the business, obviously, we see both requests coming in for higher efficiency, which does result into a lower revenue, but also there are opportunities that we see along with that of certain level of consolidation that we would look forward to.
infrastructure business or ims that you referred to is, a large amount of it is cloud work that we do. and we are seeing an accelerated movement to the cloud because it enables not only efficiency, but it also enables better working from home and virtual working in this new normal, and that is why while we will see some pressure on the run side of the infrastructure business, we see equal amount of opportunity both on the back-end modernization, automation, cloud, etc., as well as on the front-end of enabling -- we have our own ip called virtuadesk, a very strong offering around vdi and enabling virtual desktops. and we are already seeing good traction as customers adjust to this new normal by investing in collaborative tools and collaborative working across that -- from the ims will benefit.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec india -- analyst
sure. but would you be able to characterize what proportion of the clients are actually asking for steep cuts. is it a large proportion of clients at this point in time, more than half or something or how should we think about it?
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
so the way i would think about it is, there are ongoing conversations with a lot of clients. in some cases, we are also being proactive. we are very close to our customers. we see opportunities that have always existed. and there is an element of acceleration of those opportunities that we can bring, which would obviously reduce cost for the customers, but at the same time, could be revenue opportunities for us. it would be very difficult to quantify what percentage of clients are asking for this, but there is a small percentage, which have come upfront from verticals that have been very severely impacted that i talked about retail, travel and hospitality, oil and gas, the auto segment within manufacturing and others, but we see opportunities that we are going proactively with the offerings that we have, which are very specific to this covid crisis and from our experience from past recessions that could be leveraged in an environment like this.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec india -- analyst
so if we look at gfc and look at things now, do you -- how would you characterize the difference in terms of what clients are seeing in terms of impact? do you think that it is -- what you're seeing now with a little worse than gfc because everyone is impacted versus these specific sectors, then how would you characterize it?
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
so it is as bad, if not worse than gfc, but we are still very early. and so, the focus in the last three weeks or so, if you take mid-march as when really across the two main geographies, europe and us from a demand side and india from a supply side got impacted. right now, the focus of our customers and our own focus has been primarily to get up and running and business continuity. some of these conversations are just getting started as the second phase of managing the crisis. so i would say it's a little early on that to say whether it is going to be -- how -- what it is going to be compared to the global crisis.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec india -- analyst
great. thank you so much. and all the very best.
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the next question is from the line of mukul garg from haitong securities. please go ahead.
mukul garg -- haitong securities india private ltd -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. i just wanted to follow up from the previous question on discounts. we have heard from industry participants that clients in specific cases are up for discounts up to 50% of an existing rate card. can you give us a sense of what type of discounts are you seeing from a margin point of view? and are they at least as of now primarily focused on q1, or is that something which is lower to q2 or q3 as well?
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so -- hi, mukul. this is jatin. yes, there is certainly a significant pressure on price. i think what has changed from gfc times is that a large portion of our business has now become fixed price. so while immediately we can, we will certainly have to take certain reduction in terms of both the top line as well as profitability, but when you are able to lock in a business on a fixed price basis for, let's say, three-year, four-year time frame, you are higher confidence of working through your automation plans, your pyramid, your offshore -- onsite/offshore mix to be able to get some of those productivity benefit back into margin at a later point in time.
i won't comment specifically on the quantum of margins. i think there is also one big realization, if i may put it, in the market about the quality players, which -- for which customer would be willing to sort of stay with and not just go on price, and i think wipro has done well vis-a-vis responding very swiftly to our client requirements. we were, i think, first of the block vis-a-vis how we responded to some of the work-from-home requirement and that i think is also a source of us to be able to stay in a portfolio on the strength of that execution.
mukul garg -- haitong securities india private ltd -- analyst
understood. and jatin, in terms of duration, current conversation are mostly q1 constrained or people are -- people have started looking at a slightly longer term as well in discounts discussion?
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so these are -- i would answer it in two parts. number one is whenever a crisis like that this happens, the reaction of the customer is here and now in this year. so that is part one. but i also believe that right now even customers are thinking through their strategies for rest of the year or next year, so some of this conversation are just beginning and they will evolve over a course of this quarter and probably early part of next quarter. and we will have to stay with those, remain resilient and make sure that whatever we are doing is in the interest of the relationship that we have with customer over a period of time and what we can further build on that over future period.
so it's not a 15, 20-day, 30-day phenomena where everybody is coming to you and then you decide and then, the -- you are back to a normal work as usual. this is going to unfold i think as we see various parts of the world coming back to the business and various parts of the industries reflecting upon their own economic prospects for 2020 and 2021.
mukul garg -- haitong securities india private ltd -- analyst
got it. and if i may just get one more question. and abid, while we all understand that the visibility on the business is quite low and hence guidance is difficult, but can you give us a sense of the impact on individual sectors, especially on the energy and bfsi side, what sort of hits you are seeing, especially as you mentioned during prepared remarks that you are expecting a decline this quarter?
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
so as i mentioned in my remarks, definitely the aviation sector, both airlines and airports, the overall travel and hospitality sector, oil and gas due to the oil price, retail, a lot of retailers except food and grocery has almost shutdown their stores. and they are having a huge impact. the auto sector, especially in manufacturing where not only the demand side, but also the supply chain has been adversely impacted or i would call as high impact verticals.
on the other hand, some of the other verticals like communications where the surge in the use of bandwidth, surge in entertainment and media segments in terms of consumption of their services, yes -- in utilities, for example, we are not seeing a major change. in banking, we are seeing both tightening of the bells and primarily driven as all of you are in that same industry by interest rates and volatility that is seen. on the other hand because of the quick response of various governments on the fiscal stimulus, there is also a positive impact on the banking industry where they will see more activity around refinancing, originations of loans and grants enabled by the ppp equivalent programs across jurisdictions and so and so forth. on logistics, we have few logistics customers where there is a new paradigm of supply chain management in logistics. there, we are seeing some traction.
so more important than just the sectors alone, we are staying very close to each customer organization, enterprise and customizing our interactions and offerings and strategy to the strategies that these individual organizations are adopting in their context to be able to make the most out of it. obviously, the ability to quantify at this point in time is very difficult; otherwise, we would have guided because a lot of things are in flux right now, but hope the color i gave you helps you with the sector-wise feel that we are getting.
obviously, the healthcare, medical devices, life sciences, where we have a lot of strength has both kind of impacts, there are -- because we are enabling a lot of hospitals. we are enabling a lot of our customers in the ecosystem to be able to provide covid-related services. we've ourselves invested a lot directly in -- and for example, design of a new ventilator, which is more of a prototype design, but a lot of that expertise should be leveraged; analytics-based solutions around predicting and developing models and so on and so forth, but also on the other hand, a lot of the hospitals as they're prepared to take care of the covid impact, a lot of the elective surgeries and elective procedures have been put on hold.
so if you compare from a normal occupancy of a hospital versus what they are occupied today, actually, they are less occupied in most -- just if i take us, for example, let's say for a new york or a hotspot in most other places, the hospitals are running at lower occupancy and that has a cascading effect on their financials and it spend and how we service them. so at this point in time, i would say there are a lot of moving parts and quantification of that would be quite difficult.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of moshe katri from wedbush securities. please go ahead.
moshe katri -- wedbush securities -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my question. my question is more kind of maybe broad-based. what is management planning to do in terms of balancing on one hand protecting your revenues versus protecting your margin base? what sort of trade-offs are you willing to take? and then, in that context, obviously if demand does slow down, what happens to your bench? what sort of utilization rates are willing -- are you willing to kind of sacrifice in order to kind of preserve your bench at this point? thank you very much.
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
so, moshe, great question and i will take the help of a few of my colleagues in answering this, but from a wipro perspective as you would expect any reputed organization to do, very quickly we formed three teams within the organization, led by my cxos. so the first team that was formed was on the crisis -- managing the crisis itself and providing business continuity and that was led by bhanu supported by a ton of people in the organization. the second thing we formed under jatin, which has all of our presidents of our business units, which is looking at the opportunities that come out both here and now, as well as in the future and how do we from a customer perspective address those opportunities and i ask jatin to give a little more color to the activities that has -- that team has been undergoing.
and the third team has been formed under saurabh, which looks at cost overall, but also employee policies that are more empathetic in this crisis for our employees globally as well as opportunities that we need to look at for driving efficiency and the entire talent engineering area, as well as the corporate social responsibility as a responsible corporate citizen that we would do in times like these are all headed by saurabh. so i will ask both jatin and saurabh to give a little more color to you on a little more specifics of what we are trying to do to answer your question, moshe.
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
so moshe, i think one of the positive aspects about a crisis like this is that it resets the table in terms of what we can do for your consumer. and one of the key focus areas for wipro through this is really how do we emerge out stronger. and i'll tell you some of the fulcrums on which these changes are taking place. number one is, for example, some of the constraints in our business, which meant that you must have. in most places, you must get a person to a work or get work to a person. and this was fixed places either in your odcs in india or work locations of customers overseas. that paradigm is completely shifted. so assuming you have 100% agility, you should be able to theoretically capture every possible demand that is out there to be captured.
the number two is that the models of engagement from customer is changing and in a distributed environment like this, where customer wants an optimal outcome, your ability to provide reliable -- robust response and reliable, robust outcomes to the customer matter a lot more than working in a silo within an organization of our customer for some specific skill that we could provide. so you're -- the character of an organization comes in as a big differentiation in this case. so we are looking at fundamentally what we could do in times like this from market offering standpoint and from our ability to respond very swiftly to customers requirement. for example, we have spoken for some time about our additional investments and emphasis on what we call as big bets and two of those big bets were really cloud and cybersecurity. and i don't think there is ever -- there has ever been a better time to be a market leader in these two areas than today.
so we are working through horizontal offerings, some of which abid spoke about in his opening address where we very swiftly responded to customer requirement as well as domain specific, be it banking or energy and utilities, which we could very quickly take to our customers. and one very -- i would say one very emphasized aspect of our response to this crisis is how do we emerge stronger. i'll request saurabh to talk about some of the cost actions.
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
thanks, jatin. then moshe, to your question, how do we -- our premise has -- will be -- is rather that we manage the cost implications in the short term, but are equipped to move with agility as and when the demand picks up, and that's the way we are looking at our entire supply chain in terms of how do we look at hiring, how do we look at bench, how do we manage people, including how do we have -- how do we look at subcontracting, how we could we make sure we deploy our people given the rear view of bench happening. so all these moving different parts of the supply chain will be the levers for us to ensure that in the short term, given the impact, we should manage the cost, but as and when things stabilize, we are quickly in a position to come back, and that's been the intent in terms of going deep on this one.
moshe katri -- wedbush securities -- analyst
understood. thanks for the color. be safe.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of ankur rudra from jpmorgan. please go ahead.
ankur rudra -- jpmorgan india pvt ltd -- analyst
[technical issues].
operator
excuse me, this is the operator. i'm sorry to interrupt. mr. rudra, your voice is breaking.
ankur rudra -- jpmorgan india pvt ltd -- analyst
is it clearer now?
operator
yes, better. thank you.
ankur rudra -- jpmorgan india pvt ltd -- analyst
okay. thanks for taking my question. so question is if you look back at the previous crisis that you face, including gfc and the other ones, what are the main learnings you can take away from that play differently this time in terms of all the balances between revenue optimization versus cost optimization?
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
so, ankur, when we compare ourselves having navigated the crisis, the two most important things are number one in a crisis, there is a race toward quality, partners or providers that the customer trusts. and today, if you look at our customer satisfaction, it is at an all-time high. we just completed our annual customer survey and our customer scores are over 90% on customer rating and over 66% on npls. second is everything that we did in the first two or three weeks of crisis management, we've received a lot of appreciation from our customers of not only enabling the wipro services to work from home, but in some cases, even helping the customers' own employees as well as their vendors who were struggling to enable business continuity for the customer. and all of that gives us the right to claim being close to the customer and having the customers' trust. so that is one aspect.
as i said, there are two aspects. the second aspect of that is having relevant offerings. and i think jatin alluded to this earlier in his response to moshe. the investments that we've made over the last few years around digital, around cloud, around cybersecurity in consulting is very relevant because it requires a lot of organization change management, consultative, proactive propositions to be taken to the customer.
all the investments we've made in client mining and our mega gama accounts in terms of client teams, so that we are contextualized, we are relevant, we are aligned to the customer strategy as we take these offerings that are market leading. we've got leadership position in over a 100 of the 150 analyst reports that we participate, which talks to the strength of our offerings that combined with the investment that we've made in client teams will be able to make them contextualize and relevant to our customers, including the investments in intellectual property, especially around forms and some of the automation, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity platforms, data analytics platform that we have invested in are all very valuable top order, which is the crowdsourcing platform, which is a very amenable to the new ways of working. so we have the strength of our offerings. we have the strength of client relationships, which are both important to be able to do that.
and one of the things that we are very fortunate about and we've been working on it as well is the quality of our balance sheet to be able to help customers in this time of crisis. as you know, we've got significant cash available on our balance sheet. we've worked on the quality of our revenues, whether it is unbilled revenues, whether it is our pbbs [phonetic], etc., which have -- that give us a lot of confidence on our own internal strength to be able to structure deals with customers that beneficial to them for the long term and provide us a competitive advantage as we work on those. so all of this kind of put together, i would say, whether you call it learnings or best practices of coming out as winner based on the experience of the past crisis that we have all seen.
ankur rudra -- jpmorgan india pvt ltd -- analyst
thank you. very helpful. any particular insights on the workforce side, which may be different from last time?
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
saurabh?
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
workforce management side, it's basically the levers that i've called out in terms of -- sorry -- yeah, sorry, the impact from a workforce insights, which we have on gfc is that i think the only point i called out earlier is that how we are in a position to take actions, which are fast and required here and now, however, enables us to be agile to come back quickly. i think that's the biggest learning from a workforce side of it. that's what we have seen. you want to add something abid?
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
i was -- just to give an example, saurabh talk about the enablement of work from home in terms of the managers and the reskilling acceleration that we are doing. i think the question was more around ankur wanted some examples.
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
yeah. so as abid alluded to, this has -- this pandemic also pushed the boundary, which we have never expected, so 93% of the workforce enable to work from home, all managers are able to do it on daily calls with stay connected, things which we are not done, example, very clearly is doing a book closing or recurring results, which were planned and going out with them, all these very clearly are pushing the boundaries for us, which have not happen. so that is one.
the second one, that is reskilling, so that'll be another part in terms of how people were coming off to the bench as different volumes are happening and different ramp-downs and ramp-ups are happening, how do we equip them to move for the newer ways. so i think that's another one. and having a topcoder platform and a top gear platform for us is another opportunity for us to train people and make them ready. so the nimbleness for us to make our workforce ready as and when the demand comes will become the key. and all our actions and activities will be focused toward that during this period. that's the focus as we move forward.
ankur rudra -- jpmorgan india pvt ltd -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of parag gupta from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
parag gupta -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good evening, everyone. so abid, the question that i had for you is that you did mention that some of the clients you have, especially in the three to four verticals that you talked about are seeing significant challenges because obviously, there the first order of impact is much higher. i just wanted to understand how much of the impact on these customers in your view is temporary and how much of it could be permanent. so, i'm just basically thinking of -- are you seeing any of your customers who are running the risk of potential bankruptcies, which in this case may not be just a temporary impact on your business, but actually could be permanent loss of revenues. so, if i could just get some sense on that from you. and then, i'll ask my second question after that.
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
so, parag, we have srini pallia who is the president of our consumer business unit, which has seen the earlier brunt of this. so, i'll ask him to give you some color on it. and then it could be followed by angan who heads our banking and financial services business to give you a little more color in terms of what he sees in those two verticals -- what both of them are seeing in those two verticals.
srini pallia -- president of consumer business unit
thanks. hi, parag. srini pallia here. like i think abid mentioned that retail, travel and hospitality industries had a significant impact. those are the industries that are part of the consumer business unit. now, if you look at the specific segments within that, which are hardest hit includes the apparel and fashion retailers, the home improvement retailers, specialty retailers and, of course, airlines and restaurants and food chains. now, if you look at the analyst reports, they say that some of these retailers and departmental stores may shut stop for the next six months as well, right? so what we saw initially post-covid is there was hyper demand for grocer, which we expect to normalize in a month's time.
and again, across the board, there's a significant pent-up demand for online commerce and also automation that abid talked about. so to us, at this point in time, the way we see it as retailers are looking at our help, especially ideas around last-mile inventory, last-mile delivery inventory and omni-channel side. so at this point in time, the visibility that we have within some of our customers are they've stalled the transformation programs. they put a hold on discretionary projects and thereby, there's a reduction in developmental work, especially on projects. so if you were to look at a crystal ball and look at what could happen...
[technical issues]
operator
participants, the line from mr. srini pallia has dropped. please take an interim while we reconnect him.
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
angan, do you want to go in the meantime?
angan guha -- senior vice president & global head of the bfsi business unit
yes, yes. abid, thank you. so, parag, from a financial services standpoint and i think abid as well as jatin mentioned this earlier, see the interest rates are probably be almost heading to zero and also could be negative. so that, obviously, has an impact apart from the covid situation. so in the medium term, i've seen a lot of discretionary spend getting stalled at this point in time. so there is obviously an impact in the medium term. but equally, just like abid said, i think, there is a big opportunity in terms of vendor consolidation, in terms of working on the run side, there can be enormous opportunity.
so from our perspective, while the future is very uncertain and it's difficult to predict, we are staying close to our clients. we are working with our clients very, very closely. we are making sure that we deliver to all the slas that we have signed up for. we've been fairly successful, and we will continue to do that. so we will keep the long-term client and our employee interest in mind in whatever we do, parag.
parag gupta -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you. i'm just assuming that srini is not back on. so i'll just go ahead with my...
srini pallia -- president of consumer business unit
yes. sorry, i'm back. i don't know for some reason. i don't know where you last heard me.
parag gupta -- morgan stanley -- analyst
you basically talked about omni-channel and last mile is where retailers are asking for your help and they are holding discretionary spend. so that's where we lost you after that.
srini pallia -- president of consumer business unit
okay. so, parag, at this point in time, we are still working with our customers in some of the new ways, which are typically driven by covid-19, essentially around curbside pickup that i was talking about, which helps shoppers to collect the merchandise from store associates. there are some engagements where we are helping our customers around store traffic and social distancing through video analytics. a lot of customers, obviously, they have -- they want to liquidate the inventory post-covid. adaptive pricing and dynamic pricing becomes very important from a competitor benchmarking perspective, and also home delivery for those retailers who have been not full-fledged on e-commerce or omni-channel. so these are the areas that we are focusing on. so we will -- we think that, while the overall it spend will come down, but there will be key niche areas that the retailers will help -- that will need help and that's where we continue to invest our time and effort, if you will.
parag gupta -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. thank you very much. and, abid, my second question was for you. i guess, for wipro, you were basically now looking at two potential headwinds. one is the headwind of covid and how that flows through. and the second is, obviously, the fact that you have decided to move on does create some amount of vacuum at the top level. is there any change in views? and how -- or to put it differently, is there anything that we should be keeping in mind as to how wipro can manage these turbulent times, especially with you also potentially moving on at some point in time? thank you.
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
so, parag, i will let saurabh give a little bit of an update on the ceo succession, as he's been doing it very closely with the board. but i wouldn't classify that as a headwind. the company that i leave i feel very confident. i talked about our customer satisfaction, which is at a highest level, our offerings where we have our top leadership position and recognized by the stakeholders, intellectual property, our strong balance sheet, a very strong leadership team and energized sales force and the customers.
so i feel quite good in terms of a strong foundation, which i'm leaving behind. and a testimony of that is that we announced my stepping down on january 31. and while covid was somewhere a small spec in the background, it was obviously not what it is today. and we spent from middle of february to middle of march, as i articulated, preparing for it as we started first seeing it in china and then, we started preparing for it and executed quite well in march.
as i promised on the request of our chairman and the board that i would continue till my successor is announced and onboard and continue business as usual. and i think the whole crisis management has proven that. the credit goes more to the team, which made it happen, because we have a deep leadership bench; we have a great team leading this organization. so i would definitely not classify it as a headwind. if anything, it is an opportunity for bringing in fresh ideas and thinking afresh in a new normal that we are going to land ourselves in a few weeks from now. saurabh, do you want to give an update on the succession process?
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
yeah, parag. so as abid said 31st january, we have announced and board along with the governance committee and the nominations committee is working. we are well on track to -- on the process. it's moving extremely well in the entire process. it's got -- it's not got impacted by the pandemic in any way. and we should be in a position to announce our new ceo in this quarter. so it's very much on track there. but as abid said, he is very much there till the new ceo comes. so it's all business as usual for us.
parag gupta -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. thank you very much and all the best. thank you.
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
thank you.
operator
the next question is from the line of diviya nagarajan from ubs. please go ahead.
diviya nagarajan -- ubs securities (asia) ltd -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. and i think quite a few of my questions have already been discussed here. but just one follow-up on what you've talked about as what you're doing for customers right now in terms of enabling work from home. could you kind of run us through what kind of project sizes and opportunity that really is? so you talked of for instance enabling like soft teams is one of your customers. what are the kind of project sizes and durations you're looking at here? and what kind of a potential opportunity could this be as more customers try and implement these in the next several months?
bhanumurthy b. m. -- president and chief operating officer
so diviya, this is bhanu here. i will try to take this question. so we are looking at two, three different kinds of opportunity as we enable our customers through this process right now. the first, like you mentioned is to get the customers enabled for their organization to work from home and operating the new methods. if i look at for example within our own organization, for example, our chat messages between our employees has increased by about 47%. our collaboration minutes have gone up by 26%. our usage of collaboration tools with respect to users has gone up by about 21%. so we see organizations trending significantly toward these virtual collaboration tools.
so one of the things that we are doing for a lot of our customers is to quickly enable them to utilize these collaboration tools and make the work from home very effective for them. so that's the first kind of thing. and associated with that is all the cybersecurity capability that need to go with it, right? so that's the first set of activity.
the second set of activity is to help them with respect to the new opportunities that are coming in the short term because of the covid crisis. abid alluded to some examples of how organizations are trying to introduce products to take care of -- to take advantage of the fiscal stimulus that is being done in some of the countries. similarly, there are organizations, for example, which are supplying to, let's say, nursing homes. and with all the lockdowns that are there in play right now, you need to help in terms of optimizing algorithms in terms of finding the right routes and so on and so forth, right? so there are multiple short-term opportunities that are coming. there are organizations, which are looking at faster planning of their supply chains and so on. so lot of short-term opportunities of that type.
then, there are third set of opportunities that are coming in terms of organizations looking post-covid how would they look like. for example, a lot of conversations about how the supply chain visibility and predictability should be there? what are the supply chain dependencies that the organization has and how would they want to go forward and address those supply chain dependencies?
there are questions about how much of process automation should be done, how much of the current work that is being done through our digital operations and platforms organization, how much more automation can be done in those areas, right? there are lot of questions around -- there are lot of conversations around, what kind of new digital migrations can happen, right?
obviously, all organizations have understood right now that migrating to cloud is one of the best things that has happened for them. those organizations that have moved to cloud, they have been able to respond to this very well. and so, those conversations about hey, how do i go long term into, what should my architectures look like, right? so we are looking at all the three sets of opportunities right now. obviously, opportunity sizes do vary depending upon the depth of the organization and how widespread or how geographically spread that organization is.
operator
ms. nagarajan, do you have any further questions?
diviya nagarajan -- ubs securities (asia) ltd -- analyst
yeah. just a follow-up on that. would you -- would it be fair to characterize the first two opportunity sets as being typically smaller-sized projects because you did talk about them being more short term and the third set of projects being much more longer term?
bhanumurthy b. m. -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. so the time line wise, that is correct. but the first opportunity itself for example making organizations to enable to go them work from home, there could be some of the larger opportunities as well in that depending upon the size of the organization and how ready they are right now.
diviya nagarajan -- ubs securities (asia) ltd -- analyst
fair enough. and i think one follow-up if i may that nasscom seems to have started lobbying for the government to allow furloughs in the it services industry. is that something that you would consider if it comes to -- i think you've talked about tremendous need to control costs, but would that be on the cards as one of the cost control opportunities?
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
saurabh here, absolutely. i think we are right now all options on the card and furloughs is very much on the card. it is a flexible option and it helps us to come back quickly. so very much, we will explore across all the countries possible.
diviya nagarajan -- ubs securities (asia) ltd -- analyst
thanks. and all the very best for the year.
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
thanks, diviya.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of pankaj kapoor from jm financial. please go ahead.
pankaj kapoor -- jm financial institutional securities ltd -- analyst
yeah, hi. thanks for the opportunity. so my first question is on the guidance suspension. i was just wondering is it more because of relatively speaking uncertainty on the volume side or you're unable to look at the kind of a pricing pressure that can come in, which is leading to this decision?
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
jatin?
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. no. i think the -- we articulated the key reason behind guidance is the fluidity of the situation. i wouldn't characterize it any other way. if we could size any angle of it and we were still -- would be able to provide, then we would have provided the guidance.
pankaj kapoor -- jm financial institutional securities ltd -- analyst
i understand jatin. i'm just trying to figure out whether there is lack of visibility in terms of customer demand for pricing only. so, i'm just trying to understand that whether the volume can continue. it is just that the clients are coming to ask for pricing cuts and which we are unable to predict, or is it that the people are more uncertain about the work itself, so that there is a possibility of volume also contracting?
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. it is both actually where people are reprioritizing where they want to spend, whether they want to spend and when they want to spend. and then of course, the pricing also comes into the play. so, uncertainty is on both the axes.
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
and there is one more axis right now, which we think is temporary, but the temporary could extend till the lockdowns and shelter at home extent is the ability to do certain type of work from home, which is about right now in our case about 7% of the work.
pankaj kapoor -- jm financial institutional securities ltd -- analyst
got it. and jatin, the second question is on your ability to manage the cost in this time. so, you highlighted some of the pressures that you are facing and you also highlighted some of the levers that you may want to use. as a net-net impact of all that, any sense, which you can give in terms of whether we are able to manage margin in a narrow band, or do you think that margin in the near term could come under significant pressure?
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, we will -- based on the visibility that we have as less as it is, we are going to definitely go all out on the costs, pankaj. but since the revenue side of equation is fluid, one is not sure how well those two will marry. i think we should go back and see global financial crisis and see some of the margin behaviors. that's how we are looking at it to learn from past. but our endeavor, of course, is to drop as less as possible. but these are uncertain times pankaj. so, this is not normal where i can feel comfortable about a range or narrowness of that range kind of a position.
pankaj kapoor -- jm financial institutional securities ltd -- analyst
thank you.

ladies and gentlemen, good day, and welcome to the wipro limited q4 fy '20 quarterly investor conference call. as a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode. and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. [operator instructions]
i now hand the conference over to mrs. aparna iyer, vice president and corporate treasurer. thank you, and over to you.
aparna iyer -- vice president and corporate treasurer
thank you, stanford. warm welcome to our q4 fy '20 earnings call. we will begin the call with the business highlights and overview by abid, our chief executive officer and managing director, followed by a financial overview by our cfo, jatin dalal. afterwards, the operator will open the bridge for q&a with our management team.
before abid starts, let me draw your attention to the fact that during this call, we may make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reforms act 1995. these statements are based on management's current expectations and are associated with uncertainties and risks, which may cause the actual results to materially differ from those expected. the uncertainties and risk factors are explained in our detailed filings with the sec. wipro does not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect the events and circumstances after the date of filing. the conference call will be archived, and a transcript will be made available on our website.
over to you, abid.
abidali z. neemuchwala -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you, aparna. and good evening and good morning ladies and gentlemen. i'm joined by my entire executive committee that is the wipro's senior leadership team virtually today, as we practice social distancing and have adopted ourselves to the new normal of working as a leadership team. we will share with you the results for the fourth quarter and full-year performance for the fiscal year 2020. but before i do that, i want to thank the leadership team, all of the 180,000-plus wiproites globally, our customers and our partners for their untiring efforts and perseverance as we transformed ourselves into this new normal and enabling us for delivering on our commitments to all our stakeholders. this as all of us know are unprecedented times. and i'm extremely proud of how the entire team has come together in the face of this crisis and work 24x7 to ensure the safety and wellbeing of each other, while continuing to serve our clients. the fact that we've been able to stick to the earnings release schedule that was published several months back is a testament to these efforts.
on our q4 and full-year performance, as you might have seen, our q4 revenues grew by 0.4% in constant currency terms, within our guidance range and for the full year, we grew at 3.9% in constant currency. the first two months of the quarter were strong for order book, closure of large deals and ramp-up across all of our projects. but in march, as the covid health crisis rapidly deteriorated in key markets like us, europe, uk and the lockdown in india, we clearly saw an accelerated impact to our business.
let me talk a little bit about our response to the covid crisis. we -- as we realized earlier in china and then in philippines, we quickly activated our covid-19 global crisis management task force headed by bhanu, our chief operating officer and consisting of various cross-functional teams of business continuity planning, our chief information officer, our chief information security officer, our hr team, our facilities management group, corporate affairs team. and our top most priority was and remains the safety and well-being of our people.
with a lot of cooperation across, not only internal, but even external stakeholders, including the administration in various jurisdictions, we were able to move by early march most of our people in global offices, we enabled work from home. on march 15, we changed the working arrangement for our support employees based in india to work from home and started enabling the 165,000 billable client-facing employees to work from home. the initial effort obviously was about getting approvals from our customers to be able to do that. then just before the lockdown as we enabled work from home, we moved massive number of desktops, provide additional laptops and data cards and transported them to our people's homes.
we also created additional capacity in our cloud vdi and vpn using our own offerings around these areas to be able to enable a large number of our employees to work from home. in parallel, we've reached out to our customers, briefed them on the measures we were adopting and sought their approvals. all of these hectic efforts ensure that today 93% of our employees are approved to work from home by our customers and 90% of our employees are actually engaged in delivering projects globally and services to our customers in a work-from-home mode. in the past few weeks and days, our teams have settled into the new ways of working. managers are conducting daily stand-up calls to track people and their welfare, their wellbeing and the customer service delivery is being managed through this.
i'm pleased to report that our sla performance has been stable, and we are collaborating well with our customers on delivering our commitments to them. most of our customers have appreciated our business continuity planning and our ability to help them. while there are many examples, i would like to share a couple of examples with you. the first one is of a large bank in the us, which wanted to launch a full-fledged digital solution to support thousands of small businesses and their employees under the fiscal stimulus program initiated by the us treasury to get financial release under the us cares program, which is popularly known as ppp. a team of committed employees from wipro took this up as a challenge, worked closely with our cloud enterprise platform partner and started working on 3rd april and built a solution in about 72 hours, which happened also to be a weekend.
we've ensured that the application went live on 6th of april after incorporating a few regulatory changes by the us government on existing systems and providing a new front-end to be able to originate loans. on the first day of going live, 22,000 ppp loan applications were processed resulting in loan disbursal to the tune of $5.5 billion [phonetic]. this has made a significant positive impact not only to our customers' business, but to the society at large. after that, we've had similar -- three similar engagements with different banks in providing similar services.
another example that i want to provide is of one of the largest and busiest airports that we serviced in north america. we had to manage an orderly shutdown of international traffic besides being prepared to handle cargo planes delivering essential supplies like food and medicine from across the globe. this meant enabling and equipping most of the airports staff to work from home and ensure that they could continue to access all business critical applications without any issues. we happened to provide infrastructure services to this particular airport. and as you know, airport employees are not attuned or accustomed to working from home, and this was a big change for them.
we enabled change management across the employee staff and over 800 people were enabled to work from home in about 48 hours. these are employees of the airport beyond the wipro teams which service these employees and the customer. and we guided that employees. over phone, we manned walk-in-support kiosks in virtual mode, worked -- helped them do various monitoring across locations, trained them on ms teams, which was deployed for collaboration and enabled the softphone features, among many other things. totally, across our customers, we have enabled over 0.5 million client employees to be able to work in this new normal.
there are many other examples across our various service offerings, where we are seeing an opportunity to help our customers tide over this crisis. talking a little bit about the demand environment, while we are very satisfied with our actions in ensuring safety of our employees and ramping up capability to service our customers from home, we are still very much in the middle of the crisis and the economic turbulence that it has caused.
based on various estimates, the global gdp growth rates are expected to decline by at least 2%. this assumes that the virus peaks in the april/may/june quarter, but if it peaks -- if the peak goes into the july/august/september quarter, then the decline could be even more dramatic. this is likely obviously to have a significant impact on our customers' business and earnings and hence, cascading effect on their it spend. we already see instances of budget reductions, cuts in discretionary spend, request for temporary discounts and pricing pressure and restructuring of existing spends. sectors like retail, hospitality, airlines, energy especially oil and gas, and auto segment in the manufacturing business are experiencing a more immediate and deeper impact.
given the uncertainty in the environment and the inability to predict the course of the health crisis, we have decided to temporarily suspend our practice of providing quarterly guidance, and we will resume when we have increased the certainty -- when we see increased certainty of both the demand and the supply side constraints that this crisis has created. during the crisis, our priority will be to remain a trusted partner of our customers by staying close to them and enabling them in here and now and focus on proactively positioning our offerings, especially focused on efficiency like modernization, a cloud, automation, cybersecurity, analytics, etc. to gain market share in strategic accounts as well as make the most of consolidation opportunities that this could provide.
as we expect the revenues to decline during the quarter, it will put a significant pressure on our margins. we will have trade-offs to make on hiring, on salary increases that become due in this quarter in terms of the merit annual salary increase, discretionary spend that we have within wipro, variable costs such as subcontracting facilities, etc., and defending revenues and gaining market share will continue to remain a priority as we look at opportunities to get more efficient. we do anticipate that our working capital requirements will increase in the near term, but our gross cash in our balance sheet does provide us the confidence that we will emerge stronger and better.
in the end, i would like to reiterate that the environment is tough and as we all know, when the going gets tough, the tough gets going and we believe that we are coming in to this crisis with -- in a position of strength. we will remain steadfast in our goal of employee safety and wellbeing, business continuity, staying close to the customers and limiting ourselves to the new normal. i wish you all, all the very best. please stay safe and stay strong. and i will hand over to jatin to give the highlights of our financial performance.
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, abid. so, as you know, we came within the guidance that we had given for quarter four. i will talk most of the numbers relating -- this being the last quarter of the year to the overall financial performance of the year. our rupee revenues were 4.2% growth for this fiscal. we expanded our operating margin in it services segment by about 0.2% to 18.1% for the full year. that helped us grow our operating profit to 5.8%. we further got help from other income, which grew this year. as some of you know, we had larger cash earlier part of the year, which was pending the buyback that got completed in september, our other income grew 8% year-on-year.
given some of the tax announcement that we saw during the year, our effective tax rate was lower by about 1.7% during this year, and therefore overall, we were able to grow our net income to yoy at 8%. because of the reduction in number of shares -- outstanding shares, as a result of buyback, our earning per share growth for fy '19/20 was 11.2%. at the end of the year, we have about $3.4 billion of net cash and $4.4 billion of gross cash. overall, we have forex hedges of $2.7 billion in a very narrow range of what we have been maintaining. our realized rate for this quarter was inr73.95 compared to inr72.09 of the previous quarter. so we did have benefit coming to the p&l because of better realization. overall, we feel we have a good cash position, a strong cash position to continue to look at opportunities that such an environment may present in form of consolidation.
we also had a good year on operating cash flow and free cash flow. we delivered operating cash flow as a percentage of ebitda around 81% and free cash flow as percentage of net income on a very similar number, about 80%, 81%. we had a slightly lower operating cash flow and a free cash flow in quarter four as some of you may have noticed, and that was because we had four salary payments, which happens once in few years in india and that impacted both our numbers by approximately 30%. so the numbers that you see as a conversion of operating cash flow to ebitda or operating cash flow to net income for the 30% number, i'm giving it with reference to both operating cash flow as a percentage of ebitda and operating cash -- and free cash flow as percentage of net income would have increased by about 30%, if we were to make adjustment on account of that.
we did have a slightly higher dso in quarter four, because we did see some disruption on regular payment cycles that some of our customers undertake as in last two weeks, a lot of the organization were going through the teething issues on bcp, but we have had a good first two weeks of quarter one, which gives us confidence that we will catch up on some of those inefficiencies of quarter four. this is all i had. we'll be very happy to take questions from here.

operator
thank you very much sir. ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question is from the line of sudheer guntupalli from motilal oswal financial services. please go ahead.
sudheer guntupalli -- motilal oswal financial services ltd. -- analyst
good evening, gentlemen. thanks for giving the opportunity. the margin performance during the quarter, especially at gross margin level, was very impressive. in fact, it was better than even pre-covid quarters. so, what is your thought process on the sustainability of this cost structure or margin level? so, you look at it more like a one-time spike due to aggressive cost control or you think this would be something which is sustainable going forward?
jatin dalal -- president and chief financial officer
sudheer, thanks for your question. we -- let me give you a little bit more color. i think there are three components to our margin expansion for quarter one. one is the operation, which is nearly 1%, where we really went after the traditional levers. we managed our -- managed to utilize our people very well. we really had a look at our variable workforce. we looked at -- you've seen utilization improving, you've seen offshore rate improving. overall, i think, -- and of course, there is a component on automation, which is not visible to externally that has also played up. so, overall, i think we did a very good job in terms of managing our workforce to our requirement in an environment that revenue were highly uncertain. that was one component.
second is, we, of course, kept a very tight watch of every incremental spend that we've to do. we also looked at existing spend and whether they were giving us the buck -- the bang for the buck as they were giving us in pre-covid times. and if they were not, then we have really looked at them whether those banks should continue. so, that was roughly 1%. another 1% has been forex. and we had taken -- we have taken a slightly larger provision for doubtful debt, which is more called as expected credit loss, which is driven by environment and not by a specific situation or specific customer or any specificity for that matter, which is about 0.5%. so, that is about 1.4% sequential expansion that we have done.
and as you can see, i think we've done well on operations. and therefore, we believe that we should be able to keep our operating margin in a narrow band in quarter two also. having said that, as thierry articulated in his opening remarks, our focus remains growth as an organization, profitable growth that we want to go after. and therefore, if we need to make investments, we will make those investments and that will always be our first priority.
and subject to that, yes, we will try and keep it in that way.
sudheer guntupalli -- motilal oswal financial services ltd. -- analyst
thanks, jatin for that. and in healthcare vertical, some of the large companies had actually reported very strong growth in this vertical led by work related to contact tracing applications, etc. however, we did not seem to have gotten a similar benefit. is this due to difference in our service offerings in the healthcare vertical? and broadly, your thoughts on vertical-wise outlook across other verticals also will be very helpful.
jatin dalal -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. so i will start with first -- i'll start with the second part of your question, and i would request bill to take the first part. bill stith is our global head of health bu. so we have shared that we do believe that we are seeing more stability in cbu, technology, and communication in terms of where it can be in quarter two. other bus, we also see overall stability, but other bus we will wait and watch how the environment sort of progresses. so, that's the sort of commentary on other bus, and i would request bill to respond on health.
bill stith -- senior vice president and global head of health business
yes, thank you. so, first of all, let me just remind that q4 for us is a high volume seasonal business with -- especially in our payer segment for open enrollment. so, we typically expect a little bit of pressure coming into q1. obviously, that was expanded due to covid when we saw mostly volumes dropping due to patients pushing out their elected treatments, which also translated into furloughs in our payer provider segment. medical device and life sciences have also impacted on volumes based on inbound calls associated with the same procedures.
i would say that our pipeline is strong. we won new deals both in existing and new logos. and we further expanded, enabling our clients, especially in vdi and cloud as mentioned. and we do -- we saw a lot of demand for delivery in our nearshore locations of the philippines. we are watching elections. obviously, as you know, that could have an impact especially in our aca exchanges in u.s.
sudheer guntupalli -- motilal oswal financial services ltd. -- analyst
sure. thanks, and all the best.
operator
thank you very much. the next question is from the line of kawaljeet saluja from kotak. please go ahead. kawaljeet saluja, your line is unmuted. you may go ahead with your question.
kawaljeet saluja -- kotak securities -- analyst
hi, congratulations on extremely strong margin performance. i joined the call little bit late. so, i don't know if thierry is taking any questions. but, if he is, i have the first question for him.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
yes, i am, i am.
kawaljeet saluja -- kotak securities -- analyst
okay. so, thierry, welcome on board. the first question that i had was that what would be your first 90 or 120 days plan as you go about getting wipro back to the growth path or getting back to the industry growth? so what would be your key priorities for the first 90 or 120 days?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
okay, understood. okay. so first of all, i must confess one thing, i've been a little bit cheating with the concept of first day, because i've definitely been working before my first day, last monday. and so i dedicated the last three, four weeks or five weeks actually connecting with the leadership team, connecting with our chairman, rishad premji, connecting with the board members and so on.
so, i've already had a good time to really get a flavor for the business, the clients, our employees, better understand the power and the strength of our culture, of our values, and so on. having said that, obviously, starting now, looking at the priorities for, as you say, the first 90 or 100 days, i look at it in different buckets. on the first one, which is the operation. so i'm someone who likes to jump and dive into the trenches day one. and so, it's literally starting to engage with our leaders in the operations everyday and really be active on the day-to-day operations. we have the quarter two to deliver or quarter three and there is a great sense of attention paid to how we will be dealing with the health and the safety of our employees. so, that is really specific to the current situation where we are in, but also to the fact that it's actually day-to-day operations for us. yes, the world has changed, so does our -- the way our day-to-day operations look like as well.
the second aspect for me is connecting. so, connecting with our clients. i have really started to engage basically on day one and i'm spending time with clients to listen to them, to meet them, to understand what we are doing and how -- what their expectations are. so, this is also incredibly important because i see -- i have great passion for clients, great passion for spending time with them and building partnership with them.
and equally important, as you can imagine is really connecting with our employees. so, i've also started to engage and will do a lot more of that. i'm a people person, so i'd like to connect physically but it's ok. in the current environment, obviously, i need to accept, we all accept the situation may last. so, we are using the new technologies to really connect and actually, it's working well. you can connect with people from different places at the same time, you can jump from one country to another in few seconds. and i've been connecting and will connect more with different parts, different groups, senior leadership, young professionals, woman at wipro, best talents, and so on and so on.
and then obviously, while we are doing so, constantly emphasis on let's grow and the appetite for deals and clients. i will work on the bigger plan to redefine or to confirm our strategy, our vision, our ambition for the years to come and where i can potentially contribute to accelerate the growth, to build a cohesive team, and continue to grow top talent, to constantly challenge status quo inside the organization, and see where we can be more nimble, more efficient, more productive, have less time internal, more time for our clients and for employees. and finally, how we can streamline our processes and so on.
so, to respond rapidly to your question now, i would say, it's going to be a good balance between the need to dive into the operations and protect the safety and security of our people, and at the same time, work on the bigger plan. i don't want to jump on conclusions now, it's only day seven, but work on the bigger plan that i will come and share with you at some point in time.
kawaljeet saluja -- kotak securities -- analyst
right. just a follow-on question, thierry. on a slightly different note, while it's early days, what do you think wipro could have done better? now, of course, it's only seven days for you at wipro, but you have come across wipro as a competitor, while you were at cap. so, what are your broad early thoughts you can share that will be helpful.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
yeah. i can tell you one thing. this is exactly what i will not do, jump at conclusions and compare with capgemini. i don't want to do that at all, because i don't think it's right after seven days and i don't think it leads to anything. i think i still need to learn and listen and observe and better -- get a better feel. there would be a point in time i will start to draw conclusions.
what is clear is that the values of wipro are completely unique. the sense of purpose of wipro is completely unique. this is a global company. as you said, i've known wipro for 20 years, i've been competing with wipro for 20 years. won sometimes, lost sometimes, but truly formidable competitor. and what i would say after 7 days is, yes, it's a global company with an even bigger heart than what i thought before. the energy in the system, the passion of the employees for the company, the love they have of wipro is for me outstanding and i want to build on that in the years to come.
kawaljeet saluja -- kotak securities -- analyst
that's very well put. thank you. i'm just being a little bit selfish and i'll ask just one more question to jatin, so please don't mind. jatin, just a question on the margin. i'm still trying to understand what drove the margin improvement, given that your employee headcount decline was barely 1%, your utilization went up. so effectively, your volumes were flat, yet the revenues declined by 7%. with the 7% realization decline, i'm still trying to reconcile as to how you're able to manage profitability? and second, is that -- i also saw that the employee cost on dollar basis declined by 9% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, which means that you have leveraged the variable compensation lever quite aggressively. so, i just wanted your thoughts on couple of these aspects.
jatin dalal -- president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. i will speak about the first, and i'll also invite saurabh to talk about the second one. so, kawaljeet, there are parts of that walk which are unfortunately not visible externally. as i mentioned in my opening remarks, we have looked at very aggressively the variable workforce of wipro, beginning from day one of the quarter. so, we were able to leverage a lot of internal talent that actually was utilized. that is number one, instead of variable talent.
second is that in some form, utilization is also factor of leave loss and leave loss, as you can imagine, has been relatively lower for the quarter, and of course, that also played into revenue, but that is one of the things which has kept utilization to come out even better than what it was in quarter four.
and your third point on realization. i would say that the entire 7% drop is definitely not the realization drop. there is a part, which is realization and there is certainly a part, which is volume. and as you would also appreciate that in a time like this, no company will have zero volume declines. so, we also have had a share of our volume decline and there is a part which is also realization. i want to talk a little bit on realization also.
realization typically has a few components. as you know that one direct component could be price discount. the second -- but i will come on to it at the end. but in a business which is run at 60% plus fixed price project, there is -- there are impacts on realization because of the element-based contracts that we have in our infrastructure business, where we are paid based on the elements that we are able to service. and you would appreciate that when element go down, when for example, a large manufacturing firm is not operating its plants, there would be a dip in the elements which are serviced by wipro. but i cannot overnight reduce the staff from those projects because they are all doing some specific work, serving specific element, or deployed for a specific technology. so, element-based contracts has flown into it.
two, there is always a certain amount of change request, additional business that flows into existing fixed price business, which has impact on realization. this quarter it has added adverse impacts because there was a sort of at least in the beginning of the quarter, as you can imagine, a lot of decision making was on pause. so, fixed price project has got impacted by that. of course, there has been an impact on pricing also, but i would say that has been relatively smaller, and i'm confident that the variable part of the realization of fixed price projects, we should see an uptick as the environment becomes to normalcy during the course of next couple of quarters.
on variable pay, i would say -- i would request saurabh to talk about it, but i would only make one comment that our operational savings has been significant in terms of the value, and in terms of the might of execution, compared to the leverage of our variable pay. saurabh, do you want to add something to that?
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
thanks, jatin. so, kawal, exactly what -- when we got into this entire thing about in q1, you know, and the pandemic started, and we are looking at revenue impact and costs, one of the things we had called out in which we tried to do as far as possible was that we will minimize letting off people, given that there is a significant volume drop. however -- and then collectively the might of the project come together in this time. like in the previous year, for most of our people, we had given 100% variable pay, which was paid to them. the q4 was 100% variable pay, which was paid to all our employees.
in the middle this entire pandemic in the month of may, the leadership took a bigger cut, but majority of the people have got reasonable variable pay. so, as jatin said, it has been a superior execution across all cost parameters rather than looking at one specific area.
kawaljeet saluja -- kotak securities -- analyst
okay. thank you so much, and wish you the best.
operator
thank you very much. the next question is from the line of rishit parikh from nomura. please go ahead.
rishit parikh -- nomura -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question and thierry, welcome on board. just, if i -- if you look at the outlook further, some of the peers, they've started to talk about sequential improvement in 2q. right? i wanted to understand what are we seeing from a demand perspective? and then, do you see a recovery coming through? that's one. and on the deal discussions side, how the traction is improving across clients? and if you can just give a little more color on what it is expected, that will be helpful. thank you.
jatin dalal -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so, we have said that we see stability in quarter two. however, you know that the situation is very fluid. so, it is really, i would say, not in our place to say that this is the definitiveness that we see in the environment, but we certainly see -- we certainly have much greater visibility than we had in the beginning of quarter one. but having said that, it's an evolving environment both from demand side from -- you know, our largest market is united states, as well as on supply side where our largest delivery centers are in india. so, i don't think we are in a position to very accurately predict what's going to pan out. we'll play by the ear, but we certainly see a greater stability in the current quarter compared to q1.
second, from an environment standpoint, we certainly believe that we should see an uptick in performance in the bus that i mentioned, sbu-type, communication, health also should hopefully do better because some of the elective surgeries, etc., which got pushed out, probably, they will come back -- some of the volumes related to that could come back. and rest, we'll play by the ear in the course of quarter two, rishit.
rishit parikh -- nomura -- analyst
okay. and just one last question from a bfsi standpoint. the weakness seems to be slightly more, but our presence is fairly decent, right, in that space. so, just wanted to understand what you are seeing from a bfsi perspective, because some of the competition is starting to see improvement in that portion at least from the 2q onwards.
angan guha -- senior vice president and global bu head, bfsi
yeah. rishit, this is angan. can you hear me?
rishit parikh -- nomura -- analyst
yeah. yeah.
angan guha -- senior vice president and global bu head, bfsi
yeah, ok. so rishit, this is angan, and i lead financial services globally. so, let me give you a little bit of a color from a bfsi standpoint. so, rishit, as you know, most of the banks have got into this cycle with a pretty robust balance sheet, right? because none of the banks wanted to be in the same situation as they were during the global financial crisis as obviously, everybody is showing a balance sheet strength. and what that has done is, that has made the banks spend a lot lower than what they were spending earlier. so, that is one.
there are two big uncertainties, specifically with the unemployment at the rate it is and u.s., like jatin mentioned, being our biggest market, people are worried about delinquencies, that is one. and second, with almost zero interest rate or could even be negative -- from a banks as well as the financial institutions perspective, they're very careful in terms of the uncertainties. and, you would have seen the gartner report. the gartner -- gartner has clearly stated that there will be a 4% decline in terms of the spending. but that said, there are also some green shoots, so we've seen a lot of discussions around the ramp side of the banks, so where people are spending to cut cost and we're participating very, very heavily in that part of the area. but the things are uncertain. so, we will play it by the ear, we will see how it goes.
from a discounting perspective, i think we've done a good job in terms of q1. but as things become more clearer, we will be able to give a much better commentary on that situation.
rishit parikh -- nomura -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you very much. the next question is from the line of sandeep shah from cimb. please go ahead.
sandeep shah -- cimb securities (india) pvt. ltd. -- analyst
yeah, thanks very much. my first question is to thierry. just to understand, as you have said in your speech, as well as in the press release that your agenda is on profitable growth. and, you will also agree that wipro has been lagging the industry growth rates. while peers who have faced the similar situations have actually in the initial strategy has compromised the margins to get the growth turnaround as a whole, while one of the peers wanted to do both hand-in-hand and was not able to do it successfully. so, do you believe a profitable growth and a growth turnaround going hand-in-hand could be like a catch-22 situation and maybe a difficult task where you have to first compromise a bit of a margin to get the growth turnaround so you all plan and strategy around the same?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
okay. so, yeah, it's a very fair question. in my answer, i'll be a little bit academic, because i think that -- as you can imagine with seven days under my belt, it's -- this kind of answers require specific to the situation of every business, but let's be clear on my priorities. i have the -- i will drive an obsession for growth in the organization. obsession for growth for growing our top-line everywhere. but i mentioned profitable growth because i don't believe that you can negotiate one for the other. there is a possibility that may be one quarter or two, you get more of one and less of the other. these are -- you know, it can always happen, but on a long-term, you need to drive both growth and profitability. and we can do it, we can do it. growth, it starts with growth. that's also one important point. you can drive profitability through cost reduction, quarter after quarter. but it's very difficult to drive growth if you're not investing. and hence, your point on catch-22.
so, it starts with growth. okay? my view is that to drive growth, it's going to be about certainly high energy, absolute focus on that, ready to focus the investments to the accounts that matter to us, to leveraging the offerings where we have strengths and the industries and the position we have in our industry. it will take some bets, and we will take some bets, and we will be bold in going after these bets. but the focus will be on growth, not to the expense of profit.
sandeep shah -- cimb securities (india) pvt. ltd. -- analyst
okay. okay. fair enough. thanks. and, the second question to jatin. just about the margin savings, which we would have done. this was also helped by work-from-home and the lockdown. but as the growth comes back, what percentage of savings which you have achieved in 1q and maybe possible because of a full quarter impact in 2q, would you retain when the growth comes back in a normal situation when -- as the lockdown situation is much more normal versus where it is right now?
jatin dalal -- president and chief financial officer
yes. so -- so certainly, there are certain expenses which will come back. like for example, we are at a historically low value of travel as you can see into our financials. and that would come back as you climb back on activity. there would be -- but at the same time, there would be certain expenses that we've had benefit for, let's say, half of the quarter or one-third of the quarter in quarter one that will give its full benefit in quarter two. so, there are some positive levers also there.
the expenses that will come back with increase in activity, our endeavor would be that are commensurate with the additional opportunities and growth that we are seeing. so, in some form, you should get a lever from growth on those expenses. but, overall, we see that we should be able to focus our energies in second quarter also on what we can do. we remain focused on cost. just, you know, it's not a one quarter journey. we'll continue to question all incremental spend that are needed. and we have to be very clear, sandeep, that we have built a model for a different time and place, the operating model that was operating.
and if we are not conscious of looking at every cost item and asking whether in the new world this is also required or not required, then we are not doing justice to that cost. so, we'll continue to look at areas that we couldn't focus in quarter one in quarter two also. so, i would really put it in three buckets. when cost that will go up, the cost which will give it full benefits, and also the third bucket where the cost that we've not been able to look at in the short term, can we look at it now? so, those are the cost plays.
and therefore, i made a comment to sudheer's question that we'll try and keep it in a narrow band, of course, subject to the investment where we need to make. and i think, there we can't compromise and what we need to invest for growth. we've announced one acquisition, if we have to do -- we've to remain focused on strategic assets that we want to add, that could also be dilutive. so, those investments, we will remain very open. but cost side, we'll try and look at -- continue to remain as close as possible to the line of execution.
sandeep shah -- cimb securities (india) pvt. ltd. -- analyst
okay, thanks. thanks, and all the best to the management.
jatin dalal -- president and chief financial officer

thank you very much. the next question is from the line of abhishek shindadkar from elara capital. please go ahead.
abhishek shindadkar -- elara capital plc -- analyst
yeah, hi, thanks for the opportunity. a part of the question was answered earlier, but would like to understand how did the demand or the deal bookings played out in june versus may and april? any commentary or color in terms of the progression could be helpful. thank you.
jatin dalal -- president and chief financial officer
i'll request bhanumurthy, our chief operating officer to...
bhanumurthy b. m. -- president and chief operating officer
hi. yeah, in terms of the order book, you know, what we have seen is that during the latter half of the quarter, we see the deal momentum pick up. our pipeline continue to remain very healthy, and you've seen that we also announced a couple of good deals in our press release itself. and what we're seeing is that the velocity of decision making is still not at the pre-covid levels.
however, our order book remains healthy. it has improved year-on-year and our pipeline is robust. we're also seeing that in terms of demand, the nature of services that we have seen, definitely we are seeing a good pipeline for our offerings on cloud, ensuring that they -- our customer employees are able to work from home and remotely, some of the infrastructure services and our digital operations and platform services. and we are seeing a good momentum in these services along with our engineering and security services as well. so, we do see a good momentum on the order book side and our pipeline looks robust and healthy.
abhishek shindadkar -- elara capital plc -- analyst
thank you. just a clarification, you said the book is, you know, has increased year-on-year. if you can also compare it to march or pre-covid levels, that would be helpful. thank you for taking my question.
bhanumurthy b. m. -- president and chief operating officer
yeah. so, like we discussed, we don't disclose the individual size of the order book or the [indecipherable] levels, but i can tell you that the order book has improved year-on-year comparatively, yes.
abhishek shindadkar -- elara capital plc -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you very much. the next question is from the line of divya nagarajan from ubs. please go ahead.
divya nagarajan -- ubs -- analyst
thanks and congrats on the strong execution in a tough quarter. most of my questions have been answered, so i'm just going to ask thierry a question more on a sector perspective, if i may. thierry, in your experience on the services space, and specifically in the last few years, the changes that we're seeing in the it services landscape, what would you think are the key trends that you think are going to accelerate because of what we're seeing in this downturn? and specifically, what is your -- what has been your impression of the offshore sector as a whole in the last five years? and how the sector has handled this transformation to digital?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
okay, thanks for the question. so yeah, the -- i think we all recognize that the -- we are in an industry where the reality of the day is not the reality of the day after. so things are changing rapidly. what -- a couple of trends. one, we all agree on the fact that technology is more pervasive inside the organization that every company is investing in technology and, therefore, enabling technology to address business issues.
what we've seen over the years -- over the last years is that there is a growing component of this technology spend that is being done outside, or not say outside, but that is being driven by the business and it's not only triggered, if you like, by the it departments. chief marketing officer are spending in technology, chief sales officer, head of operations, head of manufacturing, head of supply chain, different function leaders are spending in technology and therefore it's an evolution we need to adapt, and obviously, be the force of connection inside the companies between the business and the it.
it is always required, absolutely essential to drive scale and security to all these investments and orchestrate, if you like, those -- the investment on those technologies. but i think it's clear that we have to be prepared to connect with cxos and very different stakeholders inside companies to engage on strategic discussions where technology can play a role.
second, i think, it's very clear that the company that have not invested enough in their digital transformation over the last years have felt the pain during the crisis of the last weeks. and, there will be an acceleration of their transformation over the next quarters. the level of adoption of cloud in the different markets is going to accelerate tremendously, and without -- not even talking about the potential of 5g for a lot of the technologies that we are talking about.
so, i think, i would say that the winners in the industry would be the one who have been able to adapt and shift the fastest to the evolution of this demand and be able to come on one side and work with the clients, the partners to drive efficiencies, simplify organizations, reduce the cost of running operations and so on. and on the other side, reinvest at least part of these savings to new technology and new ways of working, helping creation of new revenue streams, through innovation, and technology.
so it's going to be about being able to adjust, being able to accelerate and stick as close as possible to our customers and hear and get a deep understanding of the challenges of each industry and be able to respond to it. services need to be sector specific to address those needs -- those requirements from our clients.
divya nagarajan -- ubs -- analyst
thanks for that. jatin, my question to your earlier comment that you have brought down your temporary workforce and replaced it with some of the slack that you had in the system because of this downturn. what would -- how would you kind of look at talent in building up the bench as demand returns? would it mean that some of the temporary workforce comes back or do you think that you have enough slack in the system still, because utilization, as you said, has gone up a bit? does that mean that you will have to then increase hiring as demand comes up? how should we think about this equation?
jatin dalal -- president and chief financial officer
so, we have, right now, sufficient availability of talent in the company. having said that, right now, as we always say that we will hire for revenue. so, if there is a need to hire externally, we will definitely look at it. but the action that we took was a very straightforward, i would say, straightforward method of [indecipherable] action that when we saw the reduction in some of our revenues, some of our own employees became available for work. and if we had a skill set which was available, with which we could service our customers, we did not need the cost of the variable workforce. and therefore, we sort of reduced that variable workforce and put our own employees to service those requirements. and if it goes up, then we have all the channels available for us to utilize it.
saurabh, do you want to add anything to that?
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
yeah, just to add, one is that, in the -- some of the geographies in the developed markets we've been able to put some employee on furlough and that's helped in our cost perspective, but our talent's available for us and as and when demand comes, we can quickly get them back without hiring anybody. so, it's a win-win for the employees, for the company of not going and hiring people when the demand comes back or gearing ourselves for that. and the other one is also about crowdsourcing and the top gear platform and how you utilize that. that's another advantage. we're seeing a lot of traction on top gear. in the quarter, we've seen a large demand on that one. these two would be other drivers in terms of looking at when demand comes back.
divya nagarajan -- ubs -- analyst
thank you, and all the best.
operator
thank you very much. ladies and gentlemen, we will take our last question now which is from the line of mr. girish pai from nirmal bang. please go ahead.
girish pai -- nirmal bang -- analyst
thanks for the opportunity. just wanted to discuss the trajectory of recovery. you had your best quarter recently in 3q of fy '20 of about just a little less than $2.1 billion. by when do you think you will get back to that number, jatin? that's question number one. second question is regarding pricing. do you see that the worst on the pricing front is behind us in 1q or do you see that kind of coming back again in the succeeding quarters?
jatin dalal -- president and chief financial officer
yeah, hi, girish, hope you are well. we -- so, i think it will be too early for us to call when we'll come back to a particular number as thierry mentioned in his opening remarks and subsequent question that we really need to find stability, but our endeavor would be to reach there as early as possible. i mean the focus would be on growth, and focus would be on investment, and focused effort to get that growth back. so, not able to quantify that timeline, girish.
and your second question was, sorry?
girish pai -- nirmal bang -- analyst
the pricing -- do you see that it's kind of -- have you seen the worst of that or do you see that kind of coming? because the customer have too much of time to think about their spending plans, now that they're kind of coming back to office and decide on budgeting going forward, do you think you will actually see more pricing pressure going forward?
operator
participants, you are requested to please stay connected. we have lost the line from mr. dalal. okay, we have the line now reconnected. sir, you may proceed.
jatin dalal -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. so, girish i was just saying that we've worked very closely with our customers, and i would look at pricing more as a realization for us. and as i had said earlier in another discussion that some of the realization which has got impacted should start returning. yes, pricing will remain a theme in a tough year, but our endeavor has always been to work with our customers to reduce the total cost of ownership for our customer and not necessarily make it a win-lose equation, but really work toward a win-win for our customer as well as for us.
girish pai -- nirmal bang -- analyst

over to you, thierry.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you, aparna. good evening, ladies and gentlemen. it's really wonderful to speak with all of you today. last monday, i joined wipro as a chief executive officer, and i'm excited to join wipro, and consider it a great privilege to be asked to lead wipro. such an exceptional global company with incredible legacy.
i've known wipro as one of the pioneering leaders in the industry. and over the years, i've come to greatly respect and admire the company; its values, its people, and its capabilities, above all, the founder, chairman, mr. azim premji's extraordinary leadership of this company for over 50 years. and he is equally exceptional generosity is a generic. i've great respect for the work done by the azim premji foundation for the underprivileged. and it's to-date 67% economic ownership of wipro adds greater meaning to what we do.
i speak to you amid a global pandemic, which has few parallels in history. safety of employees will be our paramount concern as we navigate these extraordinary times. the pandemic has brought about lasting changes in our ways of working. i've heard of remarkable stories from our customers, our partners, and colleagues on how we have adapted to the new demands of today, and the indomitable spirit and dedication that we've shown in keeping our promises to customers and communities that we operate in.
over the last few years -- few weeks, i've been spending time. although only started a few days ago, i've been spending time over the last few weeks with senior leaders and teams across units and functions to take a holistic view of our business and better understand our opportunities and challenges. this is definitely a defining period for our industry and for wipro. disruption has always been a part of business. the challenges are new, but i know that wipro with a long history of 75 years, has overcome many challenges with tenacity and resilience. the culture of innovation fostered here over the ages will help us pivot and transform.
finally, i'd like to state that profitable growth is our most important agenda. despite the immediate challenges, i've absolutely no doubt that we'll emerge stronger. over the next few weeks, working closely with chairman, rishad premji and also senior leaders, i hope to finalize the plan to drive improvements across all spheres in our quest to achieve industry-leading growth. so, i look forward to meet you in person next time with more details on our strategy and vision for the organization.
with that, i hand it over to jatin for his comments on the business performance and highlights for q1 '21. jatin?
jatin dalal -- president and chief financial officer
thanks. thank you very much, thierry. good evening. it's great to talk to you all. it has been a tremendous quarter for all of us. i can talk on behalf of team wipro. when we started the quarter, i think we had very, very little visibility as to what we are getting into. one of the toughest quarters as we started the journey. i will give you a brief synopsis of what we have done in the course of the quarter, and then we will take up the questions. i want to cover this highlights in three parts. number one is employee safety and wellness. second is on our financial performance and little bit on demand outlook. and third is about an acquisition that we announced today.
so, let me start very briefly about the way we have managed our operation. we have continued to work extensively from home. and at any point in time, we don't have more than 4,000 or 4,500 people in our offices, and we have been able to work seamlessly, including delivering transitions, including delivering to complex development projects, including meeting all slas as per our requirements from home.
our teams have taken a greater onus on themselves to remain connected. to make sure that we are available for each other, our organization has come out with initiatives like fit for life, which are employee health and wellness programs, including some sort of counseling support when somebody needs help and somebody to talk to. so, that was on my first aspect.
second aspect, let me talk about the financial performance. as you know, we delivered in a constant currency 7.5% decline and on a year-on-year basis, we declined about 4.4% in constant currencies. our performance on margin was very satisfactory. we delivered an expansion of operating margin by 1.4 percentage points on a sequential basis, and we delivered 60 basis point or 0.6% on a y-o-y basis.
if you see, we have also done very well on cash conversion, which is the third metric we track very closely. our performance on our operating cash flow was 127% of our ebitda. and our free cash flow was 157% of our net income. as you know, we had one month extra salary last quarter, and we had that benefit in quarter one. but even if i take that away, i think the teams have done remarkable job to remain very cost conscious and cash conscious in a tough quarter.
i will go little down in the p&l. we have a slight expansion of other income, which was led by the larger corpus that we have of cash. and we have about $4 billion of cash compared to $3.4 billion that we had last quarter, net of debt on our balance sheet. our etr was slightly higher at 22.1%. our net income was year-on-year flat. and our eps growth, because we had a buyback as you know in september last year, our eps growth was 5.7% year-on-year. overall, we are quite happy with the way we came together and executed the quarter.
now, let me talk a little bit about the demand environment. demand environment is driven by what we call as three cs. the first is cloud, second is collaboration, and third is cyber. we are also seeing great uptick in offerings like vdi, sd-wan, excellent traction for our digital operations and platform offerings in this post-covid era.
from our sector standpoint, while we have had a tough quarter one probably across all sectors, but specifically, we're seeing some stability returning in our consumer business unit, in our tech business unit, and in our communication business unit. for others, we will watch it closely as to how the traction unfolds during the course of quarter 2. overall, from our perspective, we started the quarter with a certain trajectory, but we executed well on many fronts, including on revenue front to be able to come at the end where we came.
now let me talk a little a bit about the acquisition that we announced today. it's a -- this acquisition is a smaller acquisition, but it gives us a good access into northeast brazil. it gives us access into new set of customers that we don't have in financial services, retail, public sector, and manufacturing services. it's a profitable business, which has been growing rapidly and above all, it provides us a great opportunity in terms of sourcing this talent, which is very capable and very, very cost competitive for our global business.
overall, i think team wipro came together quite well in quarter one. when i started i said that when we started, we have very low visibility as to what we are getting into. but i think we stayed together and delivered a good quarter for our partners and shareholders.
so with that, we are very happy to take your questions.

thank you very much. [operator instructions] the first question is from the line of ankur rudra from jp morgan. please go ahead.
ankur rudra -- jp morgan -- analyst
thank you and congratulations on solid execution and great to see a strong guide into the december quarter. thierry, thank you for your brief commentary on the change in or the strategic direction you highlighted. could you perhaps elaborate on what your early thoughts are on which sectors or market where you see potential to take leadership and any thoughts on the period over which you can see this happen? also, incrementally, on your fifth point, where do you see scope for simplification of the operating model to drive external focus and perhaps a related increase in large deal participation?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
yeah, absolutely. thank you. thank you for the question, ankur. so if i look at the first one, which is really around the -- your point was on the simplification of the model and then on the market of focus -- area of focus. so if i look at the market, yes, the point here is clearly to say we are a global player, but we cannot equally focus on all markets and all sectors with, i would say, the same level of intensity because then what happens is that you are spreading the investment across a huge market and you're having a smaller impact than if you are really focusing on the ones where because of the size or because of your relative strengths, you can really have an impact.
and so let me give you few examples. so for example, my view is wipro has a strong position in the banking and insurance sector. we are a strong player. we will continue to increase focus in this sector. second, if i look at markets, there is no question that the u.s. market is the number one market and we're continuing to invest in this market. if i look at the european market, there is a market, german market, where we have a reasonably strong position, but where we can really go stronger if we really focus our efforts. so this is really more looking at the places where we feel we can have a true leadership position. i will give more details when we need i think at the analyst market day, but frankly, you should consider that typically sectors like banking and insurance, consumer and retail, energy and utilities, healthcare are sectors incredibly important for us and then we will define for these sectors, the markets that matter the most where we feel we can build a leadership position. so that is for the first question.
for the model itself, for the evolution of the model, one, i would tell you that there is no organization in our industry who is not exposed to the level of complexity that is driven by the size of our teams. thousands and dozens of thousands of employees is driving complexity. i usually find beauty in simplicity and so to give you a feel for the direction we are taking, it's better to be simpler than being perfect. okay, in term of model, what is critical is that you have a model that is centered around the clients that reduce internal bias, reduce the number of p&ls, because p&ls are driving individual focus and what you need as an organization is to be able to mobilize all forces of an organization for the benefit of one client. so fewer p&ls, fewer teams, fewer metrics. we don't need hundreds of kpis to follow our operations, right? so that is for the organization.
then, we need to -- we need to work on the processes, simplify the processes, simplify the different steps of controls, how can we have less controls, how can we have less people focusing internally and free up time for the market. and finally, obviously, it's about systems. so, how can we have a program launched a few years ago called quantum, who is really aiming at driving efficiency in our systems and that is also going to drive a lot of simplification of the model itself. when you combine a refined model, a simplified processes -- set of processes and more efficient system, it's inevitably driving simplified -- a simplification across the organization, a greater sense of accountability, and more time for the market, less time for the internal.
ankur rudra -- jp morgan -- analyst
thank you for this elaboration. that makes a lot of sense. if i could just get in one more question, just your thoughts on the quarter itself. it appears that a lot of growth was there in the operations part of the business. just wanted to get a sense how much of this was supply resumption versus truly demand improvement. thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
jatin, you want to take this one?
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, you know, ankur, i would say this is the -- this is the real growth. this is driven by the ramp up in some of our new and existing customers. so it is not just resumption of supply. in fact, i would say, it's a very small component of this 8% odd growth that you are seeing is resumption of supply. it is market-led healthy growth that we will -- we are confident of sustaining and growing further.
ankur rudra -- jp morgan -- analyst
yeah, understand. thank you and best of luck.

yeah, hi, good evening and congratulations on a very good execution and also guidance. so see, i have only two small questions. one is that if can see our business mix, we are almost having more than 50% business, which is in the high growth phase and it has been further probably triggered by the pandemic like digital operations, cloud, and data and analytics. now if i see this with the number of clients we are adding and this has been a very aggressive number in that -- in the last reported quarter, which you have reported today, my sense is that is the business somehow moving toward more democratization or disintermediation of the intermediaries?
what i'm trying to ask here is that i understand that we are a b2b business, but if the number of client additions increase so significantly because of the nature of the business or because of the nature of deals becoming smaller, will it mean that going forward in a long-term, our volatility in the business or lumpiness in the business will start going down because we are basically directly enabling our customers, which are businesses to service their customers. so in a way, there is more democratization of the decision making process. so that is number one.
and number two, i just [technical issues].
operator
sorry, sandip, your audio is breaking. so we lost --
sandip agarwal -- edelweiss -- analyst
yeah, sorry. am i audible now?
operator
yes.
sandip agarwal -- edelweiss -- analyst
and the second question is that on the application services, what is your sense? how will it pan out over next two years because although we are very good at [technical issues].
operator
sorry to interrupt, the audio is still breaking sir. i would request you to come in a network area, please.
sandip agarwal -- edelweiss -- analyst
yeah, i am actually not using any speaker phone or something. i'm on handheld only, but yeah, so yeah, the complete the question, just that the application services, if you can give some outlook for next two years, what is your sense on that. i'm not asking for numbers. i'm just asking for qualitative input.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
okay. so the first question i will try to respond. the second one, if moderator, you can -- because i'm not sure to have fully understood. there was a lot of breakup. so if you can clarify that would help me. i will respond to the first one to start with. so there is no question that there is an evolution of the business mix and it will continue to occur over the next quarters because as i said the pandemic is, if anything, is increasing the speed -- the need for speed in driving transformation for our customers. i have spoken to all these clients and all of them -- i haven't had one single client meeting without having a discussion on the need to transform the business and really accelerate the plans they have built in the previous months or quarters to transform their business front-end and back-end.
so there is no doubt that they will continue to accelerate, cloud agenda will become even more strategic. i was not having a cloud discussion with a lot of ceos of large companies some years ago because it was more infrastructure-led discussion with the cio. today, every cxo understands the impact of and the need to accelerate the cloud journey and we are responding to that. we are shifting, we are rotating our portfolio in every of our service line. if we look at our offerings, we have an acceleration and we are really focusing the rotation to what i would call the new space to really match the expectation of the client.
you were then making a link with the next -- the increase of number of clients and here i'd like to tell you that, that includes now the acquisition of two companies for c&i [phonetic] who are dealing with smaller clients in size and so that has brought some new clients as well. i don't think you should read anything from that in terms of do more clients and smaller in volume. that's not the reality, i don't think. we continue to have the right volume of deals with our top clients and the pipeline is actually very healthy there. so i think it -- i don't see a shift here. moderator, can you help me with the second question?
sandip agarwal -- edelweiss -- analyst
yeah, sir. my second question was what is your view on the application services. how will it pan out? i'm not asking for any quantitative guidance, but i'm just asking your view how the application services will pan out over next two years. do you see growth or do you think that it will stabilize here. what is your sense on that?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is -- this is going to be growth application world, it's going to be growth -- there is so much to do around data, there is so much to do to shift a lot of the applications, migrate them into the cloud to really develop a cloud native application. if you look at typical s/4hana projects, they are -- we are not even touching yet the acceleration that will happen over the next few years. so i am pretty bullish on the fact that the applications world is going to grow well over the next years as well.
sandip agarwal -- edelweiss -- analyst
okay, great, thank you. that's all from my side and best of luck for the next quarter.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of kawaljeet saluja from kotak. please go ahead.
kawaljeet saluja -- kotak -- analyst
hi, thank you for this opportunity and congratulations on a reasonably good quarter and a pretty good guidance as well. my first question is for thierry. actually, the first couple of questions are for thierry. the first question, thierry, is that the set of priorities that you have announced requires changes on multiple dimensions or whether on all structure, people, possibly even go-to-market approach. so, can you please share your high level thoughts on the potential changes one can look at.
and the second question is that you mentioned that lesser number of p&ls is one of the goals to bring in simplification, which actually runs contrary to the conventional wisdom in which as you gain size, you break the organization down into smaller units to create or to retain agility of course, with clearly defined kras. so i couldn't completely get the perspective -- your perspective on when you say that you have lessons of p&ls. i mean how does that bring in agility. so just your thoughts on these?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
okay. okay, perfect, perfect. okay, two good points. thanks, kawaljeet. so looking at the first one, which is about the priorities. your point is those priorities require change and yes, they do. yes and i think it's the reality in our industry. we must be in a state of constant change. we are constantly challenging the way we are addressing the market, the way we are working and you know, the way we can be more agile. there is -- i always take the example of the number of layers and the span of control is in an organization like ours and i'm not speaking for wipro, whatever the organization i'm in. this is something, if you're not keeping an eye on it, it will constantly drive, it will increase. you will have more layers of leadership with people controlling controllers and you will have lower span of control, so people managing very small teams and so on and so you need to constantly challenge your o&g [phonetic].
me joining the organization i think it's very healthy to obviously look at the organization and the way we are working with a fresh pair of eyes and i find the organization extremely receptive and really, really positive about keeping what makes us so strong and so having strong relationship with our clients, but also having a incredible strong identity internally, which makes the people of wipro loving the organization, but also identifying what can be refined, where we can drive improvement. if you look at the six priorities or the five priorities, sorry, there's only five priorities, they do drive some change, but i don't think it's breaking any of the way we are working today. it's actually going to improve the five -- free up time from internal for more time for the clients and keeping the focus for the clients.
if you look at the five points, it's all about points, it's all about the clients. the way we are leveraging and investing into our existing account, the way we are developing strategy and the team that can go after large deals bringing expertise in commercials, in negotiation, in managing complex programs following different cycles because this is a very long process usually to drive large deals.
all of that will come to an addition to what we have and clearly will certainly allow us to have better results. same thing for the partners. it's about connecting with the partners, but connecting in an aligned fashion with a strategic road map, if you like in term of directions, but also in term of ambition and i think its all about connecting day-to-day and working with partners on real opportunities. it's not at the corporate -- at the design level. if you look at the focus and scale, which is looking at the sectors and the market where we want to have an impact, it's the same thing. it's about saying which one matters to us today and where we feel we can really, really increase our chances of winning and try and find more growth and put more stake into it, more align our efforts as opposed to spread them around. i think it's the same focus for the market.
i can go through the last three. i mentioned the simplified operating model, which is about spending less time internally. i'll come back to your second question, but if you look at talent, it's also important and i think when you have a talent agenda, it's about constantly thinking about, ok, do we have the best team, how can i improve the quality of some on my team. how can i unleash the potential of our teams. how can we give them more power, more responsibility, more accountability so they can have bigger impact, but also how do we invest in them, how do we grow them, but also how do we bring talent from the outside. all of that is obviously driving change. there is no question on that.
on your second point, on the less p&ls and your point around smaller units. agility comes -- the necessity in our industry is to get the people who is the closest to the client having the power or having the power to make decisions whether it's about adjusting the offering or the solution to be -- to meet the expectation of the client or whether it is to deliver quality for the customer and the rest of the organization need to align and support this client team to make sure that we are not only able to produce good offerings or good solutions, good proposals, but obviously win them and deliver with great quality. p&ls do not matter to our clients. p&ls are operational needs to control the operations and drive processes and alignment from an internal standpoint. okay, so that's where i see the difference to me. p&ls are obviously needed to really manage our operating models, to manage the performance, to control the costs, but the clients doesn't need to see that. it does not rely on p&ls.
and then my second point on p&ls, 25 years in this industry, being -- wrestling with this question multiple times as you can imagine. every time you have one p&l more, you create one wall more in the organization. okay, so if you want to have a small unit and with a p&l for each unit, you're going to have many, many walls and everyone will have his own agenda and go after his own client with his own offering and that's not wipro. we want to have a one wipro in front of our clients selling everything we have and giving access to the client to every assets we have, leveraging all the best talents we have and that is the philosophy we are going after, and that is absolutely in line with the objective of agility.
kawaljeet saluja -- kotak -- analyst
that makes a lot of sense. appreciate your insights, but i mean i just squeeze in one more question. this is for jatin. jatin, given that buyback is nothing but -- the tender buyback is nothing but an alternative form of dividend distribution in which the price really does not matter that much. i was just curious why you were so stingy with the premium to the current market price on the buyback as such.
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i thought kawaljeet you would say that we are -- we have been very spontaneous about it, but you are not mentioning that, but i will respond to that in a way -- we looked at both 60 days weighted average movement -- volume weighted average stock price movement and since the share price has done well, you know, that has been one consideration and the second one is compared to the previous calls which was yesterday, what should be the price and that's how we determine. the third factor we also place is the accretion at eps level and -- which is quite a moderate a small number, even at this price and that we wanted to keep it. so these are the three factors which have played out, kawaljeet, in our decision of the share price determination.
kawaljeet saluja -- kotak -- analyst
okay, my objective was not be critical. i was just curious more than anything else. nonetheless, great job. thanks, jatin. thanks everyone.
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the next question is from the line of pankaj kapoor from clsa. please go ahead.
pankaj kapoor -- clsa -- analyst
yeah, hi. thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on a good quarter. thierry, of course, we will look forward to a more detailed overview on your business plan next month, but just a couple of points before that. first, i mean, the changes that we are planning to initiate, if these are just incremental in nature then you think just tinkering may not really help wipro bridge the kind of a differential in growth that it has versus companies versus the peer groups. and conversely, if you are indeed planning more structural sweeping kind of changes, then shifting the focus through internal issues in the current environment may again not be the most sensible thing to do. so i'm just curious how you are planning to balance the approach in between these two extremes. that's the first question.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
yes, pankaj, thanks for the question. i mean that's what i've tried to articulate in couple of questions. there is no doubt that -- a couple of things, one is change is ok and we are going to make some changes and i've never hide it and i said it after a few days, we are going to make some changes and that's ok, changes are fine. in our industry, we must be able to constantly challenge ourselves and make changes and adapt to the evolution of the market, to the evolution of the industry and we are in the industry that is changing rapidly, but you're absolutely right, we don't want to have people spending their time internally. that is definitely not the right thing to do. that's why for me when i look at actions, it's all about the market, it's all about clients. you do not see the five points, me telling you, we are going to cut cost here and there.
i'm not saying we are going to spend hours and weeks and months in mobilizing the teams to reflect on who we are and where we are going and so this is not at all, it's all about execution. it's all about execution in the field. it's all about connecting with the client, ok. what we are doing through these five actions is basically enablers. it's actually weapons, it's arming our teams, our client teams whether they are sales or whether they are delivery with things that they did not necessarily have with the same level of efficiency in the past and they will have it and they will be stronger and that's really how i see it. so at the end of the day, there is more intensity in the field than it has ever been and that's obviously not me saying that. this is my colleagues telling me that. this is the feedback i'm getting from speaking to the teams. over the last three months, i have connected internally with not only with clients, i've connected with a lot of our employees. i have had multiple obviously town hall, i mean virtual town halls as you can imagine, multiple calls with the vice presidents, the level below, the management teams, the different groups, senior and more junior, constantly connecting with people, including groups of very, very junior people that i'm speaking to every week for one hour and really getting their feedback.
the focus on the market is greater than ever. there is intensity, we measure that, we track that. we really expect from everyone to hit the market every day. i have a simple philosophy, i never do one day without a client, whatever it is, even a day like today. you know, at least one client in the day and i expect the same from my leaders. i expect the same from all the people that are market-facing, connecting with the client every day, listening to them, understanding from them what are the priorities and obviously acting and be proactive. if you look at the five points that i've elaborated and i'll tell more obviously about them when we are together, but clearly, it's about equipping you know the greater sense of focus doesn't keep you away from the market, right?
having a big deal team doesn't keep you away from the market. continue to invest in talent doesn't take you away from the market. so all of that is going to end in actually simplifying the organization. we're certainly not like the people more internally focused. what next they literally focus is having endless rounds of controls, of reviews, of internal meetings, of events and the second thing is if the model is leaner and simpler, you actually have a simpler accountability, you have more responsibilities. you are not wondering always if you have the power to make a decision or not, you just go. you do it and you move forward and i think it's driving agility. that is the objective.
pankaj kapoor -- clsa -- analyst
got it. so just the second part, thierry, does your changes, are you also understating some investments to be made as part of these restructuring and if so, any quantification of the investment that we would like to make?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
investments to be made in restructuring. i don't expect, again, it's not cost-cutting as a size. we are organizing, we are gearing up our growth engine. so this is clearly the focus. i'm more speaking about choosing the places where we want to invest and focus the investment there as opposed to spreading the investment. that's more how i see the things. i'm not saying you know, you should not expect to dip in the bottom line while we are working on that. that's not, that's not the point. the organization is more -- it's more about really choosing where to place your investments and place twice more where it matters rather than one a little bit everywhere.
pankaj kapoor -- clsa -- analyst
understood. thanks all and wish you all the best.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of sandeep shah from equirus securities. please go ahead.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities -- analyst
yeah, thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on good execution and the guidance as a whole. thierry, just first question is in terms of the simplification of the process, do you believe that process may require a higher release time or it could be contrary where you can achieve a faster achievement of the goals, which you desire as a whole. and second, five of your priorities, that is i think more mention about the profitability focus. so will this assume that there could be simplification may lead to more flexibility on the commercial aspect of the growth and hence in the near-term to actually gain the lost wallet share. we can compromise a bit of margin just in the near-term while on the medium to longer-term we win the lost wallet share, we can come back on the profitability.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
no, no, no. so i'm not sure i fully understood because your tone was going a little bit down on the first part of your question. so if you can explain or remind me, but i will cover the second one. no, you know, i'm not a believer of -- we focus on growth today and productivity or profitability will come tomorrow. i always communicate on profitable growth. i believe that profitability is a discipline. it's like cash management and so you should never lose sight of your margins. could it be that when you go and get a very large deal, you have a slightly lower profitability level, it's a possibility, but that's not at all as a strategy, it's not at all we are saying, ok, we are going to focus on growth now and profitability later. no, we do focus on both and we are -- we've said it. jatin has said it. we are going to -- we are communicating on the growth, 1.5% to 3.5% for q3, but we also don't expect the margin to drop from where we are. on the -- can you remind me your question number one.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities -- analyst
yeah, just in terms of implementation of your strategy which is more on simplification. do you believe you require a deep dive or do you believe simplification actually can be implemented fast and there maybe a faster achievement of the results?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
it depends. we have different streams and we have some fix that can be done rapidly, some takes a little more time. usually, my philosophy is you know processes can be fixed rather rapidly. system takes a little more time. people take a little more time again, even more time because -- so it's more attention to change management. it is obviously working in depth on systems and it's identifying the processes where we can simplify, sometimes leverage technology of course, but also review the different steps and see how we can make it more agile and more efficient for everyone. so at the end of the day, some can be fixed rapidly, some will take a little more time. this is the road map we're going to work on.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities -- analyst
okay and just last question overall, in terms of cloud and infrastructure which contributes as big as 25% of the wipro's revenue, most of the peers are saying that the demand recovery rebound acceleration has been largely driven through migration to the cloud. despite wipro being a sizable player, we are not seeing that wipro is benefiting out of the same. so what is the strategy behind that?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
yeah, i think what we have seen is two things. we've had in acceleration of our cloud business, but we've seen also a reduction of our legacy infrastructure business. so i think you really have two trends that are different and you should see a better growth on the cloud side in the quarters to come because i agree there is an increase in demand. there is no doubt.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities -- analyst
thanks, fair enough and all the best.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the next question is from the line of diviya nagarajan from ubs. please go ahead.
diviya nagarajan -- ubs -- analyst
thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good execution during the quarter. thierry, my question to you is you have outlined a strategic priorities as well as your outlook on balancing profitability with growth, but what kind of a timeline are you looking at for this to play out in the sense that what is the time period looking at for the organization to come back on a sustainable accelerated revenue growth rate?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
yeah, that's a good question. diviya. this is a good question. there is no doubt. so you remember last quarter was my first time with you in this role. i could only comment on expectation of stabilization for q2 and didn't want to project our self and guide for q3. so q2 has turned to be a rather good quarter and we are now in a position to project for q3. i'm not projecting and guiding beyond. so, that is clear, but it doesn't mean that we're not working on a trajectory that goes beyond the quarter. the objective are being clear. the objective is to resume, to get back to the level of growth of the best of our competitors and we will get there. how many quarters we'll take future will tell frankly. i'm not in a position to tell you it's going to take x or y quarters, but we will gear up driving those five pillars. we will see how we are getting there, but i'm very confident that we will be there at some point in time, quarter-after-quarter we will reduce the gap.
diviya nagarajan -- ubs -- analyst
fair enough. i'll probably try a different angle when we meet at the strategy discussion. just a couple of book-keeping questions maybe jatin can take this. what is the inorganic component embedded in the q3 guidance. and secondly, what's the thought on wage hikes either systemwide or selective that you are planning?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
sure, jatin, you want to take this one? saurabh?
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so diviya, there is two things, one is that the acquisitions, which are already done, they are in the run rate. they have been factored in the guidance. as you know, they are very strategic, but they are not like large acquisitions. so we are not calling that number out and similarly, eximius that we have announced is going to get closed in quarter three. so whatever it comes, we have factored in the guidance. again, we are not calling out -- these are not large acquisitions which bring the numbers meaningfully.
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
and this just -- on wage hikes, the number of employee interventions planned in q3. one is that we will bring promotions for eligible population or 80% of eligible population and the increments which we will give them would be what we gave last year pre-covid, 8% to 10% offshore and 4% to 5% on-site. so that's what we will do. second is we will also take care of the freshers we've hired and their increment for them. so these are the actions, which we were taking and ring fencing critical employees. so all our high-performers, good talent people, we will make sure they get taken care off.
diviya nagarajan -- ubs -- analyst
i'm sorry. and this is effective 1st october i presume. is that correct?
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
1st december, 1st december.
diviya nagarajan -- ubs -- analyst
1st december. got it. thank you. thanks and all the best for the rest of the year.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of sudheer guntupalli from icici securities. please go ahead.
sudheer guntupalli -- icici securities -- analyst
yeah, hi, thierry. first of all, congrats and all the best for your new innings. for quite some time now, wipro has been targeting to reach industry matching organic growth rates. now that you have finished your deep dive into the underlying potential of the company and articulated your strategy changes etc, how confident are you on driving wipro toward that goal post over the next let's say two to three years and what are the challenges you are anticipating in your journey?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
you know, sudheer, i am confident. i am confident because i know well this industry and i know that there is nothing that is a miracle in this industry, but when you apply a certain level of discipline around the key drivers of growth, you get growth. okay, wipro is a very strong organization. it has all the assets it needs. we have wonderful people. the values of wipro are unique and our clients know it. we have -- we are working with a unique sense of purpose that has been transmitted by the founders and frankly, we have very strong assets.
i am absolutely confident that working on these different axes, we will continue to accelerate and i think that is -- that is what is required is now -- you know, i don't think there is -- nothing in these five priorities are going to go up against each other. there is a complementarity in alignment, when i speak to the teams, i feel that there is a very, very positive mood and people are really excited to engage on those fronts. and so at the end of the day, i am confident, absolutely.
sudheer guntupalli -- icici securities -- analyst
sure, thierry. while i do understand and agree with your response to your previous question on how p&ls do not matter much to the clients, as we reduce the number of p&ls and as i understand it, it may lead to some sort of reversal of the current level of delegation in the organization. in that case or in that picture of a centralized one wipro, don't you foresee the risk of let's say, internal bureaucracy increasing and some of the erstwhile owners of p&l actually becoming different [phonetic]. i'm asking this question because one of our close competitors who had been very successful often cite their highly delegated organization structure as one of the key reasons behind their success and last part of the previous question which is the challenges that you foresee?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
no, no, i'm a believer of power in the field. i'm a believer of the decentralized power. alignment centrally power decentralized. this is how you are driving entrepreneurship culture and where you are empowering people to make decisions, people are good, they are moving forward as opposed to having organization that are frozen because people are waiting for someone at the center to make a decision. so there is no doubt in my mind that you know the decision must be -- the closest to the client -- the closest to the field, the decision must be, it doesn't mean that this is a, you know a big democracy whatever but he is doing what he wants. that's the power of alignment. that's the power of alignment.
that's why creating a one wipro where there is a common strategy, there is common objectives set, there is a clear understanding from everyone of the directions that allow people to really understand each of those targets, but the people who are in front of the client must be able to make decision to react and to move ahead. so i hope you follow me. for me, there is no question that the power -- the decentralization of the decision process is critical to drive a culture of entrepreneurs and accelerate the speed of decision.
sudheer guntupalli -- icici securities -- analyst
sure, thierry, any challenges and risks that you see for your changes or for your strategy. that's it from my side. thanks and all the best.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, good day and welcome to wipro limited q2 fy '21 quarterly investor conference call. as a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. [operator instructions] please note that this conference is being recorded. i now hand the conference over to ms. aparna iyer, vice president and corporate treasurer. thank you and over to you.
aparna iyer -- vice president and corporate treasurer
thank you, aman. a very warm welcome to our quarter two earnings call. we will begin the call with business highlights and overview by thierry delaporte, our chief executive officer and managing director, followed by a financial overview by our cfo, jatin dalal. afterwards, the operator will open the bridge for question and answers with our management team.
before thierry starts, let me draw your attention to the fact that during this call we may make certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of private securities litigation reform act 1995. these statements are based on management's current expectations and are associated with uncertainties and risks, which may cause the actual results to differ materially from those expected.
the uncertainties and risk factors are explained in our detailed filings with sec. wipro does not undertake any obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect events and circumstances after the date of filing. the conference call will be archived and a transcript will be made available on our website. over to you, thierry.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
yes, thank you, aparna. so good morning, good afternoon, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. it's a true pleasure to really speak with all of you today. since our last interaction we had in july, you know, it was a few days after i joined wipro, there hasn't been a single day without meeting a customer. over the last three months, i have met over 100 customers and more than 20 partners. our customers are very clear. they appreciate our passion for innovation, they like and respect our values, our work ethic, our culture. they really perceive us as a partner who brings deep technology expertise, but also industry focus and collaborates with them to build business solutions.
when i was reflecting on all these meetings that i've had with them, i felt quite good about the quality really of the relationship built with our clients over the years, strong, based on solid common values, on trust and trust in our ability to deliver on the conviction that we know them well that they see us as a true partner working with them, helping them transforming their organizations. so the context is good. now, let's reflect on what has happened over the last months.
there is no doubt that the context for our customers has changed enormously through the pandemic. what we are observing is that while the traditional it services will continue to be important, the next big wave of opportunity will clearly be driven by next-generation services of cloud, digital transformation, iot, 5g. enterprises in the post-crisis world are transforming their technology stack so that it really enables them to operate with flexibility, with agility. a large portion of our customers feel the need to accelerate digital transformation to stay relevant. in fact, i haven't had one single meeting with a cxo where we did not discuss about the need to accelerate this transformation.
digital transformation of both the front-end to gain better access to markets, to add an additional sales channel, and on the back-end also, to improve efficiency and drive cost optimization. modernization including cloud, automation, ai is really top tech priority. there is also i feel a clear flight to safety and trust has become more critical than ever in cyber security, in data, but also in partnerships. fewer [phonetic], stronger partnership is what everyone is looking for.
few examples of how we helped a customer accelerate digital transformation. so we have a business -- personal online banking customer in uae intended to transform not only its existing products and services, but also disrupt and lead the market with new disruptive possibilities. wipro helped the bank to transform into digital experience by deploying digital 2.0 mobile app for retail customers. another example, a leading multinational oil and gas company in the u.k. who partnered with wipro on operating model transformation for cloud migration journey. the exit of america data centers helped the customer in cloud-first strategy and is the foundational core in modernization journey of going digital.
so when it comes to engagement, our customers are clear about how they want to work. they want us to be global, but they also need us to be local. while they are becoming increasingly comfortable with the virtual, the remote, and distributed work model versus physical, they also want proximity with their client partners who can then provide them the business solutions with local context and an industry expertise. we want at wipro to be a trusted partner to our clients in their transformation journey and we want to enable them in achieving leadership position in their respective industries, which brings us to the charter or set of priorities that i have drawn or we have drawn for ourselves and i will focus on five.
first, absolute growth focus. we will continue to invest in our existing accounts, shape large transformation deals through best-in-class sales excellence and leverage our partnerships with large technologies. second is about focus and scale. we will prioritize the markets and sectors that are relevant for us and ensure we are in a leadership position in our chosen markets. third, in terms of offerings, we will continue to expand our presence beyond it office, structure vertical solutions, leveraging our ecosystem of partners both the large technology players and the start-ups.
fourth point is about talent. we will invest in specific capabilities such as domain expertise, digital transformation architects, large program managers, technology experts, investing talent to reinforce innovation, business understanding, technology skills. we will reinforce the high performance culture to build the champions league of talent. and finally, fifth point is about simplification of our operating model. we need to be agile and empowered at the edge, which means a leaner organization completely centered around our clients. i know you will have plenty of questions. we plan to do an analyst and investor day sometime next month and i will share more details then, right?
now, let me now give you all a quick update on q2 '21 performance. we had an excellent quarter with growth on revenue, expansion on margin, lower employee turnover, and solid growth of operating cash flow. looking at the revenue, the revenue growth of 3.7% in reported terms and 2% on constant currency terms was broad-based and was led by a robust pickup in volumes. the fresh volume we added has been highest over the last many quarters. we also hired over 13,000 people during the quarter. our stated guidance for q3 '21 despite the seasonality of furloughs reflects this business momentum.
from a sector view, consumer sector will grow faster on the back of sort of solid deal wins. we remain also optimistic on financial services, though it will be impacted by furloughs. energy and utilities and technology sectors will return to growth in q3. and finally, communications, manufacturing, healthcare and life science will continue to grow moderately. if we look at the demand environment, it has improved from q1, no doubt. the intensity of sales activity continue to rise and the pipeline is robust. the overall pace of decision making has improved though i find it still a bit slower on the larger ticket hunting deals.
now, looking at margin. we expanded our operating margins during the quarter by about 20 basis points to 19.2%. this was definitely led by operational improvement of about 80 basis points offset by 60 basis points of impact of appreciating rupee. the higher offshore mix improved utilization, lower employee attrition, and the benefits of lower subcontracting aided the operational improvements. besides, we continue to emphasize on employee safety as most of our employees continue to work from home globally. i want to, by the way, thank them all for the incredible hard work and tenacity which has helped us deliver these results. i'm quite excited frankly about the opportunities that lay ahead of us and very encouraged by the acceleration in business momentum we have seen this quarter. with that, i hand it over to jatin for his comments on the financial performance for q2 '21. jatin, over to you.
jatin dalal -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you very much, thierry. so, good evening, good morning to all the participants who are joining us on the call. you know, it has been a very good quarter of execution. if i can take you back to the beginning of the quarter, we had mentioned that we are looking at a stable quarter in quarter two and we have delivered a 2% sequential growth in constant currency. as we look at quarter three, we have guided for 1.5% to 3.5% in constant currency. that is reflective of some of the momentum in volume aspect that thierry spoke about.
from margin standpoint, we had mentioned that we will keep our margins in a narrow band excluding the impact of currency, but we have been able to offset the adverse 60 basis point on account of appreciating rupee and still delivered 20 basis point expansion of margin at 19.2%. if you see our cash flows, the cash flows have been quite robust. we delivered 127% of operating cash flow as percentage of ebitda and our free cash flow was 164% of net income. as a result, at the end of quarter two, we had a net cash of $4.6 billion. if i talk about forex performance, the rupee appreciation did impact our realizations. we delivered inr75.12 for every dollar in quarter two.
overall, i want to also talk about two more things. first is about the buyback. we have delivered -- we have announced that the board has approved, subject to the shareholder approval as well as the regulatory approvals that maybe appropriate, a buyback of inr9,500 crores, excluding the tax impact. if you add back the tax impact, that number is around inr11,600 crores, which is higher than the number that we had considered for buyback in our last round. overall, we feel that this is a great return of the cash to our shareholders. $1.3 billion of buyback to the shareholders and another roughly $300 million of tax costs if i include, then $4.6 billion would be roughly $3 billion and i think that is something that we should keep as part of our strategic flexibility.
i also want to talk about an exciting acquisition that we have announced today. eximius design is one of the leading players in vlsi and system design space and we would be very happy to welcome them as part of overall wipro engineering group during the course of quarter three. overall, we had good quarter and we are looking forward to continuing to execute in quarter three as well. we will be happy to take your questions from here on. thank you.

thank you very much sir. ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]. the first question is from the line of moshe katri from wedbush securities. please go ahead.
moshe katri -- wedbush securities -- analyst
hey, thanks. congratulations on the strong quarter and happy new year everyone. i just wanted to kind of get your feel on how long will it in your view take for wipro to be able to show growth rates that are comparable with some of your peers? and at this point, obviously you've had better than expected results for the quarter. the quarter has been strong for many other peers in the sector. are you still growing, probably at half a rate compared to some of your larger peers and what do you need to do to get there at this point? thanks.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
moshe, thanks for your question. i think it's a very -- if we understand the question, this is clear that we have defined a strategy to really go back to the leading board in term of growth, we know it's going to take some time. we -- it takes first to walk before you run and what we've said is that we would go from a situation where we hadn't stabilized the business in q2 to a growth pattern and then accelerate, get to the same level of growth of then our competitors and then accelerate after. it's going to take several quarters to get there, how many, i cannot tell you now, but what is clear is that we are seeing a -- we are seeing the journey, we are seeing the trajectory and we are executing step after step along these lines.
what we see as well is that, you know, with the increased focus on growth, with the focused investments into areas that we believe are going to drive higher growth than others, by investing in some of the market that are key to our success, by investing in talent and so on we will continue to support our journey and our roadmap.
so bear with us. we will not be telling you -- you know, making you promise one or two years ahead of time. we are going to execute consistently, and you will see the -- you will see the consistency of the trajectory quarter after quarter. for now it's clear that the demand is good, the market is good, and our level of optimism is here.
moshe katri -- wedbush securities -- analyst
okay. just as a follow-up.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
sure.
moshe katri -- wedbush securities -- analyst
just to confirm what i heard. are you comfortable that some of the margin gains that you had in fiscal '21 are sustainable looking into fiscal '22 and obviously, the new pandemic driven working or work from home model has given you guys a lot of flexibility and the real question here is what's sustainable into next year and what's not. thanks a lot for all the color.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
absolutely. thanks, moshe. jatin, you want to take this one?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
sure, thierry. moshe, as you know, the margin momentum has three effective levers for wipro. we spoke about it earlier in the day. one is the revenue improvement this year. revenue growth creates operating leverage on fixed expenses. that has helped certainly. second is a significant offshoring over the course of last four quarters. our offshore mix as you can see in our data sheet has improved by approximately 6%, over the course of the last four quarters.
and the third is, we have been able to manage our utilization in a very tight range especially in quarter three, adjusted for leave we have done quite well. so the first component of the saving, which is related with fixed expenses remaining at a lower level given the situation of pandemic will slowly go away during the course of next six months to nine months and that is the reality that we have to prepare ourselves for.
but the revenue momentum if it continues and offshoring it remains, then some of those advantages may stay with the -- within the operating margin. we'll have to -- we'll have to see how situation pans out, moshe.
moshe katri -- wedbush securities -- analyst
understood. thank you.

thank you. the next question is from the line of sudheer guntupalli from icici securities, please go ahead. mr. guntupalli, your line is unmuted, please unmute the line from your side and go ahead. sudheer guntupalli from icici securities, your line is unmuted. please go ahead with your question. as there is no response, we take the next question from the line of sandeep shah from equirus securities, please go ahead.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities private limited -- analyst
yeah. thanks for the opportunity, and thanks for sharing some data points from the deal wins. the first question is in terms of any quick learning in terms of a change in the operating model which helps wipro in terms of a faster creation of the pipeline or a conversion of a pipeline into deal wins? and just a related question, this quarter we have won 12 deals with a tcv of $1.2 billion. so if i exclude the metro ag, the deal wins at $500 million includes acv, the average tenure of close to $45 million, $50 million. so thierry just wanted to understand whether these deal wins on larger size, are we making a practice to win every quarter, otherwise, it may become sporadic and the deal win momentum may die down in the coming quarter as a whole?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
very true. okay. hi, thanks sandeep. so, question on the operating model first. the operating model we have built has the following strengths. one, it's a leaner model. it has many less p&ls, we've reduced the number of p&l from something like 26 down to four, adding up at my level, four. so that means a lot less walls inside the organization, a lot less silos and a lot more opportunity for people to work together.
second, we have put in place an organization where strategic market units are the one managing the account and managing the client relationship in a given geography or in a given market are working hand-in-hand with the global business line who owns the expertise, who owns the solutions, who define, who invest in talent, right, and owns the delivery.
and those team work together and that is the logic of one wipro. what it does is that you have actually less people focusing on managing or controlling the internal, you have more people involved on deals, more people working on opportunities and working with clients, more people exposed to clients, less need to manage operation in the organization. so you are nimble.
so the efficiency, i mean, obviously we've moved into this model on january 1st, so it's going to be a little bit early stage to see visibly the results. but what is clear is the following. one, we're only in january 13, but the whole organization is already in place under the new model. and that's in itself the proof that the model was well designed and well implemented.
second is the level of intensity that we've had over the last three months. on the way we are working on opportunities, mobilizing forces around the group, leveraging the capabilities and the references we have given there has been very, very high -- very high intensity. third is, we have moved from a quarterly tracking of sales activities to a monthly tracking of sales activities and that has undoubtedly driven a change, a shift in level of intensity and discussions around deals. just to give you more examples, we hold an executive committee every week, more than 50% of it is focused on deals and on deals exclusively.
so if we're not focusing time on internal discussions, but really looking at our clients, connecting with our clients, i have never one day without talking to a client, and i know the team is doing the same, has the same level of intensity. and on -- from that standpoint, i think we are more present in the market, more ambitious and more active than ever.
second is, i think the possibilities that we've already started to implement in q3 to focus investments and make some bold moves in some areas where we are convinced this is strategic. instead of having an organization where every unit was deciding its own priorities, we have now an alignment of priority, it helps us to move faster and stronger. we have made also some decisions in terms of -- in order to respond proactively to situations or clients who are exposed to in the context of covid and i think it's been well received as well.
so i would say, it's the beginning of this journey in the new operating model, but this is promising. and the last thing i would say is that based on the survey we run internally, the feedback and the level of adoption and understanding and support of the teams and leaders on this new operating model is very high. so the momentum is there.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities private limited -- analyst
okay. thanks. just a follow-up, the deal similar to the size of metro ag, more such deals are in the pipeline, and just a question to jatin, regarding the margins with q4 also there could be a wage hikes as an impact and peers are also announcing another round of wage hikes maybe in the next couple of quarters as one of your large peers has said next year would be a normal year. so, and thierry also said that our margins will continue to remain aggravated.
so jatin, is it possible to believe that the current quarter margins may continue with a narrow band movement which we generally you make a statement around that.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
so jatin, maybe before you respond, i'll just take the big deal question, the first part and i give this -- i'll let you to second one. so, your first -- your question on the big deal was, ok, you won metro, does it mean you're going to win one metro per quarter? okay. that's the plan, ok? so you know, again, we have moved from a place where we didn't have largely to a place where we have won, and now we are going to systematize. that is the logic of having created this big deal team, this large deal team.
we have -- we are structuring it, we are putting experts and knowledge. you do not go after large deals the way you go after a smaller deal. you need to bring different type of talent, expertise and caliber and we are putting that in place with the objective to obviously have a true big deal machine. for now we have some in the pipe and we are getting more. so this is the good news. but we are not yet at a place where we will have once -- one every quarter.
to you, jatin.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
thanks thierry. yeah, so sandeep, here is what -- what we have articulated. we definitely had a great quarter in quarter three with the 21.7% operating margin. we definitely have investments in the front line, sales capability consulting domain where we are hiring this cadre. we also have a host of investments on talent which thierry and saurabh have articulated since this morning, which means that quarter three margins were on higher side and in quarter four, we will not see those given these headwinds that we spoke about in terms of investments.
having said that, some of the benefits that we have seen during the course of last few months, which is that we have lower travel spend, we have lower facilities costs, those benefits will continue. we have an additional lever in terms of increased revenue momentum that should also play out. offshoring has increased significantly over last few quarters, that will also hopefully sustain. it cannot go out overnight in quarter four.
so some of the benefits will also continue compared to where we were in the beginning of the year and hence our articulation is that we will see a headwind of this investment. however, we will not go back to the levels that we were at the beginning of the year, but we will remain elevated from those levels.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities private limited -- analyst
okay, thanks, and all the best gentlemen.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. the next question is from the line of sandip agarwal from edelweiss. please go ahead.
sandip agarwal -- edelweiss securities limited -- analyst
hi, hello, can you hear me?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
yes, hi sandip.
sandip agarwal -- edelweiss securities limited -- analyst
hi, thierry and congrats to the whole management team for excellent execution and reaching top end of the guidance and also wishing you all happy new year and stay health, stay safe. so, i have only one question thierry is that what is our strategy toward this hyperscalers? how are we seeing the whole opportunity of the cloud and also are you seeing early signs of strong capex being pushed by the banking industry after a long period of gap? are you seeing this two trends and what is your, what would be your strategy to get this delta for our revenue growth? thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
okay, all right. so thank you. so you know, cloud for us is -- is a big part, is right at the center of our growth strategy, right. one because we historically had a position on the infrastructure side, a significant investment have been made over the last years. we have a strong relationship with you know companies like aws, google or microsoft. we've been with company like servicenow, like salesforce and so on.
we have invested and we want to really continue to accelerate on the cloud. so definitely, at the heart of our strategy, what do we see? we see an acceleration, a significant pickup in different markets. one in america where you know the cloud journey has started some years ago, we see an acceleration from pretty much every industry including from the bfsi sector, and banking and insurance. in europe, traditionally, a lot of companies were a little bit suspicious or careful with the public cloud adoption and therefore was going a little slower on the cloud transformation. and you know, i believe with the pandemic, they've realized the necessity to accelerate and therefore we see now an increase in volume of business in the pipeline, in terms of cloud transformation in america, in europe and in asia.
the relationship we have built with our partner are absolutely critical, i've actually gone to several clients together with the ceo of one of these large companies, as you know together and i think there is an equal understanding on both sides on the technology side, on the service side that you know, when we are together, able to offer a cohesive unified proposal to a client, we reduce a lot the level of risks for him, and this is what has been happening.
so i would say, you probably, i don't know if you realized also that in our five priority strategy laid out and presented to the market in november -- in october actually, we have presented a point around the way we want to leverage our relationship with partners. we have created a very tall partner relationship team inside wipro with a very senior leader managing this and vice president managing each of these relationships, so that we are taking them to another level. there is huge appetite on both sides. and for the discussions -- and i've engaged with all of them obviously, on deals not only at the corporate level, but on deals. there's equal appetite on both sides to work and you will hear more about the type of partnership that we will build together with several of them.
sandip agarwal -- edelweiss securities limited -- analyst
yeah. thanks. thanks a lot for the detailed explanation. and wish you best of luck for the current quarter. thanks. and wish you happy new year once again, thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you, sandip.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of sudheer guntupalli from icici securities, please go ahead.
sudheer guntupalli -- icici securities -- analyst
yeah, good evening, gentlemen, congrats on a good quarter and thanks for giving me this opportunity. thierry, for wipro historically h2 has been relatively better versus industry. secondly, given the drop in the revenue run rate over the first six months of this calendar and the subsequent recovery over september and december, mathematically there looks some more scope for residual recovery in march. in addition, we've also been talking about strong deals and momentum over the previous six months. so if we put these things into perspective, it looks like the outlook for the next quarter could have been tad higher. would be glad to know your thoughts if we are being conservative here or if there is some other element.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
no, i don't try to be conservative. i really try to define together with jatin and the leadership team, where we believe we will land. so there is no -- don't read any game here. i think this is just realize the context we are in, we have had certainly a good quarter, we continue to have a good quarter four as well. we are in the context of the transition into the new model, this is growing swiftly. but those are conditions that feel that probably we feel comfortable with the 1.5% to 3.5% growth for q4, which i believe is a good one. and more importantly, sudheer, also for us, the -- we have the ambition -- we don't want to shine one quarter, we want to build solidly quarter after quarter and be consistent. and i think this is -- this is the -- the rationale behind our communication as well.
so we are building solidly this growth engine.
sudheer guntupalli -- icici securities -- analyst
sure, thierry. and just one question for jatin, in terms of margins, of course, as you rightly pointed out earlier some of the factors like when travel will resume and all might not be under our control, so we may not be able to hazard a guess over there. but in terms of some of the aspects like utilization, how comfortable are we at the current levels? because, are we comfortable that this will sustain or probably there will be a round of hiring which can bring down the utilizations to an extent?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
so we have done a good job on utilization over i think last six quarters to seven quarters and we continue to do a good job. i'll request saurabh to share our talent planning strategy and how he sees the scope.
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
thanks jatin. so from a people supply chain, three aspects, one is on the hiring that i think is a very robust hiring we had 5,000 plus net adds 14,000 gross hiring and we see that momentum continuing. we on-boarded freshers in q3 and will continue in q4. and it's very broad-based across the globe. so that's one.
second is, attrition has held up for the last two quarters, we've been flat, but given the momentum in the market, i see this could be a rising trend in the coming quarter. and so, keeping these two in mind, if you look at our utilization for q4, net of leave is typically a seasonal quarter of leave, it is actually same as for q3 was same as q2. and if you look at it from a -- on a year-on-year basis, there's a nearly 4% increase. so i personally believe we could also have some head space of another person to two to look up in this area.
so this is a strong operational lever for us. but from a supply side, i'm comfortable that we will -- it will -- we'll make sure that we manage the growth momentum with no hiccups.
sudheer guntupalli -- icici securities -- analyst
sure sir. thanks and all the best to the team.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of girish pai from nirmal bang. please go ahead.
girish pai -- nirmal bang -- analyst
yeah, thanks for the opportunity. thierry just wanted to understand the nature of demand regarding cloud services. do you see this being compressed over say the next 24 months to 36 months, and after that kind of going to fall off? so i'm basically talking about infrastructure as a service demand. that's question number one, and then i have a subsequent question on the tcv.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
you know, i was smiling listening to your question at the beginning, because i feel i've heard this question for several years already and my conviction is absolutely the contrary, girish. so i think in my mind, it is going to be more, a lot more demand. the cloud environment is creating so much opportunity that companies will realize the potential of a true cloud environment on which they will want to develop new services, new solutions, new platforms, and so on and so i think for the foreseeable future, we will definitely serve on the cloud wave, but this is not a small wave, it's a very big wave. and we are not at 30% of it.
girish pai -- nirmal bang -- analyst
okay. jatin, a couple of data points, i want -- this $1.2 billion tcv, is this completely net new? and the other question i had was, you know, you were talking about restructuring of your collapsing the management structure from -- about people being reporting from like 24, 25 people to four people. how much of gains do you think you can extract from these two points? $1.2 billion tcv is this completely net new and the gains from the restructuring?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
yeah, girish. so first is, no it has both components in it, which means that, our renewal, as well as the new deals are part of this and we are not sharing the mix, but girish, especially for this quarter, it is easy for you to see a component of new, because metronom is sitting as part of this number and that you know is completely new.
so even in the rest of the -- rest you apply a normal percentage you will see that there is a significant component of new in this $1.2 billion. i'm just sharing a color on this quarter, we probably will not give that mix moving -- i mean as a data point, but this quarter is quite obvious for everyone to decipher.
sorry, your second question was, girish?
girish pai -- nirmal bang -- analyst
the gains from this collapsing of the management structure, you know, people reporting to just four senior top level managers compared to say 24, 26 people. how much of gains do you see from that?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
sure. you know, as we have said, for us this is around creating a simpler structure for a greater revenue momentum, a superior investment focus and sharper accountability. it's not around cost, i'll request saurabh to also add his perspective.
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
yeah, i think the reorg is about making the organization agile and more client-centric. so that's been the focus because our intent is to reinvest and really seeing a lot of leaders on boarding in the coming quarter as well as the next quarters as thierry called out earlier. so don't see that the cost exercised more, it is more about how do we make the organization more agile and client-centric.
girish pai -- nirmal bang -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of abhishek shindadkar from elara capital. please go ahead.
abhishek shindadkar -- elara securities (india) private limited -- analyst
yeah, hi, thanks for the opportunity. my question is, the revenue per employee now despite a shift in the offshoring, that number is flat on a quarter-on-quarter basis. so it seems, it may helped on the gross margins as well. so just wanted to understand how sustainable these gross margins are once we shift back to non-work from home environment?
and the second question is for thierry, whenever a large organization of wipro size goes through a reorg, there is a substantial amount of a margin lever. now, how much of the current quarter margins are coming from this reorg, and how much of it is kind of going to come over the next two, three-year period? thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
abhishek, frankly i'll take -- i'll take that one. so one, we've shifted to this organization model on january 1st, so again this would not reflect much in term of savings. but again to insist on what jatin said, yes, gdp is driving efficiency and productivity improvement, agreed. so what it means is that, you know, we will be more efficient and have a better impact in the market. but for the rest, the simplification and the rationalization of our model, we achieved somehow reducing the number, the need for many management roles is actually freeing up a lot of opportunities to reinvest into our future.
so that's how we are seeing. remember, we are really focused and obsessed about growth and want to really invest and prepare us with always more differentiated solutions, better offerings, and top talent. and so, the way we see things is we are constantly looking at ways to be more efficient, more nimble, avoid duplication, avoid inconsistencies, reduce layers of leadership, we have reduced the number of layers in our organization, increase the span of control and all of that driving savings that we are reinvesting into our engine going forward.
that is why also, of course, we believe we will be able to accelerate our growth.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
yeah. abhishek, i'll answer your first question. you know, revenue per employee as a metric is a great metric to track internally. it has various dimensions to it. first is, simply the price increases. second is offshore mix, third is, the type of services that you are selling obviously dop could have a much lower realization than it services. then there is an element of fixed price versus t&m.
so, you know we do track this internally and we are quite happy with the progress we have made over the quarters. but difficult to comment externally the movement and make it insightful for -- insightful for you beyond a point, but i can tell you that we watch it carefully every quarter, and we have comfort in the way we have moved. more prominent impacts in recent times has been on offshoring as i called out before, as well as accelerated growth that we have seen in our digital operations and platforms business.
abhishek shindadkar -- elara securities (india) private limited -- analyst

rishit parikh -- nomura -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking my question. just two questions from my side. [technical issues]. we've talked about some of the investments around sales, expanding into some of the strategic markets and hiring senior management, right. when do you expect that process to get completed? that's one. and second is, if you could just provide a little more color on what is the quantum of wage hike that you've planned in the next quarter. thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
rishit, i'm sorry, i really did not understand anything. you came very muffled. it was difficult to understand. can you -- any chance you can get closer to the phone or...
rishit parikh -- nomura -- analyst

thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director

what quantum, what? sorry, what -- the first question i understood. what quantum of...
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
quantum of pay hikes.
rishit parikh -- nomura -- analyst
quantum of wage hikes.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
okay. okay, quantum of pay hikes. okay. all right. so, i'll take the first one and saurabh i will give the -- i'll give you the second one, ok?
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
sure.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
so the -- to be honest, it's rishit, it's an ongoing process. we are going to be active on talent acquisition, very active, probably more than what you've seen us in the recent past. and so, you know, we are going to obviously, you will see every time we bring new talent in a new role, we have many key roles in the organization that will on board top talent in the near future. and i'm not talking here about six months from now. it's literally in the -- it starts in the weeks to come. and that's going to be as well the year of 2020.
certainly, you know, my view is that by the end of q4, which is, you know, the first quarter in the new model, we will have more or less all the key roles filled in, all the main key roles filled in. but then, we will continue to stay active. this is a journey as i said several times, so we will not consider we've arrived after three months, we'll continue to constantly invest and constantly look for the best talent in the industry.
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
rishit, on the wage hikes, as we have called out, three things, one is, specific to wage hikes, we will have about 80% of our workforce getting increases effective 1st of january. typically, this will have a wide range depending on performance and, but on an india basis between 5% and 6% will be an average wage hike and overseas we believe at being 1% and 2%. so that's how -- on an average versus wage hikes. this is in line with what is happening in the industry and what we had done in the previous years. apart from that, we've also done called out a 100% variable pay plans for q4 for all our employees.
so that's another factor to that.
rishit parikh -- nomura -- analyst
sure. thank you. and just -- i did not hear the earlier response, but the quantum -- the wage hike cycle will be as usual in the next year, right. is that what you're sort of aiming for or...
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
we will -- it's early because our next cycle typically is in june. so we will take stock of that at an appropriate time depending on what's happening in the market industry kind of stuff. but as of now, we have planned it for the people and the closer the date we will take stock on what we do for the next year.
rishit parikh -- nomura -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of dipesh mehta from emkay global. please go ahead.
dipesh mehta -- emkay global -- analyst
yeah. thanks for the opportunity. couple of questions. first about, we are seeing significant increase in impairment charges, and just wondered if ebitda margin expansion is even more substantial. so if you can provide some color how much -- how you expect this impairment charges to play out over next couple of quarters.
and second question is about india sre business, it's showing significant turnaround. do you think it is now more sustainable from operational performance perspective or you think we need to work around more to get more sustainable performance from india sre. thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
so i'll take -- i'll take the second question on the sre and i'll let you jatin answer the one on the impairment and strategy. so looking at the sre business, so we have confirmed or reaffirmed our strategy focus in the sre business in india. and from a topline standpoint, i think we are being a lot more selective and specific about the type of deals we are looking for.
and on the other hand, i think that frankly speaking, sanjeev singh, who is now head of operations for wipro since january 1st has done an excellent job to normalize, improve the quality of the operations, bring discipline and best practices inside the organization. and so, i think the work is done on the margin. i will let jatin complement. but on the margin side, it is certainly for good. it's not a one-off.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
that's right, thierry. dipesh, so -- as you have seen, this is also not one quarter phenomena. systematically, we have improved this margin by completing the unfinished projects by ensuring that the risk level in current execution is significantly lower and the surprises are well anticipated and dealt with, and they don't -- no longer come to additional expenditure to the company.
so overall, we feel very comfortable with the trajectory of performance on isre both from the quality of revenue standpoint and margin standpoint. however, this quarter numbers are obviously on a greater scale of 20% and that i don't think will sustain. it will remain early single-digit margins on a medium-term basis, that is our anticipated view of the sector. if it improves further, we will be also -- we'll be, of course, happy to share with you.
on impairment charges, yes, there has been some acceleration that we have -- we had to take in the current quarter regarding one particular item, which is built in the impairment charges and we don't anticipate that to recur. so it would be a one-off in the current quarter.
dipesh mehta -- emkay global -- analyst
is it possible to quantify?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
yeah, that is reflected in the financials, and beyond that, we have not shared a color on that, dipesh.
operator
mr. mehta, do you have any further questions?
dipesh mehta -- emkay global -- analyst
no, thank you.
operator
thank you. ladies and gentlemen, we take the last question from the line of nitin padmanabhan from investec. please go ahead.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec -- analyst
hi, good evening and happy new year to all of you. i had a question, it's a little theoretical. so if you look at the pandemic, i think incrementally clients are having more work being done offshore. and what do you think in terms of by when they possibly reach country risk thresholds or any such thing? and would you think that this is here to stay? or there's likely to be a reverse shift on-site at some point? so that was my question. thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
you know, it's an interesting question. i can -- look, you see it's only prospective at this point in time. this is trying to project. if i reflect on the discussion i've had with our clients, what has happened over the last nine months, they've learned -- it wasn't the case before, they've learned through this crisis that they can work with teams that are not at the office.
so distance suddenly has become a different problem or less of a problem, or at least a problem that they could not picture handling and that they actually realized they can handle. so there's definitely a reflection from many clients realizing that they can build, they can manage complex operations and operating model with teams that are not -- that are in the distance. so that's the first point.
the second point obviously is that there's also a realization that if you do so then, you also need to have a small or smaller very, very connected team locally. so it's actually really the two different aspects that play. one is, now we know that we can operate with a global model. we can operate with people working from home, and frankly, wherever your home is, right?
but also, it means you need to have pure team -- people who are really next to you, connected with you 100%, even more than before, which pushes the logic of having less partner but stronger partners, right? and so this is -- clearly, my view is that what we could offshore does not exist anymore. it's all shores, right? it's what -- it's the model under which a lot of clients will want to operate going forward. it will imply some people being close to them and people being away.
whether it will modify the percentage, up or down, it will be to be seen. but certainly, if there was one proof of what has happened over the last nine months, we can provide an outstanding support to a company and service to a company, including strategic services with distance.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec -- analyst
sure. that's helpful. as a follow-on, i think do vendors typically have country-risk metrics? and if that's the case, would they mandate having maybe offshore, but in other countries, other locations as well? and the second thing is, considering that there's such a strong pickup offshore for everyone, do you expect wage inflation at some point? and by when do you think the industry would reach a point where wage inflation would be a point to worry? thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
okay. so i'll let saurabh on the second point, although i could comment as well, but i'll let saurabh -- the first one, i would say -- and obviously, it's -- there's many companies, many clients who decide to have different platforms to leverage around the world and not necessarily limit to one single country. it can be the choice, and we can choose different places in south america, in eastern europe, in other places in asia. what is clear though is that at the end of the day, it's tough to know where this market and the scale and the quality of the talent is not evenly spread around the world. and so, you know that depending on the choices you make there will be, at some point in time a limitation in terms of scale.
that's why, in my view, india will continue to have a unique position, one in terms of concentration of technology expertise and talent, but also in terms of quality of the expertise.
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
and on your second part, very typically when we're seeing huge demand and huge hiring here the market is, we will see a pressure. but as of now, we don't see we are coming out of a period where the demand was less two quarters back. so we are very comfortable right now. but we'll assess that as it goes forward. but in any cycle if the demand is high, there would be a pressure on wage but not at the moment.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec -- analyst
sure. very helpful. thank you so much and all the very best.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director

thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
aparna, thank you and good evening ladies and gentlemen. really wishing you a very happy new year. it's a true pleasure to speak with you today. last year we witnessed some very unprecedented times and now with improved vaccine prospects, we are filled with optimism for 2021. and sincerely are hopeful that it will be a much better year for the society, for businesses, our clients and for us. i am also very happy to share with you that effective january 1st, so just literally 15 days ago, we have gone live with our new organization structure; an important moment for our company.
let me now give you an update on our q3 performance. i am pleased to share with you that we've actually had a second consecutive quarter of strong performance with healthy growth in revenues, acceleration in order booking, expansion of margins, sustained lower employee turnover and solid operating cash flows.
looking at it one by one, the revenue growth, 3.9% in reported terms, 3.4% on constant currency terms, is at the upper end of our guidance. our growth was the highest in 36 quarters. the growth in revenues were broad-based across sectors and market and led by a surge in volumes. on operating margins, we expanded our om during the quarter by 240 basis points to 21.7%. this again is the highest we have achieved in the last 22 quarters.
expansion was led by driving excellence in operations, focusing on improving the quality of revenues. several operating metrics are at our all time best, including offshore mix, utilization, attrition and optimized subcontracting. third, our overall order booking for the quarter grew double digit on a year-on-year basis. the order book was strong across sectors and service offerings and had a good mix of both large and small deals, which is always important for us.
we closed 12 deals with more than $30 million tcv each, and the tcv booked of these deals was over $1.2 billion. we also, as you know, closed our largest deal ever in continental europe with metronom. all of this was achieved while implementing the biggest transformation that the organization has seen in recent years. it's a real testimony to the stead fast execution capabilities and the committed one wipro team that we have in place whose relentless efforts are paying off.
now, let me provide some color on the underlying business performance. there is significant traction in market across all our key geographies. we saw good order booking across major geographies. in the u.s., the growth funnel add [phonetic] was very healthy and the order booking grew double-digit year-on-year.
we have consistently converted some of the large deals in europe which had -- which has resulted in europe growing faster on a year-on-year basis, at 1.4% in constant currency terms. we see demand in europe being particularly strong, and mostly driven by acceleration in the adoption of cloud, digital transformation and driving efficiencies in the core, leading to optimized cost.
now, from a sector view, i'm pleased to report that we had all cylinders firing, five out of seven sectors grew over 4% sequentially. consumer sector continues to trail blaze on the back of solid deal wins, growth in financial services is driven by demand across pretty much all sub verticals, led by demand in digital operations, primarily cloud infrastructure services also and digital transformation.
the momentum in energy and utility was led by utilities. however, we are beginning to see a ramp up in demand in oil and gas customers as well and encouraged by the deal wins we have. technology bounced back this quarter with a healthy growth despite the furloughs. communications and manufacturing continue to build on the momentum. and finally, healthcare and life sciences' performance was truly aided by a seasonal uptick in our health plan services business.
now looking at the demand environment, it has shown steady improvement in the last six months. the intensity of the sales activity continues to rise and the pipeline is robust. we are seeing heightened demand for our service offerings in digital transformation, in digital operations and in cloud infrastructure services in particular.
now, let me give you a few examples of some of our wins in digital operations and cloud infrastructure services space. first example, wipro won a multi-year, multi-million dollar engagement from a u.s.-based mortgage lender to provide customer service to the lenders' rapidly growing retail mortgage client base.
wipro will leverage its best-in-class mortgage centers in the u.s. and in india, business operation services and application development to power the customer aggressive growth strategy. second example, a u.s. based multinational food manufacturing company has awarded wipro a strategic multi-year global managed services contract for cloud and infrastructure for service desks and it services management.
as part of this engagement, we probably will also provide end to end infrastructure services including multi-lingual service desk, site support, workplace optimization, cloud on aws, cross-functional coordination tools, servicenow, sciencelogic. in addition, we probably will consolidate all infrastructure projects globally.
now, in digital transformation, we are witnessing significant business traction across three broad areas. one, clients are embracing the transformation of the it estate. and they're moving away from traditional it models and adopting business tech operating models and shifting the discussion toward [indecipherable]. second, our clients are investing significantly on digital business solutions. customer experienced transformation programs are becoming front to back initiatives including cloud transformation and not just on the key -- on omnichannel experience.
and third, clients are moving beyond the lift and shift of the workloads to the cloud, to exploit the automation and native capabilities and we are helping them link these directly to business goals. you know of that [phonetic] partnership with our strategic alliance to create joint solutions are leading to wins where we are helping clients transform their it and create business solutions. let me give you a few examples. with metro ag, a leading global wholesale food company, we've signed a five-year and over $700 million by the way, with the intention to extend up to four additional years for potential spend of $1 billion, a strategic digital and it partnership we've made toward it.
wipro will deliver a complete technology, engineering, solutions transformation program for metro, as it positions itself as the wholesale 360 degree provider in the trading, the cash-and-carry, the hotel, restaurant and catering food industry. wipro's transformation program will encompass cloud, data center services, workplace and network services along with application development and operations to provide an integrated, a flexible and robust digital infrastructure.
partnering with wipro allows metro ag to simplify and streamline the it landscape and critically give access to innovation and the best digital practices. next example we have been chosen as the transformation partner for bank in the u.k. to reimagine the customer journey and transform to be more a digital relationship bank delivered with cloud-first architecture. our cloud studio continues to build and leverage industry and horizontal patterns, enabling us to deliver business that would commence rapidly. final example for a leading healthcare provider, we have leveraged aws containerized solution to deliver complex data application in four months to meet the year end regulatory requirements.
now, on our outlook for q4'21. we've guided for a revenue growth 1.5% to 3.5%, which reflects the current demand environment. we feel confident that we will deliver this in our new and improved operating model. the last 90 days have been very busy for us as an organization, as you can imagine, but the good news is that we are moving in the right direction. the team is in place, and our focus now is only on growth and accelerating the momentum.
in our analyst day commentary, we have said that we have seen margins sustainable in medium term as you've observed, we have delivered significant margin expansion in q3, growth remains our top priority. we have begun to make investments in our frontline sales and domain specialist. for 80% of our employees, we completed the promotion cycle effective december 1st, and we will also be rolling out salary increases for them effective january 1st.
we've also announced a 100% variable pay out for q3 and for q4, which will make it three consecutive quarters of full payout. our margins for q4 will have headwinds of these investments, but will still remain elevated. to summarize, i must say i'm very excited by the acceleration in the business momentum we have seen in the quarter and optimistic about the year ahead of us.
with that, i hand it over to you, jatin for his -- for your comments on the financial performance for q3 '21. jatin, over to you.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
thank you very much, thierry. good evening, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. as always, great to talk to all of you. we had an excellent quarter of execution. our revenue growth was at just at the upper end of our guidance at 3.4% versus 3.5% at the upper end. margin expansion of approximately 240 basis point resulted in our operating profit growth year-on-year of robust 24%. we had a higher etr this quarter compared to q3 of last year, 22.1%. resultant, our net income growth was 20.8% that too improved significantly from our prior quarters.
let me now talk about the cash conversion. our cash conversion during the course of the quarter was very robust. we improved our dso days by approximately six days. overall, after first two quarters of robust performance we continued one more quarter where we delivered free cash flow at 133% of our net income and operating cash flow at 106% of our ebitda.
at the end of the quarter three, we had $6.2 billion of debt, of cash on the balance sheet and net of debt, our cash was $5.2 billion. let me talk about the forex. our realized rate for the quarter was $74.04, we delivered 0.3% positive margin uptick on account of forex. we had hedges of $2.7 billion at the end of quarter three. as you are aware, we are in the middle of a buyback program and we expect the overall process of buyback to get completed by the end of this month. the board of directors have also -- has also approved an interim dividend of inr1 per share in today's board meeting. these were my financial highlights and we'll be very happy to take your questions from here on.

operator
thank you very much, sir. ladies and gentlemen, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] your first question is from the line of sudheer guntupalli from icici securities. please go ahead.
sudheer guntupalli -- icici securities -- analyst
yeah. good evening, gentlemen. thanks for giving me this opportunity. jatin, just a clarification, metro ag, any change in the integration timelines? and after 2% to 4% guidance for june 2021, what is the contribution you're expecting from metro?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
yeah. sudheer, thanks for your question. we are not breaking out a specific deal or customer contribution to guidance, but certainly, it's a deal where the large component of the ramp up -- principal component of ramp up is happening from april 1.
sudheer guntupalli -- icici securities -- analyst
okay. so the ramp-up is effective from april 1?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
yes.
sudheer guntupalli -- icici securities -- analyst
yeah. okay. and my second question is for thierry. in terms of the deal win, if you can add further color on the renewals and make new deals, and what are these comes into, which areas are these comes into?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
so sudheer, so if i look at the performance or let's say, the activity on the sales front in the organization. one, we've mentioned the fact that if you look at our top deals, our key accounts or large accounts, if you like, they are driving growth, they are growing faster than the average of the organization, which is what it should be in. so that's a reflection of the fact that in our existing account, we are expanding our position. so through urls or through new urls, what we are doing in these accounts is certainly -- obviously, reinforcing our position by expanding leveraging the different solutions and offerings we have inside the organization. so increasing the number of our accounts that have more than one or two offerings and from wipro supporting them.
besides that we have had a very solid and strong performance in generation of new opportunities in accounts. we don't have in new accounts. and so i would say, frankly, you're right to be able to drive growth you really need to walk on two legs. we always say you need the hunters on one side who are going after new accounts and unique to farmers who are really growing existing relationship. and what we've seen over the last six months is that we've had some good wins, driven from hunter in new accounts. but over the last few months, the acceleration now existing account has picked up as well. and so that's, that's a reflection of the good activity in the market.
sudheer guntupalli -- icici securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks, thierry. one last question from my side. it has been some time since you had put the organizational changes into effect and we have seen a lot of leadership additions and changes over the past few months in the organization. so how do you think the employees of the company are taking these changes, in terms of their satisfaction levels about the organizational changes. any color on that would be helpful?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
sudheer, every weekend i organize a call with about 25 employees in the organization, really selected based on their birthday. so it's really people in the organization, oftentimes at junior levels to with whom to get a feel, but also obviously connect and know them, but also get a feel for how things are perceived and we are getting a lot of very good return on the direction taken. i think there is a great level of energy in the system of ambition as well and i would say, confidence in the organization. so people that are being really warm to the change and two new faces, i would say, we also -- obviously as you said, we've onboarded a quite a significant number of senior leaders in our organization in very different roles. the executive committee level five new members have joined the team over the last three months.
and i think what's happening is really positive, on one hand, they are very excited to join wipro and get to know better the culture and the values of this organization. the spirit that makes it so special and, but they're also bringing a different perspective, i'd say things from different to those organization that they have worked with. and the way they are being welcomed by wipro organization is really good. i can tell you very pleased with the way those new people are integrating very rapidly and very actively in the organization.
sudheer guntupalli -- icici securities -- analyst
sure. thanks, thierry. thanks, jatin. congrats on good numbers and all the best for fy '22.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
thank you, sudheer.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of ryan campbell from wedbush. please go ahead. ryan campbell from wedbush, your line is unmuted, please go to the question.
moshe katri -- wedbush securities -- analyst
hey. it's moshe katri. can you hear me?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
yes.
moshe katri -- wedbush securities -- analyst
hey, moshe katri from wedbush. a couple of follow-up questions here. first, did you disclose the mix from digital during the quarter and the growth rates there?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
moshe, we have not shared that number as part of the communication that we have done.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
yeah. but let me let me take that one maybe. so what we feel is that, i know that some other companies continue to report on what is digital or what's not. and what do we feel is that it's becoming a lot more and more blurred frankly. and so, and frankly, we are approaching percentages anyway where it's becoming the majority of the organization. so it's not really serving the way the evolution of technology works. so what we are doing is we have picked more specific offerings that inside, obviously the space around each dial in cloud and so on, to really drive high growth.
now to give you a view on the cloud, the cloud business for us, it's about a quarter of the revenue of wipro, that's growing double-digits, high double-digits, right. if you look at securities growing double-digits. if you look at a digital customer experience, this is growing double-digits. so we see that growth everywhere. there is no doubt to your equation, if i tried to read the question is, there is no doubt that the pandemic has accelerated the transition or the rotation from i would say legacy solutions and offerings to digital and cloud and data. and that's been also one of the reason why we are getting an acceleration to our growth, frankly, because we are well positioned in this space.
moshe katri -- wedbush securities -- analyst
okay. so if i asked the question a bit differently from your estimate, which part of the regular basis is not growing or actually shrinking at this point?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
what is -- what would be shrinking is asset av infrastructure business that is not in the cloud, that would be non-differentiated services because by definition, there is a -- there would be cost pressure on this that would weigh on your revenue line and those services are certainly being rapidly replaced by cloud, data engineering, security and so on.
moshe katri -- wedbush securities -- analyst
okay. and then which part of the bookings for the quarter was actually from renewals and maybe there is a way to look at this, also from an annual perspective for the fiscal year, which part of bookings came from renewals versus new logos?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
so, jatin, you tell me if we have that, but what i can tell you is that the performance in bookings over the last six months does not come from -- i would say a pickup of renewals and then usual pickup of renewals versus previous quarters. in fact, not the case. a lot of the growth we have seen is coming from new opportunities we have driven either proactively, in our existing accounts or these partners in other accounts. and so frankly, i would tend to feel that at least i would say, and i would let you jatin add, but i would say that there is not more -- there is not a bigger proportion of the bookings in the $7.1 billion tcv sign that is coming from renewal than what we would have at typically in the previous quarters.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
absolutely, thierry. i mean you articulated correct -- i mean in terms of the texture of this. and on the additional data point, moshe, we haven't broken 7.1 -- i mean we have not broken down this overall tcv that we have booked, but we can talk about the $1.4 billion of large deals that we have signed and most of it is new and very little of renewal there. to give you color of additional color as to how the business has come.
moshe katri -- wedbush securities -- analyst
that's great. and then final question for thierry. since you've announced the capco transaction. did you have some more time maybe to look at it? are you feeling more confident, less confident about the prospects here and any sort of incremental color would be helpful? thanks a lot.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
so lance levy and i are connecting continuously, ok. we are talking. we are obviously an in-patient to go through all the different steps to complete the process. we will, by the way complete the process on time within the timeframe that we had defined for it. the outlook -- i cannot consider the deal is not done, i need to apply some reservation to the view but it's positive, i can tell you it's positive. the trend is positive. the opportunities identified to happily connect the capco and the wipro sides of bfsi business on specific account has been, there is a long list. although, as you can imagine over the last month as we are talking to clients and connecting with them. they are absolutely expressing in-patient to start to engage with the capco team and start to really reflect on what it means and how we can leverage our new position and our capabilities to serve them more.
and so, to your point, which was, get a sense for feeling for my level of confidence: one, i've never -- no one, i mean we are, and i know we shared our chairman shared this view as well from a strategy standpoint. this was absolutely the right thing to do. and second, i think the process leading to the completion of the deal is running well. and third, everything i've heard in term of momentum and market impact at the moment on the capco side is positive. so, hopefully, soon more to come, but it's an exciting outlook for us.

thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
i'm sorry, i'm not been able to understand your question. it's referenced the supply, the supply side, but can you repeat?
manik taneja -- jm financial -- analyst
sure. thanks, thierry. so my question is with regards to retake cycle for the overall staff for fy '22. any thoughts on when do we plan to roll out wage hikes for the entire staff? that's question number one. and the second question was with regards to pricing trends in the market. just wanted to understand, are you seeing more progression toward scale-based pricing now, given the fact that customers have got much more accustomed to offshore delivery? and do you think that will be a margin lever for the industry as a whole over the next few years? thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
okay. so let me take the point -- the question two and saurabh, i'll give you the first one on the compensation evolution, the hikes in our organization. so on the first one, which is the price evolution. so, definitely, i think it was very clear at the beginning of the pandemic that the shock on the overall performance of a lot of companies in different industries has led them to drive significant cost reduction program even there. i don't think they have necessarily reduced the spend in it. they've certainly asked for a discounts and some [indecipherable] at that time, but that was more to help on the short-term.
from an overall spend, i don't think there is going to be a slowdown, if anything, in fact there is going to be an increase of the spend for technology over the next quarters. pricing, i would say, what i would say is, i have seen times where there was a tremendous pressure on price. i don't think we are in this period. i have seen period where -- but i've never seen a period where there is no normal pressure. so i would you say is, of course, if you are if you are working on solutions that are differentiated price, client is ready to pay the right price to get the right service because transformation, the stake -- what is that stake in the transformation is a lot more than what they potentially may say we little bit in the technology spend. so i think at the end of the day to your question, i would say, yes, there is a pressure on pricing but not more than what we've seen for many, many years, frankly.
and second is, when you own the right offerings, when you provide the right talent, the clients are willing to pay. the clients want to have the right talent. they want to have the best capabilities you can offer and that is for sure a requirement. saurabh, you want to maybe complement that one and take the first one.
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
sure, thierry. thanks. thanks, thierry. so manik, your question on overall rates hike for fy '22, let me explain to you a bit. in q4, effective january 1 of this calendar year, we have given hikes to 80% person of our employees, the junior employees. and for the balance people, we are doing it effective june 1, which is a normal cycle, in q1. we are also doing a couple of other things. this is -- one is that we are doing bonuses for skill-based bonus across the organization for the key skills, which are hot skills in the market today, where you want to make sense for employees. so that also we are doing and we will have across the board, across the company promotion cycle happening in june. so a number of interventions are happening for people.
as regards to the normal cycle for fy '22, we have just given it three months back. we will -- for junior employees, we will take a call, as you know, we have called out that our supply chain will not be a constraint to manage the growth environment. and at the appropriate time, we'll take a call when it has to be given it. but our endeavor is to remain competitive and make sure we intent the right skill critical and high skilled people in the organization. hope that answers your question.
manik taneja -- jm financial -- analyst
saurabh, thank you for that response. i guess, in the press conference, you mentioned that the wage hikes that were given by us in december were differentiated and ahead of industry. so just wanted to get some thoughts there?
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
so, yeah, so what we have given for people in the january cycle. we believe that our increases for the -- we have -- a, we have differentiated our increases based on performance and criticality; second, on skill, and what ever increases we have given to people are much more aggressive than what we've seen in the industry. that's the point only i want to make. what we've given people in january. does that answer your question manik.
manik taneja -- jm financial -- analyst
yeah. sure. thank you, saurabh.
saurabh govil -- president and chief human resources officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of dipesh mehta from emkay global. please go ahead.
dipesh mehta -- emkay global -- analyst
yeah. thanks for the opportunity. couple of questions. first of all, just wanted to get a sense about the overall rework and now whether leadership team in place because last quarter, you indicated by q4, and we will be largely done. so if you can provide some update on it from leadership team perspective and overall transition is largely behind us? second question on the progress made on global account executives, so empowered account manager related thing. that is i think one of the key focus area, so the progress made so far and how we should look on that playing out over the next few quarters?and the last question is thierry, if you can, i think you indicated some $7 billion [indecipherable] for fiscal. so is it compatible with $1.4 billion, which we announced in q4 or i want to look, look that number? thanks.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
okay. understood. so let me start on the first one, which is the organization. so yes, on january 1, we have rotated the organization from a global sector model with three dimension and about 27 p&ls to an organization by geographies and sectors inside geographies with four p&ls and two global business lines supporting those four p&ls. so that's a much simpler organization that has employed implied a significant redesign of the organization to work on the processes, to work on the whole of everyone and obviously, a realigned all people including leadership to this new model. we have set the objective to be ready by january 1.
and what we have said about, at the last communication a quarter ago is that, we would -- we considered that by end of the quarter. we would broadly be done with the transition, if you like, the [indecipherable] is that we have shifted to the new model on january 1. and we've probably by the end of january, early february, we've been at pretty much full speed in the new model. though the speed -- i'm personally myself, i've been also very impressed by the way the organization has adjusted to this new model and our leaders jump in to their new role and taken.
and the reason for the success in my mind is that, one, there is a clear spirit of what we produce, people will want to work together and really share the successes and work together with our clients. second, there is an absolute focus on the market. and from that standpoint, i think it's been a success. we've seen it in the sales performance month after month. and so as expected a lot less people time spent on internal matters, less internal frictions between silos, less discussion about whose p&l this is. but a lot and maybe also less than not maybe but also less people are focusing on operations if you like, and many more of our leaders in the market connecting with clients and focusing on closing deals and delivering.
so that's on the organization, my view is, we are mid of april the organization changes behind us. yes. there are even -- there are things that we need to adjust and grow, but that's absolutely normal. for us, the organization of ease up and running in the new setup and it's working. your second point was on the account executive, so the global account executive the gae, role that we developed as part of this new operating model on january 1. here i would say, certainly it's a journey, because for people it is a change in the responsibility, in the scope of operations. they have a lot more accountability, they are more accountable in front of the client, but also in front of the company, but then they are given more power to really tried this accountability. and i would say the progress has been really good. the fact that our accounts -- our large accounts have been driving the growth of the organization in q4 and we'll continue to do it in q1 is a positive aspect of that.
i want to say one thing also on this account executive on this gae role, the response from our clients has been very strong as well, very positive and that have definitely helped because when your clients are showing satisfaction in the way -- in the change we are implementing internally, it gives a lot more sense to the change and i guess people are, it's a lot easier to adjust to it. third, is the clarification on bookings. understood your point. so the $7.1 billion is the tcv performance for h2, so that includes q3, q4 and indeed, this is the highest ever performance in tcv for wipro in the semester.
okay. did i respond to all your questions.
dipesh mehta -- emkay global -- analyst
so one clarification on the last part, so large deal, $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion and this $7.1 billion, include everything. that's how...
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
$2.6 is large tcv and total is $7.1 billion.
dipesh mehta -- emkay global -- analyst
and this is only for h2, we are setting, we are not setting for full fiscal.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
that is right. this is only for h2.
dipesh mehta -- emkay global -- analyst
okay. thanks.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of nitin padmanabhan from investec. please go ahead.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec -- analyst
yeah. hi. good evening, and thanks for taking my questions. the first question is, would you be able to provide any tentative sort of assumption that you might have in terms of when capco and ampion would sort of, were beginning to revenue or when it would close?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
we've said before the end of june, and it will be before the end of june. so that before the end of the quarter, they will be part of the family. we are confident that they will be part of the family. this is regulation steps, right. so this is also a process where you have to go through different approval process in different countries not something that we are running ourselves, but it will get completed before the end of the quarter.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec -- analyst
sure. fair enough. and secondly, this one would check, but looking at, i think in the prior quarter when we recorded $1.2 billion in deal and i think metronom was $700 million. you had suggested that it's, you said sort of deal win that sort of may not be replicable considering they are the large deal within that. but this time, you've actually sort of delivered $1.4 billion. now going forward, based on the pipeline that you see, do you think, what you've achieved in the first half some of these large deals. do you think that something we should sort of expect from wipro going forward on a consistent basis hence your pipeline and underlying momentum that would allow you to sort of at least the above $1 billion consistently?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
this is certainly the objective. this is basically the objective that's why we are building this large deal team across wipro with very, very tall talents. we will really bring their experience of going in to large deals and help us track those opportunities of deals and build a bigger pipeline. we have deals in the pipe. and so we may continue to close several large deals, but it's still not the machine that we want to have that is producing systematically certain number of large deals per year. and so i think we are seeing in the acceleration process. we are not there to the point where we say ok the engineers working full speed and we will produce x number of deals per period, ok. so that's the most, that's the best answer i can give you.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec -- analyst
[indecipherable]
operator
mr. padmanabhan, your voice is breaking.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec -- analyst
yes. this is a better now?
operator
yes. thank you.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec -- analyst
so when you look at the deals that are out there, is cloud licensing incrementally becoming a larger proportion of deals versus what it was in the prior year?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
cloud overall is about a quarter of the business of wipro and is growing several times more than the average company -- of the company, so it is going to get a large proportion of our business.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec -- analyst
actually -- sorry, apologies. i was referring to the cloud licensing revenue per se, which is actually split out into the product business. so just trying to understand going, if you look at deals out there, that are there in the pipeline is cloud licensing incrementally becoming a larger proportion of the deal structures versus what it was in the past.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
it is, but i will not differentiating the both numbers but we see that here.
nitin padmanabhan -- investec -- analyst
sure. that's very helpful. thank you so much and all the best.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of sandeep shah from equirus securities. please go ahead.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities -- analyst
yeah. thanks for the opportunity. just wanted to understand that in a post six months of new organizational level changes, closing three mega deals is impressive. so thierry, just wanted to understand, is it largely the operational simplification, which is driving or is it something else in terms of some flexibility on contractual terms or other things, which is also driving this kind of mega deals wins?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
no. i mean, it's hard to respond to your question, because we strategically changed our approach on legal terms or commercial terms, i don't think so i think it is probably more that we are engaging more proactively with our clients on larger opportunities, just maybe something that we didn't pay enough attention to in the past. and so it's really more the result of us connecting at multiple level with our clients, leveraging our expertise of the industry and our understanding of their landscape and priorities, and really be proactive in crafting these opportunities. that's portion to me, that's where i see the inflection term.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities -- analyst
okay. this is helpful. so just a follow up, how is the mega deal pipeline has been shaping up for you, more proactive approach with the client as a whole? and is it resulting into a material increase in your pipeline, versus what it used to be a year? and just the last follow up question to jatin, for the capco sources of finance, any color? what proportion could be through debt? and what proportion could be through internal accruals?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
no. we are really looking at all options and we'll finalize what works best for us right now. so we have not yet finalized how what would be the proportion? that's the current position.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities -- analyst
okay. the first question if you can answer, yeah.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
yeah. i'm getting there. so on the large deals, so, yes, as i said, we certainly see more large deals that or large opportunities than what, we were looking at in the pipeline in the last six or nine months. what is certainly clear, also is that we are having a lot more cxo engagements with our clients that -- probably we had before. and i think it's evident, it's obvious that, these large opportunities are generated in these cxo interactions. and so, yes, we are seeing more opportunities in the pipeline. is the pipeline, big enough yet?
on larges deals, for me, no, that's confusing. that's why we are building this big deal team. because, i know by experience that we can really take it to the next level and turn it into a very systematic approach with a strong machine. but it's starting to produce some results because frankly, as you picked out, picked up, winning two very large deals in a row in two quarters have hadn't happened, ever, i guess, at least for many, many years in [indecipherable]. so, i think it's definitely the result of our focus on it. in our, my go-to-market activity.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities -- analyst
okay. thanks for this and if i can just pitch a last question jatin on the margins entering fy 2022, some portion of wage hikes for seniors still pending for a fy '21, which will come in fy '22 and on top of it there would be a fy '22 wage hikes. and on top of it there will be a consolidation of capco correlated margin headwinds. so, can you give us some sustainable range which we can model for fy '22. so, that would be helpful.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
yeah, sandeep. let me just share that, there is obviously, investments that we need to make in talent and we spoke about it at length in phrase and here. we will also continue to make investment in solutions and frontline talent, creating world class gaes for organizations, so, those are the investments we need to make. but we should be also, mindful of the some of the synergies and the benefits that the growth gets. and growth certainly provides operating leverage on fixed expenses. but more than that, it enables us to deploy our campus hire faster into projects, rotate our less experienced hires faster into new opportunities. so, it is going to be a [technical issues] as we go through fy '22, which would be certainly a very different year than what fy '21 has been.
from our commentary standpoint, we do feel that what we had said at the time of our enlist, the range that we were there, then in which was around 19, 19.2 was something that we believe is sustainable. and there will be in addition, a dilution of capco. and the impact on the year will depend on many things, including the date from which we consolidate them and sort of synergies that we are able to generate quickly on sales side, working together with capco.
so but we have spoken about the dilution that we will need to take for the first year, not from the profitability of capco, but principally the investment that will make in terms of, management incentive plan, as well as some of the acquisition accounting related intangible charge that we'll have to take, put together, that 2% dilution is what we see. and our endeavor would be to obviously continue to work hard; you have seen the way we have executed in last few quarters. but right now, these are the two anchors that we have given in past and we would like to stay with those two anchors.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities -- analyst
so just a clarification, you are saying after capco also our margin can be close to 19%.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
no, sandeep. my point was that the range that we were operating in, in addition, we will have an impact of capco.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities -- analyst
okay. okay. thanks. thanks and all the best.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer

over to you, thierry.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
aparna, thank you. good morning or good evening, everyone and thank you for joining us today. it's definitely good to be able to speak to you again this quarter. i hope you've been staying safe.
perhaps some of you may now be vaccinated, but if not, i really hope you, you have access to the vaccine too. in fact talking about that i'm happy to share that for our colleagues, based in india we will be organizing vaccination camps in our campus -- campuses, as per the guidelines set by the government. and we will reimburse the cost of vaccination for not just our employees, but their families as well.
so much needed relief in a tough year for everyone around the world. but thanks to the grit and perseverance of our entire team, we are stronger and more resilient than ever before. as you would have seen, our q4 performance was built on top of a momentum we saw in the last quarter. we have reported a solid growth in revenues, klc [phonetic] order bookings, and frankly, great execution resulting in robust margins. this sets the stage for the next quarter and the next financial year as well.
now let me give you some more details on the results, right. let's start with the revenue. our revenue growth during the quarter was 3.9% in reporting terms and 3% on constant currency terms, which is at the top quartile of our guidance range. i'm very pleased to tell you that this is the best fourth quarter results we have reported in the last 10 years. this was led by a good volume growth and despite the steep decline in the first quarter of the fiscal year, because of the pandemic, we bounced back to finished the year with -- i would say only a marginal decline of 1.4% year-on-year.
now let's look at the demand. the demand environment right now is robust and our overall pipeline is pretty healthy. in fact, our total contract value of order booking in the second half h2 '21 grew by 33% year-on-year that is the highest total tcv we've ever reported. you may ask what has led to this performance. first of all, i would say, there is an increased activity in the market that we have leveraged very well. but secondly, our numbers reflect the large deals, we've been able to close. we have closed 12 large deals, resulting in a tcv of $1.4 billion. this tcv includes a mega deal that we closed during the quarter in our americas market, which can should lead to revenue of over $1 billion over the deal duration.
i previously talked about how m&a is going to be integral part of our business strategy. and you'll see that in the last two quarters. we've announced acquisitions across several key markets, including the us, europe, latin america, australia, india. these acquisition have strengthened our local presence and our service offerings. during the quarter, we also announced our largest ever acquisition capital capco. this acquisition of capco will strengthen very significantly our position in the global financial services market. it's very clear. we are quite excited to onboard some exceptional domain experts and leadership talent in that space.
we remain hopeful of closing this transaction as early as possible. we also -- you would have seen that announced the acquisition of ampion an australian-based provider of cyber security, devops and quality engineering services. this acquisition will definitely expand our footprint in australia and accelerate our growth in the asia-pac region. our strategic mergers and acquisitions over the years have created a vibrant new age and diverse community of talent around the world. some of you may have noticed that on april 1, '21 we retired some of our individual acquired brands and we united seven such previous acquisitions thereby truly integrating it, we wanted the one brand, one identity, and one mindset and ambition that now allows all of us to go-to-market as one wipro.
the fourth point is our margins, our operating margin during the quarter was 21%. it's a 340 basis points increase year-over-year. our operating metrics have shown consistent improvement with utilization and offshoring being at the highest ever. i'm pleased to share that now we have released as promised salary increments and promotions covering approximately 80% of our employees effective january 1, 2021. we are pleased with our rigor and execution, which has also resulted in operating margin of 20.3% for the full year, an expansion of 200 basis points in the financial year.
now what speaks of -- our focus is that we completed q4 in an entirely new operating model. this was in fact first quarter under the new organization structure that if you remember i had announced in november '20. so essentially, we undertook the biggest ever transformation of the company. and so, little to no disruption in our market focus. our results that are out, change takes time, but i'm pleased to share that we are now well settled in the new ways of working with the spotlight firmly on our customers' needs.
there is now a new cadre of leadership that has joined the existing executive team. all key positions have been filled. i'm really proud to say that my senior team is truly diverse and brings to wipro, the kind of inclusive leadership that is not so typical of our industry. but it's imperative that we build local talent and improve ethnic and gender diversity. of course, a lot more needs to be done, but i want to take a moment to note the progress we've made.
now let me add some color to the underlying business performance. all our numbers are in constant currency for ease of reference. important to note, there is significant traction across all our markets, which means our growth is broad-based and therefore sustainable. in america, we grew 3.5% sequentially. with most of the sectors showing strong growth. our deal closures will provide a certain platform for next year. in americas too, we grew 4% sequentially, that led by the surge in volumes. the demand in the bfsi sector is strong across all service offerings. the manufacturing business is recovering, while our energy and utility business is likely to remain slightly volatile.
our european markets has delivered a sequential growth of 3.7%. on the back of several large deals that we've had through the year. united kingdom and ireland, benelux, germany grew collectively by 5.6% sequentially. finally, our apmea markets declined slightly, but frankly, that's due to conscious exit in some of the low quality businesses in the middle east market. but what i want to highlight is that all the other regions collectively have grown by 3.6% sequentially.
now looking at our global business lines, the ideas global business line which constitutes applications data and engineering grew by 2.1% quarter-over-quarter. this was led by a greater demand for our service offerings, and digital experience and data and engineering services. our other global business line, icore grew by 4.3% quarter-over-quarter with all three service offerings. that is to say, digital operations platform, cloud infrastructure services and our security practice growing well.
another indicator of how broad based our growth was is to note that our top customers, our top five -- top 10 customers now growth well ahead of the overall company. now let me give you a sense of the kind of deals we are winning. that also gives you a picture of the current business landscape. one of the best examples is what we already announced, the five-year deal with telefonica o2 which was signed in february '21.
as we look at our customer's buying patterns, this deal truly represents a lot of what we are seeing across industries. and i will illustrate it three showing assets. one, almost all customers believe that now is the time for radical renovation of the it environment. while there are many strategies and approaches to top to bottom overhaul of the it state. the goals are similar to significantly change the speed, the efficiency, the cost, the effectiveness of how it support business growth, innovation and customer experience. wipro is very well positioned to serve customers across this spectrum of it transformation.
second, cloud is at the center of customer conversations. cloud is in fact becoming the computing platform for large percentage of infrastructure and applications in the future. whether the conversation is focused on cloud migration or cloud native applications, multi-hybrid public or private cloud, customer are seeking wipro partnership in cloud to help them shift their operating models, as well as innovating across the enterprise value chain. third, we are co-investing business value and outcomes for our customers, demonstrating our long-term commitment to them, while supporting their funding model. as deals become more integrated, transformational and require greater innovation across the ecosystem we expect more conversations in this area.
and another deal that we have won with [indecipherable] is a european mapping and location data company that has selected wipro to partner in their cloud and digital transformation journey. as part of that engagements, we probably set up next-gen hybrid cloud operation centers and big futuristic apps in the mapping domain. we will leverage our home's, ai robotics platform to enable a fully agile and devops organization improving productivity and enhancing user experience for the customer.
and finally, on to our outlook for the next quarter. we have guided for a revenue growth of 2% to 4% outside of capco and ampion. this will translate into a year-on-year double-digit growth of 11% to 13% for this quarter. this guidance reflects the environment we are operating in, no doubt our increased focus on the market and our improved execution rigor. we recognize that we are competing for quality talent and we are fully prepared to lead the war for good talent. we are investing in building talent at scale. we have implemented several interventions to retain diverse talent as well.
in parallel, measures are in place to ensure the supply chain does not slow down our pace of growth. this includes, but it's not limited to, one, promotion cycles across [indecipherable]. two, sill based differentiated bonus and third, the rollout of the much deserved salary increases for our senior colleagues in june '21. our margins in q1 will reflect this investments for growth.
to summarize, i would say that we are pleased with the current business momentum and the optimistic -- we are optimistic about strengthening that momentum going into the new financial year. all our key markets are growing on a year-on-year basis and that's the solid foundation we are starting fy '22 on. it's final, but a very important point that i must make today is on the philosophy that we grow wipro has been passionately practicing for the last 10 years that our business should not be detached from the evolving climate crisis. so i want you to know that our growth ambition fully incorporates all the decarbonization efforts and builds on our esg roadmap. in the coming days, you will see us make some significant announcement on these fronts more on that later.
but now let me hand it over to jatin for his comments on the financials. jatin, over to you.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
thanks a lot, thierry and good morning, good evening to all of you, who are joining our earnings call. once again a great pleasure for us to host you. let me give a summary of our performance. as thierry spoke about, we delivered our quarter four in the top quartile of our guidance range at 3%. in reported terms, this was 3.9% sequentially. and this comes on the back of two good quarters, where we delivered in quarter three, a 3% sequential -- 3.4% sequential growth and before that 2%. so overall we are tracking a good trajectory as we complete this financial year.
our operating margin in quarter four was 21% which is compared to 17.6% of quarter four of last year was 340 basis points up. we feel quite well about the kind of execution that we were able to achieve in quarter four and deliver this operating margin. we delivered for the full year 20.3% operating margin for it services and this was a 220 basis point expansion for the full year.
i'll speak about etr. for the full year, our etr was 21.8%. the etr was lower in quarter four because of couple of tax matters getting settled and we got some upsides on that, but we delivered 21.8% of etr in quarter -- in the full year of '21 compared to 20.2% of fiscal 2020. resultant, our net income for the full year grew 11% and our eps growth for fy '21 was 14.6% y-o-y.
let me speak little bit about forex. we were able to achieve a healthy realization of inr73.83 for every $1 in quarter four. as we ended the year, we had about $3.2 billion of forex hedges of which about $450 million were hedges for certain capital investments we have made in our subsidiaries and are not for the normal inflows for our sales proceeds. so from that perspective, we remain in the range -- our historical range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion, but as i said, we have topped it up with certain capital protection hedges that we have executed in quarter four.
let me speak about cash flow. in quarter four, our cash flow was a little lower. as you know, our dsos are significantly better in quarter three and it -- they go up slightly in quarter four. typically, in the beginning of the year, there is a little -- more time taken to issue fresh pos and t hen by the time, you bill against those pos, you know the collections typically slips slightly into april, what should have come in march, so therefore, typically in quarter four, we have a slightly higher dso compared to quarter three. so that has one impact, but i'm pleased to say that in this quarter four, we have improved our dso by about eight days compared to quarter four of last year, so effectively, year-on-year, you would still see a strong improvement in cash collection.
second thing is that we have also -- because of the bank holidays and a few other things that impact the cash payout -- we have paid four salaries in india in this quarter. of course, this doesn't impact p&l in any manner, but cash flow does get impacted. so q4 cash flows have been slightly lower than what we would like, but i'm very pleased to say that for the full year, we have had very robust cash flow generation. our operating cash flow as percentage of net income is 137% and our free cash flow as a percentage of net income is 119%.
you would have seen that our net cash -- net of debt has come down at the end of march and compared to december end, it was $5.2 billion in december end, which is $3.6 billion at the end of march and that is pretty much reflective of the buyback that we have completed of $1.3 billion in the course of quarter four. overall, we have a strong balance sheet, healthy p&l, and we look forward to fy '22. we have guided for 2% to 4% as thierry highlighted in his opening remarks. at the constant currency exchange rates that i mentioned as part of our press release.
we'll be very happy to take your questions from here.

shall we open up for q&a?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
absolutely.
operator
thank you. ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] the first question is from the line of diviya nagarajan from ubs. please go ahead.
diviya nagarajan -- ubs -- analyst
hi. congrats on the strong quarter and thanks for taking my question. just a couple of things. i think, if you want, [phonetic] the kind of rates how you're seeing the progress of strategy in the last few months and separate it out from bottom up strategic gains such as the overall demand balance that we're seeing right now, where would you put the contribution of ideas? and in terms of the strategic path and route that you would like to take, how far do you think the organization has faced [phonetic] and what is left to be done?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
so, diviya, this is jatin. if you don't mind, can you repeat your question? your line was slightly blurred. we couldn't follow your question.
diviya nagarajan -- ubs -- analyst
okay. so my question basically was that, how much of the growth right now would you attribute to your bottom-up strategic initiatives and the results that they are producing and how much would you basically say it's the demand lift that you're getting because of what's happened overall to digital? and the second part of that question is that from a strategic point of view what is actually the progress and -- in terms of the milestones that you've been tracking and what is left to be done. thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
okay. diviya, i'll try to respond to the two points. the first one is a difficult one, obviously. it's difficult to disconnect the impact of a market and what's more specific to wipro itself. i think there is a real equation between a good market and an organization that is very aligned to the priorities of our clients. and so the bottom line is that, yes, we are benefiting from a good market. we are seeing that the market continues to be good, if not continue to get better, but we're also seeing that we are having a better impact with our clients, that we are having a better impact and that we are actually performing better on the deals we are going after. and so i think at the end of the day, i cannot split scientifically. but there is no question that this performance is the result of the performance of wipro in a good market.
the second point around the impact of our strategy. the strategy that we have laid out, diviya, about 15 months ago now was, one, a strategy of obsessive focus on growth. and that's what we've done by allowing our teams to focus the time for the clients in the market. we've simplified the model, we've simplified organization, we have reinforced our internal processes so that people can have more time for the market, spend more time with the clients. we have adjusted our ambition and really redefined where we felt we wanted to play with our clients and really be their partner in their transformation. and this is what we've been doing day after day. and then two more things or three more things. we have been very clear on the fact that we wanted to focus our investments around our top accounts. that's what we've done. and the result is that what you're seeing today is that we've increased significantly the number of deals over -- account over $100 million. we've increased the number of account over $75 million or over $50 million. so, we've increased the size of our large account. those accounts have been growth engine for us.
we have been clear on the fact that we wanted to further invest and bet bigger on the power of developing partnership with technology companies like aws, microsoft, google or sap. and this is what we've been -- or servicenow -- this is what we've been doing. and here also we've been getting remarkable growth over the last quarters. and finally, we have a strategy to go after big deal as well and that's with that in mind that we've organized our big deal team around our chief growth officer, stephanie. and so, i would say that when you look at the way we have built, if i can say, the way we have produced this growth, it's fully aligned with the -- it's the absolute result of the strategy we've been driving over the last 15 months.
operator
ms. nagarajan, do you have any further questions?
diviya nagarajan -- ubs -- analyst
yeah. just a follow-up to that. you had earlier spoken about the chief growth officer driving the large deal engine and how it is nearly complete. given that we've had a little bit of a slowdown in tcv in the last couple of quarters. i appreciate that acv has gone up, but in terms of total deal value, are you happy with where it is right now and what should we expect in terms of the deal trends going forward from your initiative?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
i'll take it a little bit and then i'll ask stephanie to build on it. for sure, we are happy with the performance in bookings. i mean, the quality of the deals we've closed this quarter with our client -- with our top clients, a good mix of large and mid-size deals. there is a good volume of activity that is fueling this growth. we didn't have a mega deal this quarter and we knew it. so it's not like you're turning an opportunity into -- an opportunity into a mega deal in a few months' time. those deals typically take more time. what we've done is geared up the engine, the big deal team, to start to produce more opportunities in our pipeline for the foreseeable future, for the next quarters. and that's absolutely what stephanie has been doing with bringing in a lot of top talent recently.
stephanie, you want to build on it?
stephanie trautman -- chief growth officer
yeah. thanks, thierry. from a large deal team perspective in the first few months of building out that team, we've been focused on the current pipeline. so everyone on the team is actively involved in deals. we've seen some clients slow down a bit in their decision making and others who have perhaps broken the opportunities into smaller opportunities, but we're still engaged. and then we've also pivoted toward more proactive origination of large opportunities, working closely with our existing client base and also our partners to create opportunities as well as respond to opportunities. so i think that is what is informing our pipeline moving forward.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
absolutely. thanks, stephanie. and just to conclude on your point, just facts, if you -- you mentioned acv and tcv, diviya, so acv has jumped 28% year-on-year in h1. tcv has jumped 19% year-on-year. so from those two aspects, we are growing well as well.
diviya nagarajan -- ubs -- analyst
got it. i have multiple follow-ups, but in the interest of time, i will come back into the queue. thanks and wish you all the best for the rest of the year.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you.
operator
thank you. we take our next question from the line of mukul garg from motilal oswal. please go ahead.
mukul garg -- motilal oswal financial services ltd. -- analyst
yeah. hi. thanks for taking my questions. thierry, i just wanted to focus a bit on the supply side of the equation. the demand environment definitely looked very, very favorable and us have been growing ahead of your own expectation. but at some point of time, the high attrition and the high addition of pressures would have some drag on the incremental growth opportunities, which is there in the market. do you think you've already started seeing some of that right now or is that something which can lead to delays in business to a quarter down the line if the attrition remains this elevated? [technical issues]
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
mukul, i will start by answering the following. the guidance given for q3 does not assume an improvement of attrition, ok. so said in different terms, if attrition would go down, we could potentially do a little better. now, i frankly don't believe that attrition will improve, if i can say so, or reduce in the next quarters. i actually believe that given the environment, we'll continue to face the high level of attrition, at least in the next two, three quarters, ok.
yes, we have obviously acted on it in many ways. you've heard, i've mentioned the fact that we have initiated a new cycle of compensation increase for 80% of our people in september. but besides that, we've also ramped up our freshers strategy. and going for a lot more -- we have revised, frankly, the level of addition of our freshers intake.
to that i'd like to ask you saurabh to maybe jump in and tell us also from freshers standpoint, not only in term of numbers, but also in term of strategy, what we have decided to do.
saurabh govil -- chief human resources officer
thanks, thierry. so, mukul, as you called out, the demand environment is very strong and supply side, we have to work on. and the interventions which we are looking at is more long term and is more in depth. so it's not only adding numbers or adding more people. it's also making sure that how do we upskill them and also retain them for a longer period of time. so, for example, for freshers as we go on -- to the campuses this year, and we just concluded a national talent hunt test for india where we had more than 200,000 people applying for it, we are having a communication plan that i think is unique where we not only share with them what happens as a compensation when they join, but also a plan for them in terms of the career and compensation over the next five years and that's built in their contract. so it's very clearly driving a plan that we increase the retention of these people because we are seeing a high attrition in this three to six-year category. and if you're able to retain these freshers and build the right culture in the organization retaining them a long period of time is going to long term impact and help us on the supply side. so it's a very different shift. it's not only about adding numbers. it's a very strategic thing through that we will be able to increase the retention of our freshers for a longer period of time and look at both cost and attrition as a long-term play here.
mukul garg -- motilal oswal financial services ltd. -- analyst
sure. thanks. thierry, the second part of the question was on how should we look at the attrition and the pricing for both traditional or legacy part of the business as well as cloud and new part of the business? historically, the legacy portion has obviously been more profitable, although growth is not there. but with more people getting trained on newer technologies where the wages are obviously higher, do you think higher attrition has started creeping up there as well?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
although definitely we are getting a significant growth from those areas that you are referring to, it's true. today we are -- the significant part of our growth is coming from cloud area, from data, from digital transformation, from engineering services, from cybersecurity. and again, this is based on this revenue mix that we have based our assumptions for the guidance for q3.
saurabh govil -- chief human resources officer
but, mukul, just to add to what thierry is saying, yes, these are hot skills today and there is a high attrition. so if i see this is one area where we are working toward where the upskilling part will help, but it is an area where we have huge demand and there is a supply and skill deficit. so it's not about -- it's that the demand is much more than what we require in the industry. it's an industry issue which we should look at.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
yeah. so to -- this is jatin. just to add, mukul, conceptually if the demand is high, as saurabh has mentioned, and there is constrained supply today, if more people get trained in that area, in fact, it will overall reduce the pressure on attrition in that area over a period of time though that specific individual may be more marketable with the new skill set.
mukul garg -- motilal oswal financial services ltd. -- analyst
okay, fair enough. again thanks for taking my question. i'll get back into the queue.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of sandip agarwal from edelweiss. please go ahead.
sandip agarwal -- edelweiss capital -- analyst
yeah. hi. good evening. thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good quarter. a small question, thierry, that when you see your current clients' work progress and execution and the way technology is getting adapted across horizon, what is your sense at what stage of implementation we are? is it very early stage or do you think that we are somewhere in the middle of it? so that was one. and second i wanted to understand that while you say that attrition may not cool off in the next quarter, will it be fair to say that the peak of attrition is behind us? thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
so on the first point, which is you want to understand at which stage of transformation. if you want to think about the potential that technology can represent for an organization for a company in term of transformation of its ways of working, i think we are -- the best of the transformation is ahead of us. i mean, the potential of -- if you look at the cloud -- so first of all, if you look at cloud transformation, what i am reading is quite consistent here. we probably have touched say 20% of the cloud transformation wave. and so, the biggest part of it and the largest part of it is ahead of us.
if you're looking at security, there is no question that security will continue to represent budget increase for our clients in the next years. if you look at data, i mean, data, the way we are leveraging data to drive insight for better decision making is -- represent an immense potential for a lot of industries and here again the best is ahead of us.
finally, if you look at engineering services and other areas where we are investing significantly and getting nice growth, we know that this is an area where in many -- across many industries, companies will have to invest in their r&d and will need support from companies like us to support and augment their r&d investments. and so across all these different areas, the bulk of the transformation is ahead of us.
on the attrition, which is your second point, i actually don't believe that the worse of attrition is behind us. i think it will -- as i said, it will continue to possibly increase in the next quarters before cooling down. again, that's at least our assumptions as of today.
sandip agarwal -- edelweiss capital -- analyst
okay, thank you. that's very helpful. thanks a lot.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of apurva prasad from elara capital. please go ahead.
apurva prasad -- elara capital -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. thierry, couple from my side. so how durable is the demand environment and is the conversation around scope increase with your large customers giving you that confidence of durability of demand and the continuity of current growth momentum? and i ask this in context of higher acv growth versus tcv growth.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
so on the first point, i mean -- i would answer a frank yes. yes, the demand is strong and will remain strong. just based on the previous point i just covered, there is so much transformation ahead of us. our clients are placing investment in technology as among their top priorities. to a point, apurva, where it's not anymore a topic for the cio only. it's a topic for every cxo in an organization, right. the cmo is investing more in technology. the head of supply chain is investing more in technology.
the business expressed strong demand for technology and obviously all the different functions, hr, finance, operations, all are pushing for programs to be developed. so the demand will continue to remain strong.
apurva prasad -- elara capital -- analyst
got that. and just on this point of yours and strong demand and in context of the current tight supply environment, what do you think is the propensity for getting rate card increase and what part of the portfolio in your opinion is amenable to that increase? or is it the case that this is more stable and the benefits are flowing through more by means of greater offshoring and volumes?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
well, apurva, i think there is opportunity today. there is opportunities to have these discussions with our clients in this current context. our clients feel the same. they are also exposed to attrition. they have exactly the same phenomenon. and so i think it's a reality that more important for them today is the ability to continue to drive those programs without slowing down.
now from a portfolio standpoint, i would say i would still talk about a certain level of stability of the pricing.
apurva prasad -- elara capital -- analyst
got it. thank you and all the best.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you.
operator
thank you. ladies and gentlemen, in order to ensure that the management is able to address questions from all participants in this conference call, please limit your questions to one per participant. for any further questions, you may come back for a follow-up. the next question is from the line of gaurav rateria from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
gaurav rateria -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. congratulations on great performance. first question for thierry. where are we right now in the whole organizational restructuring process? have you seen any material change in the top 100, top 200 heads as far as the global account executives are concerned? and-or is this something which is ahead of us and these changes are likely to happen in the coming quarters?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
gaurav, excellent question. thanks for that. one is in term of operating model, organization changes, we have implemented the new operating model, new organization, on january 1. and we had given ourselves a quarter to stabilize this organization model. it's actually been incredibly efficient rapidly.
and frankly, i don't want to be overly optimistic -- i mean, positive about it. every new model requires a certain amount of progression. but frankly very positively surprised by the level of maturity of the model after a few months. we have today a model that the organization and all our leaders consider is the model that is working and actually delivers the upside that we were expecting in term of simplicity, in term of reducing the number of silos inside the organization, the ability to create a one wipro mindset and getting -- actually freeing up time for our people to spend more time with customers.
the second part of your question, which is about the rotation or, if you like, the evolution of our leadership organization. what i can tell you is we have upgraded, if i can say, about 25% of our account executives around the world, ok. and the second aspect is that if you look at our top 200 leaders across the organization, two years ago we had only 1% of them were account executives. today 8% of them are account executives. there is a significant change in the mix of leadership toward client-facing people.
gaurav rateria -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. second question, i'll put it in two parts. one, thierry you mentioned couple of quarters back one of the key jobs which you had to do was to build a pipeline actually and the last few quarters have been good on the conversion. so just wanted to understand where are we in this journey in terms of broad-basing of our participation in the deal.
and the second part of the question is for jatin with respect to understanding the levers to manage margins in the second half. is it fair to say given the supply environment being tight, margins should be lower in the second half compared to first half? thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
okay. so i'll take the first one on the pipeline. we've seen the pipeline progression quarter after quarter. it's been a consistent progression. the trend has been positive, but more importantly, i would say two things. the quality of the pipeline has improved. we have a pipeline now that is more aligned to our strategy in term of priorities, in term of focusing on offerings where we want to invest and also focused around our key accounts.
so the proportion of our pipeline coming from our top accounts is a lot bigger than what it was several quarters ago. so from that standpoint, it's all positive. finally, i would say in term of deal conversion, i think we are also eager seeing a positive trend. we've improved the way we are qualifying our deals. we've improved the way we are mobilizing the one wipro organization to win the deals and the laser focus in line with our strategy around accounts and specific offerings has allowed us to invest into talent, into top capabilities and this is definitely helping us converting those -- this pipeline into deals.
on the second question, jatin?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, thierry. so the answer to the question is yes. there is tremendous, i would say, competition for great talent and that means that we need to remain very invested in our talent. we need to make sure that our supply curve is properly supporting our growth curve and in fact ahead of our growth curve. so we are capturing every demand that comes in.
for all of that in terms of impact or risk on margin, yes, there is a risk on margin and i think that's not just wipro, but that's the industry fact. having said that, we executed as you know, this quarter well. we were able to drive operational improvements in realization, utilization and offshoring. and that covered effectively the impact that we had to take for three-months impact on salary. so i think it's going to be -- it's going to be a growth going forward which will -- and how do we balance the effort that we put on our operating levers to be able to cover for the margin is -- that is going to be a balance that we will have to continue to fight on. but we have done well, which we are proud of, in quarter two. but there are clear investment agenda on talent going forward which we have to remain cognizant and that's what we are baking in as we think about second half.
gaurav rateria -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you, jatin. thank you, thierry.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of sandeep shah from equirus securities. please go ahead.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities private limited -- analyst
yeah. thanks for the opportunity. and i understand and acknowledge the growth of tcv, which is 29%. but if i look at the first half tcv and even if i assume close to 75% being the new business and assume a four-year tenure, then the actual new business as a percentage through the first half coming to around 5% as a whole. so does that worry you in terms of the growth profile going forward or you believe for the industry as a whole, the growth profile is changing where we have to look beyond the large deal signings where larger deals are getting converted into smaller deals and there are enough number of less than $30 million deals, which will keep your organic growth going forward robust?
and second question to jatin. jatin, this time i think ebitda margin decline is close to 75 bps, 80 bps, right? depreciation savings has been higher than 50 bps to 70 bps. so what is causing this and whether depreciation will normalize in a going forward basis?
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
sure. so, sandeep, this is jatin. i will try and respond to both questions if you're ok. on the first one, there is the strength of the performance is reflected in quarter two numbers. it is -- what we think we can do is reflected in the guidance which we have given. of course, you can look at the likely performance in many ways and you have a point of view that we respect. but you must always see that our industry runs on two fuels. one is the day to day volumes that we are able to add because we see demand and we fulfill quickly and that adds to our revenue and second is large deals. and as you can see, the first engine has really been very, very productive in last nine months and it continues to fire very well. and we did not have a mega deal, as thierry spoke about it. but we have a very strong first engine which is firing. so we feel comfortable as we speak. we feel comfortable that we have pipeline for large deals and that will convert at some point. so overall we are quite ok and well placed, is the way we see sandeep.
and the second question on ebitda versus ebit, we -- as you know, we do have certain cycles of amortization related with the specific cost for which that particular item is getting amortized on. and as and when those cycles come to an end in their natural course the amortization ceases to come in the p&l and that's reflective of that. and what you see now is something that can be the basis for your future modeling.
sandeep shah -- equirus securities private limited -- analyst
okay. okay. thanks. thanks and all the best.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of vibhor singhal from phillip capital. please go ahead. vibhor singhal from phillip capital, your line is unmuted. please go ahead with your question. please unmute the line from your side.
vibhor singhal -- phillip capital -- analyst
yeah. am i audible?
operator
yes.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
yes, vibhor.
vibhor singhal -- phillip capital -- analyst
yeah. yeah. hi, guys. thanks for taking my question. thierry, i just had one question from my side. and my question was pertaining to our strategy and the growth that you see in the european geography. i mean we know that the indian companies have done really well in the uk, scandinavia [indecipherable] and geographies. but the continental europe had something that was the reason which i think was the indian companies are not able to make so much of inroads due to [technical issues]. we've tried to overcome that over the past year with a lot of local hiring. how do you see pandemic changing that equation? has it kind of -- as it has over the entire world, has it kind of lowered those entry barriers for us as the indian it companies and wipro specifically as well, do you see more deals coming through geographies like germany, france? are the local european companies like steria sopra [indecipherable] and all these guys able to ramp up and give us good enough competition, which we have not been over the past decade? so how is the growth trajectory in the european geography looking like with all these factors at play?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
look there is -- my response, vibhor, would have two aspects to it. the first aspect is there is no doubt that companies have learned to work with teams that are working remotely. and when you're working remotely whether you're working two miles away or 5,000 miles away, doesn't change anything. you're working with teams that are not on site. and from that standpoint, there is no doubt that a lot of companies across industries in the european market have learned and will be more comfortable leveraging global delivery models, if you like.
but the second aspect for me is equally important. in europe, more than anywhere else, there are major cultural specificities that requires deep understanding of the local markets. and the local market of sweden is not the same that the local market in finland or in norway. and i think the companies that are doing well are the ones who understand that and who are able to leverage at the same time, the power of global organizations and develop a strong local connect. and that's the reason why we have so significantly invested into local leadership in europe. and this has been paying off pretty much immediately.
vibhor singhal -- phillip capital -- analyst
right. so would you say that we are on track with our strategy of that -- of what we've done? you're happy with the outcome, could have been better or do you think -- do you expect it to be even better in terms of growth rates and in terms of big wins going forward?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
my team would tell you that i am -- i always consider that we could have done even better. but i think i'm satisfied -- broadly satisfied with the progress we've made, the consistency, the alignment to the plan, the execution, if you like, of this strategy and the fact that we are doing what we said we would do. and that i like this consistency.
vibhor singhal -- phillip capital -- analyst
got it, got it. great. thanks for taking my questions thierry and wish you guys all the best.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
thank you, vibhor.
operator
thank you. the next question is from the line of manik taneja from jm financial. please go ahead.
manik taneja -- jm financial services ltd. -- analyst
hi. thank you for the opportunity and congratulations for the big q2 [phonetic]. thierry, i wanted to pick your business on a couple of things. number one thing is around the fact that while we have seen a significant shift in terms of offshore mix of revenues over the last several quarters, that has also played along with significant increase in utilization, which is contrary to what one has seen in the past for the industry.
do you think at some point of time, the normal tendency around utilization cooling off as more [indecipherable] delivered offshore starts playing out or you are seeing some different engagement models emerging in the industry because of which offshore utilization rates are holding up quite well. that's question number one.
the second question was around the fact that typically second half is much stronger for us versus first half in terms of sequential growth rate. do we expect something similar to repeat this year as well? thank you.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
i mean -- so i'll start with the point number two and i'll come back to the first one after. there is always a little bit of seasonality in our industry, for sure. and that's why when we talk about sequential growth, we need to take into account seasonality. the guidance of 2% to 4% growth sequentially in q3 takes into account this seasonality. it remains that if we look at our growth 2% to 4% growth in q3 would actually represent 27% to 30% growth year-on-year, which is quite healthy.
on your first point, which is trying to identify trends or evolution of onshore and offshore mix. i would be a little cautious with drawing conclusions. i think the reality manik is that the mix is a factor of many things. the evolution of the mix depend on the type of deals that you are selling. depending the level -- the cycle of where you stand in the transformation, you're going to need either more local presence or more offshore presence. and so i think it's not necessarily a trend that is systematic. i think it's -- you can see an evolution depending on the mix of deals in a particular sector, in the a particular geography. so that's the point i would make.
yes, typically offshore utilization is lower than the utilization we have onshore. and that will certainly remain true even in a market of high demand utilization tend to be higher, that's pretty mechanical.
saurabh govil -- chief human resources officer
with the attrition going up there, that also impacts attrition [phonetic].
manik taneja -- jm financial services ltd. -- analyst
and do you think [technical issues] customers get much more acceptable of global delivery or offshore delivery?
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
i believe -- you were breaking out a little bit. so i hope i understood your question. but your question was, do you believe that clients are more open to offshore, is it what you're saying?
manik taneja -- jm financial services ltd. -- analyst
i was saying, are there more innovative engagement models emerging around offshore delivery as clients get much more acceptable around or get much more -- are more acceptable of offshore delivery.
thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
yeah, no doubt. again that what we've learned over the last 15 months through the pandemic is we'll change the ways of working. there is no doubt i would leave you with two views. one is, we know that a significant portion of our employees will spend some days per week working from home, so therefore remotely wherever they live. and it's absolutely the same reality that applies for our clients' employees as well. in every of my interactions with clients, we are talking about it. and i think it's an evolution of the workforce to last.
and the second thing again is that being more -- being exposed and having developed the technology that support remote working in a secure way opens new opportunities to clients to think about new operating model and new ways of working with companies like ours. so, yes, for those two reasons there is no doubt that operating model will continue to trend toward more flexibility between physical and virtual.

thierry delaporte -- chief executive officer and managing director
aparna, thank you. hello, everyone. it's really good to be able to speak to you again this quarter, especially as you join us today during the festive time. i know that many parts of india are celebrating navaratri and durga puja. so thank you for joining us. we'll make sure not to keep you here for too long, ok.
joining us today on this announcement is my leadership team, so our chief human resource officer, saurabh govil; chief financial officer, jatin dalal; and then our chief growth officer, stephanie trautman.
for me personally, this is a special earnings call to be able to speak to you from bangalore. this is my first official visit to the india offices since i took charge in july last year. in the last three days i've met with our senior leaders and teams in india and it's absolutely been incredibly energizing. your openness and your hospitality i've experienced in india has always been very welcoming. but you can imagine my eagerness and anticipation to meet our teams and see our campuses here and they did not disappoint. it's been great so far. of course, i've only just started to travel, essential travel, of course. i was in the us last week, meeting with our regional ceos and gbl leaders, our chief growth officer and other key leaders of our business. each of them, i must say, has steered wipro through a very difficult time during the pandemic. and i'd like to thank everyone of our 220,000 colleagues across the world for their commitment, their trust and their dedication to our customers' success despite the challenges of the pandemic.
it is very encouraging that over 85% of our employees globally are now vaccinated with the first of the covid-19 vaccines and over 50% are fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses. in many parts of the world, we are starting to return to our offices in a staggered manner. for example, in india our fully vaccinated senior colleagues can now come to office twice a week. the return to work will be a careful and gradual process as you can imagine. we are really keeping the safety of our employees and the needs of our customers in mind as we plan this, right.
in the second quarter, i'm happy to share with you that our annual revenue run rate has surpassed the $10 billion mark, the $10 billion mark. it will be interesting for you to know that $2.4 billion of this was added just in the last 12 months. this revenue milestone assumes greater significance because we achieved this while undergoing our largest ever internal transformation. our revenue growth during the quarter was 8.1% in constant currency terms.
you may recall this as being well ahead of the top end of our guidance range of 7%. and even if we exclude our two recent acquisitions, that is capco and ampion, we grew over 4.6% in constant currency terms. this marks the second consecutive quarter of 4.5% plus growth. it signals the underlying demand and the execution momentum we have generated and majority of our growth was volume led. we've experienced secular growth across all markets, all sectors and global business lines. our recent acquisitions too, i must say, have performed ahead of expectations. the demand environment continues to be very strong and our pipeline is a clear reflection of that. in fact, our pipeline is among the highest in recent quarters. we have a good mix of large and medium-sized deals. there are, in fact, many mid-size deals and slightly smaller-size transformation deals in the market right now. this is all good news for us.
our order book in terms of annual contract value has jumped 28% in h1. and in terms of tcv, the order book is up 19% year-on-year. we have strengthened our large deal team and brought in specialized expertise there. so i'm really confident our participation and win rate of deals will accelerate.
let me come to the operating margins now. i'm pleased to share that in q2, we have sustained q1 operating margins adjusted for the onetime gains we had in the last quarter. and frankly, we have maintained our operating margin despite absorbing the full impact of our recent acquisitions of capco and ampion and in spite of investing heavily in our business across sales capabilities and talent. an additional point to note here that we've also offered a salary increase covering 80% of our colleagues in september of 2021 marking a second salary hike in this calendar year.
there is significant traction across all our markets, as i said, leading to broad-based growth. americas and europe, our top two markets, grew at 15% and 29% year-on-year respectively, even without the recent acquisitions. in americas 1, we grew 20% year-on-year with most of the sectors showing strong growth, consumer, tech, communications, health all have grown at 5% plus sequentially. in americas 2, we grew 31% year-on-year, led by growth in our organic business as well as benefits from our acquisition of capco. most sectors registered healthy growth of 4% plus sequentially. our european business has delivered a year-on-year growth of 48% on the back of several large deals. and thanks to the boost of our acquisition, capco.
uk, benelux, germany led organic growth, growing at 12%, 10% and 10% respectively in sequential terms. our apmea market grew moderately at 8% year-on-year. we are now seeing improved traction in australia and new zealand, in india, in japan and the southeast asian markets. the pipeline addition in these markets have been very healthy. middle east and africa were weak in q2, but we are encouraged by the pipeline that is shaping up.
our teams have redoubled their focus on our existing clients and that is leading to strong growth in our top customers. our top customer grew 29% year-on-year, our top five customers grew 33% year-on-year and our top 10 grew 32%. in the last 12 months, we have added four new customers in the more than $100 million bracket and we have added five more customers in the more than $50 million bracket. this, we feel, is the start of a significant shift. when i meet our customers, they actually tell me they see a change in how our teams approach their business and the value we bring to them. this recognition reflects wipro's changing mindset and our bold and confident approach to business. customer satisfaction scores, as measured by an independent survey, has also risen considerably.
from a service offering standpoint, our ideas global business line grew 11% sequentially and 37% year-on-year. most of the sub-practices showed a healthy growth. our engineering business grew over 25% year-on-year in q2 and at a compounded quarterly growth rate of over 5% in the last four quarters. our icore global business line grew by 5% sequentially and 18% year-on-year. all of the sub-practices grew in double digits on a year-on-year basis.
we launched wipro fullstride cloud services which integrates our consulting and technology capabilities along with our cloud studio based assets. this integrated ecosystem positions us as an orchestrator that delivers transformational solutions together with our partners to address our client business challenges. the cloud ecosystem, which is about 30% of our revenue, grew 27% plus in the first half and for the first time ever, our cloud pipeline has crossed $8 billion. and that's reflected in the deals we are winning too. let me give you a few examples.
one, a global software products and cloud services company has awarded wipro a multi-million dollar contract for product modernization, spanning ai, cloud and cognitive business products. we will leverage our engineering nxt product solutions to rapidly scale and migrate the clients' products to cloud. second, a multinational oil and gas company has selected wipro to build a cloud native subsurface data platform, which enables consistent api standouts for connecting with cloud and software vendors micro services and proprietary solutions. working with wipro fullstride cloud services the solution significantly reduces sub surface data analytics timelines.
we'll do a quick update of our recent acquisitions. with capco we continue to build good momentum on our joint go to market. the pipeline is building well and we've started seeing some early wins. we have won 10 deals during first 100 days of transaction closure. initial days yet, sure. but i have congratulated the capco team for leading this from the front. we are also pleased to have completed the acquisition of ampion, an australian based provider of cybersecurity devops and quality engineering services. this will definitely help us expand our footprint in one of our priority markets.
let me now give you a quick glimpse of how we have transformed ourselves. apart from, i would say, moving to a simpler and more customer-centric operating model and organizational restructuring, we have made substantial progress on leadership transformation. i have said that in our previous interaction that talent will be a critical success factor. so we have worked on two key aspects of leadership overall; one, by building a contemporary and diverse senior leadership, including our client facing global account executives; and two, by moving the leadership closer to clients. consequently, we have reconstructed our leadership with a good mix of internally promoted talent and lateral hires. 58% of our leadership are in the regional markets with increased proximity to our customers. naturally, we will continue to change and hold our momentum, but i'm happy with the pace and the quality of change we have achieved so far. but one of the issues that we must cope with as we build talent at scale is attrition. our customers too are grappling with increased attrition. wipro acknowledges this changed talent landscape and has adapted quickly to the new world of work. the hybrid work environment is definitely a part of this mix. we have doubled down on our fresher intake with 8,150 [phonetic] young colleagues joining us from campus in q2. we will continue to aggressively build on this. and i am happy to share that we are well positioned to add over 25,000 freshers in the next financial year.
and finally, on to our outlook for the next quarter. we have guided for a revenue growth 2% to 4% which will translate into a year-on-year growth of 27% to 30% in constant currency.
to summarize, i would say that the demand environment continues to be strong and our growth chart over the last few quarters reflects this. it also reflects our improved execution engine. together with the investments we've made in capabilities and talent over the last nine months, i am confident we will be able to participate and win at a greater pace.
on that note, let me now hand over to jatin for his comments on the financials. jatin, over to you.
jatin dalal -- chief financial officer
thank you very much, thierry, and good evening, good morning to all participants. i will share some financial details now. as thierry mentioned, for the first half our tcv win has been quite healthy at 18% and our acv wins have been 29%. we have signed in quarter two, nine deals with a tcv of $580 million.
our quarter two revenue growth was 8.1% which, as you know, is significantly ahead of our guidance range of 5% to 7% and that reflected, in constant currency, 28.8% healthy year-on-year growth. our operating margin for the quarter were 17.8% and it was a good sustenance considering the 1% that we received as benefit one-timer in quarter one on sale of our ensono business.
our tax rate improved compared to last year where we closed at 22% versus 22.5% of last year. therefore, our net income increased by 18.9% in quarter two and our eps increased at 23.8% year-on-year. if you see our cash flow performance, operating cash flow was 81% of our net income. we had $2.7 billion of net cash on the balance sheet and $4.3 billion gross cash on the balance sheet. we had a good realization of inr75.11 at the end of the quarter. and we had $3.3 billion of forex hedges. we have guided, as thierry articulated, 2% to 4% sequentially and the constant currency exchange rates are mentioned in our press release.
and we'll be very happy to take your questions from here.
