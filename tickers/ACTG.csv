jeff stanlis -- investor relations
thank you, melinda. hosting the call today are clifford press, chief executive officer; al tobia, chief investment officer; and rich rosenstein, chief financial officer. before beginning, i would like to remind you that the information provided during this call may contain forward-looking statements relating to current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events that are forward-looking as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.

i'd like to remind everyone that a press release disclosing the company's financial results was issued this morning before the market opened. this release may be accessed on the company's website at acaciaresearch.com under the news and events tab. clifford and al will provide a business update and rich will review the quarterly financial results.
with all that said, i would now like to turn the call over to clifford press. mr. press, the call is yours.
clifford press -- chief executive officer
thank you, jeff, and good morning, everyone.
at the end of the second quarter, our capital base consisting of cash, private and public investments, and availability pursuant to our partnership with starboard value lp stood at $770 million. we continue to pursue acquisitions of operating businesses through a tightly coordinated research process, leveraging our team's experience in public and private markets.
we focus on mature technology life sciences, healthcare and industrials, and certain segments of financial services including insurance. our primary opportunity set remains with companies that are sub-$2 billion in equity market cap. as we have said in the past, we view this segment as the least efficient area of the public markets and one that favors our primary research approach and permanent capital structure.
we have now positioned acacia in an opportune part of the market. specifically, we operate at the interface between private and public market valuations, making us an ideal partner for a variety of sellers and investors. we are able to deploy permanent capital to navigate complex multi-factor transactions. we are a corporate acquirer and are positioned to be an attractive packet to counterparties, such as private equity funds and large enterprises. this approach leverages our rigorous investment process with starboard, strong balance sheet and ready access to committed capital.
we have active relationships with private equity investors, who may find underperforming public companies where our involvement can be constructive and will continue to build this network. in summary, we remain committed to our strategy, which benefits from the inherent flexibility we have created, enabling us to pursue a range of potential transactions.
i will now turn the call over to al tobia, our chief investment officer to speak to our existing holdings. al?
alfred v. tobia -- chief investment officer
thank you, clifford. as we evaluate new opportunities, we continue to maximize the value and return of our existing holdings. our goal is to monetize our life sciences portfolio expeditiously. during the second quarter, we exited our position in sensyne and to-date we have now recovered $212 million of our original $282 million life science portfolio investment.
as a reminder, immediately following the acquisition of this portfolio, we recovered approximately $145 million through the sale of certain public equities from the portfolio. we have continued to monetize this portfolio, and as of june 30th, we held positions in two public companies, arix biosciences and induction healthcare group, and these positions represented approximately $66.7 million in value. immunocore recently completed an ipo, though our class of shares did not yet trade publicly as of june 30th. importantly, we continue to hold meaningful positions in four additional private life sciences companies, including oxford nanopore technologies.
oxford nanopore disclosed earlier this year that it state -- started the process of preparing for an ipo and that while the timing of the potential ipo is dependent on market conditions and other matters not fully within its control, oxford nanopore expects that the ipo would occur on the second half of 2021 on the london stock exchange. in addition to oxford nanopore, we remain enthusiastic about the prospects for our other private holdings.
with respect to our ip business, investments made over the past year have resulted in a balanced portfolio, including both soft licensing and litigation. we generated more than $17 million in revenue this year, up from $2 million in the second quarter last year. this growth was driven by a few licenses and settlements, including one large settlement.
our policy is not to comment publicly on the specifics of any individual settlement, including identifying counterparties given confidentiality agreements and other considerations. our team is actively advancing a number of opportunities to monetize our existing ip assets and to acquire additional portfolios.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to rich rosenstein, our cfo to discuss the results. rich?
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
thank you, al. our book value at june 30, 2021, was $147.1 million or $3.02 per basic share, compared to $128.1 million or $2.64 per basic share at march 31st, and $292.5 million or $5.94 per basic share at december 31, 2020. our book value reflects the impact of the increase in the company's share price over the last year on our warrant and embedded derivatives liabilities, which stood at $290.2 million at june 30th.
as these liabilities would be extinguished upon exercise or exploration of these warrants and preferreds [phonetic], we consider their impact should all derivatives be converted. assuming full exercise of all issued derivatives, acacia's pro forma book value would rise to $942.8 million or $5.70 per share, up from $882.5 million or $5.39 per share on the same basis as of december 31, 2020.
for the quarter, highlights of our financial performance include the following. revenues for the second quarter of 2021 were $17.4 million, up from $2.1 million a year ago. operating income was $1.6 million in the quarter, reversing a loss of $6.7 million a year ago. realized and unrealized gains totaled $25.8 million in the quarter. cash and equity securities at fair value totaled $320.6 million at june 30, 2021, compared to $274.6 million at december 31st. debt was $145.5 million in senior secured notes issued to starboard value. more detail on these results have been made available on the press release issued this morning and in our quarterly report on form 10-q, which we filed with the sec this morning.
let me now turn the call back to clifford for closing comments. clifford?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
thanks, rich. in conclusion, acacia continues to execute on its investment strategy. as always, our focus continues to be on improvement in our book value and executing our acquisition strategy, which we are focused on doing in collaboration with starboard. as stewards of shareholder capital with the valuation fit and a variety of other factors and important -- factors as important and we will not rest to make an acquisition for expedience.
we are now happy to answer questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and first we go to the line of anthony stoss with craig-hallum. please go ahead.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
hi, gentlemen. a couple of quick questions for you. most recently you sell a patent litigation with a network equipment supplier. can you confirm that your june revenues were impacted by the settlement and could we expect kind of monies going forward? then i have a couple other questions after that?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
rich, why don't you take that one?
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
yeah. yeah, i can. so, tony, as we mentioned, our revenues in the quarter were just over $17 million and did include a number of license agreements and settlements, including one large settlement. and so that you'll see on our balance sheet as accounts receivable that we would have collected in the beginning of the third quarter.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
do you expect that to continue rich or is it a kind of one and done settlement?
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
as al had mentioned, we can't comment on the specifics of individual settlements, but many of our licensing agreements and settlements are often upfront, involved upfront payment, some do have recurring revenue characteristics to them, but by and large, our transactions are typically upfront payments.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay.
clifford press -- chief executive officer
tony, it's clifford. i'll just add on that, that we've got some new portfolios that are coming to realization. now, we regard that settlement as an auspicious start for that portfolio and we expect a substantial follow on for that portfolio.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
meaning with other companies clifford or with the same existing...
clifford press -- chief executive officer
with other licensees.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay. and then shifting gears, your viamet jv, your partner is valuing their ownership in viamet at a much higher valuation than you guys are. can you discuss why and maybe the differences and what they're currently valued at versus what you are and why you guys aren't? i guess maybe why you are valuing it more conservatively?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
yeah. there is two --
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
yeah. i can...
clifford press -- chief executive officer
well, rich, can -- rich will describe the gaap aspect of it first and i'll talk about the underlying investment.
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, clifford. so, tony, you're right, we -- as we indicated at our press release, we value several of our private company positions, viamet included on cost -- on the basis of cost. and we have adopted an approach to valuing our private securities using what's called the measurement alternative under asc 321 and that involves valuing the privates at initial cost. we then adjust for any impairment that might be -- that might have taken place. and then we will also adjust for any observed transactions either primary or secondary transactions in the underlying issue or shares, whether they'd be the same shares that we hold, different class of shares, different size of amount that we own, we'll take all of that into consideration.
there has been no observed transactions environment per se and so we're -- we continue to carry that as at cost and you can see in our release the -- three of our private positions, viamet pharmaceuticals, amo pharma and novabiotics we're carrying at on a gaap basis, we're carrying at a value combined of $25.4 million. so we're not adopt -- we have not adopted a fair value approach to each of our private holdings.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay. and then, shifting gear --
clifford press -- chief executive officer
and i will say -- just to finish on your question about the difference in evaluation, rich explained why, we do not disagree with the malan's valuation, that product is a pretty significant advance for in women's health, that drug and we do think that malan have a viable basis for recording their valuation.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay. hey clifford, kind of a bigger picture one and i know you and i applaud the fact that you don't want to rush into just any acquisition, but the partnership with starboard is going on almost a year and a half, with no acquisitions to show yet. i know you guys have been working hard. any color either you've been out bid or you -- you're very active now or you think you're getting closer now, anything would be helpful, because i continue to get lots of calls from shareholders wondering, a year and a half in, while we still don't have anything to show yet?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
sure. it's a legitimate question and the -- anyway we really like to answer it is with some transactions, which we're getting close to. but in terms of where we've been so far, because starboard were extremely instrumental in doing the woodford portfolio acquisition, which is -- and we've recently spent a substantial amount of time in due diligence on a public company of significant size and decided at the end that it still did not meet our criteria. however, we have a very robust pipeline of late-stage prospects at the moment and i'd be surprised, as i've said before, if we don't have some significant transactions and completed by the end of the year.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay. thanks for that. thanks, guys.
operator
[operator instructions] and next we go to the line of brett reiss with janney. please go ahead.
brett reiss -- janney -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen.
clifford press -- chief executive officer
hello, brett.
brett reiss -- janney -- analyst
first question, is it still the company's aspiration to generate $3 to $4 of revenue on the $42.4 million patent net of accumulated amortization?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
not sure where that, where you got those numbers from, brett. we don't generally refer to that type of investment in terms of revenue. we refer to it in terms of where we expect to build book value over time and we will continue to emphasize that.
brett reiss -- janney -- analyst
okay.
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
brett, just, i think, maybe what you -- when you're referring to that, i think, that may be, if we decide to partner with someone and there's a back end, when you look at some of these transactions, there's a larger kind of revenue component and then there's a profit share, maybe that's where the $3 to $4 came from. but to clifford's point, each one of these deals has its own criteria. so we're not that prescriptive on $3 to $4 per book value. we look at things in terms of their ability to generate a targeted return that we believe is acceptable.
brett reiss -- janney -- analyst
okay. there's all sorts of estimates all over the map on what the ipo value of the oxford nanopore might be. what do you think the ipo value of oxford nanopore is going to be?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
brett, i don't think it'll surprise you if i tell you that, it's an active ipo. we're a top five shareholder and it just would not be appropriate for us to make any comment whatsoever in that regard.
brett reiss -- janney -- analyst
okay. fair enough. one last one and it's really just asking the question, again, from the prior color, in terms of on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being metaphysical certainty and one being it's just not going to happen. what is the probability of a deal being consummated on an operating company before calendar year 2021 is up?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
brett, you have been around for a long time and you know deals. so, i think it's -- it would be, nobody would feel comfortable predicting with certainty, any transaction until it's happened. but what we can tell you with certainty is that we're working very hard. we have a tremendous research collaboration with starboard and there are a number of transactions that we're looking at very closely.
brett reiss -- janney -- analyst
thank you for taking my questions.
operator
next we go to the line of kevin sami with sami capital. please go ahead.
kevin sami -- sami capital -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question. i just had one on your ownership stake in oxford nanopore. your stake has been 6% since you last disclosed it at year end 2020, and yet they've raised capital, has your stake been diluted by that raise?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
no, we've not been diluted.
kevin sami -- sami capital -- analyst
okay. so you've participated in the raise?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
yeah.
kevin sami -- sami capital -- analyst
okay. can you add some color to what that hasn't been disclosed to my knowledge? what would be...
clifford press -- chief executive officer
i think considering where that company is in its ipo. we -- the transaction was done in such a way where existing shareholders could maintain their shareholding and we did do so.
kevin sami -- sami capital -- analyst
understood. thank you.

it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to rob fink. sir, the floor is yours.
rob fink -- investor relations

i'd like to remind everyone that a press release disclosing the company's financial results issued this afternoon, after the close of market. this release may be accessed on the company's website at acaciaresearch.com under the news and events tab.
with all that said, i'd now like to turn the call over to clifford press. clifford, the call is yours.
clifford press -- chief executive officer
thank you, rob. good afternoon, everyone. this has been an active period for acacia. during the quarter we essentially completed our planned monetization of the woodford life science's portfolio with the ipo of oxford nanopore technologies at the end of september on the london stock exchange. oxford nanopore is the largest single position in that portfolio and we were the fourth largest shareholder pre-ipo. as a result of the ipo, we recognized nearly $120 million in realized and unrealized gains for the quarter. acacia sold approximately 10% of its position in this ipo, generating net proceeds of approximately $22 million and our remaining position represent just over 35 million shares was valued at $267.8 million at september 30, 2021. we have entered into a six-month lockup for our remaining shares and because of this agreement, we are valuing our remaining position with a slight discount until the expiry of the lockup. we have now recovered $256 million of our original $282 million investment in this life science portfolio.
as of september 30, we held positions in four public companies, including arix biosciences, immunocore and oxford nanopore valued at $348.7 million. we also continue to hold meaningful positions in three private life science's companies and we believe there is significant potential for these companies.
looking ahead, we are actively working to complete acquisitions of companies through a tightly coordinated research process, leveraging our team's experience in public and private markets with a seasoned board of directors. we focus on mature technology, life sciences, healthcare and industrials and certain segments of the financial services area, including insurance. our primary opportunity set remains with companies that are under $2 billion in equity market cap. as we have said in the past, we view this segment as the least efficient area in the public markets and one that favors our primary research approach and permanent capital structure. our ongoing partnership with starboard value lp continues to result in a growing pipeline of potential attractive acquisition opportunities. our expanded team is performing due diligence with involvement of our board of directors as we evaluate these opportunities and we have recently identified two public companies, where we have built meaningful positions and have made offers to bank [phonetic].
with respect to our ip business, investments made over the past year have resulted in a diversified portfolio, producing revenue through a range of licensing agreements. this was a stellar quarter for us with $1.6 million in revenue, down from $19.5 million in the third quarter of last year. however, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we were pleased to enter into a very important license agreement with samsung electronics company limited relating to our wi-fi 6 standards essential patents. terms of this agreement are confidential. the completion of the first license related to this wi-fi 6 portfolio, in such a short period since we acquired it is indicative of the very significant value of the investment. beyond that our team is actively advancing a number of opportunities to monetize our existing ip assets and acquire additional portfolios.
just after the quarter ended, we acquired printronix. a company that provides printing solutions on unique formats and in certain industrial settings where laser and other printers are not feasible. printronix' solutions have been integrated into long-standing workflows where they provide specialized capabilities. this has resulted in strong recurring revenue for consumables and ongoing maintenance. printronix generate substantial operating and free cash flow. we couldn't be more pleased with this acquisition. we've been impressed by the management team at printronix to bring with them many years of experience in this highly specialized field and we are excited to welcome the customers and employees of printronix to the acacia family.
acacia today has substantial capital resources, with $605 million in cash and public equity investments at the end of september, another $35 million in restricted cash relating to our preferred stock. if starboard value were to exercise the remainder of the warrants at $5.25 per share cash exercise price, our capital available would rise to more than $1 billion. this does not include the potential value of our private holdings, which we carry at cost.
with that i'd like to turn the call over to rich rosenstein, our cfo to discuss the results. rich?
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
thank you, clifford. first, i'd like to note that the acquisition of printronix closed in early october subsequent to the end of the quarter. accordingly, the results reported today, do not include any contribution from this business nor reflect the $33 million in cash paid for this business.
our gaap book value at september 30, 2021 was $235.9 million or $4.82 per basic share, compared to $292.5 million or $5.94 per basic share at december 31, 2020. as a reminder, our gaap book value includes the impact of our warrant and embedded derivative liabilities on our balance sheet, which in turn reflect the impact of the increase in the company's share price over the last year. as these liabilities would be extinguished upon exercise or expiration of these warrants and convertible preferred stock, we think it is more useful to consider our book value should all of these instruments be fully converted. on this basis, assuming full exercise of all issued derivatives, acacia's pro forma book value would rise to $1 billion or $6.31 per share, up from $942.8 million or $5.70 per share as of june 30, 2021 and $882.5 million or $5.39 per share on the same basis as of december 31, 2020.
for the quarter, highlights of our financial performance include the following: revenues for the quarter were -- for the third quarter of 2021 were $1.6 million compared to $19.5 million a year ago. operating loss was $12.7 million in the quarter, compared to a loss of $2.8 million a year ago. realized and unrealized gains totaled $104.2 million in the quarter. cash and equity securities at fair value totaled $605.1 million at september 30, 2021, compared to $274.6 million at december 31, 2020. and debt was $182.9 million in senior secured notes issued to starboard value lp. more detail on these results have been made available in the press release issued just after the close and then our quarterly report on form 10-q, which we -- will be filed with the sec, just after the close as well.
now let me turn the call back to clifford for closing comments. clifford?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
thanks, rich. in conclusion, during this quarter, several facets of our strategy came into focus. acacia is uniquely positioned -- is a uniquely positioned acquirer of businesses and a compelling counterparty. our focus continues to be on improvement in our underlying net asset value and executing our acquisition strategy.
and we would now be happy to answer any questions.

operator
certainly, the floor is now open for questions. [operator instructions] your first question is coming from anthony stoss. please announce your affiliation and pose your question.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
hi. anthony stoss, craig hallum. hey, clifford, rich.
clifford press -- chief executive officer
hey tony.
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
hey tony.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
i'm not sure how much you'll be able to say, but with both spok and maybe comtech is too early on, are things progressing at kind of the rate that you would have expected and i know you're limited to what you can say, but i'm just curious from the timing perspective? if you can shed some light on how much longer you think that'll go? and the easier one for, rich, the g&a was up quite a bit, you've been chugging along a little over $6 million in the bounce to $10.3 million. i know you had a bunch of m&a transactions during the quarter. where do you think opex or g&a should look for the december quarter?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
why don't you answer that first, rich, and then i'll comment on the transactions.
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks, tony. so from a headcount perspective we really have not increased significantly our headcount, since the last quarter. so the expenses that you're seeing really relate to the deals that we're working on and expenses incurred and diligence in deals and pursuing those deals. so that's going to be a function in each quarter of how active we are in diligencing and working through our execution process. so, i don't want to give a specific number for the fourth quarter, because we're actively involved in a couple of situations right now, as you know and then others that we continue to work on, but that's going to vary quarter-to-quarter based upon our level of activity in our acquisition pipeline.
clifford press -- chief executive officer
thanks, rich. and tony with regard to your first question about the two offers that we've made. those are obviously public company offers and it remains to be seen. what happens there? i would say that we have not been surprised by any of the developments to date in either of those situations. i think the trading price of both of those securities relative to the offer is probably best indication of how things are going.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay. and i just, did follow-up on your comment clifford on this samsung wi-fi patent license. clearly wi-fi 6 is going to be huge. i would presume that you've maybe given notice to other companies or how do you think this will play out with other customers? and then maybe a similar question on the ethernet patents that i think you guys had disclosed a license with cisco i believe, i'm curious if you've made any progress with other customers there as well?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
as you know, in the ip business, the first license is very important. we have had a long-standing relationship with samsung in the past. and we think this is critical transaction for monetizing this portfolio. and as for the future, samsung is one of the first of a very, very long list of companies to whom these patents would apply. so i think we expect to not proceed and license these patents to the remaining users. similar story on the ethernet patents. we pay a lot of attention to our first counterparty as does the industry and it's an indication of where things go from there.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay. and maybe if i could sneak in one more here for rich. on printronix, closed after the quarter. can you maybe help us understand revenue, profitability, opex, headcount that you'd be incurring here in the december quarter?
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
yes. what i can say about printronix as we mentioned at the time it was a $33 million acquisition, and we said that we paid approximately 3.5 times ebitda. so that will give you a sense of the profitability. a bit under $10 million. and we'll have a lot more to say about it in the fourth quarter when we will include their results within our own.
anthony stoss -- craig-hallum -- analyst
okay. thanks, rich. thanks guys. good luck.
clifford press -- chief executive officer
thanks, tony.
operator
your next question is coming from brett reiss with janney montgomery scott. please pose your question.
brett reiss -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
thank you, operator. hi, clifford. hi, richard.
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
hello brett.
clifford press -- chief executive officer
hey, brett.
brett reiss -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
hi. the nol was about $285 million and you booked $100 million plus in realized gains from the woodford portfolio. so is the nol now down to about $185 million? is that the way that works?
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
not exactly. so you're right, we had between net operating loss carry forwards and capital loss carry-forwards at the end of 2020, we had $285 million of both combined. we have sold and realized some gains during the course of the year, including in the third quarter when we sold a small part of our oxford nanopore position and we sold another position in the -- during the quarter, which is a part of our ownership of immunocore, and so we did recognize some gains. but the $100 million that you're referencing is actually our realized and unrealized gains. so the impact on our nol to use of our nol, really relates only to the realization of gains not unrealized. so it's, quite a bit less than the $400 million.
brett reiss -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay. so because the nol is still material and in place, the blocker provision that would prevent starboard from exercising their warrants is also still at play.
clifford press -- chief executive officer
the document speaks for itself brett and the blocker is in the documents. it's not tied to the existence of the nol.
brett reiss -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay. now, the $605 million in cash on the balance sheet in the release, you show $217.9 million in cash and equivalents and then there is a line item, equity securities at fair value, is that treasury bills? is that part of the cash?
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
no, no. those are, think of those has the marketable securities. so those are the publicly traded securities $387 million.
brett reiss -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay. so where is the other $400 million -- when you say you have $605 million in cash, where is that?
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
no, its cash and equity investments...
brett reiss -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
oh, and equity. okay.
clifford press -- chief executive officer
its cash and marketable securities, brett.
brett reiss -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
got it, got it, got it. sorry about that.
clifford press -- chief executive officer
that's not a problem.
brett reiss -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
now, you mentioned, you filed that you owned securities in spok. but i've not seen a filing on -- on the smtl. but in your remarks, you indicated that you did buy securities in -- do you own some of the smtl and you just haven't filed?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
well, as you know, brett, the filing threshold is 5%. so we are obviously under 5% in our ownership.
brett reiss -- janney montgomery scott -- analyst
okay. i will -- thank you for answering my questions. i'll drop back in queue because there may be others on the call.
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
thanks, brett.
operator
there appear to be no further questions in queue at this time. i'd like to turn the floor back over to clifford press for any closing comments.
richard rosenstein -- chief financial officer
clifford?
clifford press -- chief executive officer
sorry. thank you very much for attending. we look forward to explaining the rest of the acacia strategy as it comes into focus going forward. as you know it's been a while to prepare and assemble the company to start executing, and we think that the best way to make it clear what our strategy is, will be to demonstrate by example and execute on transactions. we look very much forward to having that happen and being able to report on that as we proceed.
