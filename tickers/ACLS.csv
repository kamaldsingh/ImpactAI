[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of patrick ho with stifel. you may now ask your question.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
well, thank you very much and congrats on the really nice finish to the year and the outlook for '21. mary, maybe first off, in terms of the market environment, you're talking about a memory recovery in '21, compared to three months ago do you see the magnitude of that memory recovery being ""greater than it was three months ago,"" and i guess how does that potentially impact from there when the wafer is build-out, as well as how many tools you may be shipping to the memory market in '21?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so, patrick, we've been saying now for quite a while that we expect a recovery in memory in 2021. i think if you take a look back, if you remember, in q3, we actually shipped no systems to any memory customers. in q4 that has increased to 25% and we're actually saying that we expect memory to account for 30% to 40% of our systems revenue in 2021 and that's in comparison and up from 29%, which is where we ended for full year 2020. so we are starting to see some signs of the memory recovery and we expect it to continue throughout the remainder of the year. doug, i don't know if you have anything you want to add to that.
douglas a. lawson -- executive vice president, corporate marketing and strategy
i'm sure. thanks mary. patrick, the recovery that we're seeing this past quarter is split 15% and 10% for dram and nand and we expect -- we are seeing activity on both fronts, both nand and dram. and so as we've been saying about this particular memory recovery, we see it as more of a longer-term, a couple of year kind of recovery versus what we saw back in '17 and '18 where it was very steep, ultimately be more area under the curve in terms of growth as a result. and we're poised to do well there with our position. any percentages of memory versus mature in our projections are primarily due to the fact that the mature markets are just so active right now and that's become a much bigger piece of our business compared to what it was back in '17-'18 timeframe.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
great, that's helpful. and maybe as my followup question for kevin, in terms of your working capital management, ar obviously was a little bit up which may highlight some of the linearity but you are also building some inventory. have you run into any supply constraints on your end, as you are preparing for a higher level of shipments this year, any supply constraint or issues on that front in procuring part?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, thanks patrick. that's a good question. so i would say the supply chain constraints are what they've been for most of 2020 with the pandemic, things were tight. we've continued to drive inventory probably a little ahead of where we need it to be, so that we're not waiting for long lead material, and as things kind of tightened up in different spots in 2020, we were able to move things around a little bit. we do have in some cases, multiple suppliers.
so it's about the same now. i think the pandemic related issues are improving, but as you point out the industry is ramping. so there is additional pressure coming for a different reason now. but all in all, i would say it's about what we had to deal with last year, so i don't expect any issues. we're keeping up what we need to do this year, ramping.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
great, thank you very much.
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, thanks patrick.

your next question comes from the line of craig ellis with b. riley securities. you may now ask your question.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
thanks for taking the questions. and congratulations on a real strong 2020 and finish to the year. so i just wanted to start with a near-term question. it's clear that the company believes that cs&i will move backwards to that $42 million level, but within the memory and mature foundry business, can you just characterize some of the gives and takes for the first quarter and help us understand how dram versus nand might be performing to start the year?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
okay, so. oh go ahead doug, you can take it, if you like.
douglas a. lawson -- executive vice president, corporate marketing and strategy
sorry about that. so craig, we are seeing activity on both fronts. and as you know, we are more dependent on wafer start additions. and so we are seeing activity from both sides and it was split relatively evenly in the fourth quarter from as we look at the first quarter, we're seeing activity in both fronts. so it looks good. from a mature standpoint, the mature markets are very active -- have been throughout 2020 and continue and we don't see that slowing down in 2021.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
that's helpful and maybe...
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
yeah and craig, if you want...
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
go ahead mary.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
no, i was just going to give a little bit more color on the mature markets. so you know last year, image sensor and the general mature foundry business was very strong and it continues to be into 2021. automotive showed weakness, but we do see it recovering and that's going to be positive for the power device market, which is going to be positive for axcelis.
and then as doug said, we're seeing activity on both sides of memory. so it's -- we're getting to the point where we see most of our markets and market segments beginning to hit on fulfilling this.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
that's great. and then longer term, the company commented on memory being 30% to 40% of systems, can you just characterize the demand visibility that you have through calendar '21 in different parts of the mature foundry and with dram and nand specifically so we can get a sense of how far out order visibility extends now?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean i think we have very good visibility into the first half of the year and things are starting to become more clear moving into the second half of the year, but we are seeing changes in terms of customer timings, both pull-ins and some delays in some cases, not really because of the market. i think what i would say, i would characterize it mostly as some slight delays in fab readiness.
so we expect -- that's normal for us though. i don't think we're seeing anything that's necessarily out of the ordinary at this point in time. so as i said, first half visibility good, second half, starting to improve. and i think customers do realize that given the ongoing challenges with the pandemic and in some cases the geopolitical situation they may need to lock-in on their forecast and notify suppliers maybe a little bit sooner than they normally would just because they want to make sure they get in the queue for their systems, given some of the lead times that are out there right now.
kevin, just commented that things seem to be manageable at this point in time, but if you add a ramp on top of a pandemic and you can get some issues at some point moving forward. so customers are aware of that.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
absolutely. and then one final one before i hop back in the queue. it's a multi-parter and more in the political realm. but first part of it would be, can you provide us any color on the optics that you have into the license granting process and then on the other side of that, i think it was within the last two days that a number of the very large u.s. chip companies were speaking to the new administration and really expressing the need for a lot more federal government help building out the u.s. chip supply industry, if something were to happen in that regard, what would it mean for axcelis?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
well, we're monitoring all the geopolitical -- the situation and the issues obviously on an -- on an ongoing basis. and so, we've got our legal counsel watching it carefully. we're working with outside trade attorneys we're very involved with semi -- our industry trade groups to make sure that our voice is heard as well as to better understand the situation.
obviously, investment in semiconductor fabs would be a positive thing and in the u.s., we would love that. we think that, that would be a real upside for the u.s. government, the country and for axcelis. in terms of some of the other geopolitical issues, there's really not a lot to say about what's going on with the licenses. i think that's maybe what you were poking at a little bit, craig. we've applied for the licenses, we are prepared to ship systems and parts against customer requirements as soon as we receive the licenses and we just haven't heard anything back yet. as far as we understand, we don't believe that anything significant has changed based on the change in administration, but again we are all basically just waiting.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks so much mary.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of christian schwab with craig-hallum. you may now ask your question.
tyler -- craig-hallum -- analyst
hey guys, this is tyler [phonetic] on behalf of christian. thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions. first question, i think you alluded to it, but maybe a little more color, what's your expectation as far as the timing of the memory recovery through the year? are you expecting kind of a step up here in q1 or does a gradual improvement to the year, any color on timing will be great.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
i don't think we necessarily have enough visibility. i mean i just alluded to the fact that there is visibility in q1 that leads us to believe that there is the memory -- and we have visibility into the first half, i'm sorry and which leads us to believe that a memory recovery will occur in 2021, but we don't -- i don't really -- we just don't have a view at this point in time, and we're not really going to forecast that in terms of putting numbers around it. so as i mentioned before, we're seeing an improvement in the percentage of systems that we're shipping out to memory customers and we do expect that as a percent over the course of the year to increase versus last year, so 30% to 40% versus 29%. but in terms of the timing, we're just going to continue to watch -- talk to our customers and watch the trends in the market.
tyler -- craig-hallum -- analyst
understood, that's very helpful. second question then, i believe previously your comments were that at some point in 2021 you expected to reach a run rate of your $550 million annual model. so i guess given where q1 was guided and expectations for an improving memory market and an improving automotive market, i'm wondering if it's a reasonable to think that the full year '21 kind of being close to our approach to that $550 million annual target?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, tyler, this is kevin. so obviously it's in our line of sight right now with the guide we'd say, you're right, we had kind of been saying at some point we hit the run rate in 2021 and then into the 2022 then. we're not providing for your guidance at this point. but as you point out and as i just said, it's in our line of sight at this point and the 650 model continue to say is a couple of years after the 550 but obviously we're setting up well coming out of the gate in q1.
tyler -- craig-hallum -- analyst
sounds great, very helpful. that's all from me guys. thanks.
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of tom diffely with d.a. davidson. you may now ask your question.
tom diffely -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yes, good morning, thanks for the question. mary, you said that you expect to close one of your eval tools during the quarter and i'm wondering what is your thought as far as the process of starting to ramp up production tools based off the eval over the next few quarters?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
i think the prospects are actually very good. i will actually say that for this evaluation, we have already shipped some repeat orders to that customer prior to the evaluation closing. so we definitely have been selected as ptor for the specific application. we've shipped some repeat tools and we expect to ship some additional tools moving forward.
tom diffely -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great, and then kevin, when you look at the margin profile, how big of an impact does both the closing of the eval tool have on the margin in the quarter. and then when you look at the top and the bottom of your guidance range, what is the impact of the margins there?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, so i mean evals always have a negative effect. some evals have higher cost than others. so that certainly moves in a number of the eval. and i think what's going on in q1 is weâve got the evals going out. we've also got a higher mix of high current tools going out, which overall is good for the company because that's a large market and that's one of the areas we want to continue to grow in is high occurrence, but maybe i could help you a little bit more. if i look at the full year right now, tom, i'm seeing full-year gross margin in 2021 similar to what they were in 2020. the net includes a number of evals flows analysis. as mary said, we've got one closing out and another one going out, which is 6. and i think that as you recall, typically we would have 2 or 3. so we've been saying for the last couple of quarters there's a high number of evals and more going. so those are sitting on the margins. and the other thing, we're going to see a lot of growth this year coming from system versus cs&i right. so as the systems grow and that's been accretive cs&i. that can pressure things a little bit, but the good news is, with all out in their growth in systems, all the evals, i at this point expect gross margins full year to finish similar to last year and our target model is 42 to 43 on 550. so we're just off of that a tiny bit. and if you look and try to do the math and figure when we get there and think about cross-sell initiatives, maybe we can deliver sooner than we thought. some of these initiatives still have to kick in. so i -- from a gross margin point of view, i feel really good where we're right now and expect this year to continue to drive cost out and get the value and more purion product extensions. and those are all things we need to get through our models and then the 650 model margins are up to 44 to 45 and that's a couple later. so, we're are in good shape, tom.
tom diffely -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great, now that's very helpful. thanks for the questions.
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, thank you.

your next question comes from the line of mark miller with the benchmark. you may now ask your question.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
thank you for the question, congrats on your progress. were there any shares repurchased last quarter?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
there were not, mark, so with the -- the program that was in place last year was suspended in q1. we did not put that back in place and then the board approved a new program for this year, a $100 million. and as a reminder, the prior program was $50 million and we had spent about $25 million of purchasing shares prior to putting that on hold.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
you've indicated recovery in the auto sector. i'm just wondering is that starting to accelerate because there's been a lot of talk about ship shortages spaced in the auto manufacturers and i'm just wondering if that's really starting to accelerate significantly?
douglas a. lawson -- executive vice president, corporate marketing and strategy
mark, can you repeat the question. i heard the ship shortages, but i wasn't sure what the front end was?
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
well there are some reports the auto manufacturers are facing chip shortages. i'm just wondering, you said there was recovery going on in the auto, is that starting to really accelerate as the quarter went on?
douglas a. lawson -- executive vice president, corporate marketing and strategy
we started seeing it pick up in the last quarter. it's -- we see it in a few different areas, we see it in the power device area, which started to strengthen last quarter and we see that continuing to grow throughout the year. the image sensor market is a big piece of the automotive world these days. and that's been strong in and it's hard for us to tell exactly what's going to automotive versus phones and other image sensor applications. and then the general foundry which general mature foundry, which is what's really all in the press these days where everybody is talking about $0.20 parts keeping lines down. that whole mature foundry market has been strong, utilizations in that segment have been very high, and so that's been a big piece of our business over the course of 2020 as people bought all the consumer electronics and pcs and so forth. and that will continue now that if you start layering automotive on top of it.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of quinn bolton with needham & company. you may now ask your question.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
congratulations on the nice results. just wanted to ask, maybe i missed it, but did you say which of the 6 eval tools had been accepted for revenue recognition or will be accepted for rev rec in the march quarter.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
no, we didn't say which one would be accepted in q1 and we didn't talk yet about the new one that will be going out in the quarter either. so we'll give more color on that as we progress through the quarter into next quarter.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
like, i think it was tom's question that you've already received repeat orders for that eval tool that was closed.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
we have, i guess the only additional color i'll give around it is, it's for an image sensor application and we'll just leave it at that.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you, mary. second question i had is from the cs&i strength in the fourth quarter, it looks like perhaps you're not subject to export controls for that part of the business, just wondering if that's the right read and given the very strong level at $58 million, is there a risk that, that customer doesn't purchase for some time and cs&i revenue could actually come in below $42 million at some point, as that customer digests inventory of spares?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i'm not worried about that. i think that the customer who did a lot of buying is also running at a very high utilization rate and we have shipped a number of tools there and i think they obviously -- they're probably putting more parts [indecipherable] itself, but i think they're going to continue to buy anyway. and as the business grows around this week, we had strength across the board. i striked out that one customer, but there is continued strength across the board. so i think the $42 million number that weâve put out there to model to is the right number theyâre using and i don't see any downside risk to that.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
and just lastly, kevin. for the $100 million share repurchase program. can you give us any sense, is that going to be under a 10b5-1. will you be sort of in the market on a consistent basis so you're going to try to be opportunistic, any sort of thoughts on how that $100 million buyback is executed this year?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, quinn. so we will use a 10b5-1, which is similar to what we did on the program last year that we're executing under. and beyond that, whether we are opportunistic or not, i mean it will be a board approved grid that we buy to. and i think, the board management realize that we should be returning cash to shareholders through some type of program, which we agreed as a share repurchase. so -- and i'm not going to say how much we're going to spend because, right, i mean we put it out there, we could spend it all or a good portion of it. i guess what i'll leave you is we realize that we need to be utilizing this program. so again that quinn...
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
i know you're limited. yeah. i know you can't give us too much on timing or amounts but thanks for the color you did provide. and that's it for me, i'll go back in the queue. thank you.
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, thanks.

good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the axcelis technologies call to discuss the company's results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. my name is jerome and i'll be your coordinator for today. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, mary puma, president and ceo of axcelis technologies. please proceed, ma'am.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, jerome. with me today is kevin brewer, executive vice president and cfo; and doug lawson, executive vice president of corporate marketing and strategy. we are all participating in this call remotely so i would like to apologize in advance for any technical difficulties. if you have not seen a copy of our press release issued last night, it is available on our website. playback service will also be available on our website as described in our press release.
please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the sec's safe harbor provision. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. these risks are described in detail in our form 10-k, annual report and other sec filings, which we urge you to review. our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. we do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
good morning and thank you for joining us. as a result of the strength of the overall electronics market and the growth of the purion product family in 2020, axcelis delivered its highest annual revenue in the last 15 years. to achieve this, our employees managed through many difficult logistical challenges brought on by the geopolitical environment and the continuing pandemic. i'd like to thank our employees for delivering these results while continuing to serve our customers and adhering to safety protocols.
this challenging environment has continued into 2021. but despite this, we are planning for another year of growth at axcelis. the semiconductor industry is forecast to gain strength across all markets and the purion product family is poised for significant growth. our fourth quarter financial performance was in line with our updated increased guidance. revenue for the fourth quarter was $122.2 million with earnings per share of $0.43, gross margins of 43.4% and a year-end cash balance of $204.2 million.
eps was favorably impacted by a previously unrecognized tax benefit of $0.11 per diluted share. for the full year 2020, revenue was $47.6 million with an eps of $1.46. our aftermarket business or what we refer to as cs&i once again contributed significantly to our revenue and gross margin. cs&i revenue was $58 million in q4 and $181 million for the full year 2020. this strong performance was a result of high fab utilization, the growing purion installed base and additional buying activity from one customer, as a result of the current geopolitical situation.
the growing mature process technology market continues to be an area of strength for axcelis, with 75% of q4 shipments going to mature foundry and logic customers, the other 25% went to memory customers with nand accounting for 15% and dram 10%. for the year, the mature process technology market accounted for 71% of shipments with memory accounting for 29%.
china continues to be a strong market for axcelis. the geographic mix of our systems shipments in the fourth quarter was china 56%, the u.s. 20%, korea 18% and taiwan 6%. for the year, our geographic split was china 54%, korea 28%, the u.s. 5%, europe 3%, japan 2% and taiwan 8%. we expect the memory market will improve in 2021, but as a result of the continued growth in the mature markets and the strength of axcelis' product offerings in these segments, we expect that the mature markets will account for approximately 60% to 70% of our total shipments in 2021.
during the fourth quarter, the u.s. government placed chinese foundry customer smic on the entity list, meaning that licenses are required for all axcelis u.s. shipments to smic. we have applied for licenses and are prepared to ship these tools against customer requirements in the first quarter. as a result of the uncertainty related to these licenses, we are providing wider than usual guidance.
for the first quarter, we expect revenue of between $118 million and $138 million, gross margins of approximately 40%, operating profit of between $11 million and $19 million and earnings per share of between $0.22 and $0.42. continued growth of purion products is the key to achieving our long-term business models. we shipped the first purion 200 revenue tool to a second customer for use in power device manufacturing. the power device market is a critical market for axcelis and targeted purion products for silicon carbide including the purion h200 will play a key role in increasing our customer base and revenues in this segment.
we currently have 6 purion evaluation tools in the field, focused on supporting growth toward our $650 million business model. during the first quarter, we expect to close one of these evaluations and ship an additional new one, resulting in a balance of 6 evaluation systems in the field as we head into the second quarter.
before kevin reviews the financials, i would like to summarize four key takeaways. first, the mature process technology market is very strong and growing and axcelis is the ion implant market leader in this segment. second, memory is expected to recover in 2021 and will be additive to our strong mature process technology performance. third, china will continue to be an important market for axcelis driven by many customers both domestic and multinational. and fourth, the purion product family is extremely well positioned to support future growth and our $650 million business model.
now i'd like to turn it over to kevin to discuss our financials and some operational details. kevin?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mary, and good morning. axcelis delivered exceptional fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial performance. thanks to the continued outstanding work of our employees and supply chain partners. strong execution across the board and significant leverage in our business model delivered a 140% increase in operating profit on revenue growth of 38%. during this ongoing pandemic, the health and well-being of our employees remains a top priority. we are doing our best to create a safe work environment for everyone at axcelis.
pandemic related protocols that were implemented during 2020 remain in place for 2021. our pandemic response team will continue to closely monitor these actions and update as required. we remain focused on our target business model and expect 2021 to be another growth year for axcelis. we will continue to invest in products, evaluation tools and infrastructure needed to support our $650 million target model.
turning to fourth quarter and full-year financial results, q4 revenue finished at $122.2 million and above our updated guidance compared to $110.4 million in q3. q4 systems sales was $64.2 million compared to $70.3 million in q3. q4 cs&i revenue finished at $58 million compared to $40.2 in q3. the unusually high cs&i revenue in q4 was driven by fab utilization, a growing purion installed base and significant buying in the quarter by one of our customers. we expect q1 cs&i revenue of approximately $42 million and recommend modeling at this quarterly level for 2021. full year 2020 revenue was $474.6 million compared to $343 million in 2019, an increase of 38%.
systems revenue was $293.6 million compared to $202.6 million in 2019, an increase of 45%. cs&i revenue was $181 million compared to $140.4 million in 2019, an increase of 29%. q4 sales to our top 10 customers accounted for 81.5% of our total sales compared to 76% in q3. three customers are at 10% or above in q4, the same as q3. for the full year, 74% of the revenue came from our top 10 customers with two at 10% or above. q4 system bookings were $131.5 million compared to $26.4 million in q3. q4 book-to-bill ratio of 1.98 versus 0.37 in q3. backlog in q4 including deferred revenue finished at $93.2 million compared to $45.1 million in q3.
q4 combined sg&a and r&d spending was $38.9 million or 31.8% of revenue compared to $34.3 million or 31% in q3. q4 combined sg&a and r&d spending was higher than forecast, primarily driven by variable compensation expense. sg&a in the quarter was $22.6 million, with r&d at $16.3 million. in q1, we expect sg&a and r&d spending to be approximate $36 million and run at this level through the remainder of 2021. q4 gross margin was 43.4% and above our updated guidance. q4 gross margin was driven by higher than forecast cs&i revenue and continued cost out activity. full-year gross margin was 41.8%, compared to 42% in 2019. we are guiding q1 gross margin of approximately 40%, driven by a less favorable mix of products and closure of an evaluation system.
gross margins will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, based on product and customer mix, the number of evaluation tools flows and the percent of revenue contribution for our accretive cs&i business. we've made solid progress on gross margin through cross-sell initiatives, new purion product extensions and growth in our cs&i business. our target models reflect additional gross margin improvement, some incremental volume, higher sales of purion product extensions, the continued savings from lean manufacturing and value engineering. operating profit in q4 finished at $14.1 million compared to $13.9 million from q3. full-year operating profit was $58 million, an increase of a 140% compared to $24.3 million in 2019. we are guiding q1 operating profit of between $11 million and $19 million.
q4 net income was $14.7 million or $0.43 per share compared to $10.8 million or $0.32 per share in q3. net income and eps were favorably impacted by a previously unrecognized tax benefit of $0.11 per diluted share. full-year net income was $50 million or $1.46 per share compared to $17 million or $0.50 per share in 2019, resulting in a greater than a 190% year-over-year increase. weâre guiding q1 earnings per share of between 22% and 40%. our q1 guidance reflects our current assessment of the potential impact on our business from the coronavirus and the expert control situation with a specific customer in china, which we will continue to closely monitor. q4 cash finished at $204.2 million compared to $212.7 million in q3.
we announced a $100 million share repurchase program for 2021. q4 receivables were $86.9 million compared to $45.2 million in q3. q4 inventory ended at $161 million compared to $159.7 million in q3. q4 inventory turns, excluding evaluation tools finished at 2.0 compared to 1.8 in q3. q4 accounts payable was $24 million compared to $24.3 million in q3. we finished 2020 with strong momentum and are excited about the prospects of recovery in the memory and automotive market. we continue to make the necessary investments in our products and the infrastructure needed for our $650 million target model. our customers continue to have high expectations for our dram products which we intend to achieve.
thank you, and i'll now turn the call back to mary for closing comments.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, kevin. we are pleased with our fourth quarter financial performance, as well as our exceptional overall performance in 2020 and are looking forward to another year of growth in 2021. axcelis has a competitive purion product line, a broad and diverse customer base, a strong balance sheet and a dedicated team of employees. these are the strengths that will continue to drive our growth toward our $650 million model and ultimately to a market leadership position in ion implantation. with that, i'd like to open it up for questions. jerome?

[operator instructions] your first question comes from patrick ho with stifel.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
thank you very much, and congrats on the nice quarter. actually, i have two questions for kevin. gross margins you performed very well in the first quarter, and as you mentioned there is only moving pieces with it. but as we look at the next several quarters with some of the moving pieces you talked about, evaluation assistance, continued cross-sell program, and even customer mix potentially impacting over the next few quarters; what are the biggest influences you believe will impact gross margins one way or other over the next few quarters?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, thanks, patrick. yes, so i think in the beginning of the year we thought gross margins would be similar to last year. if you look at where we are right now with our cross-sell roadmap, we are probably ahead of where we thought would be on revenues. as mary said, we now expect to exceed or beat $550 million revenue model this year.
so, cross-sell roadmaps are little bit farther, but volumes [indecipherable] 0:16:37 we have the evals that are kind of converting. those have always been in the plan.
so i don't think it's -- i was wrong to say that we're on-track for our $550 million or above revenue model this year. we've got our gross margin targets in there. even though we're a little bit ahead of that, patrick, we could certainly come into low-end of those gross margin ranges. so at this point, at 42% range plus or minus a little bit, i think that's where the year is going to be.
so even with all of moving pieces and again everything accelerating and all these evals and stuff, we are continuing to make a change. so i think we are going to have very solid year gross margin.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and my follow-up question also for you, kevin, is on the supply chain and the inventory situation. given that there are covid constraints in the ecosystem itself, you guys still actually managed it very well from an inventory and supply chain perspective. but again, with a lot of moving parts and eval systems, and just customer demand picking up, how are you managing your inventory levels and your ability to procure supplies to not only, one, meet demand, but to get these evaluation systems into the field?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so, we've continued to have our planning with raw materials in place for long lead material. the real trick is to make sure we've got the long lead. and i think you would acknowledge we're a little flush with inventory right now. i mean the churns are holding it through. but we've been driving ahead of this thing really since the pandemic started, because my philosophy always was if i get out of line we are not going to be able get back in.
so i think we are in pretty good shape, patrick, from a supply chain point of view. there is obviously issues that pop up on daily basis. but that's not new, right? everybody goes through that.
there is no doubt that everybody is running hard right now. it's not just axcelis is doing well, no. the peer group as well is doing remarkably well at this point. so there's pressure there, but i think the key is to stay ahead of it, maybe drive inventory a little bit sooner that we need it, which we have doing. and we should be good to execute on the plan this year.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

your next question comes from craig ellis with b. riley securities.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
yes, thanks for taking the question. and team, congratulations not only on the quarterly execution, but on all the strategic progress to the intermediate and long-term goal.
so, mary, i wanted to start just with a question for you on calendar '21. so nice to see the company feeling confident about the $550 million. that implies given 1q results and 2q guidance at least $140 million a quarter on average in the back-half of the year. so the question is, can you just share with us some of the visibility that you have and any thoughts on linearity that we might see as we go through the back-half of the year?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
thanks very much, craig. so we expect 2021 to be a great year. at this point, we see demand holding up and remaining strong across all market segments. we think this is through the multiyear cycle, and essentially that most of the markets are hitting on all cylinders. and as you said, the data points that we expect to exceed $550 million this year and even hit our $650 million revenue run rate by '22 means that we are continuing to sow those seeds and build strong business even out for the future.
so, in terms of the segments, the mature process technology market remains extremely strong for us. there is strength in iot, which drives general mature technology devices such as sensors. we have got image sensors. we have got power devices. and those are quite strong and even growing because of the recovery we are seeing in automotive.
memory is increasing and that is part of what is driving our confidence throughout the remainder of the year. but as i said, we expect the mature process technology segment to account for over 70% of our systems revenue in 2021. so that's going to be the major driver of what we see going on. although memory will be additive to that, and as it recovers obliviously will be another strong lever.
so we think the stars are all aligned in terms of the market segments, and because of the strong product portfolio that we have both in terms of the purion products, the base product, plus the product line extensions, and the fact that we are exceeding the market with evals of six in the field plus additional going out in the future, we feel real confidence that things will continue to be strong throughout 2021.
we haven't given guidance for the second-half of the year. you just do the math in terms of what at a minimum would need to happen to exceed $550 million. so, at this point, i think we will leave it there. and as we move throughout the year and we get further clarity and data we can share, we will certainly do that with you.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
that's fair. and thanks for all that color. and then the second question is really a longer-term question. just really nice to hear the point on the potential for the $650 million target model on a quarterly run rate basis some time in calendar '22.
the question there is, to what extent is the significant success with the product customizations, and the sam expansion that they would engender, really playing to that door? to what extent alternatively, is it just some of the bigger capex commitments that we've seen, and some of the other things that are also quite significant on a multiyear basis, but maybe not those leading logic for foundry guys really driving the expectation that we could get to that $650 million target on a run rate basis next year?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
yes. well, let me just start with saying we've always said that markets really across all of the segments would need to be strong for us to hit our $550 million and $650 million revenue targets. so, obviously, as i mentioned, we're expecting the markets to continue strong into next year and over the next few years. but absolutely, our success is being driven by the purion product line. and a lot of that is coming from the product line extensions, and what we're doing in some of those markets.
so even if i look at the evaluations that are out in the field today, two of them are in memory. three are in mature process technology. so they're two image sensor and one power device, and one is advanced logic.
so just to talk briefly about advance logic, we said that we need to do more work to further penetrate into that market segment. and we're pretty excited that the evaluation that we have in place right now, will that turn into additional business for us, as we move into the $650 million model, and even beyond that. and we are working with the other advanced logic customers to make progress there.
but in the mature process technology segment, that's really where our specialty products or the market segment driven products really shine. the image sensor market, we've done incredibly well. and we said, we believe that we're the leader in implant in both image sensor and power devices. and so, very strong presence with high energy, some of the very high energy tools. now the purion xemax is our highest energy tool and the tools going into the power device market, so the purion h200, all of the silicon-carbide tools across the full spectrum of the purion product line, so high energy, high current and medium current. those are all really key drivers of our future growth. and i believe are really the underlying reason for the fact that we believe that we can even get beyond the $650 million model.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
very encouraging.
douglas a. lawson -- executive vice president, corporate marketing and strategy
this is doug.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
yes, doug.
douglas a. lawson -- executive vice president, corporate marketing and strategy
let me just add one other thing to it. so mary commented on the power market. there's a lot of discussion about the automotive chip shortage and so forth. one of the things that's interesting with our products is the purion power for silicon-carbide and silicon really targeted at a lot of the electric vehicle activity that's going on. and that's a little less caught up in the shortage. that's more of planning for the future. so i think that power device market is another key that allows us to drive toward the $650 million and beyond.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
yes. and certainly some positive comments within the last two weeks with some of the biggest chip manufacturers based in europe that serve that market with that technology, so good point, doug.
then if i could just ask a clarification before i hop back in the queue. nice to see some licenses granted for export shipment to that chinese customer. the question is this, to what extent were those granted relative to what you applied for? and to the extent that it was less than 100%, is there potential for further grants to move up to what we would hope to fully show? thank you.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we have multiple licenses that are out there to cover all of the orders that we have for across our purion product line, and actually even more significantly, a number of our legacy systems at this point in time. so we did just start. we're receiving some licenses. as we said, in the second quarter, we are shipping those tools and the parts associated with them that were approved on those licenses.
we are continuing to work with our outside trade council and with semi and the u.s. government to ensure that the rest of the licenses are granted. so at this point in time, we think that the flow of those licenses has begun. and we're continuing to work to ensure that the rest of them are in fact granted on a timely basis.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
very helpful. thanks, everybody.

your next question comes from tom diffely with d.a. davidson.
tom diffely -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yes, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. to follow-up on the last question, if you look at the really strong bookings in the quarter, is there a meaningful portion of those bookings that are going to also require export licenses going forward?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
so we did have a very strong bookings quarter out of china. but the thing that i want to continue to stress is that we have a very broad customer base in china. and that's comprised of both multi-national and domestic customers, although we've said that most of those customers and many of those customers are focused on the mature process technology markets.
the customer, smic, that requires export licenses is only one of those many customers that we have. so we -- at this point in time, we really -- we don't expect that there's any more significant risk to any of the systems that we're going to shift beyond what we already know associated with the smic license situation.
tom diffely -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay, great. and then, when you look at the csi business, obviously very strong in the quarter. i'm curious how, if at all, it was impacted by covid, and the inability of certain service people to move around? and also, what causes the variability on a quarterly basis? what's the biggest driver of variability?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, tom, it's kevin. so the variability, let me start with that. it's -- used tools are very spotty. we actually had a lot of used tools in the quarter. so that'll move it around. we are coming off a couple of strong quarters. i think everybody remembers q4 was very strong, but we did say there was a good amount of pre-buying going on and what we thought with some of our customers particularly in china. and we've always kind of framed the cs&i business at this revenue level of about a $40 million a quarter type business. so we're off to a strong start. we think q2 is around $40 million. i think the back half of the year could be around $42 million. so it's up a little bit for us.
so the variability really today has been, i think some pre-buying is strong, a surge in used tools, probably just driven because systems, in general, everybody's trying to get out of china at this point.
so i certainly want to leave my models at $50 million, but i wouldn't be worried that we brought back into the low 40s. because that's exactly where we expected to be based on a number of tools out there, number of what we think is our entitlement that goes with those tools to spare parts and service.
tom diffely -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay, great. and then finally, kevin, when you look at lead times for your tools, have they changed meaningful in the last few quarters? and are you having any supply issues yourself?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, so i know some of our peer group has talked about late times pushing way out. i think to this point, we've done a good job, or i think we're keeping up what customers are wanting. it's certainly not easy to pull tools in at this point, but -- and if i looked at what our standard lead times are to where we are, we're not that far off in terms of the manufacturing side of time. but as i mentioned earlier too, we are driving a lot of long lead material ahead of schedule, which helps. because that's really kind of the bottleneck in the process. most materials have very short lead time, but it's a longer lead stuff that we've been keeping ahead of us.
so at this point, i'm not going to raise the flag and say that we can't deliver what customers want. so our lead times again are -- they're not too far off to where they would normally be.
tom diffely -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. thank you.

your next question comes from charles shi with needham & company.
charles shi -- needham & company -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my question. this is charles shi on behalf of quinn bolton at needham.
so maybe i want to follow-up on the question around licenses. i think i understand that the licensing requirement came in two rounds around smic, probably the first around targeting. i mean that includes some of your products under restriction around the september timeframe, but the second round actually put all of your shipments to smic, i mean, at least the system side under the licensing requirement.
so this initial approval of licenses, is that approval for the first of few licenses, i mean, that you guys applied around the september timeframe last year or is that some of that actually come from that december applications?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
so, you're right, you explained the situation correctly. first, smic was put on the military end user list in september, and then the entity list in december. we applied for licenses in september, and then we applied for licenses again in december for the remainder of our products that weren't covered the first time around. but i guess the only thing i can say is they do not seem to be coming out based on chronological order. it's not exactly clear how they are in fact doing the review and what they're putting priority on versus other things.
so at this point in time, the answer is not as clean as i think maybe we would have all anticipated. and as i said, the licenses are not being issued in as timely a fashion as we would have hoped. but again, we are happy that some of them were issued, and we continue to drive to ensure that the rest of them are issued in a timely fashion.
charles shi -- needham & company -- analyst
thanks a lot, mary. may i follow-up on another question really around the cs&i, maybe this is a question for kevin. so kevin, i understand that fourth quarter last year and first quarter this year, cs&i is probably running -- i mean, probably ahead of your $550 million model target, which i think it's about a $40 million per quarter, actually closer to your $650 million model.
and the last quarter you did point out that one of the factors -- there are several factors driving the -- i mean, unusually higher cs&i revenue is about the advance purchases even through stockpiling by maybe a few of your chinese customers due to geopolitical tension. i understand that industry utilization is high, and also you pointed out with some of used tools strengths. but i wonder for your q1 cs&i, whether some of that is still driven by some of the inventory hoarding behaviour from some of your chinese customers due to geopolitical reasons?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so, charles, i would say that there's still some, what i would say is, pre-buying in q1 for sure. but i would also say that we did see a strength come in from almost all of our different regions that was applied far too. so q4 was certainly china-centric, and a lot of pre-buying, we did see strength in q1 in korea. we saw it throughout europe, and we saw it actually in the u.s. picking back up.
so some of those areas i would not think are -- they're certainly not pre-buying because they're worrying about trades, right. now, whether they're pre-buying a little bit because they have a huge ramp coming at them in utilization side, that could be going on. but i think this is probably normal, right. and then you ramp the level we're seeing at this point was i'd say, korea, europe and u.s.
so, china, yes, i think there's still a little pre-buying going on for obvious reasons. and it's probably not just mit. i think everybody may be a little bit nervous over there. but it's definitely i think it's going to sell back off, right? so we'll drop into that $40 million range in q2 and then $42 million to backend, where we want to be. it'd be nice to be surprised that it's higher. so at this point, i think charles, we think it's kind of settled down.
charles shi -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. thanks, kevin. so maybe my next question is around the evaluation tools. i think one of the tools, dragon tools you're faced with for one dram application, i know you shipped that tool probably around june timeframe last year and the evaluation cycle, typically about the year. i'm not asking why you haven't closed it yet. but are you sort of expecting some point in q2 it's going to get closed? because one of the reason is we sort of expect that dram will become stronger in second half, especially one of your top dram customer recently announced that they are pulling the capex into 2021, and likely, majority of that will be dram. so i wonder whether the eval closure can be ahead of the volume ramp, and whether that will drive further upside for the second-half on memory revenue.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
so charles, you're right. we shipped mid last year, which would mean it should close mid this year. so it's not quite mid this year yet. so that remains to be seen. and we will report on it as soon as it's close.
it's moving along per plan. sometimes evaluations actually don't close exactly 12 months to the exact date. and the reason for that typically is as we work with customers during these evaluation periods, we also work to qualify as many recipes as possible. and sometimes we get opportunities to actually work on recipes that weren't originally planned for these evaluations, which then takes more time.
so i'm not necessarily commenting specifically on this evaluation. but i just wanted to make it clear that if it doesn't close exactly as to 12 months more, there are many reasons for that, and the evaluation will go on to be successful.
in terms of the timing, this is actually the second dragon that we have at this customer. the customer already has qualified the dragon for nand applications. so we feel very good about -- we feel very good about our position with this customer given that this is the second dragon and believe that as the cycle picks up, this customer will in fact purchase additional dragons as they have capacity needs for high current. so at this point, we are not worried about missing any upswings in the market.
charles shi -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you, mary. thanks, guys. congrats on the results and best of luck. thanks.

your next question comes from the line of dave duley with steelhead.
dave duley -- steelhead -- analyst
yes, thanks for taking my question. i'm wondering if you hit the $550 million revenue target this calendar year, what would you say that that translates into market share in 2021 for the implant market?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
david, it's hard to tell actually, this year. as you know, the market share denominator for the tam for an implant isn't really reported very accurately. and so we're not trying to make a guess as to what exactly that tam will be. we know we're increasing market share. we're having great success with purion, especially with the purion extensions, and especially in the segmented markets where we would consider that we have very high share. but it's difficult at this point to gauge the exact share. we do believe that the tam is increasing right now, as we've said the last couple of years, and it's above a $1 billion at this point. exactly how far above, it's kind of hard to estimate.
dave duley -- steelhead -- analyst
okay. what are the key things that you need to accomplish to get to the $650 million market? i think in the past, it's been wins in japan and wins in high-end foundry logic. is that still kind of the targeted areas or do you think you can get there by just having some of your other segments grow faster than initially expected?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
so i think we feel very good that we planted the seeds that we need already to get to $650 million. i mean, if in fact, we hit a run rate next year, that means that putting additional evaluations in the field at this point really isn't going to drive any significant volume above that in 2022 and perhaps even into 2023.
japan and advanced logic are obviously important segments, and we've made some progress in japan. dave, you know we shipped our first purion xe there last year to the power device market. that power device market is very strong in japan as is image sensors and nand. so we're continuing to drive after that. and, in advanced logic, i've already mentioned that we have a purion h evaluation out there to customer where we think that can turn into some significant revenue. the timing on that is, we've got to complete the evaluation and sort of go from there.
so, japan and advanced logic are important segments, but they're not going to be the major segments that are driving $650 million at this point in time, given the timing and giving what we've seeded the market with. it really is going to be at the customers where we already are, where we're processed tool of record. and the customers know the tools, like the tools are running the tools in production. so a lot of it will have to do -- china, again, will still remain a very strong market for us. it's growing our purion footprint and our existing customer base again, where we already have an install base, and perhaps continue, for example, to expand the number and types of applications we're in. that's something that can be done more readily and will bring a whole new tool and for example, for evaluation.
so those are all the things that we're already doing that will contribute to the $650 million, which is why we think we have a pretty good line of sight into $650 million. and feel confident that, as i said, those seeds have already been planted.
dave duley -- steelhead -- analyst
and two other questions. kevin what is the impact on the p&l, either on operating expenses or cogs from the increase in capacity that you referred to? and then also, as far as the competitive environment, mary, what are you seeing your core competitor in the implant market doing now with you continuing to gobble market share?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, so dave on the manufacturing capacity, at this point, we're in the early stages of setting this up. and as the year goes on, i think we'll provide some additional details about what it is we're doing and any potential impact. i guess the only thing i would say is that the long-term impact should be positive. i think we're moving to, there's opportunities to improve gross margins on this. as you point out, there is always near-term things set up and framing and things. but i think positive takeaway is that longer-term this should be something that helps the company's gross margin point of view, which helps the overall p&l.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
okay. and from a competitive standpoint, competition remains quite strong. we're facing our largest competitor, really at every account we go to. although, i will say in terms of some of the specific segments, in mature process technology, for example, like image sensor, in power devices, where we have a leadership position, it makes it more difficult for them to participate, given the strength of the purion product offerings that we have in those areas. but other than that, it's just obviously there's always pricing pressures, there's the bundle that they try to throw at the customers. there is some of the typical things that our competitor likes to do. but in general, we've -- because we are processed tool of record in most of the places right now where there is some significant spending. well, and again, i'm just going to clarify that again. probably not in japan and probably not in advanced logic, but in all those other areas where we have strong conditioning, we've been able to really ward them off.
dave duley -- steelhead -- analyst

your next question comes out of mark miller with benchmark.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
congratulations on your quarter and thank you for the question. there are at least four major fabs. three planning in the u.s. coming up starting next year. i'm just wondering in terms of your projection for the $650 million run rate, are these primary components of the $650 million, or these are coming from more existing fabs?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
no, we're all excited about the new fabs that are going to be constructed in the u.s. it's great for the u.s. it's great for the jobs, great for the industry. but right now, those are not accounted for in any of our $650 million model revenues. as i said, previously, we've already got the seeds planted for the $650 million model. so as we evaluate those opportunities that would be something that would figure into the model that we are working on right now that goes beyond $650 million with an implant-only focus.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
do you see these fabs contributing to orders next year for you?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
again, i don't have a full handle on the timing for all of these things. so i really -- next year we're continuing to work on our $650 million model. and if there are orders from some of those fabs in there, then that would be upside to what we currently have planned. but as i said, we are working on ensuring that we have the right resources in place, the right infrastructure in place, and we're doing all the right things right now to make sure that we can capitalize on those opportunities.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
okay. my last question is the -- your tax rates been kind of jumping around the last two quarters. what should we be thinking about for tax rate for the remainder of the year?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i'm going to give a standard line. mark, i think i always do my model using the standard corporate tax. so you're absolutely right, it has been moving around. this quarter was lower. some of that came through stock sales, but i would just use a standard corporate rate. or if you wanted to lower it a couple of points, if you want to go down to 18%, 19%, we would probably won't be too far away, because we do have r&d tax credits and stuff we continue to bring back through. so -- but it is all over the place, that's for sure.

yes. thanks for taking the follow-up questions. and kevin, i didn't mean to ignore you in the initial round. so i'm coming back with you. so the first question you mentioned that opex in the second quarter would be flat as a percent of sales, but on higher sales that's higher dollar. so is that performance based increases bonus accruals, is it sales commissions, or are there just projects that are queuing up in r&d that would drive the sequential increase or other things?

the answer is yes. you got it. it's across the board. it is the variable compensation pieces. it is the r&d pieces. and they'll help you out with full year models. $38 million is probably a good number for the years. and if you look at where our $550 million model is, it's 25% approximately of revenue instead of maybe the revenues a little bit better than that. i think $38 million certainly not a bad place to be using for the remainder of the year.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
great. and then the follow-up -- great to see the $12 million ensured buyback in the quarter. the question is with the license granted for customer shipments into china. obviously, there's some pressure to keep the right amount of inventory on hand, but what are some of the gives and takes with respect to persecuting the share buyback in the second quarter?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so we're buying two 10d51 plant, craig. so i don't -- that grid is in place, and we're going to execute that. so the things that we've talked about for whether it be inventory or adding capacity, i mean, that's not going to impact what we're doing with share repurchase program. we have very strong balance sheet. as you know, we have plenty of cash to execute both the investments needed in the business and grow the business and return capital back to shareholders, please.
it's something we really want to do this year when we put this program in place. i think we put a very sizable program in place, especially for axcelis. so we're very committed to continuing that. and again, we have a grid that we're executing too.
craig ellis -- b. riley securities -- analyst
nice to hear. thanks so much, kevin.
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, take care.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of christian schwab with craig-hallum.
tyler burmeister -- craig-hallum -- analyst
hey, this is tyler on for christian. thanks for letting me ask a question. so i was just wondering maybe a little bit bigger picture, you guys said your mix of mature foundry memory is expected to be 70:30 this year, and you have eval tools for both out in the field. so next year and in the future, as we move toward a $650 million model, should we expect both those segments to continue to grow? and maybe a mix, they kind of similar to these levels or, over time, would you expect that mix maybe to move back closer to 50:50 mix? any color there would be great.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
tyler, the mix is really going to be a function of which customers in which segments are spending. but as we said, we think that this is a multi-year cycle. we expect the mature process technology customers to continue to spend. we expect memory to recover, increase throughout the year, and we may see more memory spending as a percentage of our total revenues, based on, again, spending a specific customer.
so it's possible that it could shift a bit more toward back toward memory. but we expect really mature process to continue to be strong. i mean, if we take a look at where we were, last year, the mix was pretty similar. we had 29% memory last year, and this year, we're saying maybe around 30%. so, it could be the same but i think we just have to wait it out and see exactly what happens as we move into 2022.
tyler burmeister -- craig-hallum -- analyst
all right. that's great. all my other questions were answered. thanks, guys.

operator
good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the axcelis technologies call to discuss the company's results for the first quarter 2021. my name is chelsea and i'll be your coordinator for today. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.
i would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, mary puma, president and ceo of axcelis technologies. please proceed ma'am.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, chelsea. with me today is kevin brewer, executive vice president and cfo; and doug lawson, executive vice president of corporate marketing and strategy. we are all participating in this call remotely, so i would like to apologize in advance for any technical difficulties.
if you've not seen a copy of our press release issued last night, it is available on our website. playback service will also be available on our website, as described in our press release.
please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the sec's safe harbor provision. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business. these risks are described in detail in our form 10-k annual report and other sec filings, which we urge you to review. our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. we do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
good morning and thank you for joining us. axcelis posted another strong quarter as a result of overall strength in the semiconductor market, combined with the growing momentum of the purion product line. revenue for the first quarter was $132.8 million with earnings per share of $0.48, driven by strong gross margins of 42.5%.
our aftermarket business, or what we refer to as cs&i, once again contributed significantly to our revenue and gross margin. cs&i revenue in q1 was $51.8 million. this strong performance was a result of high fab utilization, the growing purion install base and significant upgrades in used tools sales.
we couldn't have achieved these results without the strong support of our employees. they have continued to manage well through the many complexities brought on by china trade tensions and the continuing pandemic. i'd like to thank them for their dedication through these difficult and challenging times.
in the first quarter, the growing mature process technology market continued to be an area of strength for axcelis with 82% of q1 shipments going to mature foundry logic customers. the other 18% of shipments went to nand memory customers. even with the expected increase in memory revenues later in the year, we believe the mature process technology segment will account for greater than 70% of system revenue for the full year 2021.
during the fourth quarter of 2020, the u.s. government placed chinese foundry customer, smic, on the entity list, meaning that export licenses are required for all axcelis u.s. shipments to smic. we applied immediately for these licenses, but have found the approval process to be slower than anticipated. since no licenses were issued in the first quarter, we were not able to ship any systems or parts to smic. early in q2, we were granted our first export licenses and began shipping approved systems and parts to smic. our guidance reflects our expectations relative to this process.
as a result, the geographic mix of our systems shipments in the first quarter was: korea, 44%; china, 39%; and europe, 17%. although the percentage of china shipments was down from last quarter, we have a strong domestic and multinational customer base in that country across multiple market segments. business with domestic chinese customers in the mature process technology segment in particular remained quite strong.
for the second quarter, we expect revenue of between $135 million and $140 million, gross margins of approximately 41.5%, operating profit between $19 million and $21 million, and earnings per share of between $0.43 and $0.47.
hitting the midpoint of this q2 revenue guidance will signify reaching the quarterly run rate of our $550 million model. in fact, axcelis is on-track to exceed $550 million in revenue for the full year 2021, achieving this goal a year ahead of schedule.
given market trends and the strength of purion base products and new product extensions, we have come to believe two things. first, that it's possible that we can also reach our $650 million model sooner than expected, perhaps hitting a quarterly run rate before the end of 2022. and second, that there is an implant-driven revenue model beyond $650 million that axcelis can achieve. these developments are very exciting and point to a potential path forward for stronger than expected growth.
before turning the call over to kevin, i'd like to provide a short update on our products and key market segments. the power device and image sensor markets are very important to axcelis. as we have said before, we hold a leadership position in implants in both of these specialty markets.
in the second quarter, we shipped multiple purion vxes to image sensor customers as well as purion h200 silicon carbide, and purion m silicon carbide systems to silicon carbide power device customers. with the shipment of the first purion h200 silicon carbide tool, axcelis can now provide power device customers with a full suite of purion products to support all of their ion implant needs.
evaluations are key to developing new customers, increasing footprint at existing customers, and penetrating the segments. we currently have six purion evaluation tools in the field, focused on supporting future growth.
during the first quarter, we closed the evaluation of the purion vxe and shipped the purion xemax evaluation to a second customer for use in advanced image sensor development.
the six evaluation systems, which include a purion dragon, a purion h200, two purion h's and to purion xemax's are positioned across key target segments including advanced logic, nand, dram, image sensor and power devices. we expect these systems to contribute to our future growth. kevin?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mary, and good morning. axcelis delivered strong first quarter financial performance. thanks to the continuing outstanding work of all of our employees and supply chain partners.
during this ongoing pandemic, the health and well-being of our employees remains a top priority. we are doing our best to create a safe work environment for everyone at axcelis. pandemic-related protocols that were implemented during in 2020 remain in place. our pandemic response team is closely monitoring the situation and continues to update these actions as required.
we are excited about the accelerating growth that we believe can take us beyond $650 million in revenue. we currently have sufficient manufacturing capacity in place to achieve this run rate. since we are seeing growth more quickly than anticipated, we have decided to bring on additional manufacturing capacity. our operations team is focused on adding manufacturing capacity closer to some of our largest customers for the goal of increasing customer satisfaction.
turning to the first quarter financial results. q1 revenue finished at $132.8 million compared to $122.2 million in q4. q1 system sales were $81 million compared to $64.2 million in q4. q1 cs&i revenue finished at $51.8 million compared to $58 million in q4. cs&i revenue was driven by strong upgrades in used tool sales. we expect q2 cs&i revenue of approximately $40 million and recommend modeling the second half of $42 million per quarter.
q1 sales of our top 10 customers accounted for 79.8% of our total sales compared to 81.5% in q4. one customer was above the 10% in q1 compared to three in q4. q1 system bookings were $148.4 million compared to $131.5 million in q4, with q1 book-to-bill ratio of 1.92 versus 1.98 in q4.
backlog in q1, including deferred revenue, finished at $186.5 million, a new record for axcelis compared to $115.2 million in q4. q1 combined sg&a and r&d spending was $36.1 million or 27.2% of revenue compared to $38.9 million or 31.8% in q4. sg&a in the quarter was $20.4 million with r&d at $15.7 million. we expect q2 spending to be similar to q1 at approximately 27% of revenue. q1 gross margin was 42.5% and above our guidance, driven by strength in cs&i, product mix and continued cross-sell activity. we are guiding q2 gross margin of approximately 41.5%.
gross margin will continue to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on product and customer mix, the memory evaluation tool's quality, and level of revenue contribution from our cs&i business. we are continuing to experience some higher cost from placing pandemic related protocol, which i expect will linger throughout the year.
operating profit in q1 finished at $20.3 million compared to $14.1 million in q4. we are guiding q2 operating profit of approximately $19 million to $21 million. q1 net income was $15.5 million or $0.48 per share compared to $14.7 million or $0.43 per share in q4. we are guiding q2 eps of approximately $0.43 to $0.47. this guidance reflects any known impact from the coronavirus and the expert license speculation.
q1 cash finished at $207.5 million compared to $204.3 million in q4. in the quarter, we generated $15.1 million of cash in operation and repurchased share worth $12.5 million. q1 receivables were $75.9 million compared to $86.9 million in q4. q1 inventory ended at $174.4 million compared to $161.1 million in q4. in the quarter finished goods inventory increased due to the export license situation.
q1 inventory trends, excluding evaluation tools, finished at 2.0, the same as q4. q1 accounts payable was $40.5 million compared to $24 million in q4. i am excited about the ongoing strength of the industry and customer demand for axcelis product. we have a strong balance sheet, which is enabling the right level business investment while returning capital to our shareholders through the share repurchase program. additional manufacturing capacity is targeted at improving customer satisfaction and supporting our group results.
i hope that all of you and your family are staying healthy during the pandemic. hopefully as more people become vaccinated, we can finally get back to normal time.
thank you. and i'll now turn the call back to mary for her closing comments.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, kevin. we are encouraged and excited by our future as we move into a post-covid environment. the strong multi-year trends of the industry cycle and growth in the adoption of new technology that uses ever increasing chip content bode wells for customer investment and capacity.
the incentive plan to address challenging and emerging customer manufacturing requirements will likely expand the implant tam and accelerate the adoption of our differentiated purion products and services across all segments.
axcelis has the financial means to invest in r&d, global support infrastructure, and capacity to capitalize on all of these opportunities. the ingredients for continuing success are in place and will drive our leadership in ion implantation.
with that, i would like to open it up for questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of patrick ho from stifel.
j. ho -- stifel, nicolaus & company, inc. -- analyst
thanks very much. congratulations on a really nice quarter and outlook. maybe first off, kevin, in terms of the supply chain and given your results and the strong outlook, obviously, it looks like you manage them very well and it looks like it's not having an impact on you guys. can you just qualitatively [indecipherable] inventory -- that's coming over the next few quarters? what are some of the steps you've taken to kind of mitigate the situation given that the higher ecosystem is with challenges today?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. thank you, patrick. it's a good question because certainly, there is a lot of pressure out there, and we're seeing it certainly in a lot of peer earnings. but we've been dealing with supply chain disruption really since the start of the pandemic. what was pandemic related moved more to just a steep ramp. many of those problems are still out there, and we're seeing it as well as others. but i think probably what helped us certainly early on, we tried to stay ahead of it. we took a hard look at our supply chain. we started moving some of the commodity level things. so we put additional material, some new suppliers.
we really -- mrp aggressively and opened up the lead time offsets to drive more material ahead of schedule. and the other area that we focused on with engineering was making sure we kept ahead of any potential obsolescence that may be coming and took a look at long lead item. so i'm not going to tell you it's easy, but we've been managing it. we took people out of manufacturing from the manufacturing engineering ranks and put them looking at suppliers and working with suppliers. so it's a continuing challenge, logistics, freight. all this stuff is adding cost. but our gross margins, we're still on track to our margin improvement plans that we have, and we're capturing some of that through the volume.
so i think that, patrick, it's probably what we do with the mrp and moving some of that material early on that's helped us. and so far, we've been able to keep ahead of it with meeting demand.
j. ho -- stifel, nicolaus & company, inc. -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and maybe as my follow-up questionthe gross margin. you've done a really good job there from -- always has a lot of leading pieces -- some of the evaluation that [indecipherable]. typically, they tend to have lower margins, but you are still on progressing long-term gross margin model of over 42% and even close to 43% -- get to $650 million on your revenue. what are some of the steps there to, i guess, mitigate evaluate some units -- your gross margins -- seen that longer target model range?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. well, the obvious one is we're continuing to focus on the cost-out activity. we've got numerous value engineering programs ongoing. the other thing, patrick, is going to help to a lot of these evals replacing around our product extensions and those are higher gross margin tools. so as we flip some of these evaluation tools and start getting into some follow-on business, that will also help. so it's really going to be continue to hammer away at cost out and get these extensions into the field. those are things we're focused on. and obviously, taking advantage of the volume right now. as i mentioned, there are some other things pressuring as well. but the net of it all is we're still continuing in a positive direction. so we're just going to keep focusing on those things that i mentioned.
j. ho -- stifel, nicolaus & company, inc. -- analyst
great. thank you very much and congrats.
operator
your next question comes from the line of craig ellis from b. riley securities.
craig andrew ellis -- b. riley securities, inc. -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking my question. i'll echo the congratulations on the very robust execution, especially on the fulfillment side in the current environment. mary, i wanted to go back and follow up on the comments that you made about booking business into the second quarter of 2022 and to see if you can help us with some color on what you're seeing as things look out that far relative to maybe the mix of business, mature foundry versus memory. does it look similar to where we are now? or is it tilting one way or the other? and maybe secondly, just in the composition of what you're seeing, what are you seeing with respect to uptake on some of the new products and the product line extensions that have had very good momentum over the last 18 months?
mary g. puma -- chief executive officer, president and director
okay. so craig, right now, the demand is really strong across really all markets and geographies. and in terms of the segments, the mature process technology markets remain robust, and this is really driven by high fab utilization. if you go one level down, image sensors, general mature foundry business and the power devices are also strong. and in particular, we're seeing a lot of growth in the power device area driven by a recovery in automotive. and so when you combine what i mentioned before about the long-term commitment to electrification of the automotive market and you combine that with the success that we're seeing from the axcelis purion power series in this market, this is really one of the things that created a sustainable growth opportunity for axcelis.
so again, this is not just 2021, but this is moving into 2022 and beyond. in terms of the split, we said this, i think, on the last call. we expect mature process technology segment is going to account for over 70% of our systems revenue in 2021 just because of the strength that we're seeing there. but let's turn to memory. so we've been talking about how memory is recovering and we expect steady business in 2021. we are seeing initial capacity by coming into our slot plan at the end of this year and early next year. so we are seeing a pickup in memory. and we've always said that our memory business is additive to the strong mature process technology business. and that's really what's driving us to say that we are going to exceed $625 million in revenues this year.
the customer interest remains strong. we've got a lot of demo activity. we've got six valuation units out in the field. we believe we have the right products, the right market positioning. and as we've talked about our execution at this point in time is really quite -- so this is really what's going to lead to future growth even beyond our $650 million business model. i'll turn it over to doug in a second. but as i said, the second part of the question the product line extensions and how are the products doing. well, the products are doing extremely well. and i did mention that we have six evaluation units in the field right now. we've got two in memory, three in mature process technology and one in advanced logic.
and we're looking to all of those evaluations to drive future growth. four of them are in high current, which is the largest segment out of the implant product type, and that's where we're really focused in terms of driving additional growth. and two of them are in high energy, and our high energy business remains very strong. and we have a leadership position there, and we're putting these product line extensions out into the field. so for example, out of those six evaluation units to our purion xemax leading image sensor manufacturers, one of them is a purion h200 that's leading power device manufacturer. and the other that i'll mention is the purion h at an advanced logic customer. and we truly believe that this is the opportunity that we've been looking for to penetrate this segment and really get a foothold and some growth in this very important market. so doug, i don't know if you want to add anything to in terms of some of the details on the products themselves?
douglas a. lawson -- executive vice president of corporate marketing and strategy
i think you covered most of it. i think, craig, the silicon carbide tools, both purion h200 and the purion xe in that market are doing very well. and the purion h200 especially appears to be a very popular option for customers in the power market. so we're looking forward to good growth in that product line.
craig andrew ellis -- b. riley securities, inc. -- analyst
that's really helpful. so the follow-up question relates to the remarks around the point on moving capacity closer to customers and with the facility getting ready to ramp up in south korea. so the question is this. when that facility is opened and operational, what's the revenue capacity of the firm in the near-term, next one to two years? and as we look at some of the longer-term trends which, mary, you identified the multi-decade dynamics in auto-related ev and adas and the very robust position that axcelis has there, will existing capacity plus south korea give you the three- to five-year headroom that you need? or will there be other capacity that you'll need to bring online we look at getting from here to at least kind of the first step forward with some of the secular auto dynamics by 2025, 2026?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. craig, this is kevin. let me grab the first part. so from a capacity point of view, what i'll tell you is that the models we're looking at beyond 650 right now that we're going to publish at the end of the year. we'll have plenty of capacities between our beverly site and the new facility in south korea to cover those models. longer term, if we need to do additional expansion, we can take a look at what we're doing in south korea and add capacity there. but i think we did a lot of work over the last couple of years with our existing infrastructure through kaizen events. we invested in capital equipment and we freed up space. so i think between all the things we've done in south korea, there won't be capacity issues from a pure build point of view moving forward.
mary g. puma -- chief executive officer, president and director
can i just add one thing to that? so craig, you didn't specifically ask this, but i did want to just add that we have spoken -- we know we have a very strong position with customers in korea. and i've been in personal contact with -- in fact, i have the pleasure of telling one of our largest customers in person about the fact that we're adding this capacity in south korea and they're all extremely pleased. so the good news is we'll have the capability to be able to meet those needs. and again, i think it's a plus not only in terms of the capacity, but i think it's a plus in terms of our positioning in south korea as well as in the asian market.
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. just one other quick follow-up. i should have mentioned too, craig. the plan for south korea is that we'll be able to ship to any of our customers from that facility as well. so it's not going to be set up just for one or two particular customers. the plan is that whatever we're building there has the capability to ship to any of our customers.
craig andrew ellis -- b. riley securities, inc. -- analyst
okay. very helpful. so you could meet some of that very strong china market demand from south korea after it opens?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. yes.
craig andrew ellis -- b. riley securities, inc. -- analyst
okay. very helpful color. thanks, i'll get back to you.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from tom diffely from d.a. davidson.
thomas robert diffely -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
yes, good morning. thanks for the question. mary, i could hear a little bit more about the emerging memory recovery and how you think it rolls out over the next year or two in terms of both nand, dram and maybe the timing?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. well, i think as i just said, we're starting to see this pick up now come at the end of the year. we expect it to build into 2022. our business right now, as i just mentioned, for example, in q2 was evenly split between nand and dram. and honestly, we've said this a number of times, in terms of our preference, it doesn't really matter what specific type of device capacity the memory customers lay in because there's a little bit more high energy in the nand, there's a little bit more high current in the dram and we have exposure in our process tool of record to both of those types of devices. we're just waiting to see really how it lays out. again, doug, i don't know if you any additional color you want to add on with your thoughts?
douglas a. lawson -- executive vice president of corporate marketing and strategy
yes. so tom, for implants, we're very much capacity dependent in terms of growth. so as they add wafer starts, they need to add implant. and as you can see from the various memory company earnings calls this quarter, demand continues to be very strong and supply is tightening. the last year, they did a lot of technology increases to increase their output either additional layers or shrinks in terms of dram. and now they're at a point where they're beginning to fill the shelves that they put in place. and so we expect that as we go into the end of this year and throughout next year to be a pretty good cycle in terms of memory capacity wafer start adds.
thomas robert diffely -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
thanks. that's quite helpful. and then so you talked about your business, your systems business being 70% mature this year. what is your long-term view of the mix between mature and memory? it seems like it's been skewing more toward mature over the last year or two, but has your long-term view changed?
mary g. puma -- chief executive officer, president and director
i don't think our long-term view has changed. i mean -- go ahead, doug. doug, did you want to say something?
douglas a. lawson -- executive vice president of corporate marketing and strategy
no, i was going to say the same thing that back in the days when it was 50-50 or even 70-30 in favor of memory are probably behind us given the strength in sort of the diverse and large customer base that we've developed. so as the power market continues to grow in the image sensor market, as we establish a foothold in japan and in advanced logic, then memory will continue to be strong as it cycles in terms of capacity adds. but i think we would expect to continue to see a stronger mix from the other technologies over time.
thomas robert diffely -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
all right. great. and then finally, when you look at the eval tools and four of them potentially closing up later this year, i was going to ask you about the hit rate of follow-on orders because it sounds like mary mentioned earlier that she expects business from all four. so i guess curious at this point. what is the typical timing of closing of an eval tool to maybe some volume production tools?
mary g. puma -- chief executive officer, president and director
well, it can vary. i mean we've talked about how evals typically run one year, some run a little bit larger. some run a little bit shorter. but in general, it's about a year where we become process to of record and then get repeat orders. now there are systems where we are able to get repeat orders even prior to closing the valuation. what's happened is we work very closely with the customer. the results have been very good, and the customer has requirements to add capacity. and so we have gotten repeat orders again in less than 12 months. so it really varies by customer, but i think in general, 12 months is a good benchmark.
thomas robert diffely -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
okay. great. thank you for the time today.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of quinn bolton from needham & company.
nathaniel quinn bolton -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
hello all. i offer my congratulations on the nice results and outlook. wanted to start just with the eval tools to make sure i've got the numbers right. mary, i think you said you will complete four evals or expect to close four evals before the end of the year with one in the third quarter, so likely three then in the fourth quarter. is that correct?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no. quinn, this is kevin. so we have one in the third quarter, that is in our guidance. and then we expect to see four additional tools before the end of the year.
nathaniel quinn bolton -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
so that's in addition to the one in the third quarter, so it's four then in q4?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
nathaniel quinn bolton -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
got it. okay. and then, kevin, the guidance for the full year on gross margin of just over 42% sort of implies a step down in margin in the december quarter. i assume a lot of that reflects those four eval tools you recognize. but i'm wondering whether the south korea facility carries any start-up costs or absorption issues as it begins to ramp capacity in late this year?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so initially, there is some drag from that, quinn, for those exact reason you brought up, the absorption issue. and we're hiring people right now, we're training people, the expectation is that once we're fully operational sometime next year, that this becomes a margin accretive type of thing versus a slight drag this year. but yes, so there is a little bit of margin pressure coming from that. and then as you mentioned, the additional evals closing out as well. but i think that the key point on our margins are we've had road maps in place. we're following those road maps. some of them are timing-based. so i mean we're way ahead of our models right now in terms of where we thought it would be on revenue.
and the gross margin is coming along, and it should continue to move up as we execute on these cost-out initiatives we have, get the factory fully operational over there, flips some of these evaluation tools, which are product extensions and high margin into follow-on orders that mary was just talking about. and i think those are really the levers that are going to continue to give us margin growth. and the timing is, again, will be based on quickness that we can get some of this work done.
nathaniel quinn bolton -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
kevin, i wanted to ask a longer-term question. mary, you had mentioned that you think the ion implant tam now is much larger than perhaps it had been. i think for a fairly long time, you've described the tam of ion implant of about $1 billion. wondering if you have an updated tam you might give us. and i know you're going to give us new long-term models, but i think your 550 and 650 model sort of assumed up to 45% share of the old tam. wondering if you might update sort of your market share thoughts given that the tam is now much larger.
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'm going to grab that, doug, unless you want to -- why don't you take it?
douglas a. lawson -- executive vice president of corporate marketing and strategy
yes. so the tam, let's start with the first question on the tam. as we've said numerous times, it's difficult to actually quantify that because there's not a lot of actual recording. we had been for the last several years been saying that the tam has been about a billion and is growing a 10% to 15%. so, this point, if you look at some of the recent analyst numbers, it's now looking like it's probably up into 1.5 billion range and so, we're right now trying to quantify that and get our estimate. in terms of share, again, it becomes a very difficult thing for us to calculate given that the denominator is a moving target. so what we do know is that we have very high share and technology leadership, mindshare leadership and market leadership especially in the targeted segments like the power device and image sensor markets. and we continue to do extremely well with the focused products that we've developed for the purion extensions. so we'll update the model and, at that point, make some decisions on how much additional color we do around any tam calculation or share.
nathaniel quinn bolton -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
great. and then last question just on the china business, i know you received licenses to ship to one of the chinese foundries. wondering if you could comment -- was the china revenue concentrated this quarter as a result to receive those licenses? or was it a fairly diversified revenue stream?
mary g. puma -- chief executive officer, president and director
it was a mix. there was a concentration to one particular customer just based on the timing of some of the export licenses that we received. but china is made up of a large and diverse group of both the domestic and multinational customers and the particular customer that you're referring to and that i mentioned is only one of many, many customers that we have in china. so there was a little bit of that, but i would say, in general, it was much more of a mix across a large number of customers.
nathaniel quinn bolton -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
okay. thanks for the color.
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
quinn, it's kevin again. i want to go back to the evals. so it's one in q3, it's a total of four more for the remainder of the year. so it's one in q3, three in q4, which i think is what mary had said earlier. so i apologize for that. i think i confused the issue. so just four more we expect, one in q3 and three remaining ones in q4. for closing...

good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the axcelis technologies call to discuss the company's results for the second quarter 2021. my name is mary, and i will be your coordinator for today. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, mary puma, president and ceo of axcelis technologies. please proceed, ma'am.
mary g. puma -- chief executive officer, president and director
thank you, mary. with me today is kevin brewer, executive president and cfo; and doug lawson, executive vice president of corporate marketing and strategy. we are all participating in this call remotely, so i would like to apologize in advance for any technical difficulties. if you have not seen copy of our press release issued last night, it is available on our website. playback service will also be available on our website as described in our press release. please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the sec safe harbor provision. these forward-looking these statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business.
these risks are described in detail in our form 10-k annual report and other sec filings, which we urge you to review. our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. we do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. good morning, and thank you for joining us has posted another strong quarter. this resulted from overall strength in the semiconductor industry as well as growing momentum in the purion product line, notably from the purion power series. revenue for the second quarter was $147.3 million with earnings per share of $0.55, driven by strong gross margin of 43.5%. quarterly system sales surpassed $100 million for the first time since 2004. cs&i, our aftermarket business, continued to provide significant contribution to our top line and gross margin with a venue of $47.1 million. in the second quarter, 70% of shipments went to mature foundry/logic customers and 30% to memory customers with an even split between dram and nand. we believe the mature process technology segment will account for greater than 70% of system revenue for the full year 2021. the geographic mix of our system shipments in the second quarter was china, 58%; korea, 18%; europe, 12%; taiwan, 3%; and the rest of the world, 9%. turning to third quarter guidance.
we expect revenue of approximately $170 million, gross margins of approximately 42.5%, operating profit of approximately $32 million and earnings per share of approximately $0.70. we now expect q4 revenue to be above q3 guidance, allowing us to exceed $625 million in revenue for the full year 2021. this is driven by the rapid growth of the mature process technology segment and the early stages of the memory capacity build. we expect both markets to remain strong well into 2022, and we are currently booking systems into q2 of next year. overall demand for capital equipment in the conductor industry is being driven by several factors, including supply chain shortages, high fab utilization across all segments causing significant new fab investment, government incentive programs creating geographic expansion opportunities for our customers and the fundamental underlying drivers that started this growth cycle of 5g, data analytics and ai.
as a result, we believe that the implant tam has increased significantly. in addition, the rapid acceleration of the electrification of the automotive industry is driving substantial demand for power devices and image sensors. this is not related to the shortage of general-purpose mature devices like mpus for automotive. it is driven by the 10- to 15-year strategic road maps of all automotive manufacturers and their suppliers. these markets are generating sustainable growth with purion product extensions in high current, medium current and high energy designed to serve the power device and image sensor market. we have invested significantly in both of these markets over the last several years.
as a result, we expect power to make up approximately 30% of our systems revenue in 2021 with continued growth driven by the purion product extensions specifically developed for this market. our growth in -- area is clear and sustainable. and most importantly, it is tied to a long-term trend beyond any increases driven by supply chain shortages. looking at the memory market, we maintain a strong and growing position. we expect 2022 to be a good year for capacity additions in this segment and are already seeing bookings for shipments later this year and into next year. we continue to see a high degree of activity in both advance logic, where we have a purion evaluation underway and in the japanese market, especially related to power device manufacturing. the market in china continues to be one of our strongest.
this market includes a large number of both domestic and international customers in both the mature and memory market. we currently have licenses for all planned smi shipments in q3 and continue to receive licenses for future shipments. evaluations are key to developing new customers, increasing footprint at existing customers and penetrating new segments. we currently have six purion evaluation tools in the field focused on supporting future growth. these include one purion dragon, one purion h200, two purion hs and two purion xemax, which are positioned across key target segments, including advanced logic, nand, dram, image sensor and power devices. we expect four of these systems to close this year. we are also planning to ship one to two additional evaluations in 2021.
given that our current guidance is at the quarterly run rate for the $650 million revenue model, much sooner than previously anticipated, we are developing implant-driven revenue model beyond $650 million that we will publish by the end of this year. as we mentioned last quarter, we are also putting in place offshore manufacturing capacity to support this growth. kevin will provide additional details on this project as part of the financial review of the quarter. kevin?
kevin j. brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mary, and good morning. axcelis delivered solid q2 financial results driven by strong gross margin performance and continued revenue growth. based on our third quarter guidance and current review of the fourth quarter, we now expect to exceed $625 million in revenue for 2021. at the current run rate, we are seeing significant leverage in our business model and expect full year operating expenses to be around 24% of revenue. the gross margin is expected to finish slightly above 42%. ongoing gross margin improvement will continue to be driven by the timing of cost-out initiatives and mix assumptions that include a higher number of purion product line extensions. full year gross margin assumptions include higher pandemic and supply chain related costs and the impact of our investment in additional manufacturing capacity.
based on the strength of the market and demand for our purion, by developing new financial models that we plan to share later in the year, that should take us well beyond our current $650 million model. on our last call, i mentioned plans to add manufacturing capabilities closer to customers with a goal of increasing customer satisfaction and capacity. we're well underway with those plans and expect to have a new axcelis manufacturing facility in south korea by the end of this year. we currently have sufficient capacity in place to support our near-term demand and expect the korea factory to play an important role in supporting future manufacturing requirements. now turning to our second quarter financial results. q2 revenue finished at $147.3 million compared to $132.8 million in q1. q2 system sales were $100.1 million compared to $81 million in q1.
this is the first time since 2004 that we exceeded $100 million in quarterly system sales. q2 cs&i revenue finished at $47.1 million compared to $51.8 million in q1. cs&i revenue remains strong driven by high fab utilization, the growing purion installed base, system upgrades and customers purchasing safety stock. we expect q3 cs&i revenue of approximately $47 million. q2 sales to our top 10 customers account for 75.1% of our total sales compared to 79.8% in q1. two customers were at or above 10% in q2 compared to one in q1. q2 system bookings were $172.1 million compared to $148.4 million in q1 with a q2 book-to-bill ratio of 1.71 versus 1.92 in q1. we are currently working into the second quarter of next year. backlog in q2, including deferred revenue, finished at $271.2 million, a new record for axcelis compared to our prior record of $186.5 million in q1. q2 combined sg&a and r&d spending was $40 million or 27.2% of revenue compared to $36.1 million or 27.2% in q1. sg&a in the quarter was $23.4 million, with r&d of $16.6 million.
we expect q3 combined sg&a and r&d spending to be approximately $40 million or 23% of revenue, highlighting the significant leverage in our business model. q2 gross margin was 43.5% and well above guidance driven by strength in cs&i, increased purion power series shipments and continued cost-out activity. we're guiding q3 gross margin to be approximately 42.5% driven by product mix and the expected closure of one evaluation system. we expect full year gross margin will be slightly above 42%, including the closure of four additional evaluation tools. operating profit in q2 finished at $24 million compared to $20.3 million in q1. we're guiding q3 operating profit of approximately $32 million. q2 net income was $18.9 million or $0.55 per compared to $16.5 million or $0.48 per share in q1. regarding q3 earnings per share approximately $0.70. q2 cash finished at $220.5 million compared to $207.5 million in q1.
in the quarter, we generated $30.8 million cash from operations and settled share repurchases of $13.4 million. q2 receivables were $79.5 million compared to $75.9 million in q1. q2 inventory ended at $192.3 million compared to $174.4 million in q1. q2 inventory turns, excluding ship evaluation tools, finished at 20%, the same as in q1. q2 accounts payable were $40.7 million compared to $40.5 million in q1. i would like to thank our employees and suppliers for their continued efforts and outstanding execution, supporting our seed business ramp turn ongoing pandemic. it is an exciting time for axcelis with unprecedented growth in the industry and customer demand for our products. our balance sheet is strong, and we have the financial strength of investment products, infrastructure and our employees.
we've also returned over $50 million of capital to shareholders since the start of our share repurchase programs and have $75 million of remaining authorization under the current program at the end of q2. thank you. and i'll now turn the call back to mary for closing comments.
mary g. puma -- chief executive officer, president and director
thank you, kevin. axcelis is currently positioned for strong, sustainable growth. the strength of the industry is a positive for all semiconductor capital equipment suppliers. but axcelis is uniquely positioned to benefit significantly from the long-term electrification of the automotive market through the strength and base of our purion products, in particular, the purion power series implanter family and high energy products for image sensors, like the purion vxe and purion xemax. these implementers provide significant and enabling capability to our customers and result in better margin profiles for axcelis. we will continue to partner closely with our customers across all geographies in this growth segment.
axcelis has the financial means to invest in r&d, global support infrastructure and capacity to capitalize on all of the opportunities discussed in today's call. we are in the middle of one of the most exciting times in the history of the industry and are confident that we have in place the ingredients to maintain our leadership position in ion implant patients. with that, i'd like to open it up for questions.

[operator instructions]. our first question comes from patrick ho with stifel. your line is now open.
patrick ho -- stifel
thank you very market and congrats on a really nice quarter and outlook. mary, maybe [indecipherable] in terms of the business environment, you talked about memory picking up at least in q3 with between [indecipherable]. can you give a little bit of color in terms of the kind of customer mix. is it primarily, with one customer you're seeing or is it grow out of mix multiple customers?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
at this point, patrick, we're seeing that it's a broader mix with multiple customers. there is one customer in particular that has actually aggressively started placing orders but based on the quotations that we're doing in the bookings that we have, this is what gives us the confidence to say that it's broader and we'll start with dram and then expand into nand in the second half of the year. remember, we said we're actually already booking into the third quarter, so we've got pretty good visibility into the first half of the year.
patrick ho -- stifel
right. that's helpful. maybe as my follow-up question to kevin, congrats to you guys for managing the supply chain in a challenging environment and you gave a little bit of color on some of the variables that you'd be willing to i guess [indecipherable]. maybe specifically for q3, given that there were more issues that arose. one, how did you manage to [indecipherable] a lot more i guess compensate issues. and secondly, how are you reacting to kind of mitigate those situations in q4, is it still persistence coming off of q3?
kevin brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, that's a good question, pat. i mean, there is no doubt that the supply chains are very tight and really since the start of the pandemic, it was mostly driven by pandemic and closures of businesses and for us, then we got into a logistics issue and part of that because of the pandemic part of this, just because of, you know the volume is trying to move right now through the industry. but early on, i think we got very aggressive with looking at our lead time offsets in mlp with suppliers, putting a buffer inventory, moving from some of our bottleneck suppliers and getting some new capacity put online. so i think some of those early action certainly are helping now. now we're doing, what we've been doing since the start where we're trying to stay on top of it. i mean, the team is working hard as all companies are doing right now.
we're still adding new suppliers as we see problems arise, we're reacting and we're trying to be proactive as well. we continue to look at where there may be potential bottlenecks and trying to beat it off in the past if we can. so there is a lot of hard work and i think you've heard me say before, there is a lot of luck too. i mean, it's a big supply chain so all we're going to do is continue to do those things have been working for us. so far, as you point out, we've been able to manage through this and that's our intentions as the continue to move forward. so i feel comfortable with our q4 guidance that we have a good handle on what we need to do to execute this quarter from a supply chain point of view.
patrick ho -- stifel
great, thanks again, and congrats.
kevin brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from craig ellis with b riley. your line is now open.
craig a. ellis -- b riley -- director of research, senior semiconductor and capital equipment analyst
yeah, thanks for taking the questions and congratulations really on two fronts, not just the near-term operating execution, which is remarkable in such a tough environment, but in the vision that you had years ago to really diversify out the purion product line so you can be so well positioned for the secular drivers that you mentioned. and that's really where i want to start. mary, as we look at the mature foundry market on the power side and if we look at ev activity. we're currently low single-digit million units of production by mid-decade. we should be $10 million, maybe $30 million by the end of the decade. so there is a tremendous ramp coming. and the question is, where do you sense your diverse customers are in getting capacity in place for that ramp. how much of that are we seeing here right now in second half, strength in the business and how much would you expect to fill in as we go through 2022 with the visibility that you have in your order book?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
well, we've talked extensively about power devices and how those are actually being driven by the electrification of the automotive market. our customers right now who serve that market are adding pretty significant capacity, i would call it full speed ahead at this point in time. and again based on our discussions with them and we stay very close to them not only in terms of trying to understand what the forecast is, but also in terms of understanding what the trends are in the products because we've talked about how our purion power series is really a market leader and we want to make sure that we stay that, that it remains that way. so i would say that it's quite strong right now and we believe that is going to remain strong into the foreseeable future. this is not a trend that's short term, this is a trend that's longer term. and again, we expect to be right there with our customers enabling them to continue to manufacture these chips even if they evolve over time. so this is a long-term trend, craig, and we believe it's going to remain in place for many years to come.
craig a. ellis -- b riley -- director of research, senior semiconductor and capital equipment analyst
yeah, that's helpful. and then-- go ahead, doug.
douglas a lawson
yeah. i just wanted to add that we are planning to do a deep dive on that market, on the power market in the specialty markets at the investor day in december. so there'll be a lot more information.
craig a. ellis -- b riley -- director of research, senior semiconductor and capital equipment analyst
great. and then the second question was also in mature foundry and just flipping over and doug, you may refer me a bit to the december session. but i wanted to see if i could get some color on the, cs&i part of the mature foundry market. certainly we're seeing very strong ev and adas demand there. we're also seeing very strong smartphone demand, smartphones continue to have an increase in image sensors per phone and one of the things we've been looking for is the opportunity for axcelis to potentially gain further share in the japanese market and i'm hoping you can provide a little bit of color on whether you've got any increase in optics into tapping that market and growing into a large well-positioned potential customer there?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
so craig, doug can address any of the technical issues, but we're continuing to work with all of the image sensors manufacturers, particularly the large ones. obviously, the target that you're talking about is something that we are working very heavily, not only with our team in japan, but also really across the business. in japan right now, we actually have quite a bit of interest both in image sensors but also in the power market and that's something that we'll continue to focus very heavily on. we put a purion xe into the power device market last year and that's in production and we're using that as a reference site, which has generated a lot of interest. we actually just launched a japanese axcelis website and that should really help our japanese customers become more familiar with and comfortable with axcelis. so lots of ongoing activities and that's definitely something that will be a future event for us, a future win for us. let's put it that way.
douglas a lawson
yeah. and i think a couple of other things we are exhibiting at [indecipherable] japan this year with the booth. we expect quite a bit of activity and the key products relative to the image sensor market, there is the purion xe max, which we have two evaluation systems, in the field at a leading competitors of that customer you're referring to. so we think that that's the product that is going to drive really the next generation of image sensors.
craig a. ellis -- b riley -- director of research, senior semiconductor and capital equipment analyst
that's really helpful. and i'll flip it over to kevin for a question. kevin, interesting point on the prepayments that helped with cash, $50 million very, very strong performance. the question is, are prepayment something that we should expect to see more of in calendar '22 or were there just unique dynamics that took place in the calendar third quarter.
kevin brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, it is customer specific and i will tell you it's one particular geography with some of our smaller and what i would say newer customers. there is, in the po terms, there are prepays that are associated with that order so depending on where the mix is from quarter to quarter, craig, that could occur more or less. so it's... i did want to make mention much into this quarter because it was more significant and we had a pretty significant cash generation from operations. so i just wanted to flag that.
craig a. ellis -- b riley -- director of research, senior semiconductor and capital equipment analyst
yeah. helpful and congrats on that, cfo. i'll hop back in the queue. thanks very much, team.
kevin brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from christian schwab with craig-hallum capital. your line is now open.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- partner/senior research analyst
hey congratulations guys on this really excellent execution. kevin, did i hear you right that your backlog went from $272 million last quarter to $406 million this quarter?
kevin brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, you did. in last quarter was a new record and this, obviously, was a new record. yeah.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- partner/senior research analyst
okay. fantastic. so [indecipherable] they come on december 9th but can you guys kind of talk about, in particular the silicon carbide market where i think you have implant product where your competitor really does not and the industry is looking for material for wafer growth and i'm sure you're aware, there's not too many cars per wafer, right now and that may or may not change in the future especially if we go to 300. but can you, kind of quantify the opportunity for you guys in that marketplace alone?
douglas a lawson
well, i think, christian. as i said, we're going to have a deeper dive on this on the investor day more than we can do a quick q&a, but we expect this year power... both silicon and silicon carbide power combined will be 25% to 30% of our large systems revenue. so that's up from last year, which i don't have the charter front of me, but i think it was about 17% and so it is continuing to grow and automotive is probably the key driver. there is a lot of power switching that goes on in the car. a lot of silicon, in addition to silicon carbide. so, we're seeing a lot of activity across all geographies. there was a lot of activity in europe, really starting at the japanese market has always been pretty strong in power. recently, the us market has really started to go after it aggressively as seen by several customers earnings reports in the past week or two. and the chinese market is very, very active. so it's a worldwide phenomenon. there is big push worldwide on evs and so we expect it to continue to grow and we continue to develop the purion power series family.
christian schwab -- craig-hallum capital group llc -- partner/senior research analyst
okay. that's helpful. i don't have any other questions. again, congrats on the high visibility of the great execution. thanks.
douglas a lawson
thank you.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from tom diffely with d. a davidson. your line is now open.
tom diffely -- d.a. davidson -- wall street analyst
yes, good morning and thanks for the question. so first, kevin, i wonder if you could give us a summary or an update on just where we are, where you on the evaluation systems, what you expect to close by the end of this year, which looks like the impact margins a bit and which ones are going into 2022? it might be impactful there.
kevin brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so i think mary mentioned there is five evaluation systems currently out in the field and in q4, we expect to convert multiple e-commerce systems. so, we didn't put the exact number in there time, tom, but let's put it this way, it's three of more. so going forward, i expect we'll still have a few evals in the field in quarter one, but we are also continuing to put evaluation tools out. as a matter of fact, a fairly large portion of our current inventory number beyond having some buffer inventory for supply chain issues is evaluation systems is both shipped or work in process in the factories. so i don't expect the evaluation tools to drop off in any meaningful way in the near term, we're going to continue to put them out there. and as you know, the more evals we have out there, the more opportunity we have to convert to revenue in future growth. so the margin impact is always a bit of a disappointment, but it's a short-term disappointment because a lot of these new evals as well or the product extensions, which are, as we've talked about before. they have higher esp in the margins are certainly more accretive than some of the base products.
tom diffely -- d.a. davidson -- wall street analyst
okay. yeah, one of those high-class problems. okay. maybe shifting over to the memory market for you to mary or doug. a year ago at this time, we were looking into 2021 which was going to be a nice recovery year for memory, it didn't materialize, but it was worth by just the mature business being so strong. i'm curious, would you look out into '22, how this memory look different this year than it did a year ago?
douglas a lawson
well, i think, if you look at pricing trends and so forth, they are beginning to support growth in terms of additional capacity. the demand, if you look at any of the gartner or ic insights reports show a increase in overall demand for memory over this next coming five years. so we expect that there'll be capacity additions. as mary mentioned, in the script was we have begun to see some of that this year, we expect that to continue next year and so we expect it to be a better year than last year in terms of overall memory. but for our business, i think your comment in terms of the mature business to work this year, the mature businesses is very big for us and is more implant intensive actually than memory. so i would expect that next year, we'll continue to see percentage wise a stronger mix toward mature in memory even though memory will be growing.
tom diffely -- d.a. davidson -- wall street analyst
okay, that's helpful. thank you, doug. and then the final question i guess for kevin again, when you look at the backlog and ramping up here. the bookings, very strong, and this is going into the third quarter now of next year. are you capacity constrained in any sense, i mean it is a good in the third quarter because that's when the customers need the tools or is it kind of restrictions on how fast you can get these tools out the door?
kevin brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, i think we've done a very good job meeting what customers have required for ship dates so i would say, tom, that the majority of it really is meeting with the customers' requirements are. i mentioned, we do have the korea facility online now which extremely excited about this. if i look at the timing, how quickly you brought that up and running. so i feel quite remarkable what the team accomplished in. we just started manufacturing this week. as i mentioned, that will start shipping in q1. so that's going to certainly help out into the next year shipments, the near-term requirements. we've got covered with our current manufacturing in beverly right now. so there's really not any constraints there. i'll say it again, the team both manufacturing supply chain across the business people were pedal on about the bike hard right now, but we're keeping up with it. so yeah, i think maybe your question may become, i know throughout the year, we have heard from others in our peer group that they're pushing deliveries out or they couldn't take any more deliveries in 2021, things like that. we haven't, really made that an issue at this point, but i think, again we've kept up of what customers are needing for to meet their requirements.
tom diffely -- d.a. davidson -- wall street analyst
okay, that's helpful. thank you the three of you for your time today.
kevin brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, don.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from charles shi with needham and company. your line is now open.
charles shi -- needham & company -- vice president, equity research
hi, good morning. thank you for taking my question. i'm asking on behalf of quinn bolton here from needham and the company. so i wanted to start with a question. i think you guys mentioned mature foundry, logic and not only on a dollar basis, but on a percentage basis, next year is shaping up to be even stronger than this year. so i want to ask a question, given how strong bookings are and given good visibility, all the way through would like third quarter next year, how much of that demand you are seeing today is the underlying market demand or is there any like our share of those customers, the purchasing behavior from, just in time purchasing to like maybe just in case purchasing because the lead time so stretched out?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
i would say at this point, our sales team does a really good job trying to shake out exactly where people are just trying to get in line versus where the requirements are, and they do a lot of background work on that. for example, is the fab built, what's the status of the fab, the equipment going and so we believe that the bookings that we have right now, are bookings that will remain in place. obviously, there are going to be some movement, there always is in terms of fab readiness. but we're very comfortable with the fact that the customers who are actually placing orders are going to take that equipment, basically in the timeframe that they've indicated and we're building to that. so we watch it, we do internal reviews with the sales team and the manufacturing team. it's almost on a daily basis at a minimum, every week. there is a review, to take a look at inventory levels and things, changes in the forecast. so we manage it extremely closely. so if any of those things do happen, we're on top of it. and at this point in time, again we feel, it's pretty certain and so we don't think that there is a lot of speculative buying out there at this point.
charles shi -- needham & company -- vice president, equity research
thanks, mary. so maybe the next question i want to ask us more specifically about power devices, the demand you're seeing. obviously, there are probably at least three major type up power devices silicon bcd, igbt, carbide with various in i think tends to, i would say they are high, but there may be some difference there. so based on pointed to orders, are you kind of seeing a shift in terms of the mix between these three types of power devices from '21 to '22. is there more biased with silicon carbide, igbt more sophisticated, power device types? thank you.
douglas a lawson
it's a split, charles. we're still relatively early in the game in terms of, i mean, power devices have been around for eternity. but we're kind of in the early game of this new use in ev applications. so i think it's split across the board. it really depends on that customers' primary strategy. some are focused on silicon and igbt, some focused on silicon carbide, there's other other customers that are focused on gan. so i think we're just seeing across the board, there is a lot of power device demands across bunch of industries but automotive is probably the biggest driver.
charles shi -- needham & company -- vice president, equity research
got it. maybe my last question back to eval, i noticed that your purion dragon eval for dram and a purion xe max eval for image sensor has been a little bit for a while. i wonder whether you can update the progress there, those two obviously very important for expansion in dram and the image sensor market. so we'd like to see if you can provide any color on those two.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
as kevin mentioned earlier, we have five evals in the field, two high currents and three high energys. one is the high current is the purion dragon that you mentioned that is being qualified for dram application. now, that customer has already qualified the purion dragon for nand application and it's in production. so we're going through the pace this year. i think as you know evaluations some can close early, some can take a little bit longer. typically when it takes longer, we're working with the customers to ensure that they have all of the performance that they want and sometimes those steps actually changed from originally what we mutually agreed to and expand. so that purion dragon eval it's on track. we're working through it and we're looking forward to having that close and having that tool go into production very shortly. in terms of-- let me just mention the other purion h eval that's out there.
it's for advanced logic that's going very well also, and we believe that that is a great opportunity for us to further penetrate the advanced logic market in the future. in terms of the high energy, you mentioned the purion xe max, we actually have to purion xe maxs in the field, both for image sensor development and both of those are going very well. so there is no delay on that and again we didn't really give out a timeline in terms of when those valuations would close, but i would say that at this point they are both on track. so that's very positive. and then the last eval is a purion xe silicon carbide system, which is out with the power device manufacturer and that's also proceeding very well. so i think we're on track. and again, i'll say that we're more or less based on each specific customer experience at this point in time.
charles shi -- needham & company -- vice president, equity research
thanks, mary. that's all from me. thank you.
douglas a lawson
thank you.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. our next question comes from david duley with steelhead, your line is now open.
david duley -- steelhead securities -- managing principal
yeah, thanks for taking my questions. just a couple of clarifications. you gave us percentage of systems revenue for both power and cis. could you repeat those percentages again.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, let me find these. so in terms of shipments for the quarter, we had, we said 91% was mature process technology. we have-- actually, doug, did we set out, did we give it out by specific segment? i have it. but i don't remember actually saying that in the script. dave, i don't think we actually gave it out. i think when we get--
david duley -- steelhead securities -- managing principal
i'm almost positive i wrote it down, but [indecipherable] that revenue is power and 25% of cis is what i think you said for q3.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
i said yes, i didn't give a specific number. yes, that's what we basically estimated that it would be, but we didn't give out the specific breakdown and as doug said, you're going to get more detailed information on december 9th when we actually do a deep dive into that segment. so, i'm sorry, dave. you are right, but we didn't give the exact numbers.
david duley -- steelhead securities -- managing principal
okay. and then when you talk about power and cmos image sensor being more implant intensive. can you help me understand exactly what that means, how many implanters for 10,000 wafers or however you can characterize it. what does it mean to be more intensive for those particular applications with implant?
douglas a lawson
yeah. so, the devices that they're building in order to adjust the transistor characteristics and so forth, they require more implants. they require deeper implants and so they tend to have a lot of high energy applications within them. they require fairly significant adjustment implants to get the performance where they want them to be, to get the adjust for the threshold voltages and leakages to enhance the device performance and so forth. so they really optimized types of devices. and so that creates a higher implant intensity. it's hard to break it down specifically to per 10,000 wafer start, per 400,000 wafer start because it's very customer mix and recipe dependent. and so, but they are more implant intensive than most other devices and more so than the memory and definitely more than finfet transistors and so forth in advanced logic.
david duley -- steelhead securities -- managing principal
okay. and with this record orders and backlog. what should we expect for the first half of next year, given that you're manufacturing slots are full for the first half? what implications does that have for revenue in the first half of next year?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
we're not going to give any guidance or forecast into 2022,that'll be something when-- we will give you some general information, we talked about some new models that are coming out that are implant specific and we'll provide that at our investor day and then obviously when we get to the full year call in february, we'll give you more information on 2022.
david duley -- steelhead securities -- managing principal
okay. thank you.
douglas a lawson
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from craig ellis with b riley, your line is now open.
craig a. ellis -- b riley -- director of research, senior semiconductor and capital equipment analyst
yeah, thanks for taking the follow-up and i wanted to direct it toward the cs&i business. mary, you mentioned the gsd product that had press release recently. and the question is, is that something that investors should expect would be material to cs&i potential revenues in calendar '22 and on the topic of revenues, $50 million in the third quarter. i think the company said $50 million in the fourth quarter. so is $50 million kind of the new run rate for that business?
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
let me answer the first part about ovation, then i'll turn it over to kevin to address the financial part of it. the gsd ovation is basically available in terms of upgrades to our installed base of legacy tools, namely the high current and the high-energy tools. it provides our customers with a path forward for improved performance on the tools that they already have. it can be ordered as a separate configuration. but i think the main benefits we're going to see is through these upgrades that we have. so it's something that is important, but it's really part of the ongoing investment in innovation that we're making in that aftermarket business and because the mature process technology segment is so strong, and we have such a very large install base there. this is a really good investment for axcelis to be able to continue to drive growth in that area with our customers.
kevin brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. and craig, i think there is no doubt that $50 million seems like it's the kind of the new normal because we've been at that level for quite a few quarters now, high 40s into the low 50s. certainly with all of the buying going out [indecipherable] consumable business right now, it's been keeping this number elevated. and i think more importantly too our installed base is growing. we've shipped a lot of tools over the last several years and that's beginning to take hold now with this kind of entitlement that goes where they tool shipment. so, what the right number is, i mean it's certainly a lot higher than where it was when we were always seen it was in the mid-there is based on we're running. when we put out our new models on the 9th december at the investor day, i'll be more than happy to share our assumptions in those models for cs&i going forward. craig, so i think if you give me a month i can probably provide a little more color on that, but certainly $50 million at this point is i think a scenario, we're going to stay in and hopefully this continues to grow. and when we brought new models again i can discuss more about them.
craig a. ellis -- b riley -- director of research, senior semiconductor and capital equipment analyst

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the axcelis technologies call to discuss the company's results for the third quarter 2021. my name is daniel and i will be your coordinator for today. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, mary puma, president and ceo of axcelis technologies. please proceed, ma'am.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, daniel. with me today is kevin brewer, executive vice president and cfo and doug lawson executive vice president of corporate marketing and strategy. we are all participating in this call remotely, so, i would like to apologize in advance for any technical difficulties. if you've not seen a copy of our press release issued last night, it is available on our website. playback service will also be available on our website as described in our press release. please note that comments made today about our expectations for future revenues, profits and other results are forward-looking statements under the sec safe harbor provision. these forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to the risks inherent in our business.
these risks are described in detail in our form, 10-k annual report and other sec filings which we urge you to review. our actual results may differ materially from our current expectations. we do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. good morning and thank you for joining us. axcelis posted a very strong quarter due to the growing momentum of the purion product line and strength of the semiconductor industry, particularly the mature process technology segment.
revenue for the third quarter was $176.7 million with earnings per share of $0.81 driven by strong gross margins of 43.3%. quarterly system sales increased significantly to $126.2 million and implant systems record. cs&i, our aftermarket business continue to provide a major contribution to our top line and gross margin with q3 revenue of $50.5 million. in the third quarter, 91% of shipments went to mature foundry logic customers and 9% to memory customers with an even split between dram and nand. due to growing strength in the mature process technology market, we now estimate that segment will account for greater than 80% of system revenue for the full year 2021. the geographic mix of our systems shipments in the third quarter was china 70%, europe 15%, korea 5% and the rest of the world 10%. in q4, although china will continue to account for our largest percent of systems revenue, we expect the overall regional mix to be more balanced. turning to fourth quarter guidance, we expect revenue of approximately $190 million, gross margins of approximately 41.5%, operating profit of approximately $37 million and earnings per share of approximately $0.84. we now expect to exceed $640 million in revenue for the full year 2021.
the increase in revenues since the last quarter has been driven by the continued growth of the mature process technology segment and the early stages of a memory capacity build. we believe both market segments will contribute to what we expect will be a strong 2022 for the industry and for axcelis. our visibility into the first half of next year is very good as we are currently booking systems into q3 2022. overall demand for capital equipment in the semiconductor industry is being driven by several factors, including chip shortages, high fab utilization across all segments causing significant new fab investment, government incentive programs creating geographical expansion opportunities for our customers. the rapid growth of the power device market both silicon and silicon carbide to support automotive industry plans for electrification. and finally, the fundamental underlying drivers that started this growth cycle, 5g, data analytics and ai. we believe that the implant tam has increased significantly. this is driven by an overall increase in wafer starts, by the growth of foundry serving the mature markets where ion implant is a fab bottleneck due to the large mix of products.
and lastly, by the power and image sensor markets, which are more implant intensive and require our more advanced purion product extensions. the mature and specialty markets are generating sustainable growth with purion product extensions designed to serve the power device and image sensor markets. this is the case across all implant types, high current medium current and high energy. we have invested significantly in products for these markets over the last several years and we continue to invest to maintain the leadership, our purion products enjoy. in q3, we successfully closed in evaluation of a purion h200 for silicon power customer, highlighting our continued strength in the power segment. we believe the power segment will comprise 25% to 30% of our systems revenue for 2021 with the image sensor segment accounting for 20% to 25%. strength in these segments contribute significantly to our margin expansion. our growth in these segments is clear and sustainable, and most importantly, it is tied to long-term trends beyond any increase is driven by semiconductor shortages.
turning to the memory market, since the end of q3 and early into q4, we have seen an increase in memory shipments for both nand and dram applications. last week, we announced that we shipped multiple systems to a memory customer and successfully closed the evaluation of a purion h for a new nand high current customer. this customer now has both the purion h and purion xe qualified for production. revenue for that system will be recognized in the fourth quarter. we maintain a strong and growing position in memory and we expect 2022 to see continued capacity additions. we believe, dram will be stronger in the first half of the year with the subsequent pickup in nand later in 2022. we continue to see a high degree of activity in this logic, where we have a purion h evaluation underway that is expected to successfully close in q4. this qualification will open the door for production buys in 2022 and 2023. we are also seeing an increase in activity in the japanese market, especially related to power devices, image sensors and general mature devices. interest is strong for both our purion and legacy tools. in fact, earlier this week we announced the launch of gsd ovation high current and high energy batch implanters.
we expect these enhanced legacy products to be well received by 200 millimeter customers and to provide potential cs&i upgrade opportunities to our large installed base. the valuations are key to developing new customers increasing footprint at existing customers and penetrating new segments. we currently have five purion evaluation tools in the field focused on supporting future growth. these include a purion dragon, a purion h, a purion xe silicon carbide and two purion xe maxs which are positioned across key target segments including advanced logic, dram, image sensor and power devices. we expect to close multiple evaluations in q4 and plan to ship additional evaluations in the forth quarter and throughout 2022. in 2021 we are closing in on a $650 million revenue model, thanks to the success of purion and a very strong semiconductor market. as a result, we are developing an implant driven revenue model beyond $650 million that we will introduce at a virtual investor day currently planned for december 9th. now i'll turn the call over to kevin to discuss third quarter financial details as well as several operational topics including supply chain management and progress with our korean manufacturing site. kevin.
kevin brewer -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, mary, and good morning. axcelis delivered solid q3 financial results driven by strong gross margin performance and continued revenue growth, but our strength in a growing mature process technology market, we now expect to exceed $640 million in revenue for 2021. growing systems and cs&i revenue, coupled with strong bookings and backlog have set up a strong finish to 2021 and position us well for expected growth in 2022. we are seeing significant leverage in our business model and expect full-year operating expenses to be around 24% of revenue, the gross margins above 42%. for your gross margin assumptions include, a higher pandemic and supply chain related [indecipherable] and the impact of our investment in additional manufacturing capacity. on going gross margin improvement will be driven by the timing of cost out initiatives, customer and product mix and continued growth in our cs&i business. based on the strength of the market and demand for our purion products, we are developing new financial targets that will take us well beyond our current $650 million model.
we will introduce this model at our virtual investor day on december 9th. before discussing the details of our q3 financial performance, i'd like to provide an update on our supply chain and new manufacturing facility in south korea. we have and will continue to provide guidance [indecipherable] that reflects our current assessment of supply chain challenges. we are working closely with our established suppliers. we continue to qualify new sources of supply and carry a higher than normal level of inventory to help buffer supply chain disruption. our sales team is also working with customers to provide purchase orders much earlier than in the past, which in improves visibility for our manufacturing team. we are adding manufacturing operations closer to our customers with the goal of increasing customer satisfaction and capacity, construction of the new facility in south korea is complete. manufacturing again this week, but first shipment scheduled for the first quarter. this is an exciting opportunity for us. but i want to reiterate, especially with our recent rapid growth that we currently have sufficient capacity in place to support our near-term demands and expect the korea factory to play an important role in supporting future manufacturing requirements.
now turning to our third quarter financial results. q3 revenue finished at $176.7 million, compared to $147.3 million in q2. q3 system sales were $126.2 million and implant systems record compared to $100.1 million in q2. q3, cs&i revenue finished at $50.5 million compared to $47.1 million in q2. cs&i revenue remained strong, driven by high fab utilization, the growing purion and installed base, system upgrades and customers' purchasing safety stock. we expect q4, cs&i revenue of approximately $50 million. q3 sales, our top 10 customers accounted for 77.3% of our total sales compared to 75.1% in q2. one customer was above 10% in q3, compared to two in q2. q3 system bookings were $244.2 million compared to $172.1 million in q2 with a q3 book to bill ratio of 1.86 versus 1.71 in q2. we are currently pointing into the third quarter of next year. backlog in q3, including deferred revenue finished at $406.6 million, a new record for axcelis compared to our prior record of $271.2 million in q2. q3 combined sg&a and r&d spending was $40.1 million, 22.7% of revenue compared to $40 million or 27.2% in q2. sg&a in the quarter was $23.4 million with r&d at $16.7 million.
we expect q4 combined sg&a and r&d spending to be approximately 22% of revenue. q3 gross margin was 43.3% driven by strength in cs&i, higher purion power series shipments and continued cost out activity. regarding q4 gross margin to be approximately 41.5% driven by product mix and the expected closure of multiple evaluation systems. we expect full year gross margins to be above 42% including closure of these evaluation tools. operating profit in q3 finished at $36.4 million or 20.6% of revenues compared to $24 million in q2. we are guiding q4 operating profit of approximately $37 million. q3, net income was $27.5 million or $0.81 per share compared to $18.9 million or $0.55 per share in q2. we are guiding q4 eps of approximately $0.84. q3 cash finished at $271.8 million compared to $220.5 million in q2. in the quarter, we generated $66.2 million of cash from operations and several share repurchases of $12.5 million. also in the quarter, we received meaningful prepayments on system sales. q3 receivables were $78.3 million compared to $79.5 million in q2. q3 inventory ended at $196.8 million compared to $192.3 million in q2. q3 inventory turns excluding ship evaluation tools finished at 2.4 compared to 2.1 in q2. q3, accounts payable were $35.5 million compared to $40.7 million in q2.
as always, i want to thank our employees and suppliers for their continued efforts and outstanding execution supporting our stiff business ramp. it is an exciting time for axcelis, what unprecedented growth in the industry and solid customer demand for our products. our balance sheet is strong and we have the financial strength to invest in products, infrastructure and our employees. we have also returned over $62 million of capital to our shareholders under the share repurchase program since 2019. under the current program, we had $62.5 million of remaining authorization at the end of q3. thank you, and i'll now turn the call back to mary for closing comments.
mary g. puma -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, kevin. axcelis is currently positioned for significant sustainable growth. the implant market is increasing, thanks to strength in the overall semiconductor industry, but also due to a rapidly expanding mature process technology segment. the capabilities of purion product extensions, like the purion dxc and purion power series, combined with the implant intensive nature of the image sensor and power device segments, uniquely position axcelis to benefit from the electrification of the automotive market. we will continue to partner closely with our customers across all geographies in this growth segment. axcelis has the financial means to invest in r&d, global support infrastructure and capacity to capitalize on all of the opportunities discussed in today's call. we are in the middle of one of the most exciting times in the history of the industry and are confident that we are focused on all the elements required for leadership in ion implantation. with that, i'd like to open it up for questions.
