thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]. andy kaplowitz with citi is on line with a question.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
good morning, guys.
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
good morning andy.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
mike, can you help us think about the additional restructuring program you announced? i know, you said you'd give us more details later. but, how do we think about it in the context of the past program the $225 million g&a program. could it be as big and then, in the release, you said that the 8% margin in dcs reflects the expected benefit from the already executed $225 million programs, so does that mean that the new restructuring program could actually result in more than 8% dcs margin either over time or in fy 2020?
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
so, thank you for the question, andy. so, first of all, based on the success we had with the execution of the $225 million reduction. you saw that we were able to execute on that fairly quickly at the beginning of the year. it has had an impact of 100 basis point improvement over the previous year. we have previously said that we expected that to be 100 basis point improvement in fy 2019, and then when we had the full-year run rate in fy 2020 that would be another 50 basis points. right. so, we were already counting on the 100 for this year. the additional 50 basis points for next year.
we went through another exercise to evaluate our cost structure, and as are our portfolio evolves, we took a hard look at our real estate footprint to make sure that our real estate footprint is aligned with our new business model and our expectations for the future.
we also took another hard look at taking advantage of our higher utilization in our design centers in our shared services centers, to continue that evolution and the announcement that we made today is that we would expect another 50 basis point improvement.
so, the first round of restructuring at a full run rate would impact margins by 150 basis points. this would be another 50 basis points for 200 basis point improvement over fy 2018 margins.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
all right. so, let me shift gears then mike and ask troy about cash. so, maybe can you give us more color to the reasons why the cash has been so far below your expectations. is it just the virgin islands, or are there any projects that you've not been executing on as well as expected, or maybe there are other projects that you've had difficulty collecting cash. so just, if you give us any of the reasons or is it really just the virgin islands that had slipped?
w. troy rudd -- chief financial officer, executive vice president
yeah. so andy, let me give you a headline and then some detail. i think it's -- first, the headline is, is putting aside the us virgin islands what we're experiencing is we're experiencing issues with the timing of some of the collection on some projects, but not the collectability on those projects. so, we clearly have a second-half weighted cash flow historically, and we expect it the same this year. so, beyond the us virgin islands, which we had expected to collect a little in q3 and some in q4. we've had some projects in q3 that those collections moved into q4, and we've already collected on a number of those items.
and with respect to the us virgin islands itself, the reason that we -- we downgraded our view on where we'd end up in the range is because with -- they said with seven weeks to go, we've actually experienced the bureaucracy with our customer and with fema, and getting those invoices and those collections made -- actually we've actually -- bureaucracy getting worse, not better. so, that has changed our expectations, but again i just highlight that our view is, it's an issue of timing and certainly not collectability on any projects or execution.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
and troy to that comment of you've already collected some of the cash. do you have visibility like you did last year, toward collecting? we understand the couple of $100 million of virgin islands could slip, but the $500 million that you need. besides that, do you already have the visibility you need to collect that cash here in q4?
w. troy rudd -- chief financial officer, executive vice president
yes andy. we've got a pathway to do that in q4.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
all right, thanks guys.
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
thanks you.
w. troy rudd -- chief financial officer, executive vice president
thank you.

jamie cook with credit suisse is on the line with a question.
jamie l. cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good morning. i guess a couple of questions, one mike back to the -- the improvement in the dcs margins of at least 8%. you know, before you sort of talked about broad 2020 ebitda guidance of above $1 billion so i'm just trying to figure out, does that mean we can add an additional $0.25 or whatever, to what we were expecting on 2020 estimates. so, i'm just trying to think of it, is that a guidance raise relative to the bigger picture 2020 ebitda targets? and then, my second question just back on the cash flow again, troy, if the couple of $100 million from the virgin islands slips into 2020, do we view that as additive to 2020 free cash flows, so you should be at least at the high end of your free cash flow guidance range of $800 million. and then last, mike for you, also just an update on where we are on the construction divestiture? thanks.
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
great. thanks jamie. so, why don't i let troy answer the first two parts on cash flow, and guidance and then i'll answer the question. i'll come back and answer the question on cs.
w. troy rudd -- chief financial officer, executive vice president
yeah. so jamie, in terms of the 2020 guidance again as we said -- as we said, it's too early in the process to give formal guidance, we'll do that when we get to q4 earnings. but, in terms of the dcs margin improvement, we do see that being additive to our guidance in fiscal 2020. and with respect to cash flow, the answer is yes. we gave guidance that was over a three-year period, and so to the extent there is some cash that moves into the following year i would see that being additive or moving us to the higher end of the range in the following year.
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
yeah. i'd just to underscore that jamie. we still feel very good about our overall long-range cash flow. we've had five years in a row now of incredible industry-leading cash flow. we don't see that changing at all, and anything that does move from q4 into q1 next year just -- it's a timing difference if we have it. so, no change there. with respect to cs, as we have said, we are -- we have a clear goal to be out of the at-risk self-perform construction business by the end of this calendar year. we are in the market. we are actively engaged with discussions with potential buyers for the civil and power business there, and that continues to progress and we'll update you as soon as we have something to announce on that front.
but, i think the important part is that by the end of this calendar year, we fully expect to be entirely out of the at-risk self-perform business. we will have a professional services business of a high-margin, certainly on an nsr based on high-margin construction management business, a low risk business and a changed portfolio going into calendar 2020.
jamie l. cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, thank you. i'll get back in queue.
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
thanks jamie.

tahira afzal with keybanc capital is on line with a question.
unidentified participant
hi team. this is [phonetic] sean on for tahira today. so, for me, just drilling in on the dcs margin target for fy 2020, how would you characterize the dependence on the overall macro economy holding out to hit that target versus kind of what you've already got locked in backlogs and locked in with the cost savings through these last two programs?
w. troy rudd -- chief financial officer, executive vice president
so this is -- sean, it's troy. look, i think that when you look at our 2020 guidance, in terms of margins, we're not building in an expectation of significant growth into that. now clearly, the market conditions that we're seeing support growth in that business, and based on the backlog that we have at the end of the third quarter we certainly see contracted backlog being up, so that indicates growth in that business. but, really through the restructuring actions that we've taken out and that we're going to take, we see the confidence in that 8% margin guide.
unidentified participant
all right. that's really helpful. and then ms prospects wise, it sounds like there is some bigger doe contract decisions being made in kind of the coming months. i'd just like to get an update on aecom's competitive positioning in the doe realm, considering we do hear several other companies talk about wanting to be bigger in that space. so, an update there would be great.
randall a. wotring -- chief operating officer
sure, this is randy. this quarter, we saw the savannah river contract extended. and as mike said, subsequent to the quarter end, we received another $250 million increment to funding on that contract. it will go -- it will go back into competition sometime in the future. other than that, the next contract up for award is the central plateau contract at hanford, and we expect that, that award announcement to be in the near term. i mean, it could be made at any time over the next three to four weeks.
there is another contract at hanford the tank op, it will probably be delayed. but look, the best indicator of our success in the future in my opinion, as i've stated previously, is the performance we have on existing contracts.
all of our contracts within doe are rated very highly. and just, as mike mentioned in his prepared remarks, our last award fee score at savannah river was over 94%. so, we continue to perform in an outstanding manner on all of our doe contracts, and we remain very bullish on our bidding activities and in the future. we've been in this market for over for over 50 years, and have consistently been a top performer. so, we're very bullish on the future.
unidentified participant
helpful. i'll turn it over there. thanks so much.
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
thanks [phonetic] sean.

andy wittmann with baird is on the line with a question.
andrew j. wittmann -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
great. i just -- i wanted to clarify, maybe just get a little bit context on the precise impact of the us virgin islands revenue? you mentioned that the core business was up despite that, so can you just tell us what the usvi year-over-year headwind was, so we can get a better sense of that underlying business?
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
yeah, it was about 2% andy, in terms of revenue is the headwind.
andrew j. wittmann -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
got it. and that should be fairly similar in fourth quarter, and i think that compare stays relatively difficult through the second quarter of next year, but i guess i wanted to confirm that with you?
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
yes. it's something similar. it will be 200 basis points to 250 basis points in the fourth quarter, i think is the headwind from that.
andrew j. wittmann -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
got it. and into next year, as well, that we should be thinking about that ?
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
yeah, next year. yes, absolutely in the first half of the year, next year in the first quarter and second quarter, we will -- we'll again have the same headwind. i was just going to add one thing to that too, but as we do look forward, again even absent that, we do see the opportunity for growth in that business into 2020.
andrew j. wittmann -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
certainly. okay. and then just, on this next wave of restructuring in dcs, as you're looking at your cost structure there, obviously, we can do the math in terms of how much cost you're expecting out to come out of the p&l. do you expect the relationship between the cost to achieve that 50 basis points to be somewhat consistent with the first wave? in other words, the ratio of cost to achieve to cost savings, and do you expect it to be primarily cash or non-cash in nature?
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
yeah, andy, again as we -- so just again, a headline and a couple of details. first is, yes, we see it actually having a slightly larger cost and the reason is, this relates to real estate. so, the return is not quite as significant, but with respect to real estate, there is a fairly non-significant non-cash component. but, at this point in time, it's too early for me to give guidance on that detail.
andrew j. wittmann -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
yeah, totally understand. that's helpful and i'll leave it there. thank you.
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
thanks andy.

chad dillard with deutsche bank is on line with a question.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, good afternoon everyone.
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
hi chad.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
so, i just wanted to spend some time on the ms segment, and just understand -- just the revenue ramp for the projects that at least you have in your backlog right now? how are you thinking about -- how long it takes to actually hit the full run rate, and then also just on the margin side, are you guys committed to that 7% margins and just wanted to understand, whether it's the case that it's kind of needing to kind of ramp-up the business and you actually get there or is there more -- anything else that you need to do to hit that target?
randall a. wotring -- chief operating officer
hi chad, this is randy. let me talk about the revenue ramp. again, we've seen revenue at double-digit growth the last four quarters -- that will slow down, and we believe that will slow down, but again, the pipeline remains very large so the comps get tougher, but we see opportunities to continue to grow this business. we have a pipeline of $30 billion and our bidding activity remains high, our win rates remain really healthy and from that standpoint, we see this business continuing to grow, albeit maybe at a lower rate, given the comps that we see going forward.
in addition, we see a higher content of doe type bids in next 18 months to two years. so, i'll let troy, talk about the margins.
w. troy rudd -- chief financial officer, executive vice president
yes. chad, our margins are really driven by the mix of business, and the mix of business, if you recall in the past, we'd won a significant amount of work at the department of defense, so with that client and as you heard from randy in the fourth quarter, we had another award, that's doe award and there are a number of doe awards coming in the future. so, as we see a change in our backlog, as a result of an increase in percentage of total backlog related to the doe client, we see that improvement in margin over time, but i also want to make another point, which is that, in terms of looking at our margins, i also think it's important to look at the actual cash conversion, because when we look at the amount of cash that our management services business produces, as a percentage of its revenues it actually equalizes for the impact when compared to our peers, because our peers -- a lot of our peers have a very capital-intensive businesses, ours is a very capital-light business and when you look at the percentage of cash to revenues in the business, you see that, in fact our business may look at 6% and 7% margins to be lower, but in fact, it is right in line with all of those -- peers.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
that's helpful. and just another question on the aecom capital, i think you guys call it about $13 million of ebitda after this year, but just wanted to get a sense for how you're seeing the monetization pipeline as we go into 2020? do you see, i guess, the ability to actually capture similar level of realization? and then, just on the construction services side, there is that the equity and earnings saw like a pretty nice healthy bump up to $20 million. just wanted to get some clarity on how sustainable that is?
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
so with respect to -- i don't want to start to give subcomponent guidance for next year on aecom capital, but just a quick update there. we expect to complete the external fundraising process by the end of this quarter. we would expect them to be using almost entirely outside capital to fund that activity, and so, the restructuring there to hone our focus has been successful. the realization of gains will not be dissimilar from what we've recently experienced, so you should expect that to be somewhat constant, but we'll give more guidance on that come the november earnings call when we give the full-year guidance for 2020.
and the second part of your question was about cs so...
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yeah. i just know that there is a nice little pop in the equity and earnings $20 million, i just wanted to kind of understand like how sustainable that was and what drove that?
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
yeah. andy, i wouldn't look at that as being a sustainable path. again, within our cs segment, we have a number of projects that we consolidate and a number of projects that are in joint ventures, and it just happened in the quarter related to project execution and that we actually saw the impact of that coming through our jv line or through joint ventures.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, thanks. i'll pass it on.
operator
[operator instructions]. michael dudas with vertical research is on line with a question.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning gentlemen. mike, i wanted to delve into your prepared remarks regarding the ms spin and how you're seeing that? what's giving you more confidence? what's some of the feedback that you referred to in
-- since the announcement, have you received indication of interest from other parties about different structures to monetize or get the value out of that businesses?
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
and so, mike thanks for that question. we initiated this process with the belief that the ms business held considerable value which the separation would unlock. we feel even more confident about that belief today than we did before the announcement, and i really can't comment on the specifics because we're early in the process, but we're just very confident based on the initial steps in the process and our initial dialogs that have validated this view that it's a highly valued asset, and there is no question that we're on the right path here.
so, i'll leave it at that mike, as you can understand that. i don't want to comment too much about the specifics, given where we are in that process.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
i totally understand, and timing is similar to what you talked about back in june like within a quarter or so range?
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
yeah. we are moving ahead of schedule right now, let's say that.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
excellent. and follow-up is, with the cs business you called out in new york, los angeles the boom there assuming there'll be some more sports arenas, built especially out in california, they have opportunities with, but there's -- everybody watching [phonetic] tape and seeing the concern about the economy, concern about market etc. do you have any indication from some of your key developers or the folks that there has been some pause/concern, are we really late in the game on the non-res big construction in these core markets or is still there enough hope and visibility, especially with maybe funding costs coming down that we can continue to see this market expand for you guys for the next several years?
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
yeah. mike, just the market still seems to have legs in front of us. we have, first of all, that business has about four years of backlog right now. so, there is plenty of backlog to keep us busy for the next four years. but, having said that, the wins that we have seen -- our total backlog in cs is up 34% and so the backlog continues to grow.
i think there's just a number of other really interesting areas, we are seeing a growth in -- and you mentioned the sports arena where we are a leader in that marketplace, continues to be a robust market, you've heard us mentioned in the past, the aviation market where there is an expectation over the next several years for $100 billion of investment in airports in the us alone, which we are a strong player in that space. but, even in the core, non-residential building market, the jpmorgan headquarter building on park avenue in new york, of course that's a very large project.
but, what's significant about that is the rezoning of that entire section of midtown manhattan to allow for additional high-rise buildings, and we're seeing a lot of demand in new york city. we're seeing a lot of technology companies taking up significant amounts of space in new york city.
so, that market still seems to have quite a bit of legs, but the important part is, we continue to win work. we have about $10 billion of decisions that we're waiting on that we expect to be made in the next six months for construction management work.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
so, you tell me, it's still going to be difficult to get around midtown manhattan for the next several years. is that what you're saying, mike?
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
that's correct.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
it's too bad. thanks gentlemen.
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
sure.
operator
we have no further questions at this time. i will now turn the call back over to mike burke for closing comments.
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
okay. thank you operator. so, before concluding the call today. i just want to put our third quarter accomplishments in the right perspective, and emphasize a few points that we've made throughout the discussion today and throughout the q&a session. it was two years ago that we began a very deliberate process to transform this business; to best position us for long-term success, to maximize shareholder value based upon a number of changes that we were seeing in the marketplace.
and you saw that commitment back in 2017 with our capital allocation policy, where we are focused on returning capital to our shareholders through both debt reduction and our stock repurchases under the $1 billion share authorization.
we then moved into a further effort with a deep analysis of our cost structure, in consultation with bain and our board of directors, which resulted in the $225 million restructuring plan that we completed earlier this year, and the additional incremental restructuring that we announced today.
we then embarked on a path to de-risk our portfolio, and that started in the early part of 2018 with the decision to extract ourselves from the combined cycle gas power business, so that we could focus on the higher returning and lower-risk businesses. we announced that we were exiting more than 30 countries, we announced the sale of non-core assets where we believe the risk wasn't commensurate with the rewards, and we announced our intent to fully extract ourselves from the self-perform, at-risk construction business.
and we are well on our way, on all of those fronts. our third quarter and our year-to-date results really provide the strongest evidence that these strategic actions are creating real value for our investors. we've delivered 14% adjusted ebitda growth in the first half of the year, the highest margin that we've seen in several years in our dcs business and we continue to benefit from near record backlog levels.
so, as we continue to evaluate additional avenues for further unlocking the value inherent in the organization; we announced back in june the separation of our management services business to unlock that value, and we'll continue to pursue every strategic opportunity in front of us to do that, but we remain incredibly confident in our ability to position this company to provide incredible growth opportunities for our employees to deliver great value for our clients, and of course to drive long-term value for our investors.
so, we are delighted with the progress that our leadership team has made and all of our employees to transform this business over the past two years. and, i think you're seeing the tracks in the snow this quarter, once again, down that path.
so, thank you again for joining us today.
and with that, i look forward to the next discussion. thank you.

will gabrielski -- vice president-investor relations
thank you operator, i would like to direct your attention to the safe harbor statement on page one of today's presentation. today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about future business and financial expectations. actual results may differ significantly from those projected in today's forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, including the risks described in our periodic reports filed with the sec. except as required by law, we take no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.

today's call includes comments about restructuring activities that are expected to commence later this year. today's discussion of organic growth is on a year-over-year and constant currency basis, and is adjusted to exclude impacts of non-core businesses. beginning today's presentation is mike burke aecom's chairman and chief executive officer, mike?
michael s. burke -- chairman of the board, chief executive officer
thank you will. welcome everyone. joining me today are troy rudd, our chief financial officer and randy wotring, our chief operating officer. i will begin with a discussion of aecom's results, and the trends across our business. i will also provide an update on our strategic actions that have resulted in a substantial increase in shareholder value this year, then troy will review our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. before turning the call over for a question-and-answer with session.
please turn to slide three. we entered the year with a sharper focus and a clear plan to maximize shareholder value, and we are delighted with our progress against this plan. this progress is no more apparent than in our plan to separate the management services segment, the near record dcs margin resulting from the restructuring actions we executed in the first half of the year, and in our ongoing commitment to focus on our higher margin and lower risk professional services businesses.
importantly, we are continuing to pursue every avenue to unlock the value inherent across our enterprise, including the additional margin enhancing restructuring actions we announced today. turning to our third quarter results. we delivered adjusted ebitda of $244 million, which was ahead of our expectations. as a result year-to-date adjusted ebitda increased by 14% and we remain confident in delivering on our full-year adjusted ebitda guidance for 12% growth at the midpoint.
the quarter was highlighted by the highest margin in the dcs segment in the past three years, which is a clear indication of the success of our restructuring. to that point, our year-to-date dcs margins have increased by 100 basis points from the prior year. we continue to expect at least 110 basis point improvement for the full year with another 100 basis point increase now expected in fiscal 2020.
this result validates our ongoing deep review of opportunities for margin expansion, and builds on the conclusions we reached last year in consultation with bain that resulted in our completed $225 million g&a reduction. we delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in management services segment, reflecting the higher returns on our business development investments, including a nearly 50% win rate over the past several years. in addition, despite the anticipated reduction of storm recovery work in the us virgin islands, our americas design business saw continued underlying growth.
momentum across our markets is strong, year-to-date wins of more than $21 billion reflect a 1.3 book-to-bill ratio and our backlog is up 10% from the prior year. as a result, all of our segments have backlog at near-record levels, which is the best indicator of our success in the marketplace and of future growth.
free cash flow is positive, but was below our expectations. we are pursuing a sizable outstanding balance for the fema-funded storm recovery work we executed in the us virgin islands. we expect to collect what is owed to us and deliver on our long-term cash flow and capital allocation goals.
please turn to slide four. we have made significant progress on the strategic actions we have taken and continue to take to improve our margins and drive shareholder value. in june, we announced our intent to separate the management services segment. we are aggressively moving forward, are ahead of schedule, and have received positive reactions to date. we can't comment on specifics, and we are early in the process, but we are very confident that initial steps in this process have validated our view that this is a highly valued asset.
we remain confident, we will unlock value for our owners. additionally, we are on track with our plan to simplify our business through the exit of at least 30 countries. we are also progressing well against our portfolio derisking plans. we recently completed the sales of our oil and gas production services and international development businesses, which further de-risk our portfolio. and we are conducting a review of all at-risk construction exposure with the goal of having zero at risk self-perform construction.
importantly, upon completion of this process nearly all revenue will be generated from higher returning and lower risk businesses. building on the extensive financial and strategic work our team has conducted in partnership with our board, we also announced additional restructuring actions today that further align our overall cost structure with our more efficient and streamlined operating profile.
these actions build on the success of our previous $225 million g&a reduction and are expected to significantly benefit fiscal 2020 margins and ebitda. as a result of our progress to date, and the anticipated benefits from this plan, we are increasing our adjusted operating margin target in dcs segment, for fiscal 2022 to at least 8%, reflecting a 100 basis point increase from our fiscal 2019 expectation and a 210 basis point increase from fiscal 2018.
these actions further bolster our confidence in delivering continued strong earnings growth, including our expectation for adjusted ebitda in excess of $1 billion, in fiscal 2020. we will provide formal financial guidance in november with our fourth quarter results.
please turn to slide five for a discussion of our business trends. beginning in the dcs segment in the americas, we delivered solid results and are capitalizing on very favorable market conditions. the fiscal health of our state and local clients, which account for approximately 75% of us infrastructure spending is robust.
state revenues are increasing, reflecting the late cycle nature of tax receipts and rainy-day funds are at an all-time high, with further increases expected in fiscal 2020. as a result, proposed state budgets for fiscal 2020 will call for nearly 4% spending growth. infrastructure investment remains popular with voters and states are prioritizing transportation projects, including proposals for another $8 billion of transportation specific tax increases in 2020 with another five states, set to increase gas taxes next year.
the canadian market is also robust and execution on large projects continues to result in double-digit revenue growth, led by our largest market, transportation.
turning to our international markets, beginning in the emea region. we are capitalizing on a substantial set of opportunities in saudi arabia, the third quarter marked our strongest revenue growth in several years. we recently announced our selection for phase 1 of the $500 billion neom bay development, wins on projects of this size, scale and ambition speak to client recognition of the strength of our capabilities as leaders in mega city development.
the uk market remains pressured from lingering brexit concerns. however, long-term infrastructure demand remains strong. prime minister johnson already announced the commitment to substantial investment in national infrastructure, since his appointment last month. in fact, the focus on infrastructure and the need for significant investment to support post-brexit changes was front and center in the prime minister's acceptance speech, and we are well positioned to support these initiatives.
pivoting to the asia-pacific region. we are continuing to execute on a near-record level of backlog in our largest markets, led by hong kong and australia. even so, we are mindful of the geopolitical uncertainty and potential impacts to economic growth in hong kong. while our backlog creates a degree of certainty for us, the pace of awards is slow. we expect that demand will reaccelerate, once the current issues are resolved and we are well positioned to capitalize.
turning to the management services segment, we delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth, despite tough comparisons in the prior year that benefited from the initial ramp-up in revenue for several large wins. our backlog remains near an all-time high at nearly $19 billion, reflecting strong returns on our business development investments and superior execution by our leadership team.
in july, our performance of the savannah river site was rated excellent for a fifth consecutive year and our award fee was earned at more than 94%. this performance further validates our strong execution track record for our client and reinforces our confidence, with the highly robust department of energy bid environment.
in addition, after the quarter close, we added approximately $250 million to our backlog related to our contract at the savannah river site that will contribute to growth in fiscal 2020. and we continue to pursue a $30 billion pipeline of opportunities with several sizable decisions expected shortly on large doe pursuits.
looking ahead, the defense spending outlook is strong. the president signed a bipartisan budget agreement that removes the risk of the spending caps imposed under the budget control act, supports continued record defense spending and add certainty to our outlook. pivoting to construction services. execution, in our lower risk building construction business was strong. backlog has increased by more than 50% and we have nearly four years of annual revenue in backlog.
for instance, in new york, our largest market, strong demand for office space was evidenced by the substantial long-term leases signed by several large technology companies during the third quarter. in addition, the rezoning of 78 blocks of prime real estate in midtown manhattan played to our strengths, having built approximately 60% of all buildings over a 1,000 feet in in new york city, over the past decade. today, nearly 90% of our revenue in the building construction business is in our four core markets, primarily new york and los angeles. in these markets, our execution track record is strong and our history, scale and market presence create competitive advantages. we will continue to benefit from the professional services nature of this work, that provides for a low risk profile, high margins on revenue after excluding pass-through costs and generates our highest return on capital.
please turn to slide six. as this quarter demonstrates, the actions we have taken to enhance profitability and reposition our portfolio toward our higher returning and lower-risk businesses are delivering results. today, these businesses account for approximately 90% of our total revenue. upon completion of our strategic actions, our end-state portfolio of businesses, will be almost entirely comprised of our lower-risk design and construction management businesses, which provides for consistent execution, strong returns and strong cash flow.
as we will detail on our fourth quarter results and at our investor day in december, we will align our financial reporting with the changing nature of our portfolio, specifically we will continue to report revenue on a gross revenue basis consistent with how we report today.
in addition, we will report revenue on a net revenue basis or nsr, which is the self-perform component of our revenue, that excludes subcontractor and other direct contractor costs. this presentation will provide a greater level of insight into business performance and is consistent with the reporting practices across our professional services peer group. we will also begin to report on and provide guidance for margins on the same basis.
i will now turn the call over to troy, who will discuss the quarter in more detail.
w. troy rudd -- chief financial officer, executive vice president
thanks mike. please turn to slide eight. our third quarter results included double-digit growth in all key profitability measures, highlighted by 10% adjusted ebitda growth, and 16% adjusted eps growth. our year-to-date results tells a similar story, with continued revenue growth 14% adjusted ebitda growth, more than $21 billion of wins and a $59 billion backlog. we are benefiting from the focused restructuring actions we executed in the first half of the year. because of these actions, we are more efficient and profitable company.
this is evidenced, by the three-year high for dcs profitability and our reiterated financial guidance for the year. building on this momentum, today we announced additional planned restructuring actions to further increase efficiencies and profitability by aligning our real estate portfolio, with the ongoing transformation of the business. the benefit of these actions will primarily benefit fiscal 2020 results, where we have increased our adjusted operating margin target in the dcs segment by 50 basis points to at least 8%.
this is 210 basis points above the fiscal 2018 results. we continue to evaluate opportunities for additional margin improvement. we will provide more details on the restructuring and formal guidance ranges for fiscal 2020 in our fiscal fourth quarter earnings, consistent with our usual cadence. please turn to slide nine. dcs segment, underlying performance was strong and the benefits of the restructuring actions we completed earlier this year led to a 130 basis point increase on the adjusted operating margin to 7.4%, which was a near record high.
our revenue was negatively impacted by the anticipated headwind from lower us virgin islands related storm recovery work in the quarter, and a decline in the asia-pacific region due to geopolitical uncertainty. importantly after accounting for the lower storm recovery work, revenue increased in the low-single digits. our contracted backlog increased which is the best indicator of revenue growth over the coming year. while the headwind from reduced storm recovery work in the us virgin islands will challenge our comparisons in the fourth quarter as well, we expect underlying revenue to increase.
please turn to slide 10. revenue in the ms segment increased by 10% marking a fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. the adjusted operating margin was consistent with our expectations for the year. importantly, this business requires very little capital to grow, and produces a high return on invested capital and although peers report a higher ebitda margin, we convert each dollar of revenue to cash flow at a rate consistent with our peers, due to our capital-light model, which is the best measure of financial returns.
looking ahead, we remain committed to our long-term margin target of 7%, supported by continued strong funding levels in our key us government clients and an increasing mix of higher margin work from the doe. i should note, we removed approximately $200 million from our backlog related to the sale of a non-core business in the quarter. adjusting for this impact, the backlog was mostly unchanged from the prior year. please turn to slide 11.
organic revenue in cs declined by 9%. this result included the anticipated decline in the power business, following our decision to extract ourself from fixed price combined cycle gas power market. we expect to complete construction of the alliant combined cycle power, plant later this calendar year. revenue building construction business declined against record revenue in the year ago period. however, we have strong backlog visibility into growth into 2020, as recent wins begin to contribute and our pipeline is robust.
the adjusted operating margin was 2.6%, reflecting solid execution. recall this business include substantial pass through cost in the building construction business that dilute the margin percentage on a gross revenue basis. excluding these costs, margins on a net revenue basis are typically in the high-teens.
upon completion of our derisking, nearly all the revenue in the cs segment is expected to be generated from our lower risk building construction management business, where we deploy virtually no working capital and generate high returns on capital. please turn to slide 12. operating cash flow was $77 million and free cash flow was $52 million. year-to-date free cash flow was a use of $85 million. we continue to pursue a more than $200 million net outstanding balance for storm recovery work from our client in the us virgin islands, which is expected to be fully funded by fema.
we are confident in these collections, but with only seven weeks left in the year, we cannot determine the exact precision if the collections will fall within the fiscal year. as a result, we are now targeting free cash flow to be at the low end of our $600 million to $800 million guidance range. recall, our cash flow is typically second-half weighted and in the last year's fourth quarter, we generated $500 million of free cash flow. our historical cash flow performance provides some insight into why we remain confident, in the strong cash generation over time.
this performance includes $2.7 billion of free cash flow generated from 2015 through 2018, including annual performance near the midpoint of the range in each of these years. as a result, we have an industry-leading cash flow yield based upon our track record of delivering on our guidance. importantly, the highly cash generated nature of our business has not changed. turning to capital allocation, we will continue to allocate capital in a balanced manner, focused on maximizing shareholder returns.
our total debt declined by $81 million sequentially, and by $77 million over the prior year. we have also repurchased $210 million of stock, since last august under our $1 billion authorization. as we progress with the plan to separate the ms segment, we will continue to allocate our capital, primarily toward debt reduction to achieve our leverage targets. please turn to slide 13. with our strong year-to-date results, we are confident in reiterating our fiscal 2019 guidance or 12% adjusted ebitda growth at the midpoint and adjusted eps of between $2.60 and $2.90.
with that, i will turn the call over for q&a. operator, we're ready for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from andy kaplowitz with citi. your line is open.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
good morning, guys. nice quarter.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks. good morning, andy.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
mike, can you talk about the 8% operating margin dcs in q4 as well as your ongoing focus on cost out? you mentioned last quarter that you've ramped up the consulting effort within the business. and -- so as you proceeding along both on your planning of what future dcs looks like as part of the main cause as well as given what you're actually executing. are you getting more confidence that 8% plus margin in fy 2020, which is a signpost on a longer road of margin expansion? and at the analyst day, will you give us a new target to think about in terms of a margin goal for that segment?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, andy. the majority of the actions that we've taken to get to that 8% margin target happened in fy 2019, or would be taken in the first half of the year of 2020. we have made a lot of progress on those actions over the past year. we still have some that we're executing on right now. but we have a high level of competence in that. we still have additional opportunities for continued margin expansion both through the continued increase of our global business services centers and our global design centers. we have -- we still have some actions that we have planned and are taking on the continued reduction of our real estate portfolio as we continue to refine the right places that we want to have a platform within and where we want to deliver that work. it gives us a pretty good outlook there.
that 8% margin on an nsr basis translates to about 11.4% -- i'm sorry, 11.8% on an nsr basis. and so, it gives you a sense where we were and how far -- how much progress we've made over the past two years and the opportunities in fy20. we will continue to give more insight into the future margin improvement opportunities when we get together in december.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
thanks for that mike. and troy, free cash flow of $780 million in the quarter -- i know you, kind of, pre-announced that you're going to do a full year of $700 million versus you were guiding to the low end of $600 million to $800 million. and concern you didn't collect significant payments from the virgin islands or the refinery that you mentioned the past. it's obviously quite good. so what was so much better than your expectations? was there any pull forward of cash from 2020? and if you get virgin islands cash, i mean, assuming that the company was still together, can you do $800 million plus, as you sit here today?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. so, andy, there's no single item that i could point to that said, we outperformed, kind of, what we guided to last quarter in terms of free cash flow. it was really an effort across the entire company of folks focusing on cash flow and driving an outsized result. and when we look at the last five years, we said -- we generated $3.4 billion of cash flow. and within that timeframe, things move around from quarter-to-quarter. so when i look at this entire year, we did certainly come within our guidance range. the organization pulled together and did better than we had expected in the fourth quarter.
and the reason that we gave the guidance for the entire company for next year of $600 million to $800 million was just to make sure that we gave the indication that there wasn't something significant that we were pulling forward from a subsequent year. we still have the same belief that business continues to turn earnings into cash flow on a consistent basis, again, recognizing that there are fluctuations between quarters. i will say that having the year-end on september 27th, instead of september 30th, did provide a small benefit for us in terms of timing, and i estimate that to be about $50 million of benefit in terms of the 2019 performance.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
and then just a quick clarification on the $160 million -- $180 million of cash restructuring costs. i think you said it was $90 million for the original program. and i know, troy, you talked about in a new stranding -- taking care of stranded costs, but also focused on core dcs. if i think about that ratio in the past of that $90 million to $225 million[phonetic], is it similar ratio for the subset of cash costs that is focused on incremental margin in dcs?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
no, it's a slightly different profile, because part of the restructuring that we're undertaking now is related to real estate. and so the payback is a little bit longer term. it certainly is a significant cash payback. but it has a little bit different profile. and then the other significant element of that is stranded costs, which will have a benefit to the company, but that's not a benefit that we would see in margins as the benefit again removing those costs as the management service business would exit sometime we think in q2.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael feniger with bank of america. your line is open.
michael feniger -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, guys. yes, thanks for taking my questions. i know your quarter, obviously, ended at the end of september. i'm just hoping maybe, mike, you can talk about in october and already with a week or so in november, is there anything you're seeing, mike, in terms of fee[phonetic] on the awards? any slowdown that you highlight or is that -- is there anything that's giving you confidence that especially in dcs you expect the organic growth to reaccelerate once you lap some of those tougher comps in the back half?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. well, certainly we're not seeing any indications of a slow down. in fact, in fy 2019, we had $27.5 billion of wins. if you look at what we'll call the professional services segment, the dcs and cm business, we had a book to burn of 1.2 in fy 2019. so it kind of gives you a sense for the momentum you have coming into fy 2020. we still believe that mid-single-digit organic growth is the right target for us in both the short and the longer term in that business. but we haven't seen any market indicators on a broad scale. but that gives you a sense.
michael feniger -- bank of america -- analyst
that's fair. and then just thinking about the backlog that you're seeing in cs and dcs. just curious, is there any view internally that with the backlog and the visibility now that you have that -- where the backlog is -- is it now -- did you push more price, do you get a little bit more selective as you approach some of this pipeline that you say is still robust? i'm just curious how you manage that?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so again the professional services segment is got a 19% increase in backlog for the year. we are definitely continuing to grow. but we are being selective of that, kind of, risk profile we want. we continue to stay laser focused on higher-growth and higher-margin markets. there is no question we have a different focus on the type of projects we're willing to take on. but i don't want to suggest that somehow that is going to have an enormous impact on -- an enormous negative impact on organic growth. we still feel confident in the mid-single-digit growth rates.
michael feniger -- bank of america -- analyst
and just lastly, just -- there is still some loose end[phonetic]. i know you guys have -- on the oil and gas side, you talked about civil construction keys. provide us an update on the timeline there. the fact that the cash flow came in so strong in the fourth quarter, does it change your timeline at all, especially, with what we're seeing in the public market side on some assets for civil construction? and i'm just curious how you're thinking about that, mike and troy, as we approach 2020?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so, it is still our strong intention to divest ourselves of at-risk self-perform work. during the year we did sell our international development business. we sold portions of oil and gas. we're ramping up our alliance combined cycle gas power plant this quarter. but as i've said in the past, the market conditions are difficult to be selling civil construction assets right now. so we continue to market that asset. but in the meantime, we're really focused on carefully managing the risk in that portfolio, and we're also focused on ensuring that we maintain the value that exist in that business today for a potential sale. it's performing well. it's generating cash flow. and we want to make sure that we maintain that. so, we're certainly not going to give those assets away, but we still have the same intention to divest in those business.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from sean eastman with keybanc capital markets. your line is open.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks for taking my questions. first one for me is just on the cash flow. clearly, a ton of moving parts into fiscal 2020, and it sounds like we'll get more color in december. but just coming back to those items, andy brought up the usvi receivable and the refinery claim, just those two big discrete items. i just wondered, are those likely to be additive in fiscal 2020, and could they may be help drive a less back-end loaded free cash flow cadence as we look into fiscal 2020?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. so sean, as we look forward, we certainly have some element of collections of the us virgin islands project built into our cash flow forecast. but we do have some upside beyond what we're guiding for what is baked in, and similar for the refinery project. at this point in time, we don't have a projection of when that will be resolved. so that would also provide upside to our guide for this coming year.
and the additional point again, this gets to our capital allocation as those items are resolved and they provide upside to our cash flow, we would view that capital has being deployed against our stated intentions in terms of buying back stock.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then, just diving in on the capital allocation plan as we move out over the next few quarters. clearly ended 4q well within the aecom net leverage target, but i think you guys are still above that 3 times threshold on a gross basis. but i'm just trying to get a sense for when we, kind of, move from deleveraging to buybacks. how much more debt do you guys want to pay down before buyback start to take priority?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so i think, we certainly were pleased in the quarter to achieve our net leverage target in the down to 2.2 with the record quarter that we had in the fourth quarter. but we're just not yet ready to pre-empt our plans with public comments on specifics about a buyback in giving the market exact timing and quantity and price. but we will have a substantial opportunity to deploy the expected net proceeds from the management services deal.
as troy noted in his remarks earlier, we've got some timing considerations on sources and uses of cash this year. so certainly on day one after the transaction, we will be expected to be paying down our debt and developing a plan to repurchase of a substantial number of shares, consistent with the capital allocation priorities that we've previously talked about, which is keeping our net debt ratio in that 2 to 2.5. but we will -- we don't want to pre-empt the market on the exact timing.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then last quick one for me, just on the simplification program, exiting more than 30 countries, what kind of percent completion are we had on that process right now? and do you think we might have to see more impairment charges as you sort of rationalize some of those more exotic locations?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
so we're about 50% of the way complete with exiting those 30 countries. we are doing them very carefully. we have got work -- we've got client commitments in some of those places that we're winding down. i don't anticipate impairment charges on those countries that we're working on. but we will continue to look for opportunities to simplify this organization over time. we want to ensure that we are spending our management's time and energy focused on the highest-margin, lowest-risk, highest-growth markets and not getting distracted by some of these small countries that we're currently operating. and so they'll be continued opportunities for us to get more and more focused on the biggest and best opportunities, so that we can extract the highest margin from the work that we're delivering.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. i appreciate the time. i'll turn it over.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. thanks, sean.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael dudas with vertical research. your line is open.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen. mike, as you -- and i'm sure we'll talk more about it in december at the investor day, but as you look at the pro forma restructured professional services business, dcs and cs, any thought on where you'd add more talent and more investment relative to returns on each of those businesses? or are we just looking at it as one holistic business, where there's opportunities that just come about? how best to think about when we're looking over the longer term? how the cs or the cm business can contribute to aecom longer term?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so those businesses are in markets where we have a very strong competitive position. we continue to constantly look for opportunities that line up with higher growth markets and our skills and services. and so, one of those you saw this year, we saw an opportunity in the aviation space, where we saw an aviation market in north america that look to be about to move into a very expansionary time. and so we dedicated a lot of our business development dollars in that market and achieved, i think the last number i saw $8 billion or so of wins in that space. and so, we'll continue to look at markets to provide outsized growth opportunities, so that we can get focused, and there are a number of those. they may change from time to time.
you've heard us talk about the pfas opportunity. that is a really strong opportunity. there is expected to be billions of dollars spent to decontaminate soils from that toxic mass. and so, we still -- in our core markets, the transportation continues to be a good market. we're seeing, as i mentioned earlier, gas tax increases and special funds for transportation across the big markets in which we operate. and as well as water markets have some pretty good opportunity and it lines up well with our skill set. so there's plenty of opportunity there. we just want to make sure that we are focused on the biggest growth areas with the highest margin and the least amount of risk.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
and following up, mike, thinking about the at-risk business and your intention to monetize or to de-risk the business, are you working off like lost projects or sub-optimal projects, are you going to not take on as many bookings relative to what you're burning off? or is that still, kind of, be in a flux? because you're trying to keep the business realistic at a good level to monetize. and is there a timing issue? i'm sure the timing is probably a lot longer than you would have thought six months ago. but is it six months, nine months or is it just whenever things when the market comes back you can monetize?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, i don't want to put a real specific timeline on it, michael. but as i said earlier, those businesses are performing well today, and we're not going to give them away. but every project we look at, we're managing the risk reward balance. and it's -- i wouldn't say we're working off big problem projects or anything. nothing is ever perfect on every project, but i wouldn't say we're working off of a number of large problem projects. but we'll continue to focus on ensuring that we are in the market to maintain the value inherent in those assets to offer them to a buyer when the right buyer comes along at the right price.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thanks, mike. see you next month.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jamie cook with credit suisse. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good morning. nice quarter. i guess, just two follow-up questions, mike. when we think about the margin opportunity in dcs or professional services broadly and you think about your ability to achieve the longer-term margin target. is it just a function of the cost cutting that you've already done or is the contracted backlog that you've been booking more reason is? or the margin opportunities within backlog also higher that we could see some potential upside?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i think, jamie, there is a couple of pieces there. one is just ensuring that we are more focused on the markets to give the most opportunity for margin. so some markets just simply offer better as sold[phonetic] margins than others. and so making sure that we're deploying our resources in those markets that deliver the higher margin projects when you sell them. the second piece of it is continuing to look for opportunities to scale up the business without increasing the costs and to continue to reduce our costs as troy mentioned earlier. but it is that -- what i mentioned the opportunity to utilize the global design centers, our global business service centers at a much more rapid pace that will present opportunities for continued margin expansion. so it's a little bit of all of that, jamie. i can't say it's one or the other, but it's a combination of all of those.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. and then can you just comment -- obviously, the bookings within dcs have been very strong. i mean, throughout the year you're going through this exercise. do you think sort of the backlog and growth rate can continue at the pace that you have then just given the opportunities that are out there? or is it -- i guess, just because of working that's going on internally it need to be perhaps the order backlog growth rate slows a bit before it starts to get back to a more normalized trend? thank you.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i don't want to try and forecast future wins. but we have had a really good track record of growing that backlog over the past couple of years. and i don't want to suggest that our construction management business is going to have another year of almost 50% growth in backlog that might be a bit too much to expect. so i think that was an abnormal year. but i did mention the 1.2 book-to-burn in our professional services business, which feels pretty good. so we're still seeing market opportunities in front of us, and i don't see that changing. it's certainly in the near term.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, jamie.

our next question comes from andrew wittmann with baird. your line is open.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst`
great. thanks. i want to ask a couple more questions on cash flow here from the skeleton balance sheet you gave us. we've got cash, accounts receivable and the working capital changes here. it looks like on the liability side of the ledger, you've increased the liability. troy, can you talk about what the payables balance was at the end of the year and how that change sequentially?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, andy. and so, year-over-year -- just first of all, in terms of talking about total working capital, our total working capital over the course of the year was effectively a use of cash. so in aggregate it was a use of cash. in terms of the course of the year, we saw our receivables balances increase and we saw our payables and the -- and accrued liabilities increase by almost a commensurate amount. and as i said a little bit earlier, the one thing that impacted at the end of the year was affected. we had the timing of our year-end. the fact is that we've payments going out the door in september 30th and with a september 27th year end we did benefit from the timing of that, and it was about $50 million.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst`
got it. what was the payables balance at the end of the year?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
i don't have the payables balance. so i'll have to share that with you.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst`
okay. i guess on the -- you mentioned that the some of the receivables that you sale -- that you previously sold are going to unwind in 2020. presumably, that has to do with the credit facility that had i think a governor on the maximum amount that you could do on that. i think last quarter you finished about $369 million on that. i was just wondering, should we assume that the size of the reduction in the amount that you're allowed to sell a receivable is commensurate with the reduction in the ebitda that the company is going to be generating next year after the ms sale? is that kind of a good way of thinking about what that unwind could be in terms of dollars?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
andy, i'll -- no, i'll tell you, think about a little bit differently, which is -- we have programs that within the business that we have been selling receivables for the last four years, and those programs have been running plus-or-minus $50 million for last two years at about the same level. as we exit the management services business, we have been selling that receivables within that business. with the sale of business, we'll no longer have that opportunity and those sales will effectively unwind.
but what we'll be doing is, replacing that with programs in the remainder of the business. so when you think about the kind of the program that we have, it's not dependent upon ebitda. it's just dependent upon us and actually putting a additional program in place to replace the one that was currently in our management services business. so there certainly will it be an impact in the year. i view it as a timing impact as we move out of one program and into another in another place in the business.
and andy, to answer your other question, the right side of the balance sheet, the ap and accruals, over the course of the year increased by about $400 million.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst`
okay, that's helpful. and then my last question, i guess is for mike. there's been a lot of talk about buyback. you've been talking about that for a long time. but i was just wondering if a dividend is in the conversation at the board level as another option and how serious you would consider that as a deployment of capital?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
it's always in the consideration, and it's just a matter of timing. right now, we feel pretty good about the opportunities to buy our stock back and so that would be a matter of first importance for us. and then at some point, we may certainly consider dividend. but it is something that we at the board level talk about quite a bit when we go through our capital allocation plans on a year-by-year basis. but it's definitely something that could be a possibility in the future.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst`
perfect. thank you very much.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer

our next question comes from steven fisher with ubs. your line is open.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning. one of you guys -- i guess, troy could walk through some of the puts and takes to margins in construction services in 2020? should we be thinking the higher than where we are holding in the fourth quarter and how does some of these p3 projects like jfk effect the margins for that segment?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
so if we're talking about the construction services segment in its entirety, we wouldn't see the margins changing in that business in 2020. however, again we're taking that business and we're thinking about it in two components; one is, construction management and the other is in the at-risk businesses. if you think about the construction management business, and i think that's where the work at the jfk terminal is. the margins that we're thinking about in that business again, we described in nsr basis, are in the mid teens. so as we move forward with our professional services business we will be reporting net service revenues and net service revenue margins and the margins across that business will be in the kind of the 11.5% range we expect in the coming year in aggregate.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then, i guess, maybe mike, if you could talk a little bit about the status of the private sector markets in particular? i heard you talk a lot about state funding and robust infrastructure opportunities. i'm wondering if you could just talk about what some of the trends you're seeing in the private sector markets particularly in the us.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so our largest private sector component is in the construction management business, and you heard me mention earlier that our backlog in that space was up almost 50% this year. and so, we continue to see a very robust opportunity for that type of work. so it feels -- still feels pretty good. we've been saying for quite some time that we don't see that kind of growth in backlog increasing forever. but it just keeps coming. and so right now, we're not seeing signs of a slowdown on that side of the business.
and the other big component of our private sector business is the environmental engineering business, and that work is not necessarily driven by capex or new developments. most of the work that we do is heavily driven by regulatory demand. the increase in regulatory requirements for environmental cleanup. i mentioned the pfas opportunity earlier. those continue to present opportunities for us to continue to grow in that space.
and then of course, the other pieces of the private sector business we are divesting from components of that when we divest our at-risk construction business.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
okay and then just lastly, i know mike, you have talked about and answered some questions about moving to higher margin type businesses -- putting our focus on higher margin things within dcs. i guess, to what extent -- to achieve that are you going to be focusing more on increasingly technical type services because it seems like that's a popular approach at enhancing valuations. i'm wondering, if there are specifically technical areas. i mean, you mentioned things like pfas. is that an area where you really do explicitly want to increase your exposure?
randall a. wotring -- chief operating officer
yeah. so, this is randy. just to play the context, as mike indicated, we're not going to be doing everything for everybody anywhere. so just the fact that we will be focused on markets that are higher margin will give us a leg up in increasing margins on a go-forward basis. that said, we are making significant investments in digital transformation activities and we expect that those will lead to increased margins as well as our focus on shared service centers that were previously mentioned. global business, shared services and our global design centers, which also allow us to implement digital transformation on an accelerated basis.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chad dillard with deutsche bank. your line is open.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everyone.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, chad.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, chad.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
so i just want to go back to the guidance for dcs of up-single-digit revenue growth. and i just wanted to understand, just what's embedded in there. i was hoping you can maybe in, kind of, a couple of different ways, domestic versus international, public versus private, what are you seeing there? how big is the pipeline opportunity? any color there will be helpful. thank you.
randall a. wotring -- chief operating officer
sure. so the dcs business, we'll see slightly more growth in the americas, then you'll see outside the us. we will see low-single digits in emea. we're still waiting for the brexit resolutions that has frozen up some projects in capex in that market. so we're not seeing a big growth opportunity there of a low-single digits. apac is a mixed bag. some markets are doing really well and some are not. we're seeing markets like hong kong, where you're not going to see organic growth, you're going to see organic decline as the protests there continue to worsen. so when you put all those together, you get to a low-to-mid single-digit opportunity for growth in fy 2020.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
that's helpful. and then on the operating cash flow, just given that there are a number of moving parts through the year, like how should we think about the cadence of cash flow first half versus second half? how should we think about that build? yes, that's it.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. so, chad, i'm going to start a little higher level and work down to some of the detail. but when you think about our year in terms of the underlying performance, we gave the guide for the enterprise as $600 million to $800 million. again, we see that the earnings growth contributing to that. we also will have a cash tax headwind that we haven't had in the past year. so, getting to that -- getting within that range earnings performance -- underlying earnings performance has improved with a similar cash conversion profile and a tax headwind.
when you look at the elements of the year, obviously, there is a timing of events that would impact that to make this a little more challenging. first of all, it's the timing of the management services sale. the timing of that will have an impact on full-year free cash flow. then if you look at the at-risk businesses, which we expect to generate cash flow during the year, but the nature of those businesses means that it's a little bit lumpier than our professional services business. the timing of some things that might happen in that business also impact the free cash flow guide for the year.
and then the other elements to that, as we pointed out, are the restructuring. we see some cash in first half of the year being spent on restructuring. and then as those business -- as the divestitures take place, the stranded costs and the cost of restructuring for stranded costs will be impacted, the timing will be impacted by that. and then the last thing is the sale of our receivables in our management services program. as management services leaves, we'll have to replace that program from other places in the business, and that will also impact the timing.
so unfortunately, that's not a great answer for you, chad. but our underlying cash from the business remains -- our ability to generate remains similar. but there are a lot of moving parts in the year that make it difficult for us to guide very specifically.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got you. that's okay. thank you very much. i'll pass it on.
operator
thank you. and i'm currently showing no further questions at this time. i'd like to turn the call back over mike burke for closing remarks.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, operator. so before we conclude the call today, i just want to reiterate a few takeaways from today's call. two years ago, we embarked on a very deliberate process to transform our business and position us for long-term success and of course, to maximize shareholder value. as part of this journey, we said our top priority was delivering on our commitments and achieving our plan. in fiscal 2019, we clearly did that with 13% growth in our ebitda, a 25% growth in ebitda in our professional services business. we also said that we were going to substantially enhance our margins in the fourth quarter. we delivered 190 basis points of margin expansion in the dcs segment, and we are quite well poised to continue on that trajectory in fiscal 2020.
we also said, we are going to evaluate our portfolio to unlock value. and last month we announced the sale of our management services business at a premium valuation that's going to allow us to accelerate our capital allocation plans. we also said that we were going to de-risk our business and transform us into a higher returning and lower-risk professional services business. and as i mentioned earlier, we have exited several of our non-core oil and gas businesses. we sold our international development business. we're about 50% complete with the exit from 30 countries that i mentioned earlier.
and finally, we said we are going to prudently allocate our capital. and we had our fifth consecutive year of free cash flow in excess of $600 million. we bought back $75 million of stock last quarter at a very strong discount, and we substantially reduced our debt. so as a result, we are exceptionally confident in our ability to position the company for tremendous growth opportunities in front of us.
and i look forward to discussing these trends and the vision for our company in greater detail at our investor day in december. we'll be joined by this team, as well as steve morriss and lara poloni, the two executives that lead our americas and emea businesses, respectively. and we'll be happy -- they'll be sharing overviews of their business and some of the market trends that they're seeing on the ground.
and then finally, we'll showcase several innovations such as our augmented and virtual reality products that demonstrate how we are differentiating ourselves in the market. so we're looking forward to it, and i hope to see all of you in new york next month. thank you.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the aecom fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. at this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. after speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, will gabrielski, vice president, investor relations. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
will gabrielski -- vice president , investor relations
thank you, operator. i would like to direct your attention to the safe harbor statement on page 1 of today's presentation. today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about future business and financial expectations. actual results may differ significantly from those projected in today's forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, including the risks described in our periodic reports filed with the sec. except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
we are using non-gaap financial measures in our presentation. the appropriate gaap financial reconciliations are incorporated into our presentation where available, which is posted on our website. all percentages in today's discussion refer to year-over-year progress except as noted. organic growth is presented on a year-over-year and constant-currency basis and is adjusted to exclude impacts of non-core businesses and planned and actual dispositions.
i should note, we will now refer to our building construction business as the construction management business, consistent with the professional services nature of the work. we will refer to our professional services business in our presentation, which is comprised of the design and consulting services segment, the construction management business and aecom capital. adjusted ebitda for these businesses exclude stranded cost associated with planned separations and divestitures, which are expected to be eliminated.
historical professional services financial metrics reflect our current estimates based on information available as of the date of this presentation. the final figures may differ materially from these preliminary amounts due to the completion of our financial closing procedures, final adjustments and other developments that may arise between the date of this presentation and the time the recast quarterly results are finalized.
we believe adjusted ebitda for the professional services business provides additional insights into business performance by excluding the results of planned business divestitures. however such estimates are forward-looking statements and are inherently uncertain. as such, you should not place undue reliance on such statements as actual results may differ materially. reconciliation of adjusted ebitda for the professional services business for fiscal 2020 to the most directly comparable gaap measure is not available without unreasonable effort, because the company cannot predict with sufficient certainty all of the components required to provide such a reconciliation at this time.
today's call includes discussion related to the previously announced sale of the management services business, which has not yet been completed and includes potential risks and uncertainties, including that the transaction does not close or the closing may be delayed.
finally, i should note that fiscal 2020 is a 53-week period.
beginning today's presentation is mike burke, aecom's chairman and chief executive officer. mike?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, will. welcome, everyone. joining me today are troy rudd, our chief financial officer and randy wotring, our chief operating officer. i will begin with a discussion of aecom's results and the trends across our business, including an update on the strategic actions we are executing that have resulted in a substantial increase in shareholder value. then troy will review our financial performance and outlook in greater detail before turning the call over for a question-and-answer session.
please turn to slide 3. fiscal 2019 was a successful year for aecom on several fronts. first, we exceeded our expectations on nearly every key financial metric. adjusted ebitda grew by 13%, and we delivered a fifth consecutive year of free cash flow in excess of $600 million, including record cash flow in the fourth quarter. importantly, our professional services business delivered an even stronger 25% adjusted ebitda growth rate.
second, through the sale of the management services business at a premium valuation we unlocked substantial shareholder value. the expected cash proceeds will transform our balance sheet, enable us to accelerate stock repurchases at a highly attractive price under our existing authorization.
third, the restructuring actions we have taken and continue to take are resulting in record profitability, including an all-time high dcs margin in the fourth quarter and for the full year. with the additional actions we are taking to enhance profitability, we reiterated our expectation to achieve an 8% dcs margin in fiscal 2020. on a net service revenue basis that excludes pass-throughs. this translates to an approximately 11.5% margin, which is consistent with our peers.
finally, we are winning work at a strong pace and backlog remains near an all-time high at $60 billion. as our fiscal 2020 guidance confirms, we expect another year of strong adjusted ebitda growth, including our expectation for 12% adjusted ebitda growth in our professional services business, supported by a 19% backlog growth in fiscal 2019. all of these accomplishments in our positive outlook for fiscal 2020 are the results of our deliberate and focused efforts we began executing two years ago to enhance shareholder value.
please turn to slide 4. we have been steadfast in our commitment to enhance profitability and to fully capitalize on our near-record backlog. we executed a $225 million restructuring plan during 2019, and we announced additional restructuring actions in august. as a result, we continue to expect to achieve a greater than 210 basis point increase in dcs margin by 2020 compared to fiscal 2018 supported by the already achieved 120 basis point increase in fiscal 2019.
we are evaluating additional opportunities for further margin upside. these include further investments in best cost shared service centers and global design centers to lead our industry in delivering work consistently and efficiently. additionally, we are focused on improving return on capital and return on management time. this includes continued progress on our plan to exit more than 30 countries, where we are nearly 50% complete.
we are continuing to evaluate our entire portfolio to ensure we are investing in markets that are aligned with our strategic and financial priorities. we are also making progress on our commitment to de-risk our business. the alliant combined cycle gas power plant is expected to achieve substantial completion on time, later this year. in addition, we have divested several lower returning businesses over the past two years, including our international development business and numerous oil and gas businesses that were not aligned with our strategic and financial priorities.
as we continued to pursue the exit from our remaining self-perform construction businesses we are managing our risk reward profile on this work to maximize the ongoing value and attractiveness of these businesses to third parties. we are committed to an end state goal of nearly zero at-risk self-perform construction exposure.
finally, last month we announced the sale of the ms business for $2.405 billion at a premium valuation, which is expected to close in the second quarter. the sale unlocks value much sooner than the proposed spin-off and create certainty for all stakeholders. this transaction will generate substantial cash proceeds, which we will deploy to reduce debt and repurchase our stock and what we view as a substantial discount to professional service peers in our estimate of intrinsic value.
please turn to slide 5 for a discussion of our business trends. beginning in our professional services business in the dcs segment, performance was strong in 2019. this was highlighted by record profitability in our largest market, the americas, where we are benefiting from efficiency gains and favorable market conditions in both the us and canada. state and local clients continue to operate with healthy budgets and record rainy-day funds.
in addition, over the past year, five states faced in gas tax increases, underscoring our clients' focus on funding critical infrastructure. importantly, bipartisan support for infrastructure investment remains strong. we are also delivering growth in our work for federal clients, where we support a number of agencies and have a growing pipeline. conditions in canada are similarly strong. we are executing on several large transportation projects in the region and delivered double-digit revenue growth for the year, led by our leading transportation franchise.
turning to our international markets. we delivered solid results in the emea region, led by large wins in saudi arabia and growth in the uk. across the region, profitability is benefiting from the actions we have taken to more efficiently deliver work and to extract ourselves from lower returning market. with brexit now delayed until, at least, january, we are closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment to ensure our business is resilient across a range of potential outcomes.
importantly, the uk government remains committed to supporting economic growth in his prioritizing infrastructure investments to address potential economic weakness. we maintain a leading position that allows us to capitalize on these opportunities. in the asia-pacific region, the macro economic backdrop is a mixed but execution remains strong. geopolitical uncertainty and a slowing rate of economic growth in hong kong is balanced against public sector investment in australia, resulting in stable growth across the region.
profitability is benefiting from a sharp focus on execution and operating efficiencies.
pivoting to the construction management business. execution was strong, which led to a substantial increase in profitability. our backlog increased by 45% and we are pursuing a robust pipeline of larger opportunities. the year was highlighted by our selection to deliver the new terminal one project at jfk airport in new york city, demonstrating both our strength in the aviation market and our leadership position in new york. as a result, our backlog represents nearly four years of annual revenue, and we expect revenue and profit growth in 2020 and beyond.
in management services, we delivered 12% revenue growth, which reflects the successful growth investments, we've made and strong market trends. the strength of this platform was evident in the premium valuation we realized as part of last month's announced sale.
across aecom execution in 2019 was stellar across a number of key financial and strategic initiatives. we are continuing to make progress on our transformation into a higher-returning and lower-risk professional services business, where we are energized by our performance in 2019, including 25% adjusted ebitda growth and 19% backlog growth. this momentum underpins our expectations for another year of double-digit growth this year. we remain focused on capitalizing on the opportunity to further enhance the value in 2020 as we continue to deliver against our commitments.
i will now turn the call over to troy, who will discuss the quarter in more detail.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, mike. please turn to slide 7. we delivered a number of financial and strategic accomplishments in fiscal 2019, including exceeding our expectations on nearly all of our financial targets. before reviewing our performance in greater detail, i want to discuss a few financial impacts associated with the strategic actions we have taken and continue to take to maximize value.
first, we recognized a $588 million non-cash impairment to goodwill associated with the at-risk self-perform construction businesses in the fourth quarter. we intend to exit these businesses apart as part of our strategy to derisk the business profile. second, as mike detailed. we continue to take actions during the year and anticipate further actions in fiscal 2020 to enhance profitability. this includes the commencement of restructuring actions in the fourth quarter associated with the margin improvement plan we announced in the third quarter, as well as actions required to eliminate stranded costs.
finally, we expect to report in the first quarter a one-time reduction to equity related to real estate of approximately $125 million from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard. there is no p&l impact from this adjustment, and this is a non-cash item. i will discuss the cash components of these restructuring actions shortly.
please turn to slide 8. in the dcs segment, underlying performance was strong. the adjusted operating margin was 8% in the fourth quarter, which marked a new record and a 190 basis point increase from the prior year. the substantial improvement reflects the benefits from already completed restructuring actions and solid execution. the full-year adjusted operating margin was 7.1%. also a new high for dcs and exceeded our expectations.
for the full year, revenue increased in the low-single digits. we faced a challenging comparison in the fourth quarter due to elevated storm recovery work last year. revenue increased excluding this impact. contracted backlog increased by 6% to an all-time high, led by 8% growth in americas, which supports our expectation for continued growth in 2020. i should note that the growth rates in the first half of 2020 will continue to be impacted by the high volumes of storm recovery work executed in the first half of fiscal 2019. however, growth is expected to accelerate as the year progresses, and we expect to deliver a low-single-digit revenue increase for the year.
please turn to slide 9. organic revenue in the cs segment declined by 3% in the full year. this performance include a decline in the power business, which was expected due to our decision to no longer pursue fixed price combine circle gas power plants. the alliant combined cycle power plant, the only large fixed price new generation project in our backlog is on track to be completed later this year. the adjusted operating margin was 2% for the full year, which was consistent with our expectations. in cs, construction management profitability improved significantly in 2019, and we expect double-digit growth in 2020, supported by a 45% increase in backlog. as a reminder, our construction management business, which comprises approximately 70% of the revenue in this segment, contains a high level of pass-through revenue. on an nsr basis, which excludes these pass-throughs, the adjusted operating margin was 15.2% for the year.
please turn to slide 10. revenue in the ms segment increased by 12% in the year and set a new record. activities on several of our larger projects have now fully ramped up. the adjusted operating margin was 6.5% in the fourth quarter, resulted in a full-year margin of 6.1%, which exceeded our 6% expectation.
please turn to slide 11. fourth quarter operating cash flow and free cash flow were $794 million and $779 million, respectively. both metrics set new records and resulted in full-year free cash flow of $694 million. this is a great outcome and reflects the efforts across the organization to drive cash flow despite continued headwinds from delayed collections for our completed work in the us virgin islands. generating cash is ingrained in our culture, as has demonstrated by the $3.4 billion of free cash flow we have generated since fiscal 2015.
turning to our capital allocation priorities. we will continue to allocate our capital consistent with our commitment to maximize shareholder value. our substantial cash generation in the fourth quarter enabled $413 million of debt reduction. and our net leverage ratio exiting the fourth quarter was 2.2 times. this is within our target range of 2 to 2.5 times. in addition, we repurchased $75 million of stock during the year at an average share price of $31 and have $760 million remaining under our $1 billion authorization. the sale of the ms business is expected to close in the second quarter. we expect to allocate cash proceeds to debt reduction, consistent with our leverage goals and to execute share purchases. with our expectations for continued growth and our transformed leverage profile, we continue to expect to allocate available free cash flow to repurchases thereafter, as we continue to believe our stock trades at a substantial discount to a fair estimate of intrinsic value.
please turn to slide 12. we are reiterating our fiscal 2020 guidance. we expect enterprise adjusted ebitda of $1,060 million at the midpoint, which includes 12% growth for our professional services business, excluding any impacts from the sale of the ms business, our plan to exit from at-risk self-perform construction. and on a consolidated basis, we would have expected to generate free cash flow within our $600 million to $800 million range. this would have reflected both our expectation for continued earnings growth, lower interest expense and the expected increase in cash taxes.
however, a few variables may impact our cash flow this year. first, we expect to receive approximately $2.2 billion of net proceeds from the ms sale in the second quarter, and we will continue to pursue the items associated with the $150 million of contingent purchase price, which would substantially add to available cash for capital deployment.
second, we expect a cash use of between $160 million and $180 million for restructuring activities. there are two main drivers of this cash use. the first is the additional restructuring actions we announced in the third quarter to further increase margins. this plan is focused on driving real estate efficiencies and increased usage of the best cost design and shared service centers. the second is the elimination of stranded costs associated with the management services business and the planned divestitures of at-risk self-perform businesses.
third, we expect the ms sale to close in the second quarter, likely at a point in the year when year-to-date cash flow is typically negative. as such, full-year cash flow will be impacted because we don't benefit from ms cash flow as the year progresses.
finally, there will be a headwind to cash flow from the elimination of receivables that we had sold within the ms portfolio. this will negatively impact cash flow in the short term. however, we intend to replace this program over time with other receivables from the professional services business.
we're not ready yet to provide formal cash flow guidance. we will provide the details on fiscal 2020 cash flow at our investor day on december 10th in new york city.
looking ahead, we are confident in the direction of the business. our professional services business is expected to deliver double-digit ebitda growth in fiscal 2020 and is expected to convert adjusted ebitda to unlevered free cash flow at a greater than 75% rate on a normalized basis. this strong cash flow profile creates continued opportunities to deploy capital to repurchase stock and to enhance shareholder value.
with that, we will now turn the call over for q&a. operator, we are ready for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of andrew kaplowitz of citi. your line is open.
andrew kaplowitz -- citigroup inc -- analyst
hey. good morning guys.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
good morning andy.
andrew kaplowitz -- citigroup inc -- analyst
mike or troy, it's interesting to see your new segment because while you're americas nsr at 16.6% is very good, margin is very good. international nsr 4.7% as you've said has lots of room for improvement. so could you give us more color into how and why your international margin is so low versus americas? and could you talk about where you think international margin should be? and then how quickly it could get there given the consolidation of your geographic footprint, the additional restructuring you're doing?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
andy let me start off with that and i will turn it over to randy. i think you correctly point out the opportunity for improvement that we see outside the us, and a big part of that is due to the wide distribution we've had across 150 different countries. we've announced the exit of 30 of those that were under way on. we're not stopping there, we're continuing down that path. we're just simply in too many places and when you start distributing your efforts in that many places, it has an impact on margins. and so as we begin -- as we continue to refocus our energies in content -- in a concentrated way in the major markets, we see a significant opportunity for increased margins. but i'll let randy take you -- into a little more detail on that.
randall wotring -- chief operating officer
hey, andy. so we are committed to driving profitability across the organization and we've been successful in the americas and many of the actions we are taking will benefit the international business. and as you can see we've had a 210 basis point improvement from last year, but there is a big gap and we're focused on that. today we have realignment of our strategy, our business model and execution. we're laser focused on higher margin, higher growth markets, as mike said, simplifying the business and getting the leverage of our organization from a size and scale standpoint. there is no sacred cows. you heard troy talk at the investor day about the expanded review of geographies and business lines and the continued push to deliver our work more efficiently.
we are having successes. successes the frameworks we've won in the uk are producing results and positions us well for post brexit investments in the uk. we've also won large projects in saudi, where our scale and city planning capabilities are an advantage. and as noted in the prepared remarks, profitability in the uk is still suffering from brexit, but simply normalizing would add 100 basis points to our international margins. so look, we have the plan, the roadmap and the international leadership team to drive a better result over time, and we're confident we'll do that.
andrew kaplowitz -- citigroup inc -- analyst
thanks for that guys. and then obviously there are some other topics of conversation, and aecom don't have much to do with the quarter. so let me just ask, can you give an update on the new ceo search to the extent you guys can? and then giving you haven't picked a new ceo yet, you're sitting now on a significant amount of cash, which would seem to make you more attractive to a potential suitor. can you talk about your appetite for potential m&a transaction with a potential suitor?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
so i'll take those in reverse order andy. i think as we said, we're not going to comment on speculation in the market about mergers or acquisitions. so, i'll pass on that one. but with regard to appointing my successor, the board has put together a search committee, that search committee has been working actively to identify both internal and external candidates. that process is under way. and as soon as we have something to announce there, we will. but, i think we're all very confident that the company is positioned well for a new leader to take us even further heights. so things are all on track in the right way on that front.
andrew kaplowitz -- citigroup inc -- analyst
all right. i tried on that one. troy just real quickly on the new model. i mean you're dcs business you suggested tough comparisons in the first half '20 with hold growth down, but for the year, you record low single-digit growth for the year. i would assume that same general pattern will hold new americas segment including the construction management related revenue, whereas your international segment could act a little definitely. anymore color there would be helpful.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes, sure, andy. so you're exactly right and the point you made is we do expect the growth to ramp over the beginning of the year. as we said back at investor day, we saw modest growth in the first quarter of the year. so we're in -- we're kind of on track with where we expect it to be. and again, growth in the second half of the year is going to be driven by the improvement in our contracted backlog across our design business, in particular in the americas, our contracted backlog in that business is actually up 27% year-on-year.
and then also, as we highlighted during the discussion there are just a lot of opportunities in the marketplace. and so we don't typically talk about this, but our pipeline is also up almost 10% from where we've seen it last year. so we certainly feel good about the prospects for growth as we continue through the year. one other point is to think about -- when we talk about growth, there is a difference between, what i'm going to call as good growth and there is also a comment in there about where we should be shrinking. because we're focused on growing in markets where we have the highest return on invested capital opportunities are in those businesses.
and then we're trying to shrink or decline in markets where we see the lower opportunities. so within our 1% there is actually good news buried in that, which is we are growing in the higher returning markets and shrinking at a lower returning markets. so, sometimes you get to just sort of take that modest growth with a grain of salt, we're focused on creating better growth in the business and you can see that coming through in margins.
andrew kaplowitz -- citigroup inc -- analyst
all right. thanks guys.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, andy.

thank you, guys and thanks for taking my question. just to just to kick off, declaring the $100 million and 300 million of free cash flow. does that include the fema collection and refinery receivable in your guidance? and can you help us just with the cadence of the free cash flow through the year. obviously, q1 was soft and you explained the rationale for that. but i'm just curious, is there should be anything we should keep an eye on as we move to q2 and beyond on that $100 million to $300 million number?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. so first of all, we don't see any change in the seasonality in the business. if you recall in the past, typically we see 10% to 20% of free cash flow in the first half of the year. the remainder coming in the second half of the year. that doesn't change. and there are a number of factors underlying that that remain consistent. but in terms of the guide itself the $100 million to $300 million, we do see a significant amount of collections coming through usvi, certainly not all of it. and to remind you, we had $200 plus million invested in net working capital in that project. we have not collected any. but we do see ourselves collecting that in q2 and through the rest of the year. and in terms of the refinery project you spoke of, we don't have any recovery in our guidance today. so that would be upside to that number.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you. and just, we were talking about the successor process. is the successor contingent on executing your capital allocation strategy and your buyback strategy with time to that. and just to be clear, you guys had a very detailed analyst day. you provided 2021 targets. is it, our understanding that anyone who does come on board as a successor is signing off on what the board has agreed to as the capital allocation strategy?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
let me touch on that one. it's, the board has made a decision on capital allocation very clearly and troy has stated it very well. and so the successor would clearly be required to follow the board's decision on that point. and so i don't see any change at all on that point, the board is firmly committed and as well as the current management team are very firmly committed to executing against that plan.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay. thank you. then just lastly, like your quarter-ended december 31. you said -- you made a couple of comments about the backlog award activity in january. just anything you want to touch on with the virus an impact. and any of your exposure out there and what you're seeing? thank you.
randall wotring -- chief operating officer
well, i'm sorry, go ahead.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so you were talking about the...
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
coronavirus.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
the virus, yeah. so we have not seen any direct impact on aecom yet, either in our asia-pacific region or elsewhere, but certainly we have our safety and resilience teams very focused on that. we have isolated number of employees in greater china that are affected by certain quarantines but not directly by the virus itself. we have proactively directed our employees across the greater china region to work from home until at least february 6, and we will continue to evaluate that guidance as we start to see things hopefully normalize after people returning from their travels around the chinese new year holidays. but as we look ahead, we currently don't expect this to have any material impact on our business. just to put it in perspective, the greater china area is a single-digit percentage of our net service revenue, but we don't see an impact currently, but if we do see any change to that we'll be certainly -- we'll certainly let you know.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
perfect. thanks guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jamie cook of credit suisse. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good morning. i guess a couple of questions. one, obviously the ebitda growth in the quarter were strong at 27%. i know for the full year, i think you're expecting 12%. but given your bullish commentary and the backlog opportunity, just trying to understand why we didn't increase the guide or why would growth be moderating from first quarter levels if there was anything one-time in there. my second question following on andy's, you didn't give a formal target for the americas versus international longer term, but is there any way you can help us with how you're thinking about the margin for each segments at least for 2020. and then my third question, just on capital allocation. obviously, you guys have the proceeds from ms. you're going to pay down the debt. how quickly can we move on a share repurchase. should we assume that we ramp on that fairly quickly? thank you.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. so this is troy, jamie. that was a -- that was a lot. i think you got it all down here. so i'm going to take the first two of your questions. first of all, just on ebitda performance. so we certainly did have a good quarter in terms of performance growing ebitda 27% year-over-year. and we look forward, given the markets that we're in, the backlog that we have and our expectations. we feel very confident about achieving that result for the year. so it's a little early for us in the end of the first quarter to effectively call up our guidance. the best way to describe it is based on that performance, we feel very confident about our ability to deliver on that number for the year again.
and in terms of your targets for margin. so if we look at our us business and compare it to our peer group. i think we can say -- comfortably say, that we believe that is at the head of our class in terms of margins in our americas business. internationally, clearly that is an upside for us and we believe that we will be able to again to come up to where we see some of our peers in terms of international margins, which are -- we see the upside of being low single-digits in terms of margins. we see that slowly improving over the course of the year, and of course, we see that being void by an improvement in our emea market and also stability as we see coming into hong kong and we hope to see that over the course of the remainder of the year. so again we see upside certainly in our international margins which support us achieving that longer-term target. and then i'll let mike take the last question.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, jamie. as you know, we closed the sale of our management services business just on friday of last week. we would expect to use about $1.2 billion of those proceeds to pay down our debt. we would expect to use the remainder of that to repurchase our stock, both the remainder of that as well as cash flow throughout the year. but we expect those stock repurchases to happen in the second half of our fiscal year, which is just on the horizon here.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
you're welcome.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael dudas of vertical research. your question please.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
good morning, everyone. and mike best wishes on your next endeavor.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
so looking at the americas and your backlog growth and your confidence on q2 with some projects, there seems that your backlog cover has grown, you almost three years of cover on your backlog growth to revenues. are the products just getting longer in scale or is the cadence of the bookings going to quicken up here as these budgets and these fundings move through at least from planning stage to execution? and is the mix of americas going forward still going to lean on a percentage basis toward your traditional transportation, water, environmental business, and is there any upside or some activity in the construction management side that could skew the numbers going into '20 and 2021?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
so mike, thanks for the question. i guess first of all, when we look at the backlog, one thing to remember about backlog, even in an design business is, quarter-to-quarter there is some lumpiness to that. so when you look over the course of the last year, you'll see that our total backlog has continued to progress or grown. but there has been a little lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter. what we have seen again is contracted backlog growth in the business and particularly in the americas, which gives us near-term visibility. we have some other awards we're expecting in the second quarter. they're imminent. we expect that will give us longer term visibility.
in terms of the overall makeup of backlog, there isn't a dramatic difference in the lengths or duration of our backlog in our design business. it's remained relatively constant over the course of the last few quarters. so no change there. and then in terms of the mix of business, again we don't see a change in the mix of business. our design business represents approximately 85% to 90% of the overall nsr revenues of the entire professional services business.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, mike, i think, as troy correctly points out you see lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in wins with -- if i go back, looking at since the beginning of 2019, our [technical issues], book win rate over those five quarters and so we're continuing to book more than we burn, but equally important, as you know, we give you transparency to contracted backlog and then awarded backlog, which is the precursor to that, but there's also another precursor to awarded backlog, which is our -- what we call our qualified pipeline. and when i look at our qualified design pipeline, that's up 8.5%. so it's not just the growth in the contracted backlog, americas contracted backlog was up 27% year-over-year. so you're seeing contracted backlog up higher in our highest margin business. you're seeing a 1.3 book to burn over the last five quarters. and then that qualify design pipeline is also quite robust. and so, and it is primarily, transportation americas is the biggest component of that as i think troy pointed out. so, hopefully, that gives you some color on that mike.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
terrific. and just, just to follow up on that. relative to low your high-value engineering, does the global design centers, you mentioned in the prepared remarks, pretty good growth there, is that going to continue. and is that something you can accelerate it, and do you have the capacity to improve that mix in through your -- into your revenue flow and your margins as you book and execute work in your americas business over the next several quarters?
randall wotring -- chief operating officer
hey mike, this is randy. to answer those questions is yes, we saw great growth in the first quarter and over the remainder of 2020, we're planning on seeing north of 25% growth over fy '19. so we have capacity and capability. not only that, but our global design centers allows us to accelerate application of new technologies and innovation. so we're seeing a demand growth for use of our design centers and it's working out well for us.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
thanks gentleman.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from sean eastman of keybanc. please go ahead.
sean eastman -- keybank capital markets -- analyst
hi, team. thanks for taking my questions. i just wanted to go back on cash flow. so we touched on the usvi receivable and refinery claim, but just hoping to get an update on some of the other sort of discrete items here. like, i know there was an opportunity to launch receivable factoring program to help replace the program ms. and then i know now the free cash flow item, but would be great to get an update on the probability we see the contingent consideration brought in the door here in fiscal '20?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. so sean, i guess, i'll try and address those in the order you laid them out. i guess first of all, in terms of discrete items, absent the us virgin islands, our portfolio is a long list of small discrete items. i shouldn't say small but discrete items. so when we balance that overall portfolio of collections, there is nothing else that really stands out that could drive a change in that outcome. the us virgin islands is a thing that's large enough and we call it out because of that. secondly, in terms of the management services program, the answer is yes, we have started to build a new program to put that in place to replace the sale of receivables program with the departure of management services, and that is built into our cash flow guidance. so again, we expect that to contribute over the course of the year.
and then in terms of contingent consideration, i'm not going to speak specifically to the underlying item, but we do feel we've made some progress prior to the sale of management services, and we do have an expectation that collection could be in the next 12 months.
sean eastman -- keybank capital markets -- analyst
okay, great, very helpful. and next one for me is just on the at-risk self performed construction sale process. your comments today seemed like things have moved along a little bit, at least since the december analyst day. so it'd be great to just get a little bit more color on where you guys are out there and hate to paint you into a box, but maybe just an updated target timeline on getting that transaction done. and i'm also just curious on whether it is expected that this will be a single transaction or whether we're looking at potentially two or three separate transactions?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, so let me try and there's a lot of questions there. let me try and give you a quick overview. first of all, we are firmly committed to extracting ourselves from all of our at-risk self performed construction business as we continue to transform ourselves into the higher margin lower-risk professional services organization. we already closed on the oil & gas production services in our international development divestitures. we're more than 50% done with our country exits and we're also moving along on a few possible sales of the other businesses. but i think as we've said in the past, it is not a great time to be trying to sell construction-related assets. and we are not going to give that business away. those businesses are profitable. they have working capital, capital investments that we expect to harvest in the very near term here. but we're continuing to be in the marketplace and attempting to sell those assets, but we're not going to give them away.
i should also note that the alliant plant is nearly complete and we derisk the remainder of our power business. so when we look at the entire construction services portion of our business, it's only about 30% of that is -- about -- i'm sorry, about half of that business is at risk, with the civil business being the biggest profit driver there. so our end state is fairly clear. we continue to have a desire to dispose of those assets as soon as possible. but like i said, we're not going to give them away and rush them to a market that's not receptive to construction assets today as much as we would like.
sean eastman -- keybank capital markets -- analyst
okay. all right, thanks very much for the time.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. thanks, sean.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from chad dillard of deutsche bank. your question please.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi, good morning everyone.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning chad.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
so, you guys mentioned $100 billion in infrastructure opportunities in the uk post brexit. i just wanted to get a sense for how you're thinking about the timing for when you come see the benefits and just talk a bit more about how you're relatively positioned over there and what sort of incremental margin tailwind that could be?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
so, yes, chad. i guess maybe, the best way to explain is just what we've been doing over the last six months, which is we've been incredibly successful winning almost all of the frameworks that we've bid on. and so those are rail and highway projects. so i can't speak to how the infrastructure plan in the uk will roll out. it will take a number of years. but based on how we position ourselves and the work that are weighting of those frameworks it puts us in a great position to participate with that in the long term. so we're seeing again, short-term impacts from the wins in that area. we see that improving over the course of the year. but more importantly we see ourself position so as that infrastructure money is going to be spent, we are well positioned to participate.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i think, chad it's also consistent with our transformation that we've been talking about, as we extracted ourselves from a significant number of countries in continental europe. it allows us to ensure that we've got our best resources focused on those best opportunities for the future in a post brexit environment. so it's not only do we have improving market conditions in the uk, but redeploying our best resources to focus on that opportunity versus what some might say feathering them away in multiple different countries in continental europe.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. and then just going back to the question about at-risk construction and sell that asset. i just want to clarify, are you guys still bidding work within that [indecipherable] and also just, how to think about the glide path of a revenue and margin let's say over the next like two years?
randall wotring -- chief operating officer
yes. so in terms of the at-risk business the answer is within our power business we are not bidding any work that is fixed price at risks construction work. so we discontinued doing that a number of quarters ago, more than a year ago. so we're delivering those. and then the other in terms of our civil construction business, we are continuing to bid work. but again, we're doing it in a way that preserves value but lowers the risk of that profile. so again we're moving away from the types of typical construction projects that you'd see being bid and moving more toward doing some o&m work and working with customers that we're intimately familiar with. so we've not stopped bidding, we are very carefully managing the risk profile of the work that we're taking on in civil as we look to take it to market.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
thanks, i'll pass it on.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from andy wittmann of baird. your question please.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay, great, thanks. so this question was asked earlier on kind of the guidance, obviously very good margin performance in the first quarter and you guys too early to raise for the year and i get that, but i was just wondering was there anything one-time-ish that made what normally would be a seasonally weak quarter for margins particularly strong troy?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
no, no, one-time item. what as improved our margins frankly is the actions that we took beginning in the first quarter of last year and have continued to take to improve those margins. so it's a portfolio effect and it's execution against our plans is what's driven those margins. so nothing that we would call out as a one-time item.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay, great, thanks. and i guess just for modeling purposes everybody is going to have a lot of work here today, but i thought it would be helpful for probably everyone's purposes to just get your thoughts on a couple of the key lines, which are a little bit hard to deduce from information that we currently have. and so the two that stick out to me at least are the corporate segment cost, the unallocated segment costs and what you're thinking about for the year now with the lower base and some of that having been offloaded with ms, and some of moved into discontinued ops in the at-risk construction. in that line, i think in particular would be helpful to have some thoughts on as well as the non-controlling interest line, is actually if fairly big number this quarter. i sense that it, i think around $12 million i think was the number on the income statement. i sense that's probably unusually high. i mean that the actual kind of underlying non-controlling interest line might be less than that. and then, just make sure that nothing has changed in your view on the tax rate. or if you had any comments on interest expense. i know a little bit detail there. but i just think, helpful given that there is a lot of moving pieces this quarter.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
okay. sure. i can certainly answer all four of those items. first of all in corporate segment cost, you should think about it as being consistent with what it's been in the past about $140 million for modeling. nci in the professional services business, about $20 million to $25 million. it was a little higher in the quarter because management services was with us for the entire quarter. and that's typically we've seen most of our nci. tax rate, it's a little bit higher for the quarter, but i would expect it to be consistent with the guidance that we've given over the long-term in terms of tax rate. and interest expense at this point in time, it's a little premature to talk about modeling interest expense. again, we just collected almost $2.2 billion in proceeds from the ms transaction. so clearly paying down $1.2 billion of pre-payable debt and having some cash available to us will change that equation, but i'm not -- i can't give you guidance at this point in time. but i think you can model it out.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
yes. okay, that's fair enough. i'm going to leave it there. thanks guys.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from adam thalhimer of thompson davis. your line is open.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning adam.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis -- analyst
i wanted to ask first, private construction in the us, what do you seeing on the tishman and hunt side and some of the biggest us cities non-res?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so, new york and los angeles, we have about 74 -- also say 75%-ish of our business in those two markets. and what's important that we're seeing there is the diversification away from just commercial real estate. so some of the biggest projects in new york are projects at jfk, the biggest -- some of the bigger opportunities we're still pursuing are -- in addition to the work we've already won at jfk aviation related. los angeles being the sports related activities. so we're still seeing those markets growing very significantly. our book-to-burn in those markets is well above 1. we still have, i think troy mentioned in the prepared comments that we have a few billion dollars of work that we expect to be awarded in q2 here in those markets. you mentioned the key word non-res because the res markets in both of those geographies have been slow for a while, but it's the commercial real estate as well as aviation and sports that are driving it. so we like the diversification away from just corporate real estate, which is part of our strategy of a couple of years ago to make sure we're redeploying our resources so that we have a better diversification, both geographically as well as end markets. but as of right now, there still seems to be a significant demand for real estate in both of those markets.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis -- analyst
okay. good color there. and then i wanted to ask about $100 million to $300 million of free cash flow of the guidance. so that -- just to be clear that excludes the potential $150 million contingent purchase price, excludes the sale proceeds from self-perform construction. and then there was talk at one point of replacing the ms receivables factoring, something in dcs. so that's not in the cash flow guidance either?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
so the simple answer your question is, the first two items are not included in cash flow guidance. so that is -- i think that's fairly clear. in terms of the overall guidance including the replacement of our ms factoring program, our guidance does assume that we will take some actions and replace the current sale of receivables program that exist in ms with something in the dcs business over the next three quarters. so there is some element of that that is included in our guidance.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis -- analyst
understood. okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. at this time, i'd like to turn the call back over to ceo, mike burke for closing remarks. sir?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for participating today. i'd like to make a few comments. just as we reflect on the quarter. i think it's helpful just to think about where we've been. it's almost two years ago that we set out a course for the transformation of this organization. we set out in the past, we said we were going to reduce the risk inherent in the organization. we were going to improve margins, we're going to grow our ebitda, we were going to achieve better focus as we pull out of some of the countries that we're participating in around the world, and we said we're going to unlock value by looking at our portfolio. and here we stand today, we have implemented much tighter risk management protocols across the organization. we have a lower risk business. today, we are continuing to -- on our commitment to exit the at-risk construction markets. we have executed on a 200 basis point improvement in our margins. we are expecting another 100 basis point improvement in fy '20. you saw the results in q1 here with a double-digit growth in our ebitda of 27%. we have -- we are more than 50% complete with the exit from 30 countries and continuing to take a hard look at the additional countries in our portfolio.
we closed friday on our ms transaction that unlocked significant value for the organization and it's reflected in our share price. our share price was up 64% in 2019 and another 12% or so, so far, calendar year-to-date. and so i think we're on the right path here with this transformation of the organization and i think this is just the beginning of the continued transformation and the continued trajectory of the organization. and so thank you all for your support as we've been down this path over the past couple of years and we're excited about the future that sits in front of us. so thank you and have a great day.

beginning today's presentation is mike burke, aecom's chairman and chief executive officer. mike?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, will. welcome everyone. joining me today are troy rudd, our chief financial officer; and randy wotring, our chief operating officer.
i will begin with an overview of our financial and strategic accomplishments and review of market trends. troy will then review our first quarter performance, outlook and trends across the business in greater detail, before turning the call over for question-and-answer session.
please turn to slide 3. we delivered strong first quarter results demonstrating the benefits of the strategic and financial initiatives that we have executed over the past two years to transform aecom into higher returning, lower-risk professional services business. building on last year's momentum, adjusted ebitda increased by 27% in the first quarter and we reiterated guidance for 12% ebitda growth at the midpoint of our 2020 guidance range. key to this growth was another quarter of substantial margin improvement. the adjusted operating margin in the professional services business increased by 230 basis points to 11.7%, building on the 200 basis point increase we delivered in 2019 and consistent with our expectation for the full year.
this outcome reflects strong execution against our plan to drive profitability and create substantial shareholder value. we have executed several initiatives, aimed at reducing overhead, simplifying our business, leveraging our scale through greater utilization of best cost global design and shared services centers and derisking our portfolio. in addition, we strengthened our business and financial profile with the sale of the management services at a premium valuation which closed last week. i want to thank everyone who made this result possible. today, we are a stronger company and we are confident that we will deliver on our stated goal of delivering industry-leading profitability.
we are continuing to win work at a high rate. we had $3.3 billion of wins in the quarter and backlog increased by 2% to $37 billion, which remains at near-record levels. in addition after the quarter ended this momentum continued with several large pursuits moving into the award phase. as a result, we expect backlog to reach a new record in the second quarter. importantly, we are delivering strong results even as trends across our business remain varied.
in the americas nearly every end market we serve grew in the quarter. continued strong support for public infrastructure investments and strong client budgets support our expectation for growth this year. international performance was more mixed. in australia, we are benefiting from continued investment in large transportation projects in our backlog, which contributed to growth in the quarter. however profitability in the uk, our largest international market remains well below prior peak levels. we are optimistic that recent progress on brexit and our commercial successes on a large number of key frameworks position us well for the expected post brexit infrastructure investment surge. and in hong kong, we were negatively impacted in the quarter by ongoing political instability, although we expect better performance as the year progresses.
as we look ahead, i'm confident that the brightest days for our company are yet to come. we have a strong leadership team in place and the most talented workforce in the industry whose extraordinary efforts have been integral to our success. as you know, the board, led by the ceo search committee is actively engaged in identifying my successor to carry the company forward and build on our many successes and accomplishments.
with that i will turn the call over to troy to discuss our financial and strategic accomplishments in the first quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year. troy?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, mike. please turn to slide 5. our first quarter results demonstrate the progress we have made on transforming into a focused and highly profitable professional services business. as mike noted, adjusted ebitda of $173 million increased by 27% from the prior year. in addition, the adjusted operating margin of 11.7% was consistent with our full-year margin target, despite the first quarter typically being our seasonally weakest quarter. these accomplishments are a direct result of the strategic actions we have taken and continue to take to drive strong financial performance. these actions include the already executed $225 million g&a reduction that further aligned our cost structure with our transformation into a more focused professional services organization.
we also continue to simplify the business and prioritize investments where return opportunities are the greatest, including our planned exit for more than 30 countries, which is more than 50% complete. and we continue to review our portfolio to ensure we are delivering profitable growth and returns consistent with our roic goals. in addition, we are progressing with a substantial real estate consolidation. in total, we expect to reduce our real estate footprint by more than 5 million square feet compared to fiscal 2015, including more than 1 million square foot for reduction as part of the current plan. finally, we are leveraging our scale and global delivery capability by driving greater utilization of our best cost shared services and design centers to ensure we are efficiently delivering our work, including a nearly 20% increase in hours delivered through the best cost design centers in the first quarter.
please turn to slide 6. revenue in our americas business declined by 4%. importantly, nsr increased by 2% on an organic basis with strength in our core transportation, water and environment markets, and double-digit growth in construction management, consistent with our expectations for growth this year. the americas business had a 16.6% adjusted operating margin, which marked a 220 basis point improvement over the prior year and was ahead of our expectation for the quarter.
contracted backlog, one of the best indicators of future growth, increased by 27% to a new record in the quarter, driven by several key trends that inspire continued confidence in growth. first, state tax revenues increased by mid single-digits in 2019 and five states implemented gas tax increases in the last year, which are key funding sources for public infrastructure investment. second, building on the theme of strong funding, many states and large metros are proposing plans for substantial infrastructure investment. in our largest us market, new york, governor cuomo, recently unveiled a $275 billion infrastructure plan, which would be the largest statewide plan in us history, and would support the mtas more than $50 billion capital spending plan. we have actively onboarded several key leaders in this market to further strengthen our competitive position.
third, the recently proposed changes to the national environmental policy act demonstrated political focus on accelerating infrastructure investment. for example, the federal highway administration has an approximately $10 billion backlog of projects that have been undergoing environmental assessment for more than a year that would move forward much more quickly under the proposed nepa change. fourth, demand for more innovative solutions continues to rise as resiliency and sustainability remain front of mind with our clients. with our investments in proprietary technologies, many of which we demonstrated at the innovation export on investor day in december, we are ideally suited to capitalize on this demand and lead our industry. finally, the pipeline in the construction management business remains strong and we are pursuing sizable opportunities across our core building, stadia and aviation markets. this includes large expected wins in the second quarter that underpin our expectation for growth in 2021 and beyond.
please turn to slide 7. turning to our international business. while revenue declined slightly, organic nsr was effectively unchanged over the prior year. our adjusted operating margin for the first quarter was 4.7%, a 210 point basis increase over the prior year, with strong performance in australia and results in the uk. trends across our international markets are mixed. our business in the uk, our largest international market is improving. following december's election, the prime minister signed to withdraw agreement from the eu last month, which provides greater certainty in the marketplaces economic condition to steadily improve. in addition, the new government has indicated support for an additional $100 billion of infrastructure investment in its first budget, which would add to our pipeline of opportunities. we have been successful in winning more than 250 frameworks, including key positions for highways england and network rail where we are already winning assignments.
in australia, we extend our sympathies to those impacted by the devastating fires in the region. we are proud of our local teams who have been engaged in their communities to support the recovery efforts. revenue in australia increased during the quarter as large infrastructure projects continued to progress. in hong kong, macroeconomic and political uncertainty impacted our first quarter performance, where we had forecasted a 20% revenue decline for the year. however, our performance was better than we originally contemplated and we'd expect to see further improvement as the year progresses. the long-term outlook for infrastructure spending in hong kong is robust and we retain a leading position in this market.
in the middle east, we are closely monitoring the evolving political tensions. to date we have not experienced a material impact to any of our projects and activity in saudi arabia, our largest middle east market continued to progress as expected. importantly, across the region, the decisive and deliberate actions we have taken to align our portfolio and cost structure with these very trends resulted in a strong year-over-year improvement in profitability, and we expect further margin improvement as the year progresses.
please turn to slide 8. i'd like to spend a moment providing an update on the strategic actions we continue to take. we closed the sale of the management services business last week. following our separation announcement in june, we moved quickly to capitalize on strong market demand for a high-quality asset and realized a premium valuation through a sale. the net proceeds from this transaction will allow us to repay a substantial portion of our outstanding debt and to repurchase stock. we are advancing toward our goal of exiting nearly all at-risk self performed construction businesses by the end of this year, including progress on certain transactions that are advancing toward completion in the coming quarters.
i also want to provide an update on our combined cycle power plant construction project. although we recently encountered a few challenges that resulted in a higher estimated cost to complete, we expect to successfully deliver the state-of-the-art plant to the client in our fiscal second quarter. all these initiatives enable us to operate as a more focused and more profitable company.
please turn to slide 9. operating cash flow was a use of $207 million and free cash flow was a use of $238 million. cash performance across the business was mostly consistent with expectations. however, our cash flow is not significantly impacted by timing delays and management services. all of which we recovered prior to the close of the sale last week. adjusted for this impact, our first quarter cash flow was consistent with our expectation for seasonal cash flow performance. we continue to pursue a large outstanding balance related to our disaster recovery work in the us virgin islands, and we are optimistic that recent positive development support our expectation to collect a large portion of this cash in fiscal 2020. as a result, we are reaffirming our guidance for $100 million to $300 million of free cash flow this year.
turning to capital allocation. net proceeds from the ms transaction totaled $2.2 billion, which does not include approximately $150 million of contingent purchase price. as a result of this transaction, our pro forma net leverage is approximately half a turn. we will use the proceeds to transform our balance sheet, including the immediate repayment of approximately $1.2 billion of pre-payable debt. successful execution of our strategic actions has closed some of the valuation gap between us and our professional services peers. however, our valuation remains at a discount to our estimate of the intrinsic value, and we are committed to returning capital to our shareholders with the remaining $760 million of capacity under our $1 billion board repurchase authorization. we will provide more details on how we will execute these plans once finalized.
please turn to slide 10. we started the year with a strong first quarter on nearly every key metric and leading indicator. our professional services margins are near all time highs. our backlog remains near an all-time high, and nearly every end market is strong or improving. as a result we have reaffirmed our financial guidance for fiscal 2020, included in our expectations for adjusted ebitda of between $720 million and $760 million which would mark a 12% increase from last year at the midpoint of our guidance.
with that, operator, we're now ready for questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of sean eastman with keybanc capital markets. your line is open.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. compliments on the quarter, a strong first half and a really resilient outlook for the year. first question for me is, you guys came into this crisis with a focus on cost and returns. i'm just curious whether there's been a reassessment on the potential for those programs, whether some of those actions can be accelerated or expanded and just to what extent a weaker macro backdrop extends the time line to achieve the financial targets you outlined.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
so sean, let me start off with that, and then i'll let troy kick off any further color on the guidance. but we came into this, we've been working on margin improvement for two years now. and you've seen the dramatic 200 basis point increase over the past couple of years on our margins. we didn't stop when we got through that first tranche, and we're not going to stop as we get through this next tranche of margin improvement opportunities. we don't see any slowdown in achieving the margin targets that we set out previously. we're continuing that work. most of the work is already behind us. and in fact, we're looking at opportunities where there could be consequences of the pandemic that could increase our margins. and specifically, what i'm referring to, as we've gone through the work-from-home remote working process where 90% of our people are working remotely, we have seen an employee engagement that is higher than it was working in the office. so people are enjoying the additional flexibility of working from home, which could in the future allow us to have a lower real estate footprint. and as you probably know, we spend almost $400 million a year on rent. so taking even a 20% reduction in that as we move to a slightly larger remote workforce could be additional opportunities for margin improvement going forward.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. excellent, excellent. go ahead.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sean, it's troy. i was just going to reinforce what mike said, which is what we've experienced is the pandemic is creating opportunities for actually to accelerate some of the trends that were naturally taking place in the marketplace. and one of those is, again, remote working and rethinking your real estate portfolio. so we do see that as a fairly significant opportunity to layer on top of the things that we have already executed on and have planned for the remainder of this year that will benefit this year and into 2021.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and second one for me is just trying to get as comfortable as we can on the swing back in free cash flow to hit the impact outlook for the full year. to the extent you can bridge us back between just underlying aecom free cash flow, any discrete items helping you get back there and then, of course, some of the benefits from some of those stimulus programs that are going to help in the back half as well.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so first of all, in the first half of the year, we had within our guidance, we had predicted a number of the items that have impacted cash flow. particularly those are the items related to the sale of the management services business. as we move into the second half of the year, we've got again a clear line of sight to that range of cash flow. we're highly confident. and it's driven by, first of all, just the earnings performance in the second half of the year. we have a history of converting ebitda to cash flow on a fairly consistent basis. we also, in the second half of the year, have, as we said, a purchase price payment, a working capital adjustment related to the ms transaction that is about $130 million that will effectively catch us up for the first half of the year. and then beyond that, there are the normal things that we typically see in the business. there is just a natural kind of unwind of working capital in the second half of the year based on increased activity. and that's been consistent with the past. and then in terms of what we're seeing as a result of the pandemic and government stimulus, we haven't planned any of the stimulus into our guidance. but we're certainly within the range. the number of programs that we see around the world in terms of payroll tax deferrals, acceleration of government payments, we have a number of our government clients, particularly in australia and the u.k., that have accelerated payments to us and have a plan of continuing to do that through the year. and then there's a number of other programs within australia and canada and the u.k. that will provide deferral of expenses or payment of certain things like taxes that provide a tailwind. so all told, we see there being potentially up to $100 million tailwind just from government programs that would support our view of being within that guidance range.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
sean, was your question relative to stimulus limited to cash flow or was it a broader question?
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
yes. just trying to get comfortable on the second half ramp, and you guys had mentioned there would be some tailwinds there. so i'm good on that one. that was really helpful, troy.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks.
operator
your next question comes from the line of michael dudas with vertical research. your line is open.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
good morning, afternoon, everybody. so mike, you just teed it up. let me hear your thoughts on general stimulus, what comes out. i mean it's amazing how much money has been spent by congress already for this crisis. how do you see that flowing through and how it impacts some of your public sector client base? and then maybe you can drill down a little bit more in your historic work you've done in new york city. certainly, the revenues from the mta and port authority is certainly going to take a big hit here. how does that play through? and how does it impact on what you do and how those agencies use aecom to work through that?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, great. thanks, mike. so the first round of the cares act provided quite a bit of access to capital to the state governments through mostly through lending-type activity. but we're closely following a couple of new developments. one is the second round of the cares act, the economic relief that we're expecting is probably more like a may, june time frame where the governors are asking for an additional $500 billion in aid. the state departments of transportation are asking for about $50 billion of direct funding for transportation in the states. and so we think there will be additional economic relief through cares act, too. and also, there is quite a bit of momentum in washington for infrastructure stimulus. that's probably more like a june or july time frame. but the house democrats are moving forward on a 5-year $760 billion stimulus program. and so when we look at all of those together, it starts to look a little bit like what we saw after the global financial crisis in '07, '08 and '09. and when we look back to '07, '08 and '09, we saw that stimulus activity coming into the market, and we certainly experienced the double-digit organic growth in '07, '08 and '09 as stimulus activity came into the market. and so we are expecting that deficit spending will be the way of the world for the next 12, 24 months. and there's significant momentum to direct that toward infrastructure activity that we will benefit from.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
and about new york area?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, new york is yes, new york is one of the things that you look at the big markets. and half of our state and local spending in the u.s. comes from five states and california, new york, texas the real big ones. and the good news about those states is those states coming into this had significant stabilization and rainy day funds. so they were in the best position coming into the pandemic. so they have a bit of a head start. so we're focused on the right markets that had strength coming into it. and we expect that due to their political clout, they will be the primary beneficiaries of any federal stimulus activity that gets directed toward new york. and one of the things that we hear the new york government agencies talking quite a bit about is this may be an opportunity to accelerate infrastructure spending, the reason being is it's a lot less expensive to undertake infrastructure projects during certainly during a time when there's less traffic, whether it be airport traffic, whether it be mass transit traffic. you can get things done much more efficiently. so there may be an impetus to accelerate some of the infrastructure work in the new york area.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
i appreciate it. and my follow-up for you, mike or troy, is that, can you maybe share a little bit how your customer base is adapting toward the new world that we're in, especially with working remotely and being able to engage from plans that you're sending or in your conference calls or getting documents to your clients in an efficient manner so they can continue to work on their front? is that going to prove any competitive advantage for you guys as you move forward as the customer base i'm thinking more on the public side but maybe even private as well, accelerate and adapt to the changes that we're seeing?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so let me kick that off, and then i'll ask randy to talk about the it investments we've made because it's been such a big facilitator of this. we had been preparing for this for quite some time on the it side. and it became clear that we were able to almost overnight shift 90% of our workforce to a remote working environment. and that turned out to be an incredible differentiator in the market. it wasn't clients weren't willing to wait and see if we could work remotely. they wanted to see that capability immediately, and i think it allowed us to differentiate ourselves quite a bit. and i think it may be the way of working in the future. we have one project right now we're doing down in florida. we have 150 different employees around the world working remotely on a project in florida to get an unemployment center up and running as quickly as possible. it's all being done remotely. it's all being done in a collaborative way. but that didn't happen overnight. it came through significant investments. so maybe, randy, you could give us a little overview on what we've done on the it side.
randall a. wotring -- chief operating officer
thanks, mike. so aecom has really been strategically investing in it infrastructure and digital tools for a lot of years but specifically over the last three years. and even with this significant ramp that we've seen, with more than 90% of our employees, almost overnight, working remotely, our it systems not only performed well but, as mike said, provided us with a differentiator in the marketplace. so all of our employees have videoconferencing capability and extraordinary collaboration tools that allow them to carry on their work. we have put digital tools in the cloud, which certainly enhanced our work-from-home capabilities and the ease of use for our employees. digital tools like autodesk and bentley for design purposes, digital libraries, design anomaly detectors and other tools reside in the cloud, which made it much easier for our employees to work. in addition, aecom brought to the market two proprietary software packages built in emea but imported and tailored to u.s. requirements. the first is the virtual consultation software that mike talked about that let us respond to u.s. federal asks to streamline permitting processes. and to date, we've already been working with clients, utilizing these technologies and are now selling them to numerous federal, state and local as well as international government and private sector clients. and then secondly, we have a digital environmental impact assessment software. that allowed us to complete the first u.s. ever digital eis for the u.s. army corps of engineers. and that's light years ahead of anything in the market. it allows nepa to be performed better, faster, cheaper with greater margins. it likely will reduce cost 30% and times more than 50%. so again, i mean in this case, our it tools not only let us continue to perform and work effectively from home but we believe give us a differentiator in the near term and in the future.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
that's great insight. thanks gentlemen and stay healthy.

your next question comes from the line of andy kaplowitz with citi. your line is open.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
good morning guys, hope you're well. nice quarter. mike, can you give us more color on your construction management business? i know you mentioned that 85% of your work has continued. obviously, 70% to 75% of the business is new york and l.a., as well as you have a big focus on sports. so how concerned are you that projects in that business could move to the right? maybe you can talk about your confidence in because i know you had a big backlog coming into the pandemic. have you factored potential cm weakness into your guidance?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
so good question, andy. the construction management business, first of all, it's more diversified today than it's ever been. if you went back six years ago, our commercial and residential real estate was about 80% of our business. now that's only 45%. aviation was formerly 1% of our business in cm. now it's about 13% of our year-to-date nsr and about 1/3 of our backlog. and so we put forth a considerable effort over the past few years to start to diversify that business. and the aviation business at 13% of our nsr and 1/3 of the backlog, those decisions are those are 10-, 20-year strategic decisions for airport expansions that they don't change based on changing demand in passenger miles for the quarter or for the year or even next year. they're looking out 10, 20 years what they're going to need at jfk, for instance. so that's really important. secondly, the projects that as you heard us say, 80-plus percent of our projects are still operating today. and almost all of the projects that are not operating are paying us our general conditions, which covers our cost on those projects because the clients want to keep our teams at the ready to jump back in when construction is revived. l.a. construction is still continuing. in new york, there has been some nonessential construction that is put on halt.
the governor has said they expect to start back by may 15, although they've asked us to put forth a plan to start even earlier, which we're working on. so we're highly confident that we'll be back up to full steam very quickly. so we're not seeing projects stop except for a few that i mentioned. we're not seeing time lines move out. as you know in that space, it's rare that once you get started with a construction project, it's very, very rare that it stops, the reason being is we've got financing in place that requires you to finish it. and so even back in the '08 financial crisis, i could think of less than a handful of projects around the world that literally shut down for good. the rest of them moved forward. so given that we've got four years of backlog in that space, i feel pretty good. we're about the same place we were. going back again to the global financial crisis, we had built up a good book of business coming into '07, '08 but then carried us through the next few years. so that is a piece of the business we feel very confident in because of the backlog and because of the diversity.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
mike, that's helpful. and then while understanding that you lowered your ebitda guidance just a bit given the pandemic concerning, could you tell us, since the pandemic started, how much positive offset you've seen so far from work from fema versus the actual covid-related delays? and what would you expect to see moving forward? or is there incremental work to do there?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay. so troy or randy, do you want to take that one?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, sure. i'll jump in and take that. i guess first of all, andy, just in terms of our guidance, when we look forward, typically, we have six months under our belt and we're forecasting the next six months of the year. we've come to the end of our april results, and so where we sit today is we actually have seven months of results. and two months of those results, i'm going to call them march and april, have us operating in the pandemic environment that we're in. and our april results have exceeded our expectations in terms of nsr, earnings and cash. so just in terms of our confidence moving forward, we have a higher degree of confidence in our guidance than we did certainly a few weeks ago. and again, to your point about what we're seeing in the marketplace is we certainly have been active in helping local governments, trying to help people through the impact of the pandemic and supporting healthcare initiatives and supporting just governments and figuring out how they work their way through this, so project management types of projects. so we've been active in doing that. we've certainly won a lot of work during the last few months, and that has supported our april results.
but i think even beyond that, as we look forward, the business itself has a number of attributes that we made reference to and mike made reference to a little bit earlier that allow us to be adaptable to the environment. so even as there might be some project deferrals or as we can ramp up to take on certain types of projects to try and support the change that is certainly coming over the next month, it gives us the confidence that even in a dynamic environment, the agility or the adaptability of our business allows us and gives us confidence to be able to work through and achieve our guidance. so we have a high degree of confidence in guidance where we sit today because of the seven months of the results and our the proven agility of the business and what we still can see as market opportunities. change is ultimately good for what we do. we support change in infrastructure, and that is coming and will be accelerated by the impact of the pandemic.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. one additional item there. just you asked about what are the positives that we are seeing coming out of covid-related work or what are the plus-ups. we have won hundreds of millions of dollars of work already. and at least according to the bloomberg government report, we've captured about 25% of all the covid-related federal dollars within our industry, and we're the number one in our industry in winning covid-related work. so and that work is widely various. disaster response work, it's field hospitals, treatment centers, medical stockpile facilities, global supply chain-type activity. so it's widely varied, and we think there'll be continuing opportunity on that front.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
mike, so that all sounds pretty good. like what would it take for you to restart your share repurchase program? you just need to see the pandemic fade a bit? anything else that you could give us color there?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
troy, you want to give some guidance on that?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, certainly. yes, and andy, you actually kind of summarized it in the sentence, which is our focus today in the current marketplace or market backdrop is focusing on our liquidity. right now, we're in a very comfortable liquidity position. and we're going to be focused on maintaining a comfortable liquidity position until we can create confidence that the market conditions are going to stabilize and there's a clear line of sight to what the future is going to hold. so for the time being, that's going to be our focus, but it is just a matter of timing, and we will then return to our stated commitment, which is maintaining our leverage target at two to 2.5 times and returning substantially all of our capital to shareholders, which means that we'll start buying stock under our existing repurchase authorization. again, there's certainly, the big question is when that will happen. and we're just going to be working through this and make sure that we gain more confidence about what's going on in the marketplace before we start trading off liquidity for repurchases.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of jamie cook with credit suisse. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good. good morning and nice quarter. i guess two questions. one, the margins on the international business improved, but not at the targeted range, but it improved nicely sequentially, i guess, year-over-year. is that sustainable as you look to the back half of the year just given we don't have history there in terms of how the business performs on a quarterly basis? i guess then, and my second question, mike, any color you can give in terms of what's going on with the ceo search? is that still active? or is the board thinking it makes sense to keep you there indefinitely in particular in an environment like this given your history with the company? just any update that you could provide on that front?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. troy will take the first part of that.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i'll take the first part of the question. and jamie, the restructuring actions that we've taken beginning last year and we continue to take this year what those are that's what's driving the margin improvement. so it's a combination of the things that we've been talking about consistently for the last few quarters, which is improving our real estate profile, taking advantage of our design centers and our shared service centers. and we just continue to proceed on the path, and we expect margins to improve over the course of the year and even beyond this year into the future. there is certainly a run rate impact. there's a benefit in the year but an additional run rate impact in subsequent years. and then the other thing i'd point out is that historically, our business does have a ramp-up in the second half of the year based on activity and volume. so that's the piece that we have to pay a little more attention to as we work through q3 and q4. again, as we said, we see economic activity bottoming out in q3, so we might not see the impact we typically see. but certainly, over the course of the year, we expect margins in the international business to improve and to benefit from the activities we already have undertaken.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
so jamie, to the second part of your question, as you know, i had announced my departure at our annual shareholder meeting on march 10. and then along came the pandemic, and the board asked and i agreed to stay on and lead us through the crisis and making a rapid change during the crisis was not a good idea. but we certainly have continued with the ceo search process. we are still evaluating potential candidates. and it's just been a bit slowed down and a little reluctant to make a precipitous change during the challenging times. but i can't give you a specific time line on that, but the process is continuing. and we'll update you as soon as we have information to provide.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. i appreciate it. glad you guys are healthy and well great.

your next question comes from the line of michael feniger with bank of america. your line is open. michael feniger with bank of america. go ahead, your line is now open.
michael feniger -- bank of america -- analyst
perfect, thank you. thank you for taking my questions. just, troy, on the free cash flow bridge, i think i missed a few things. have you observed the pickup in april on working cap phasing in collections to give you that confidence as well? or is this really kind of like we saw last year, a very fourth quarter type of phenomenon?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. actually, we saw a pickup in april. as i think i may have mentioned this a little bit earlier, our april results were ahead of our expectations on nsr, earnings and cash. so we saw a substantial improvement over what we had forecast for april. and that is again just due to the activities of people being focused on collections with their clients. clearly, in this environment where people are concerned about delay in payment, we have a highly engaged group of people here that are focused on making sure that they're on top of that. but also, we're seeing a number of our government clients actually accelerate some of their payments just to support their economy and to support the people working in those economies. and so we've seen accelerations in hong kong, australia and even canada. so again, supporting that bridge, in fact, is having us actually collect beyond what we expected in april, so supporting an improvement in working capital in the second half of the year. and then additionally, we do see, just in our business, there is a natural improvement in working capital during the course of the year. one of the significant items that has an impact on that obviously is compensation. we do make accruals during the course of the year for some of our compensation that gets paid out the following the first quarter of the following year.
michael feniger -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and if we take just the low end of your ranges this year, the $100 million of free cash flow and the $700 million of ebitda, let's say you don't grow ebitda next year and you hold the line at $700 million. can you just help me understand what the free cash flow you think you can generate from that $700 million next year? is there any stranded costs that we should be considering cash to fund some discontinued ops that we should be aware of, i guess, just to help us get a sense of where your balance sheet and leverage is now and maybe where it could look like in 2021?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. well, that's that was a lot to cover. i'm going to try and simplify it and by simply saying that we gave free we gave cash flow guidance at our investor day. and it was focused on the conversion of our earnings, ebitda, to unlevered free cash flow. and within our professional services business, even as we move forward in the subsequent years, we don't see that changing. the underlying nature of our business, the conversion of earnings to cash is consistent. and so we see 75% of the earnings in 2021 converting to unlevered free cash flow for use in the business. so that characteristic remains unchanged. and just to the point you made a little bit earlier, i don't know where you came up with the $700 million number. but i certainly don't want to leave anyone with the impression that's we believe that the subsequent year will look like. not at all. we still again look forward and we think that based on the underlying nature of our business and the marketplaces that we're in, that we have the ability to deliver profitable growth into 2021.
michael feniger -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. yes, sorry, i got confused. i think the $700 million was i was talking about the ebitda figure with which you can convert to free cash flow. and i guess just lastly, and mike, i think you touched on it, obviously, it's a capital-light business, high variable cost structure. i know you have you're in a position where you have a big backlog and only a handful of projects in 2008 were canceled. just help me understand like the sensitivity of your business with the high variable cost structure. if for some reason, we did see some of the backlog get canceled and revenue for this professional services business was down 10%, how does that flow through to what percent change to your operating profit since you do have a capital-light and high variable cost structure?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so we have done a lot of modeling on those type of questions. and the good news is we are not expecting a 10% drop in revenue in any way. but we have modeled it, of course, as we do a lot of modeling these days. but maybe, troy, you want to just touch on some of the variable cost levers that we pull in those scenarios?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, yes. and again, one of the things that we spend a lot of time on in february, and we still continue to do this almost on a weekly basis, is making sure that we keep updating and stress-testing what we think is the range of outcomes for the business. and then with that work, we've also developed a significant number of trigger points or levers, the adjustments that we make to react to what we might find, either it might be on a client basis or a project basis or even an office basis. so we worked through that. and what we've determined is that even with a wide range of different outcomes in terms of revenue during the second half of the year, that we have the ability to manage to stay within our guidance range. so that's what gives us comfort ultimately in the guidance range even with a wide range of outcomes. and the things that we focus on, again, are the things we've talked about, which is controlling the costs in the business. as we said, we currently have a hiring freeze in place. we aren't undertaking any travel. so there are some things that just naturally have fallen away in the business. but then just given the nature of the workforce, we have the ability to, again, adjust if there are dramatic changes in terms of workloads and rebalance work. so those are the that's the principal lever that we have. and then beyond that...
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. troy, i think go ahead.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i was going to say, so and beyond that, there are a number of programs that the governments around the world have put in place to support the population and our workforce. it also provides benefit or think about it as a lever that has an impact on ultimately our results.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. and just so we talk about the modeling we're doing should there be a decline in revenue. but i don't want to leave anybody with the wrong impression here. you saw our backlog up double digit to $42 billion in the quarter. we rarely see anything drop out of backlog. in fact, we've got 50,000 projects going on at any one point in time around the world. so far, we've seen 18 cancellations, 18 out of 50,000. we've had less than 1% of our projects have had some sort of deferral during the covid crisis. and right now, when i look at the pipeline of opportunities, the number of projects in our pipeline is up double digits. the gross margin in those projects is significantly up. so we're not expecting to see a decline.

your next question comes from the line of steven fisher with ubs. your line is open.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks, good morning guys. just to pick up on that last bit of discussion about 2021, i fully recognize that most companies have pulled their 2020 guidance, let alone have anything out there for 2021. but i really wanted to just ask you about what the status is of your specific 2021 expectations that you had out there. i noticed they were not in the slide deck this quarter. you do have the luxury of having a very robust backlog. you just talked about the very small percentage of deferrals and cancellations. so just curious, what is the status of your 2021 targets? and how confident are you in the backlog that you have in getting there?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i guess first of all, steve, is our cadence for providing guidance certainly on the next year is when we get toward the beginning of that year. so we won't specifically do that until the fourth quarter. we did at the investor day give a guide. and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver on profitability and growth. and as you pointed out, it's dependent upon some of the key attributes of our business. we do have that record backlog. and our 2021 plan was built on low single-digit revenue growth to achieve a 15% ebitda growth in 2021. and that was built upon the actions that we are taking to improve the efficiency of the business. and they were built around real estate improvements, design centers, built around use of our shared service center. and then beyond that, we now have a lot of confidence that because of the impact of the virus and our ability for our workforce to work remotely, it also presents additional opportunity with respect to how we would change the dynamics of how people work and the impact that would have on our real estate portfolio. so again, as mike pointed out a little earlier, we spend about $400 million a year on real estate. and there certainly is an opportunity that we believe is accelerated by what the workplace of the future will look like to actually improve margins and to continue to build a path of improved productivity. so it's a long way of saying we certainly have confidence in the future because of the low single-digit revenue growth the revenue growth we had anticipated. and our future is built upon improvement in productivity and efficiency in the business.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
so that just to characterize it, would you say that number is still somewhere between valid and we just need to see how the pandemic plays out or that number is just still valid at this point?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i would say that we have confidence in the things that are within our control. and as we see the market stabilize, we'll become again, we'll become more confident about our ability to deliver against those future numbers.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
got it. and then just a quick follow-up on the state and local budget situation. i know you've talked a handful of times on the call about the $500 billion and $700 billion. just curious about how you think the scenarios will play out for your fiscal year because you do have a september year-end. most of the states have a june year-end. and do you think that federal help will all come in, in time to have the states avoid having any deferral of projects in a meaningful way basically over the summer in your fiscal fourth quarter?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
so we don't think there's a negative impact there, the reason being the projects that you're working on are typically funded. there's typically money set aside. as i mentioned, we have about 23% of our nsr comes from state and local governments. half of that comes from five states that had come into this with very strong stabilization and rainy day funds. so the stimulus money that might be brought to bear on the states in later in the year will just support the outlook for 2021 and forward. but we're not concerned about the next couple of quarters here.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
okay, very good. well, thanks
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of andrew wittmann with baird. your line is open.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
okay, great, thanks. i guess my question is focused on the liquidity. you've mentioned that given uncertain times, you want to hold on to liquidity, and i think everyone understands that. but i guess my question is, how much liquidity is too much liquidity? your guidance is implying like $700 million of free cash flow here in the rest of the fiscal year. that will mean that you only have maybe a couple of hundred million dollars of net debt, plus you have a u.s. virgin islands big receivable that's getting paid, albeit slowly that's on there. there's some claims that certainly could be a source of cash in the next couple of years that are on your balance sheet as well. i mean it seems like there could be an option to do more share repurchase as there's cash that's coming in even this fiscal year. trying to understand what, besides being overly conservative, the liquidity could be factoring into that. and i was wondering if you could address that.
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
andy, it's troy. look, i think i don't believe at this point in time, you can be overly conservative in terms of liquidity. but again, as we work our way through the year, our liquidity position will continue to improve. again, it's i would describe it as being comfortable today, but it will improve. and again, as we reach a point where we start to see there'd be some more stability in the marketplace, it becomes just, as i said, a matter of timing where we will return and start buying back stock. there's not a pinpoint there's not a point in time we could say that's exactly when it's going to happen nor would it be appropriate for us to do that. but certainly, we can see, based on the underlying attributes of the business and our confidence in the future, that there is a point in time where we're going to move away and rebalance away from liquidity and toward repurchase.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
okay. maybe as an addendum on that, you guys have talked about these dispositions that are in discontinued operations today, either oil and gas, certainly the civil, power. i was just wondering, given the state of the markets right now and m&a activity broadly, how realistic is it? i heard the comments on the songs job, but how realistic is it still here today that these can be completed this fiscal year like you previously anticipated? or do you see some risk that some of this moves into the next fiscal year?
randall a. wotring -- chief operating officer
andy, this is randy. we are actively working to exit these businesses. and we are have made good progress over the last couple of years in getting rid of we got rid of our international development business. we sold our production services and oil & gas business. with the completion of the line, we will and removing two combined cycle jobs from our backlog, we'll have exited the combined cycle business. we are closely managing the at-risk business remaining at-risk civil business and preparing to go back out the market. so we believe that there'll be opportunities as the market and infrastructure spend starts happening. we our largest contract now, about 1/3 of our remaining at-risk backlog is the songs contract. and we are, as we indicated, in discussions there to exit that contract. so we're making progress, and it'll likely be happen in lumps, but we expect to make that happen over the as soon as the market opens up.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
got it, great. and then my last question is just kind of a technical thing, but you kind of alluded to this, troy. nobody is traveling, and that does have the benefit to your p&l. can you just talk historically, like maybe what percentage of either gross or net revenue your travel cost has represented over the period of time just so we can have some context as to how much that's benefiting you?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so the bulk of our travel costs are actually funded by our clients. so the impact, i would classify it as in the bundle of travel costs and other types of out-of-pocket amounts that we spend in the business. that's going to be at this point, i'd say it's less than a percentage point of our entire nsr.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. it's also helpful remembering that people that are traveling are also billable to clients. and so what you end up having is you've gained some productivity time. so instead of being stuck in an airport, they're at their home office doing work that's billable to clients. so it's not just the cost of the airplane, checking in hotels. it's actually you replace some travel downtime with productive billable time while they're not traveling.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
even better. great, thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of adam thalhimer with thompson, davis. your line is open.
adam thalhimer -- thompson, davis -- analyst
great. thanks for squeezing me in. i wanted to ask, mike, since asia was first in, first out, what kind of demand destruction did you see there? and kind of what does that tell us to expect elsewhere in the world as we restart?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
so one of the the one way to look at it is there's about 10 working days lost in asia. and so 10 working days is meaningful if you think of 240 working days or so in a year, it's 5%-ish. and so that gives you a sense of what we saw. but more importantly, as we learned from that experience very quickly and we are learning at scale because we're talking about 10,000 employees across china, so we had an opportunity to learn from that and use that experience elsewhere as we move through a remote work environment. but i'll tell you, hong kong is our biggest market in asia where we've got almost 5,000 employees in hong kong alone. in that market, we went into this year expecting a double-digit decline in revenue going into the year because of some of the challenges and protests in hong kong. in fact, coming out of this, we are beating our plan in hong kong right now despite covid. and we're expecting that stimulus dollars in hong kong will give us even more momentum there. so we're actually doing better than our plan despite the covid shutdown. and maybe it's our plan was lower than it should have been coming into the year as we were being cautious about some of the protests that we were seeing in hong kong. but we've learned at scale there, and we've deployed those learnings around the world, which are helping us maintain productivity in other markets that have gone to remote workforce.
adam thalhimer -- thompson, davis -- analyst
okay. and then with u.s. stimulus, i mean i really hope you're right, but man, the republicans seem to be putting up a big fight on any kind of phase four or infrastructure stimulus. how do you think about that versus the hope for something over the next few months?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, there's certainly a lot of momentum. and i don't know how to handicap it, adam. it's we're following it very closely. and so far, the amount of money that's been that people are willing to spend in washington on both sides of the aisle through the first round of the cares act, it seems like they're willing to throw just about any amount of money to get this economy restarted as soon as possible. and infrastructure spending is something that's top of mind for democrats and republicans, although you mentioned some of the republican resistance. but i don't know how to handicap, but i'd hate to put odds on it, but i just feel it's more likely than not we're going to see stimulus activity deployed toward infrastructure.
adam thalhimer -- thompson, davis -- analyst
okay. thanks, mike.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
there are no further questions at this time. mr. burke, i turn the call back over to you.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
great. well, thank you, everybody, for joining today. this is certainly unprecedented times, but i have to say that i'm incredibly proud of how our organization has responded, and it gives me a great sense of pride to be able to work with some of the incredible employees across aecom. but there's a few additional points i want to emphasize from today's discussion before we close out here. clearly, our financial performance over the past six quarters has been clear that we're delivering on our strategy and we're exceeding all the targets that we've set. we are delivering on our commitments to simplify and derisk our business and expand our margins. we've certainly transformed our balance sheet after the sale of the management services business. we did that just at the right time coming into this pandemic, which gives us a lot of flexibility on capital allocation with a lot of liquidity. and liquidity is highly valued right now, as troy mentioned earlier.
and the transformation that we've been undertaken to convert to a professional services business has a lot of advantages that could position us quite well to consistently deliver on the financial performance we're talking about. and we're certainly delighted to see the agility that our employees have displayed over the past few months by converting to a remote work environment by providing new services to new clients in new ways that the pandemic has required. so we're feeling pretty good. as we look ahead, there is uncertainty in the world, but we have a lot of confidence in our outlook for the year. we've got a lot of confidence in next year based on the backlog we have, the continued very high win rates and the expanse of that backlog. and so we feel a great sense of confidence for fy 2020 and fy 2021. so i look forward to speaking to everyone again soon. thank you for all your support, and stay safe and sane in these difficult times. thank you.

[operator instructions]
i would like to turn the call over to will gabrielski, senior vice president, investor relations. please go ahead.
will gabrielski -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, operator. i would like to direct your attention to the safe harbor statement on page one of today's presentation. today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about future business and financial expectations, including expected and potential impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. actual results may differ significantly from those projected in today's forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, including the risks described in our periodic reports filed with the sec. except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. we are using non-gaap financial measures in our presentation. the appropriate gaap financial reconciliations are incorporated into our presentation where available, which is posted on our website. the sale of the management services business closed on january 31. the management services business, along with our at-risk, self-perform construction businesses that we intend to exit, are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements. today's comments will focus on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. the discussion of adjusted operating margins reflects segment-level performance for the americas and international segments. we will also refer to net service revenue or nsr, which is defined as revenue excluding subcontractor and other direct costs. our discussion of margins will be on an nsr basis unless otherwise noted.
beginning today's presentation is mike burke, aecom's chairman and chief executive officer. mike?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, will. welcome, everyone. joining me today are troy rudd, our chief financial officer; and randy wotring, our chief operating officer. i will begin today's discussion with a review of our financial and strategic accomplishments. i will then review impacts from and our response to covid-19. troy will then review our performance and outlook in greater detail before turning the call over for a question-and-answer session. please turn to slide three. i am very pleased with our performance in both the second quarter and the first half of the year, which reflects the benefits of the many actions we have taken over the past two and half years toward achieving our long-term financial and strategic objectives. for the second quarter, adjusted ebitda increased by 16% over the prior year to $182 million. for the first half of the year, adjusted ebitda increased by 21%. underpinning this strong performance was continued margin expansion of 200 basis points in the quarter. i am also pleased to report that we are continuing to win work at a higher rate. wins for the quarter totaled nearly $9 billion, a record for the professional services business. strength was broad-based and included a greater than one book-to-burn ratio in both segments, led by several large multiyear wins in the americas.
as a result, backlog increased by 14% to a new all-time high of $42 billion, providing substantial visibility against an increasingly dynamic macroeconomic backdrop. in late january, we closed the sale of the management services business for $2.4 billion, capitalizing on record-high valuations for government services companies. we immediately repaid all of our $1.3 billion of secured debt, and we finished the second quarter with an all-time high cash balance of $1.3 billion and net leverage of 1.2 times. this leverage profile positions us extremely well at a time when liquidity is highly valued. i also want to highlight another accomplishment this quarter, and that is our recently announced industry-leading emissions reduction targets, which are designed to meet the goals of the paris agreement. this includes a goal of achieving a 20% reduction in emissions by 2025 as well as a 10% reduction in emissions across our supply chain. these reductions, when achieved, would be equivalent to eliminating the environmental impact of burning nearly 40 million pounds of coal every year. our commitment to achieving these targets marks a major milestone on our continued journey to deliver a better world. please turn to slide four. as a global company, covid-19 has been a part of our daily routine since the beginning of the year.
in asia, nearly half of our offices were closed, and 90% of our workforce was working remotely at peak. while we lost 10 working days in mainland china in february, we quickly called upon our resilience, it and hr teams to ensure that our employees were safe and accounted for, and we took immediate actions to ensure business continuity. i am proud of our response. in fact, in asia, despite the challenges presented, we achieved our profitability target and exceeded our cash flow target for the quarter. markets across asia are beginning to normalize, and restrictions on movement are being reduced. we are seeing similar impacts from covid-19 across other markets. in our americas and emea regions, 90% of our people are working remotely. most major global metros have instituted shelter-in-place orders and halted nonessential activities, including nonessential construction. additionally, state and local clients are bracing for steep tax revenue declines. however, coming into this crisis, rainy day funds were at a record high, and the cares act and federal reserve actions are expected to deliver $700 billion of direct support. importantly, though, much of our work is of a critical nature for clients and has been deemed essential.
we are working closely with federal, state and local clients to respond to the immediate needs created by covid-19, including temporary hospitals. in april, we won more than $200 million of work to deliver thousands of hospital beds in short order, and we are engaged with clients globally to provide additional services, including developing return-to-work strategies for our clients. in fact, we are ranked number one in our industry in terms of work won for the u.s. federal government for covid-19. as a result, our momentum has continued into the third quarter. in april, utilization, nsr and profitability were ahead of our expectations, and we are ahead of our plan for the first seven months of the year. looking ahead, our confidence in achieving our financial targets is underscored by the strong year-to-date performance as well as certain attributes inherent in our professional services business that position us well during periods of uncertainty. first, we deliver primarily knowledge-based critical and essential services. in most cases, these services can be delivered uninterrupted while working remotely, supported by our long-running investments in technology and innovation.
these investments have enabled a relatively seamless transition to remote working, and our ever-expanding digital solutions are deepening our client engagement as well. in fact, last month, we announced an innovative virtual consultation tool, which has garnered very positive client reactions since launch. many of these changes may accelerate innovation and digital transformation trends in our industry, which we are well positioned for. second, our professional services business has a highly variable cost structure. this allows us to quickly respond to changes in the market. beginning in february, we built robust mitigation plans to assess different potential virus durations and impacts, put in place a freeze on new hiring and discretionary spending and instituted a global travel freeze. with these actions, we achieved our top priority: keeping our key assets, the many talented people across our organization safe, employed and highly engaged with clients. third, most of our work has continued unabated. in most regions, transportation, water and environmental services, our largest market sectors, are considered critical or essential, and work continues.
in our construction management business, more than 85% of our projects are continuing to move forward, including more than 70% in new york despite temporary nonessential construction shutdowns. now the vast majority of our projects where work has been suspended, we continue to have our general conditions paid for by our clients, which covers our costs. because of this and our agility in repositioning our workforce, we have retained nearly 99% of our employees, which positions us even better to respond directly as economic trends recover and client demand accelerates. fourth, we have built a record $42 billion backlog, which provides all-time high levels of visibility with more than three years of trailing 12-month revenue in backlog. this allows us to operate with a high degree of certainty against a rapidly evolving landscape. finally, aecom has a proven track record of delivering through periods of slower and negative economic activity as evidenced by our strong organic growth during the global financial crisis. this is largely due to having nearly 60% of our nsr from public sector clients where spending is often inversely correlated to gdp due to government stimulus investment in infrastructure that increases during periods of weaker economic activity. with the cares act and other measures taken, we have already seen historic levels of approved public funding.
the cares act provides for more than $2 trillion of stabilization spending, and the federal reserve has created a $500 billion direct lending program for our state and local clients. in addition, substantial programs in our largest international markets have been put forward, including nearly $900 billion of funding across the u.k., canada, australia and hong kong. encouragingly, these programs continue to prioritize investment in critical, large-scale transportation and infrastructure projects. these type of projects are precisely where aecom excels as evidenced by our number one ranking in the transportation and general building design markets, which was reaffirmed last week by enr. as i look across the company, our strategic and financial position has never been stronger. we have transformed our balance sheet with substantially reduced leverage and ample liquidity.
we have consistently exceeded our financial targets over the past six quarters while delivering 300 basis points of margin improvement since fiscal 2018. and our agility as an organization has proven to be a key competitive advantage as we quickly mobilized contingency plans for our people to support our clients in the face of unprecedented change. before concluding my remarks, i'd like to thank our employees for their tireless commitment to our success and to delivering for our clients during these challenging times. the last few months have impacted all of us in profound ways, and the resilience of our people inspires a great deal of pride. with the most talented workforce in our industry, i remain confident that the best days for aecom are yet ahead.
with that, i will now turn the call over to troy to discuss our performance and business trends in more detail. troy?
w. troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mike. please turn to slide six. echoing mike's sentiments, we are really proud of the organization's response to the challenges presented by covid-19. importantly, we have built significant momentum across the business, including a sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted ebitda growth and substantial margin improvement. notably, margins in the americas segment lead our industry, and we have delivered substantially improved margins in the international segment. this strong performance was achieved despite substantial covid-related downtime in asia during february, which speaks to the commitment of our people and the resilience of our organization. including our performance in april that exceeded our expectations for nsr, earnings and cash flow, we have delivered seven months of outperformance compared to our plan this year, which underscores our confidence in achieving our full year guidance. these accomplishments are the result of strategic actions we have taken over the past two and half years. this includes exiting underperforming businesses and markets, optimizing overhead, consolidating our real estate portfolio and expanding the use of best cost design and shared service centers. importantly, we still see plenty of opportunity to further expand margins and deliver on our long-term financial objectives. for instance, we now recognize how productive our employees can remain while working remotely.
with 10 million square feet of real estate, we are developing a workplace of the future strategy, which is targeted at enhancing productivity while further optimizing our operating costs. we are also continuing to progress on our plan to exit our remaining self-perform at-risk construction businesses. we are actively negotiating with a potential buyer for our share of the san onofre nuclear decommissioning project, which would result in a substantial milestone in our derisking strategy. although we encountered challenges as we close out the alliant combined cycle power plant that has increased the cost to complete, the plant is now generating power and is moving through the miso certification, which is expected to be completed over the next several days. finally, i should note that our results in our discontinued operations in the quarter included an approximately $89 million noncash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on certain oil and gas-related businesses as a result of the dramatic fall in oil prices. importantly, as our performance in professional services business underscores, we are benefiting from our lower risk profile, which validates our strategy. please turn to slide seven. in the americas, organic nsr was effectively unchanged with the prior year. i should note that excluding the impact of elevated levels of storm recovery work from the prior year, organic nsr in our design business increased by 2%. this is the last quarter of material headwinds to growth related to our storm recovery work. this performance reflects continued underlying strength in our core transportation and water markets and in our construction management business.
the americas segment had a 15.6% adjusted operating margin, which marked a 160 basis point improvement over the prior year and was ahead of our expectations for the quarter. our backlog in the americas increased by 16% and set a new record. prior to the impacts of covid-19, state and local tax receipts were trending positively through april, which provided for a solid base of project funding. while the forecast of tax receipts is clearly lower today, contributions from the cares act and the federal reserve are set to provide $700 billion of funding capacity to our clients. and talks of additional infrastructure stimulus are continuing, which we are well suited to benefit from. please turn to slide eight. turning to our international segment. organic nsr declined by 2%. our adjusted operating margin for the second quarter was 5.9%, a 240 basis point increase over the prior year. increasing our international margin is a top priority and a critical component of achieving our long-term financial objectives. both the emea and asia pacific regions contributed to this improvement, with the benefits primarily from optimized overhead costs and the expanded use of best cost design and shared service centers resulting in increased profitability. importantly, as mike noted, we are also successfully mitigating the headwind from 10 lost workdays in mainland china, and we are seeing market conditions begin to normalize.
we are positioning to capitalize on substantial stimulus and emergency covid-19 response efforts in our international markets. this includes a more than $700 billion infrastructure investment program in the u.k., along with approximately $100 billion of stimulus funding in australia and hong kong. as a result, with very favorable funding conditions in our largest international markets, we are poised to capitalize on a growing opportunity set that is well suited for our leading capabilities. please turn to slide nine. underlying cash generation in the quarter was mostly consistent with our expectations, and we remain confident in achieving our outlook for the full year. let me walk through the details of our cash flow. free cash flow was a use of $313 million. there were a few factors that i want to specifically address. first, following the completion of the ms sale in january, we terminated the receivable sales program associated with that business, which resulted in a $180 million impact to cash flow. this was contemplated in our original guidance for the year. second, we incurred cash restructuring costs of approximately $40 million in the quarter as part of our strategic actions that resulted in substantial margin improvement for six consecutive quarters.
this was also contemplated in our original guidance. finally, the ms business delivered cash flow below our expectations for january, resulting in an approximately $130 million impact. however, we expect to recover this timing-related impact in the third quarter through a favorable net working capital purchase price adjustment. the mandated accounting treatment for this collection is that it be recognized in the investing section of our cash flow statement. this is a timing-only impact, and our full year free cash flow guidance includes this collection. as such, we have reiterated our guidance for full year free cash flow of $100 million to $300 million. our confidence is supported by the highly cash-generative nature of our business, which remains unchanged, as well as the normal second half weighted phasing of our free cash flow. in addition, we expect to benefit from tax incentives and certain elements of government stimulus programs across the globe, including advanced billing for essential contractors, retention credits and payroll tax deferrals. please turn to slide 10. we completed the $2.4 billion sale of management services business in january. as a result, we have transformed our balance sheet and capital structure. we have repaid all of our secured debt, and we exited the second quarter with a $1.3 billion cash balance and net leverage of 1.2 times.
this strong liquidity position, combined with our undrawn $1.35 billion revolving credit facility, allows us to operate with certainty. in addition, we have recently closed on a $400 million delayed draw term loan. this creates greater flexibility to manage our capital structure going forward. as we look ahead, our capital allocation priorities are as follows. first and foremost, we are in a fortunate position with excess liquidity at a time when liquidity is scarce. we will continue to prioritize maintaining excess liquidity and reiterate our long-term net leverage target range of two to 2.5 times. second, when conditions normalize, we will look to return substantially all available excess capital to our stockholders. please turn to slide 11. turning to our financial guidance. our updated guidance balances the near-term uncertainties posed by covid-19 against the strong backlog growth and underlying momentum in the business. we began aggressively stress-testing and developing mitigation plans in early february.
this was a global initiative that involved hundreds of key operational and finance leaders across the organization. our team's efforts, combined with acting quickly to react to the impact of covid-19, underscores our confidence in our updated range. we now expect to deliver adjusted ebitda of between $700 million and $740 million, which reflects 10% growth at the midpoint. in addition, our guidance includes an expected $15 million headwind from currency fluctuations. based on our global experience with covid-19, we expect that shelter-in-place orders and construction shutdowns in the americas and emea regions will begin to ease in the third quarter. as a result, our guidance assumes that economic activity bottoms in the third quarter and that there are no material project delays or deferrals in the fourth quarter.
with that, operator, we're now ready for questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from sean eastman with keybanc capital markets. your line is now open.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
lara, troy, congratulations on the promotions, and mike, all the best on your next endeavors, leaving on a high note here this quarter. i just wanted to start on the state and local budget element. you called it out in your prepared remarks, troy. can you just level set with us on just how we should be thinking about the magnitude of the potential swing there to the extent global stimulus measures are delayed, whether in the u.s. or internationally? i mean, where is the exposure? where's the concern? and how big of a swing could that be on aecom's fiscal 2021 revenue trajectory, in your view?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. sean, first of all, thank you for the well wishes. with respect to our state and local budgets, that does represent about 1/4 of the work that we do or 1/4 of the revenue that we have in our overall professional services portfolio. there certainly is an element of that that's been impacted by the shortfalls as a result of covid. but on the other hand, we are seeing, again, user fees starting to increase as people return to work and return to traveling. we also have a significant amount of optimism around what the federal government will do to support transportation expenditures and, in particular, state and local governments. in particular, the fast act, it will expire in september, but i think it's been decades before that the transportation funding has gone without being replaced.
so we certainly have confidence that something will be done to support those transportation budgets and transportation expenditures in 2021. and in terms of state and local budgets, again, we have some optimism around what will get done, either from either political party. but i think more importantly, from our perspective, there are things that we can control. and i think the things that are within our control that we've proven over the last number of quarters, we can manage our way through turbulent times, times when perhaps there is funding shortfalls within certain budgets. so well, we certainly don't have a line of sight to what the outcome will look like, but we certainly do have confidence in our ability to manage through it.
and then the other important part is we have a great platform and great professionals that allow us to win work. and from what based on what we've seen in the third quarter, we believe we've taken market share in the area of transportation and water. so got great professionals in the marketplace. we are winning work and replacing the work that we've been delivering. and even though there is uncertainty in state and local budgets, we have confidence in our ability to manage our way through it, based on our most recent experiences.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay. great. that's helpful. and maybe just from a strategic direction perspective for you, troy, as you take the big seat, a lot of sort of announcements on digital innovation, new tools. is that the primary focus for you here in the immediate term? and maybe you could just detail for us some of the early wins on digital that you can build on here. that would be helpful.
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. certainly. again, i think if you sort of step back and look at the impact of the pandemic, well, it's been a lot of work and difficult to manage through the environment that we're in. it's accelerated a lot of the things that we've done to work together and to work with our clients. and a number of those things are based around what we're referring to as digital. so we have been investing and allowing ourselves to have the tools to work together and with our clients in a digital environment. and at the same time, we've been investing in some of the tools that allow us to work with our clients and to continue our clients to do the work. so a great example of that is we've developed software so we have virtual consultation with our clients.
we've put that in place and we've been using that for a number of our clients. the most recent experience that i can talk about is work we've done with roche in ireland, and it's been entirely successful. we also have been working on a digital environmental impact assessment tool. and at the moment, we're piloting that. it's the first-ever ies process that we're working with on the corps of engineers. it is certainly light years ahead of anything else that's in the marketplace. and it's available internally, so we're starting to use that with clients to accelerate the permitting process. and we will be bringing that to public, and we expect it to be used as a tool by government agencies in the future. so those are some of the things that we're working on.
but maybe just in terms of our overall kind of thesis as we continue, i'll let lara contribute some of that as well. so lara, if you have something you want to add?
lara poloni -- chief executive officer of emea
yes. thank you, troy, and thank you for the good wishes also, sean. so i think we're very strongly positioned with the development of our digital tools. and just to further expand on troy's point, particularly in our transportation market, where we have a lot of optimism about an infrastructure-led recovery. our teams around the world have done some great work. and a recent example of that was the launch of the trips tool, which is transportation resilient integrated passenger solution. obviously, a lot of uncertainty as communities returned to public transit, in particular. so this is a new technology platform that gives real-time information to commuters and other alerts. so it's very timely that we're bringing that to market, and we've brought that to bear on one of our projects in the greater new york region.
and as troy said, very strongly positioned in the environment business so we're a clear market leader. and also, we have just ongoing development of our digital libraries in our buildings and places segment, which is the other big part of our business around the world. so i think all these tools will provide continued sort of separation and differentiation for us, and it's an area that we're going to continue to develop our main business as well as scaling up even in our global design centers. it's a key priority for building up that know-how throughout our business. so i think it's a very important element of our strategy.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst

your next question comes from michael dudas with vertical research. your line is now open.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
good morning everyone. and again, well done, troy and lara, and good luck, mike, in your next endeavors.
michael burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, mike.
william gabrielski -- vice president of investor relations
thank you.
lara poloni -- chief executive officer of emea
thank you.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
given your perspective as you're involved with major cities, state, local, port authority, transit, large as san francisco, l.a., a lot of stuff going on, obviously, covid-related. how are you seeing business in activity to date? it seems like you've managed it very well. but certainly, the funding pressures, which may or may not come from washington and some of the caution that might be put forth among the governments running these cities, do you sense that there's a normalization that will occur here through this? or there will be some changes where it might maybe you need to adjust a little bit, adapt to certain different areas to attack your services on the government side here in the states?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so mike, i think it's again, i think it's difficult for us to provide those kinds of prognostications. i think what we can say is that our people are constantly working with our clients in the metropolitan areas globally. and we're working with them to adapt to the environment, which is ever-changing. and as you look around the world, we don't want to point out that there certainly are some areas around the world where maybe there are some funding shortfalls and there's some uncertainty in that respect, but there are a lot of places where we're seeing government support the infrastructure investment with stimulus. so we are seeing that in places like canada and australia and hong kong. we're seeing a discussion of an investment in stimulus being made in the u.k., which would support that market.
and then again, in the long run, i think we have optimism around not just short-term stimulus, but some long-term stimulus here in the united states to ultimately help support the required investment in infrastructure but also to help just getting people back to work in the medium term. so again, i couldn't comment on the changes in cities other than to say that we're working with our clients and reacting to that. and our professionals and leaders are out doing that. and that when you kind of look at the overall portfolio, we do have a lot of optimism about continued long-term investment in infrastructure. and in our private sector markets, while we've certainly seen in the environment business some of the awards and bookings being delayed, we see that just being delayed so effectively pushing that work out to the right.
and in our construction management business, again, our backlog gives us good long-term visibility into the future. and we still are seeing a pipeline of opportunities in that business. so overall, i have a sense of optimism, the short term, it's difficult for us to make any concrete predictions.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
those are very fair remarks and i appreciate those. my follow-up would be, maybe terrific progress on the margin front, especially in the americas and your international and u.s. design business. maybe you could remind us some of the ways that some of the methods you've had to increase that business.
and have you i'm assuming you've increased your global design center use that's been helpful to contribute to some of that margin improvement? and again, your long-term goals appeared from your remarks in the press release, those are achievable. maybe a little more comfort level on that front.
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. yes, absolutely. the headline there is we are absolutely confident in our continued ability to improve margins beyond where they are, as we again, certainly as we move forward in the short term and the longer term. i'll make a comment just about the north american markets, and i'll turn it over to lara to make some comments about the international markets. but here in north america, again, it's been a combination of things, continued improved use of design centers, focus on streamlining the operating structure and using global sorry, our global business service center.
even though we've had a lot of that work moved to and continue to be moved to manila, we've been able to operate even in a remote environment and to continue to move those opportunities overseas. and then the last point is obviously our real estate footprint. as we've changed the organization, we set out at the beginning of the year to undertake an important real estate restructuring, which we've been proceeding with, and we will complete that by the end of the year. so lara, i'll turn it over to you.
lara poloni -- chief executive officer of emea
yes. and thanks for the question, mike. so we are absolutely focused on international margin improvement. and i think we're making good progress there. so as we said earlier, year-to-date, margins have increased by 170 basis points. we reduced sg&a by $16 million year-to-date, which is ahead of our plan for sg&a. and i think, it's important to note, and we've achieved that in spite or despite the substantial revenue headwinds that we've experienced, particularly in the larger parts of our international business, like the u.k. and the middle east. so and we also see opportunity to get to double-digit margin performance over the next few years. so just to add a bit more color to your question about how we're going to do it?
what are some of the specifics there? so i think, first, continuing to focus on the simplification and focus about within our portfolio, so focusing on those parts of the international business that continue to offer us the highest return on investment and simplifying that focus. so i think testament to that in recent times has certainly been the execution of the exit from 30 countries in our european portfolio, very important to have achieved that. second, i think we will continue to look in a very focused manner at means of reducing our overhead or redundant or unproductive costs within our business. and i think the current look-ahead at the workplace of the future offers us potential to do that in terms of our real estate portfolio, in particular. and then i think and you touched on this, mike, obviously, the gbs continues to be a central element of our margin improvement strategy. so just this year, we stepped up the volume by 30%, and we have even more ambitious targets for next year.
and as i said earlier, we will continue to upskill those teams with the latest and best digital capabilities and know-how. and then the fourth part, i would say, is we will continue to be relentless in terms of just continuing to carve out market share in those focused markets for us such as the u.k. so the fact that we have, over the last 18 months to two years, achieved a place on more than 250 frameworks in the u.k. despite post brexit, despite post-covid environment, i think, gives us a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to attack that market and achieve greater margin, achieve greater market share and strengthen our leadership position post-covid. and also the other example of that, i think, is just our market leadership in saudi arabia, where we said a couple of years ago, we're going to focus on that market on the giga city development. and i think some of our recent wins and performance are a testament to that as well.
so look, i think we'll continue to be very focused on it. and we've done it before. we did it and achieved similar sort of recovery and refocusing our business in australia after the mining downturn. that was a business that i looked after at the time. so i think we're in good shape to continue to improve.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
those are very helpful answer. thank you very much.

your next question comes from andy kaplowitz with citi. your line is now open.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
good morning, guys. mike, thanks for all your help, and good luck. and troy and lara, congratulations.
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
lara poloni -- chief executive officer of emea
thanks.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
troy, you mentioned just following up on a couple of those questions. troy, you mentioned that your pace of orders slowed in june in the americas. maybe you could quantify for us piece of that slowdown? and then you do come into this slower order pace with contracted backlog up 13% year-over-year. so can you give us some initial thoughts into your revenue growth visibility over the next few quarters?
i'm not asking necessarily for a guide for next year, but how much visibility does current contracted backlog growth give you? and then how difficult would it be to grow your revenue in fy 2021 if there isn't a help from state and local stimulus?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so the best way i can answer that is just starting with our backlog. our visibility certainly an immediate as you said, the immediate term visibility comes from our backlog. so our backlog is up, i believe, 16% year-over-year from where we were last year, so that bodes well for the future and gives us that visibility. when you look at construction management, construction management gives very clear visibility to what the future will look like. in our design business, our book-to-burn has been over one times for the year, so again, that provides visibility into the near term. when you start looking at the impact of sort of how state governments will be funded and how money will be spent in the short term, it certainly will have an impact on us.
but again, the most important point i can make here is that we've shown ourselves kind of being resilient to manage our ways through those short-term fluctuations. but again, as we move forward in the long term, we have very good visibility into what the future looks like for the next few quarters. but that, obviously, around the edges, whether it's growth or whether it's flat, though it has been this past quarter or perhaps it might be down a few points, that will become clear as we work our way through the fourth quarter, and we start to see some more certainty around funding in particular markets.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
and i wanted to ask a follow-up on the margin question. you guys gave very good color on the respective segments. but you do have the long-term guide out there of 15% ebitda margin. when we think about the americas, margin has been trending up into the high teens this quarter. so maybe the sustainability of that, if we do see a little bit more muted growth here.
and then, lara, in international, again, you gave good color around double-digit margins over time. but let's say the markets stay weak in 2021. can you still grow that international margin even if you have some headwinds on the business?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so andy, maybe the best way i can answer that is we absolutely have confidence that we can continue to grow margins into 2021. just remember, just from the actions that we've taken over this past year, there's a run rate benefit that carries into the subsequent year. and then when you look at margins, a good example is in emea. we actually have seen a contraction in the third quarter in our international business, but we have seen margins continue to improve.
so again, as we look forward, with double-digit margins that we would expect to be able to accomplish over the next few years in our international business. and with the combination of the success we've had in our americas business, we believe our long-term targets are entirely achievable.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
great. and then just one quick follow-up, troy. you talked about basically increasing the focus on exiting your at-risk self-perform construction business that's intensified. what does that mean in terms of a process?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, maybe just a few moments, just kind of a history here. but when we were in the second quarter, we were involved in a process that were fairly advanced, expecting transactions to close on some of those businesses early in the third quarter. obviously, with the impact of the pandemic, all of those processes stopped and those deals were no longer available. so as we've started to see some more certainty in terms of how the world is going to progress over the next few quarters, as we've seen financing kind of become more certain in the marketplace, we've seen the opportunity to now take up those dialogues with groups of buyers and take all of those businesses to market together.
and so that's really what we're getting at is we've kind of gotten to a point where there is enough interest and perhaps enough certainty in the market where some deals can get done, and we are out in the marketplace with those businesses and in discussions with multiple parties.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
i appreciate, troy.

your next question comes from jamie cook with credit suisse. your line is now open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, congrats, troy and lara, and best wishes to you, mike. i have a couple of questions. i guess my first one, troy, in the press release, you said you're committed to ebitda growth in 2021. i'm assuming we're not committing to the numbers we put out at the analyst day. i mean, the street the consensus isn't there. i don't think it's in your stock, but if you could just confirm that.
my second question, unless i missed it, i don't think you guys addressed sort of what's going on with the cfo role, whether we're looking externally, internally and sort of like a time frame there? and then my last question, troy, again, just because you are taking over, i'm assuming your strategy will be the same that m&a is sort of off the table and how you're thinking about share repurchase.
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that was a lot, jamie. so let me take that in order.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
there always is a lot, troy.
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
try and keep it under half an hour. so first of all, absolutely, we are committed to growing earnings in 2021. but as you can appreciate with the uncertainty in the world, we're not, at this point, restating and/or giving guidance and we will do that when we get to november. but again, there is some softness in some of our markets, there's strength in some markets, and we expect some more certainty or clarity to be around some of our transportation and infrastructure markets as we get through this quarter.
and again, as i've said, what gives us confidence is our continued ability to improve margins and achieve an improvement in profitability, even where there might be softness or slowing in terms of revenue opportunities. in terms of the cfo timing, again, as mike said, with the accelerated transition, we would expect to have something to announce before august 15 in terms of the cfo.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
and are we looking externally as well? or should we view it as an internal candidate?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i won't make any comments on that.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay.
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and in terms of strategy, again, as you described, there are no real significant changes in the strategy for the business. we are continuing the process to transform the company into a higher-margin, lower-risk professional services business, that is a highly cash-generative business. we, again, expect to continue to grow that business and take some of the margin improvement and continue to invest it in margin improvement and in organic growth opportunities, and frankly create a virtuous cycle as we move forward. our commitment still remains, to return our free cash flow to our shareholders over time. that remains unchanged.
and ultimately, what might be different is that as a result of the pandemic, we have invested a lot of time and energy thinking about how the workplace of the future is going to change how we work and might change and how it will change our industry. and so that's going to be not just simply removing some real estate. that's going to be changing the way that we think about and how we deliver work for our customers and our clients. and we think that it will ultimately accelerate a lot of the digital transformation that is going on in our business and will change the way that we ultimately deliver work, causing greater opportunities for us to continue to improve margins and drive up returning capital in the business.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you.

your next question comes from michael feniger with bank of america. your line is now open.
michael feniger -- bank of america` -- analyst
yes. sorry, i was on mute. sorry about that, guys. just to kind of follow-up on jamie's question. i'm just curious, troy, like what are the guideposts that you're looking for in terms of the strategy on capital return? so i remember last quarter, you mentioned capital markets, so hopefully, capital markets have stabilized. just in terms of executing that strategy, is it the fast act that expires in september?
is it november elections? you have a cfo in place in a few weeks, it sounds like. would you want gross leverage to come down to a certain point? i guess just point us to the signs that you might be looking for in terms of executing that capital return strategy?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so maybe just a few points. so just starting with leverage. our leverage gross leverage for the quarter was 2.8 times or under three times. i expect us to keep our gross leverage under three times. it's the right leverage for us to continue to operate the business and enables us to return capital to shareholders. again, as i said, as we saw more certainty over the course of the second half of this year in terms of our performance against our targets and our ability to drive cash flow, that it would create more certainty toward an outcome of returning capital.
and again, we're committed to, over time, deploying that capital to buying back stock. but i will say at this time, i certainly don't have any intention of front-running any of our repurchase activity because it just simply increases the price at which we repurchase stock.
michael feniger -- bank of america` -- analyst
okay. fair enough. if i could just level-set on bigger picture here, troy. there's as you're aware, there's a massive valuation discount to you and the premium design peers. last quarter, you guys provided guidance when those premium players pulled out and you guys just raised your guidance today. as you're aware, there was a voice that felt an external candidate is necessary.
so troy, as you take over in the coming weeks, i know it's kind of executing the plan. but do you see anything structural with those peers as you guys transformed your portfolio that makes you feel that discount is warranted or can't be closed? just commentary around that would be really helpful as you take over in two weeks and maybe evolve the plan that's been set going forward.
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i don't see any reason why there's a discount to our peers, to be very just blunt about it. simple. we've been able, in this business, to prove that we have fantastic professionals and employees in the marketplace, serving our clients. we're number one in transportation facilities and environment globally. and we've proven our ability to operate and to drive margin improvement. there are things that we can focus on, that we've proven we can focus on that will drive the profitability of the business. again, as i sort of think about what we've been working our way through is we've had a workforce that has been focused on keeping our people safe.
their families safe and our clients safe and delivering for our clients. we've been focused on maintaining a workforce so that when the pandemic is over, we emerge stronger than ever, given the phenomenal franchises that we have. and we've been maintaining the business to health and achieving our targets. so i frankly don't see why there would be a discount. and ultimately, if there remains a discount, we'll be in the market again, buying our stock cheaply.
michael feniger -- bank of america` -- analyst
fair enough, troy. and just lastly, like i know there's a lot of scenarios. we've gone on with 25% of your business that's state and local. just if we do, just to level-set and have a base case, if we wake up and the fast act is just like you get a cr, a one year kind of punt to post-elections, i'm curious how you feel like you can manage through that. is that a steady as you go? is that a negative outcome?
just anything you can kind of drill down on if that scenario plays out. just a one year extension with a little bit of help to munis and states. is that still a positive scenario? is that a base case for you that you can muddle through? and that would be great.
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. look, i think maybe just to try and highlight what the headline is, we obviously think about a number of different scenarios, and we do a lot of different scenario planning as we have done throughout the entire pandemic. and even under all of those scenarios, we have confidence in our ability to grow earnings in 2021.i couldn't pick on one single item and say this is a plus and this is a minus.
we manage the entire business, and there is funding available in some of those places in our business that has improved, and there's some places where there's some uncertainty. but through all of this, we're confident of what we can control. we're confident in the franchises, the people that are here. and that we're confident in growing earnings next year.

steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
how are you thinking about the trajectory of the building construction business over the next couple of years? are you anticipating or preparing for this to have some softness? and what are some of the things you can do to mitigate a cyclical downturn? and then does it kind of hold the same strategic importance to the framework as it has held in the last few years?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. even as we look forward from where we are today, we see that business growing next year, and we think that it grows at a double-digit rate. and again, that's built on the strength of the backlog that we built up over the course of the last two years. it does give great visibility into the future. as we look out beyond that, certainly, there's going to be a change in the nature of the opportunities that we'll pursue. but what we've experienced over the last few years is we've moved into different elements of the business and focused on where our clients are investing in infrastructure.
so we'll continue to do that. and so it's difficult at this point to say, here's a long-term view other than we know that it's a great franchise. we know that we have an ability to continue to serve those clients as they are investing in certain sectors of the market, and we have a lot of visibility to the backlog in that business.

okay. and certainly, the size of the backlog is one of the strengths of the company at the moment. we are hearing from some of the some of the peers about a slowing burn rate at the existing backlog. so i guess wondering to what extent are you seeing that in any elements of your business, be it airports or any of the building business and kind of how you would be how you would manage that from here?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. the answer is across the elements of the business, we are seeing deferrals of work. the place that i made mention earlier was just in our environment business where we're seeing the largest and most obvious deferral of work. but it is happening. i believe it is a short-term phenomenon, certainly in the areas of transportation and water. but what we are experiencing is, again, as i said, in those marketplaces, so far in the third quarter, we believe we've been taking some market share.
so our capture rate has been improving even as opportunities or award opportunities have been deferred or moved to the right. so again, it's we have a lot of confidence based on the underlying capabilities in the business. and then through that, through active management, we believe that we can continue to improve the trajectory in the business health of the business.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
okay. it sounds good. thanks.
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from adam thalhimer with thompson, davis. your line is now open.
adam thalhimer -- thompson, davis -- analyst
thanks. hi guys, congrats on a good q3.
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
adam thalhimer -- thompson, davis -- analyst
in the largest cities like a place like new york, what are you guys seeing on the front end? i mean, on the one hand, you have kind of a lot of talk about de-urbanization from a place like new york, but on the other, rates are super low. so how do those two factors kind of play out?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that becomes a difficult question to answer. it depends. there's a lot of there's again, there are a lot of within a city like new york, obviously, we do a lot of different types of work in a lot of different markets. if you're referring to our construction management markets, again, we really see the benefit in those markets just coming from change. what you described, there's certainly uncertain conditions but it's not going to be a discontinued investment.
there's going to be investment that we'll put forward over time. and our business is well positioned to take advantage of that. but in terms of, again, construction management, we are seeing opportunities in some of the major cities here in north america. but we certainly are seeing our clients thinking or rethinking some of the decisions that they might be making for the future.
adam thalhimer -- thompson, davis -- analyst
so you would say if you've seen any weakness, it's been more on the design side more so than construction management?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
again, i'd say that again as i said, in our private markets, you see it on the design side of private markets. we see the we're seeing the weakness.
adam thalhimer -- thompson, davis -- analyst
okay. and then just kind of a modeling question. corporate sg&a, what's a good run rate to use for that?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's $40 million to $45 million for the quarter.
adam thalhimer -- thompson, davis -- analyst
okay. and then last one, just on federal spending in fiscal 2021. i know the fed's still a good client for you, not as big as it was when you had ms, but what are you seeing in the budgets for federal spending next year?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we're not anticipating any significant declines in the clients that we typically do our work for. again, you think about that, that's a large client, like the corps of engineers.
adam thalhimer -- thompson, davis -- analyst
so you and you just see them stable next year?
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes.
adam thalhimer -- thompson, davis -- analyst
okay, great, thanks for the color.

william gabrielski -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, operator. i would like to direct your attention to the safe harbor statement on page one of today's presentation. today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about future business and financial expectations, including expected and potential impacts of the covid-19 pandemic. actual results may differ significantly from those projected in today's forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, including the risks described in our periodic reports filed with the sec. except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. we are using non-gaap financial measures in our presentation.
the appropriate gaap financial reconciliations are incorporated into our presentation where available, which is posted on our website. as a reminder, we sold the management services business earlier this year and intend to exit our remaining at-risk, self-perform construction businesses. as a result, these businesses are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements. today's comments will focus on continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. today's references to adjusted operating margins reflect segment level performance for the americas and international segments. we will refer to net service revenue or nsr, which is defined as revenue excluding subcontractor and other direct costs.
our discussion of margins will be on an nsr basis, unless otherwise noted. beginning today's call is mike burke. mike?
michael burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, will, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. i'm joined by troy rudd, our chief financial officer; and as we announced in june, our incoming ceo; lara poloni, chief executive of our emea business and incoming president; and randy wotring, our chief operating officer. i'll begin today's discussion with a high-level summary of our results. troy and lara will then review our performance and outlook in greater detail, before turning the call over for a question-and-answer session. i'm proud of our people and very pleased with our q3 fy 2020 results. for a seventh consecutive quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in ebitda, while hitting our free cash flow targets, continuing to win great new work, growing backlog and advancing our transformation into our industry's premier professional services firm.
for the third quarter, we delivered adjusted ebitda of $187 million, which is an increase of 18% over the prior year and above our expectations for the quarter. the benefits of our ongoing initiatives to expand margins contributed to this outcome. the segment adjusted operating margin was 13.2%, an increase of 250 basis points over the prior year, setting a new quarterly record for the professional services business. with $3.1 billion in new project wins during the quarter, our backlog increased by 16% over the prior year and remains near a record. we have more than three years of revenue and backlog and record contracted backlog. this visibility provides us with many strengths to outperform, including the ability to maintain a strong workforce and provide more certainty for our teams, which include the best and brightest minds in our industry.
troy, lara, randy and i all share pride in the incredible efforts our employees are making each day to address our clients' needs. their efforts continue to make the difference in aecom rising above an operating environment that changes almost daily because of the covid-19 pandemic. given the tremendous progress we are making with substantially improved financial performance and the smooth leadership transition, i plan to accelerate my departure from aecom and transition my responsibilities to troy rudd on august 15. while we are only six weeks into our transition, troy and lara have already proven they are ready to lead this company immediately. i see no reason to further delay this transition. we are all excited about what the future holds for aecom under their leadership, and we are ready to accelerate the transition to more quickly take advantage of the opportunities in front of us.
i remain highly confident in the continued upward trajectory of the business under troy's leadership. the transformation of our business is not yet complete, but over the past two years, we have simplified our organization through the sale of our management services business, lowered our risk tolerance, improved our margins by almost 500 basis points since fy 2018 and built the foundation for an incredibly resilient and agile business that allowed us to outperform our sector during the pandemic. after six years, this will be the final time i speak with all of you as ceo of aecom. i want to thank our shareholders, employees and all our stakeholders, everyone who counts on the value aecom creates. i came to aecom 15 years ago, drawn by its purpose to build a better world.
in that time, we've grown from a private company with $1.5 billion in revenue to a public company and market leader with $21 billion in revenue last year. our innovation and expertise have given rise to iconic projects around the world from modern airports, ports and transportation systems to the rebuilding of the world trade center. while the look and focus of our great company continues to evolve, the purpose that aligns our professionals around the world is stronger than ever. this has been particularly evident in our response to the coronavirus and the results we are achieving. aecom is built for moments like these, and our q3 results and fy 2020 outlook highlight the momentum that through troy's and lara's continuing guidance will carry forward well into the future. i have the utmost confidence that they will continue the incredible trajectory of our business that we have experienced over the past two years.
with that, and to go into further detail on our performance, i want to hand it over to our next ceo, troy rudd.
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, mike. i plan to get into additional detail about our financial performance and discuss our strategy. but before i begin, i want to offer a huge thank you to mike. under mike's leadership, aecom has experienced phenomenal growth and transformed the company into a market leader whose innovation, technology and infrastructure solutions are unrivaled in our industry. he's inspired countless professionals, including me, with his vision and strategic focus. he's been unwavering in his commitment to shareholders as well as to our employees and our clients around the world who align our counsel, ideas and infrastructure. personally, mike has been a strong thought partner, someone i have always been able to count on for constructive feedback. i'm certain that i'll be a much better ceo for having the honor of working with mike these past six years.
please turn to the next slide. i've been asked, what defines a great professional services business? my answer is always the same, it is the strength of the people within the organization, enabled and empowered by leadership to succeed in the marketplace that defines a great professional services business. my viewpoint is affirmed by my more than 11 years of experience at aecom and having spent my entire career at professional services organizations. aecom is a great professional services business with a limitless future. as my role in the organization expands, i'm fortunate to have the support of strong partners, including lara poloni in the role of president, and the rest of the executive team. we will continue to enable and empower the most talented workforce in the industry to reach our full potential.
today, aecom is a critical partner to the world's largest governments, companies and organizations who are leading change in urbanization, expanding transportation networks and transforming our environment and water infrastructure, and keeping us safe. it bears emphasizing that we are consistently ranked the number one transportation and facility design firm and the number one environment firm in the world by enr, and we hold leading positions in several other market sectors.over the past few years, we have taken several steps toward our transformation into a pure play professional services business. we are derisking the business profile. we are we are derisking the business profile. we are making investments in people and digital innovations to expand our market share and deepen our client engagement.
we are removing unnecessary costs from the organization through a simple operating model, which improves our agility, expand our margins and increases returns on capital. finally, we have a leadership team executing against a shared objective of building the leading professional services firm and creating value for our stakeholders. our leadership team is executing several priorities toward achieving this vision. first, our commitment to our professionals is critical to our success. we are investing in our people and innovation and fostering a culture that promotes equity, diversity and inclusion, contributing to the communities in which we operate and creating a culture of one aecom. as a global company, we have firsthand insight into the benefits of a truly diverse employee base, and with it, the benefits from incorporating different perspectives and experiences into our culture to create unique experiences for our people and our clients.
to this point, we are advancing reverse mentoring programs and enhanced internship opportunities, along with enhanced community engagement programs and volunteering efforts. with more diverse teams brought to bear on our projects, the best and brightest ideas will succeed within our company. second, we are investing to lead our industry's digital transformation. the pace of digital transformation has intensified because of covid and has magnified the benefits of our long-standing investments in it and innovation. third, we will work tirelessly to eliminate inefficiencies and to create capital to invest. plenty of opportunity still exists within aecom. for instance, our workplace of the future initiative has identified an even greater opportunity to optimize our real estate portfolio in tandem with increased employee preference for greater workplace flexibility.
this is an opportunity both within aecom's walls as well as an opportunity for us to help our clients adapt to similarly changing employee preferences. we're also expanding our global shared services and design centers, with greater proliferation of our digital solutions furthering our ability to execute certain tasks from better cost geographies. all of these actions are critical to creating capital to invest in our teams. finally, through our investments in teams and innovation, we are building a highly cash-generative and enduring business model. to maximize value for our shareholders, we are committed to our capital allocation priorities, including returning substantially all available free cash flow. please turn to the next slide. turning to our third quarter performance.
i'm really proud of how the organization has come together and with our performance over the past several months. as mike discussed, we exceed our expectation for ebitda. margins improved substantially over the prior year with strength in both segments and free cash flow was strong. our backlog has increased 16% over the prior year, creating even greater visibility into the future. in june, we saw the pace of awards slow in certain markets as the impact of covid spread. however, we were able to offset these pockets of weakness by leading our industry in covid-related response work and by continuing to innovate and deliver for our clients. please turn to the next slide for a discussion of our segment performance. in the americas, organic nsr grew by 2%.
this performance was led by double-digit growth in our construction management business and by market share gains in our largest design markets, transportation and water. however, other markets declined during the quarter, including in environment, which is more heavily weighted to the private sector and the oil and gas clients. the americas segment had a 17.9% adjusted operating margin, which marked a 340 basis point improvement over the prior year and leads our industry. this is a new high for the business. backlog in the americas segment increased by 18% over the prior year and includes a record contracted backlog. however, trends in some markets are beginning to be impacted by funding uncertainty and slower client decision-making. our state and local clients are impacted by lower tax collections. these clients came into the year with record revenues in rainy day funds.
the impact of covid has altered the landscape. it's important to note, though, that while state budgets are under pressure, 95% of state transportation department funding is supported by specific user fees. this funding is much more insulated and less discretionary than other markets where state general funds comprise the majority of funding. one thing is certain, states will make an infusion of capital to maintain or increase current spending levels. importantly, both parties have expressed support for an advanced proposal to replace the fast act and to support state and local governments. as clarity around funding solidifies, we expect our state and local clients to act with greater certainty. we remain focused on what we can control, specifically in running the business as profitably as possible in any environment.
i'll now turn the call over to lara for a discussion of our international performance.
lara poloni -- chief executive officer of emea
thank you, troy. please turn to the next slide. for the quarter, organic nsr declined by 3%. declines in the u.k. and middle east, along with stable trends in hong kong were partially offset by continued growth in australia. the turnaround of our international margins continues to progress. our adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 5.7%, a 50 basis point increase over the prior year. year-to-date, the adjusted operating margin has increased by 170 basis points, which is a particularly strong achievement considering the 2% decline in organic nsr over this same period. when i assumed responsibility for the emea region, the opportunity to improve margins was apparent. as a result, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of our overhead cost structure and the return profile of the business in each of our markets.
this analysis resulted in actions to consolidate our real estate portfolio in the region, reductions to our g&a to eliminate unnecessary costs and increase efficiencies and our ongoing exits of more than 30 countries. to that end, our performance this year inspired confidence in our trajectory. we have driven $16 million of year-to-date g&a savings in the international segment, and we have focused the business on our best growth opportunities. our actions position us well to benefit as markets recover, and our recent large wins across the region have resulted in market share gains. backlog was highlighted by 6% growth in the emea region. we have made investments over the past several years to ensure we are well positioned on enduring work in the middle east, and we have reestablished our leadership position in the u.k., where we have successfully won positions on more than 250 frameworks, positioning us well for future growth, including most recently securing a leading position on the gbp500 million four year services framework, the transport for london.
in the middle east, conditions in petro-dollar funded countries are impacted by low oil and gas prices, which is providing some resistance to growth. however, we continue to build a strong backlog of business for mega-project developments in saudi arabia, including a more than $100 million win in the quarter, which demonstrates our commercial successes and diversifies our work on projects that remain a priority for our clients. as we look across conditions in our international markets, there are pockets of strengths contrasted against certain covid-related headwinds in various countries. in the eu, government stimulus efforts, including the nearly $1 trillion plan that passed last month, could provide for a strong pipeline of opportunities over the coming years. in the asia pacific region, stimulus actions in hong kong and australia have helped to stabilize market conditions and backlog remained stable as a result. however, covid-related headwinds in southeast asia have delayed the pace of award activity and may offset some of the growth opportunities we've seen of the market. importantly, our utilization in the region remains high.
our year-to-date nsr has held steady with the prior year, and our actions to reduce costs and drive efficiencies have resulted in year-to-date profitability that is ahead of our original plan for the year. before turning the call back to troy, i want to comment on my recent appointment as president, partnering with troy and the great leadership team as we continue on our journey to create the best professional services business. as troy said in his remarks, a great professional services business is defined by the strength of its people. and as leaders, it is incumbent on this team to enable and empower their success. we must inspire the best minds in the industry to solve the world's most complex and unique challenges. we must measure what matters, such as client satisfaction and voluntary employee attrition and reward and celebrate winning.
equally as important though is holding ourselves and the organization accountable for delivering on our objectives. it is our job to evaluate opportunities and direct capital to the right projects and initiatives that will have the most meaningful impact. we must also know when to make calculated investments and trust our teams to challenge the limits of what is possible. after 25 years with aecom, i am excited as ever about our future because i know that every challenge we face and overcome builds an even stronger organization with dedicated people who are passionate about the possibilities to create a great aecom. i look forward to getting to know all of you in the future.
and with that, i'll turn the call back to troy.
troy rudd -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, lara. please turn to the next slide. turning to cash flow, liquidity and capital allocation. our financial position is strong with a low-risk business model, strong balance sheet and a highly cash-generative business. operating cash flow in the quarter was $186 million and free cash flow was $272 million. this performance was consistent with our expectations and was highlighted by strong collections across the enterprise. we also successfully collected $122 million as a result of the previously announced favorable net working capital true-up related to the sale of the management services business. as a reminder, the ms cash flow during the first four months of the fiscal year was well below the contribution we expected in our initial guidance. this was a timing-only difference. accordingly, we've collected the working capital in the third quarter with no material impact to our results for the full year.
debt declined compared to the second quarter, and our gross leverage ratio declined from 3.1 times to 2.8 times, further improving our financial flexibility. i'm also pleased to report that we are continuing to take actions that strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity. on july 31, we issued a notice of redemption to our holders of our 5% 2022 notes. the redemption will be funded by the proceeds under our existing lower-cost, delayed draw term loan facility that we put in place last quarter. importantly, as a result of this transaction, the annual cash interest expense will be approximately $6 million lower. going forward, we will target gross leverage of below three times, which we believe will provide us with the best capital structure to operate the business and to execute on our capital allocation priorities.
after investing in our people and innovation, our priority remains deploying substantially all available free cash flow to share repurchases. please turn to the next slide. i want to provide a brief update on our discontinued operations. we are closely managing the operations of these businesses to ensure risk is controlled and the business value is retained. to this point, i am pleased to report that the underlying profitability improved in both the civil and oil and gas businesses, which generated positive ebitda. excluding additional costs to complete the alliant combined cycle gas plant, power also generated positive ebitda. importantly, we achieved substantial completion on the alliant plant in july. our process to exit our at-risk, self-perform construction businesses has intensified with several processes running in parallel.
there is strong interest and exiting these businesses remains a top priority. finally, i am pleased to note that through our restructuring actions this year, we have fully eliminated stranded costs associated with the sale of the management services business earlier this year and other businesses we've exited. please turn to the next slide. as you heard today, the business is resilient and we are energized by the opportunities in front of us. productivity has remained strong even as up to 90% of our employees continued to work remotely. utilization levels are ahead of our pre covid levels and are consistent with the levels that were contemplated in our full year plan.
with that, we are increasing our fiscal 2020 adjusted ebitda guidance to $720 million to $740 million, representing 11% growth at the midpoint. our guidance includes an expected $20 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency rates as compared to our initial guidance for the year. we continue to expect aecom capital to contribute $10 million of earnings this year. we are also reiterating our free cash flow guidance of $100 million to $300 million and are confident that we will fall within this range based on strong quarter-to-date collections and normal seasonal trends that tend to benefit our fourth quarter cash flow.
with that, operator, we're now ready for questions.

operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from sean eastman with keybanc capital. your line is open.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, team. thanks for taking my questions.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
hi.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
i just wanted to get some more color on the advisory and program management growth strategy that you guys introduced this quarter. how would you characterize the growth opportunity here and how would you characterize the benefit to the client of having aecom that involves earlier and, sort of, stick around longer?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. sean, thank you for the question. first, just in a word, i would characterize the growth opportunity as extraordinary. so when we think about the opportunity to help our clients, they've got large infrastructure investments and programs that will be rolled out over the course of the next year, and we believe that those will go on for, frankly, for decades. and also, with all of the decarbonization agenda or decarbonization ambitions that our clients have, we also again see that similar opportunity. there is large capital investments that will be made that would last perhaps for a decade, and we seriously see ourselves being perfectly positioned, given our technical ability to support them. and also, this may be lost, but we actually are a global leader in program management already. so it's not like we're starting from zero. look at the enr rankings. we sit at the top; the top of that group. so we already have a great base and experience upon which we can fulfill those ambitions.
that was the reason that we're making the investment bringing people on board. we were really happy to have drew jeter join us, who's a recognized leader in the industry and is taking over our leadership of global program management. so again, we see this as a very sizable business in the future and i don't think it will grow in terms of percent. we think this has the opportunity to grow in terms of multiples of the business that we do today. so -- and along that point, just maybe to help make this a little more real about what this means in terms of our clients and how we would help them, lara, if you wouldn't mind, maybe i could ask you just to give the example of what we're doing for the neom project in saudi arabia.
lara poloni -- president
so -- and thanks for the question, sean. to troy's point, and we're very excited about this is our most significant growth opportunity looking forward. and in the case of neom, many of you know, they're a -- these are the new [indecipherable] cities of the future in the kingdom of saudi arabia and we assisted the kingdom with a lot of front-end support. it wasn't just project control and different to traditional program management offering that many often talk about. there was a lot of front-end advisory support to help them start the project, consider the sort of technology that would be required and really the approvals, all the permitting and regulatory issues and those sorts of services at the beginning. and then, of course, that evokes a program management, support, contract admin, and then all of the technical and environmental support that we are very strongly placed to deliver and in more recent time, that role expanded to include all of the very complex backbone, utilities and transport infrastructure.
so that evolution from early front-end advisory support to the more traditional place that we play for our clients and bringing the full weight of global multi-disciplinary teams that a client like that expects from aecom and all performed in a fully digital environment. so it's a very comprehensive opportunity for us and one that we're very excited about and for the great pipeline, and we really look forward to sharing more of the detail on that at our upcoming virtual investor day. so, thanks for the question, sean.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, lara. and, sean, maybe just a simple way to think about this is what we're talking about is not delivering projects, we're actually -- this program management is delivering outcomes for clients and a simple way to think about it would be, again, in terms of an olympic games. instead of delivering a venue, which you might do in terms of the design or the construction of it, we actually would be involved as program managers and delivering the games, so delivering the outcome of a successful olympic games, and that's the difference. we just -- we look at what our people are already doing and the large change that's going to go on in the world and we see this is our, again, as lara said, our most substantial growth opportunity.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
okay, great. i appreciate the color on that. and my second one is just on the margins. clearly a stronger than expected start to the year. but the full year margin guidance is intact. so i'm just wondering how you'd characterize that? i mean, is this just kind of prudent conservatism early in the fiscal year, or is there something maybe unsustainable from a cost perspective helping the first quarter results?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, sean, in terms of our margins for the year, we believe, first of all, these are sustainable. there is no temporary items that we believe are built into the margins that would cause us to back away from our ambitions for the year. i would describe this as us being prudent. we are still in an uncertain environment in fiscal 21, and i certainly don't want to make any projections or predictions that would be aggressive in this environment. so we're sticking to our 13.2% for the year. certainly, our 13.1% in the first quarter, we were very pleased by, and it certainly gives us more confidence in achieving the full year -- in the full year result.
the other point i'll make about within those margins, and this is difficult to see, but we've continued to invest in business development. and we've invested more in our -- in this year that run through those margins than we have in the prior period. and again, we've done that because we have conviction about the opportunities in the marketplace and we see the opportunity to position for things that are going to come into the market in the second half of '21 and into fiscal '22.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
that's super helpful responses, guys. i'll turn it over.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from michael feniger with bank of america. your line is open.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. just following up on that, the margins are impressive, but there is a view, troy, that aecom is cost-cutting its way to growth with another quarter of organic decline. one of your peers reported today saying it has visibility to grow in fiscal year 2022. i'm not asking you right now for a '22 outlook. but based on what you're seeing on a state level, customer level, some of your initiatives, do you see momentum for organic growth to really return to aecom in 2022 and that your growth is going to be more driven outside of just being able to cost-cut?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, thanks for the question. again, the answer -- the simple answer is absolutely yes. we do see growth into '22 and let me give a little bit of color on that, and certainly in terms of our margins. so we have reduced costs in the organization. we've created efficiency in the organization and that absolutely has benefited our margins. but today, what we're doing is we're driving efficiency in how we actually deliver the work and we run the business. and so, again, i view that as being sustainable and as i already made the point, we are not cutting our investment in business development or cutting our investment in the future in achieving those margins. and i'll say it, we believe that those are sustainable margins and we still have room to improve, and i'll certainly share more of that when we get to our investor day -- virtual investor day on the 16th.
when i look at this year, again, we said that this year was going to be challenged and we expected our revenue to be around flat for the year. when we look at the first quarter, we had tough comps. last year, there was -- those were pre-covid periods. so in terms of where we think we are, i believe that we are holding our own and gaining market share in some challenging markets. we are investing in growth in the future and i don't see that growth coming in fiscal '22. i see this year continuing to be flat, but i do view there being substantial upside as we move into '22. so growth in '22 and beyond. and again, we'll share more of them -- those ambitions in detail when we get to our investor day.
in terms of the backlog in the pipeline, we are seeing some growth in our backlog, but i think, more importantly, if i talk about our pipeline, in particular, in our design business in the americas, we are seeing the pipeline start to get back to pre-covid levels, which is indicating our clients are gearing up to let out work in the second half of the year and fiscal '22, which again leads us to believe there is a significant opportunity to grow into '22 and beyond.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
that's -- thanks, troy. that's helpful. and just on -- you kind of touched on some of the funding initiatives. i mean, yeah, we saw the fast act is extended, we just saw the covid relief package, i think, extending $40 billion to transportation markets.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
but, like, outside of the big bang infrastructure package, obviously, that would be the home run, outside of that, what signposts are you looking for that can be a catalyst outside of that big infrastructure package? so there's a new epa chief there, there's pfas regulations in the headlines, are there any catalysts that we should be monitoring that would maybe drive momentum outside of the whole infrastructure package in the environmental and water-type areas that we should be keeping an eye on? thanks.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, ok. well, actually, you kind of did my job for me by relisting all of those. but when we look -- we look at what -- again, so what we're looking toward is we're looking predominantly -- saw levels of federal funding and we are seeing levels of federal funding improving. now -- and i'm not thinking about what might come or what president biden has announced in his agenda, that would be kind of upside for the future. we haven't built our plans around that. we also look at our state and local governments and what has been difficult for them has been funding levels. funds have been devoted to fighting the pandemic, but we've actually started to see a return of funding to those customers. and a lot of the funding doesn't come through the federal budget, a lot of it comes through user fees and it comes through other measures. so we're seeing because people are returning a little bit toward normal, we're seeing funding start to build up within our state and local government clients, and there is no doubt that if there is a package that is passed -- the stimulus package is passed, it will help our state and local government clients. but we're -- again, we're seeing the kind of the green shoots around funding as people are returning to work and businesses started to head in the right direction, so some growth in the economy here in the u.s.
worldwide, it's a little bit different. we've actually seen some governments already step up to the plate and provide levels of funding for infrastructure programs. and so we've seen that building in australia and new zealand. we see that certainly building in canada and as lara had pointed out in her previous points is that in the u.k., we are very confident we've been taking significant market share. so even while the funding hasn't been building in that market, we're confident that we are positioning ourselves through our framework wins to grow based on what will be available in the future in that market.
lara poloni -- president
and if i can just add a couple of just very quick points. i mean, i think, infrastructure is obviously the main area of exponential growth and even in the quarter, we did see growth in australia because that pipeline continues to be very strong for us. we've secured all the major infrastructure projects. we had growth in asia, again, on the back of some strong infrastructure programs. but the other exponential growth play that we talked about previously, we're feeling pretty bullish about extending our market leadership in the pfas space, which you mentioned. we think that's a $100 billion-plus opportunity over time, and we have market leadership and then we're very excited about the above and beyond which exists, which is really our niche area in terms of the disruptive technology where we have a pilot, we're hoping to commercialize that later this year, that's another example. and then, of course, the program management, which is sort of trade to full-time course opportunity. so they're just a few examples of very big sort of exponential growth play that i think we can absolutely signpost along the way over the next few quarters and couple of years.

and your next question comes from andy kaplowitz with citigroup. your line is open.
andy kaplowitz -- citigroup -- analyst
good morning, guys.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
good morning.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
good morning.
andy kaplowitz -- citigroup -- analyst
troy, or gaur, is there a better way to frame the piece of operating improvement in cost takeout that you are in the middle of, because, obviously, it seems to have accelerated in the first couple of quarters that you've been ceo, troy. for instance, your sales were down sequentially and then it's our basis but both segments recorded margin up 50 basis points sequentially. so can you give us a read of how much additional streamlining you've done since you took over as ceo and what that can mean for aecoms progression toward that 15% longer-term margin goal?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, andy, what i'm going to do is i just want to make a headline comment on it, and then i'll pass it over to gaur to give some more of the details. but in terms of the streamlining changes that we've made, for the most part, we haven't made those. if you look at our results for the quarter, again, you see that we have very little restructuring plan for the year. we've put most of this behind us. our results are -- i believe, to be very clean. so we've taken the actions to restructure the business and now as we move forward, we've really ingrained in our culture, a focus on efficiency and in continuing to deliver and focus on the work we're bidding in and how we deliver against those margin targets.
so we've kind of taken the actions in the past and we certainly have a little bit of work that we'll do in the future, which gaur will give you little details on. but i view this as kind of changing the culture in terms of our efficiency in running the business and delivery. it's not a significant action undertaken. we have to take on the move from here.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
yeah. andy, this is gaur. just adding on to that, troy is absolutely right. simply put, this is the annualized benefit of restructuring that we performed last year and that's why you see such a symmetry between our gaap and adjusted results. we have minimal restructuring going forward, but consistent with the messaging, right, being in the upper echelon of margin delivery in our industry, we're not satisfied with that. our goal, our vision is to achieve 15% margins, which we will provide more detail during our upcoming virtual investor relation day next week. and if you were to say, well, what's -- what exactly is changing in the current year, why are we ahead -- maybe a little bit ahead in q1? i think it really has to go toward the new organizational structure that troy put in place as well. right? we have really created a dynamic environment that is allowing us to leverage best practices in terms of cost structuring globally and executing on as quickly as possible because we no longer have the multiple layers as we had in the past.
andy kaplowitz -- citigroup -- analyst
helpful, guys. and then, you did mention a decline in your construction management backlog, but still good visibility. so could you tell us how you're thinking about the growth of that business? i know you've had several years or you have several years of backlog coverage. but how does that business factor into your growth assumptions for flat this year and return to growth in '22?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. well, again, just in terms of our construction management business, again, it represents about 10% of the profit in the nsr of our business overall. and again, we see the environments that the construction management business is in has been challenging. there is no question that there are being -- there are decisions on projects being delayed and even some of the work being delayed on some of our existing projects. so i view that as we're going to be burning off some backlog during the course of this year. the great thing about that business is we certainly have multiple years; more than three years of backlog. and when we look at the pipeline of the opportunities, the actual pipeline of opportunities and the things that we've been pursuing, that isn't really shrinking. so i think the story around construction management is more about delays and decisions and projects and maybe some changes in scope. but we certainly don't -- we don't see kind of a long-term decline in the opportunities for that business.
andy kaplowitz -- citigroup -- analyst
thanks, troy. great, thanks, andy.

your next question comes from the line of andrew wittmann with baird. your line is open.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
okay. thanks for taking my questions. i guess, most of my questions have been asked and answered, but i thought there could be a couple of technical questions that'd be helpful for us all to understand. and, gaur, starting with you, what's the expected annualized interest rates savings from the renegotiated [indecipherable] facility that you guys announced last night.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
andy, we expect for 2021, it will be $2 million to $3 million. but on a full run rate basis, it will be $4 million to $5 million.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
okay and then just in terms of the cash flows here, obviously, looks like you guys are trying to smooth out the seasonality and that's great. i assume that part of that is the sale of receivables, but how are you doing it in terms of managing the other parts of the working capital in terms of dso collections and the payables? what's the process that you're using to get better, i don't know, smoother quarter-to-quarter variations in cash flows and what's the customer experience of that? is this -- is it burning the customers, is it burning your employees? how does it work to do that, just mechanically?
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
sure, absolutely. as i mentioned during our fourth quarter year-end call last year, a key priority for us from cash flow standpoint was not to have the seasonality as we had previously experienced. and there are some key contributors to that. right? one is it's a simple byproduct of us becoming a true professional services organization, which is lower risk, higher margin profile, aided by more predictability in our cash flow, because of the disposal of our at-risk businesses. we're no longer burdened by those huge variations of large construction projects. and a key change we made in the current year is we've aligned our operational incentives to align with our cash flow phasing, instead of just being an annual target.
and in terms of the specifics, you really have to look at how we are transforming our organization operationally and the finance transformation we're going through. this allows us to utilize shared services, where again we leverage best practices on invoicing, billing and collections across the board, globally, where instead of having these services being provided in various geographies, you're in a center of best practices and leveraging it globally.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
got it, thank you for your answers.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
yeah.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from jamie cook with credit suisse. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good morning, nice quarter. i guess just two follow-up questions. one on the cash flow. i appreciate how you have this figured out, how you're doing better sort of seasonality with regards to your cash flow. but given the success that you had in the first quarter relative to the past few years, is it fair to assume you see sort of the mid-to-high end of your free cash flow guidance as more achievable just because of where we're starting the year off; i guess is my first question.
and then my second question just relates to, troy, it sounds like the portfolio that you have in place after getting rid of some of the assets, the construction at-risk business, the management services, i'm just wondering, if you look at your portfolio, is there anything else that potentially isn't core to aecom or there are holes in your portfolio that could help you achieve some of your longer-term goals quicker with the balance sheet where it is? thank you.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thanks, jamie. gaur, why don't you take the cash flow question, and i'll take the second one?
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
absolutely. so, jamie, in regards to cash range, this -- we hit our cash guidance six year in a row and we expect current year to be no different. we feel very confident in the guidance we have provided and expect better than historical phasing, consistent with our performance in q1.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
and the second question, jamie, just on the overall business. i guess, first of all is, i think it's important to make the point that we've been making for a while, which is we're going to constantly evaluate our portfolio of businesses and make sure that we're in the businesses that we believe have the highest returns and the highest growth potential. so that's just going to be part of our dna and our culture. we'll continue to do that. in terms of, as you said, holes in the portfolio, at the moment, i don't see any significant holes in our portfolio and to the extent that we do see that there are some opportunities to add some capability, we are going to do that. but i have no intention of doing that through m&a. there are other means that we can do that, that i think are easier for us to digest and frankly have -- and have a lower cost associated with them. but we certainly have opportunities to grow some capabilities. we will do that, but we anticipate doing that and invest in those capabilities through our margins, not doing m&a.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, thank you.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah.

your next question comes from mike dudas with vertical research. your line is open.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen, lara.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
morning.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
good morning.
lara poloni -- president
morning.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
a part of your business development investment, troy, going forward, certainly, i guess, would be expanding or accelerating your best practice centers, your high value-added centers that aecom has. can you -- how has that been progressing and is that an area where you could see significant help, especially when you're targeting some of the margin potential in the international design business going forward?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, mike, so that is important to us. we had set some pretty ambitious objectives of improving the work that was going through in our design centers. through the pandemic, we've actually modified our thinking around that, that it doesn't have to be design centers. we can actually set up kind of regional design centers. the interesting thing about the pandemic we figured out is that whenever we were working remotely, you can actually connect your teams and have everybody working around the kitchen table quite well. so it means that we can create sort of centers of excellence virtually or even regionally and that's something we've learned through this process.
but more importantly, we're continuing to invest in, what i'm going to refer to as, digital, which is having some of the work that we've done in the past be replaced by script or code and giving our people or freeing up the time of our people to do things that are more innovative or focus on their clients and the project to growth opportunities. so i'm going to talk more about that on the 16th, but that absolutely is a focus of it, and we refer to that as changing the way that our work is delivered.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
i appreciate it and i look forward to...
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
...meeting next week. yeah. i appreciate it and look forward to meeting next week. thanks, troy.

your next question comes from steven fisher with ubs. your line is open.
steven fisher -- ubs securities -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning. you mentioned troy that...
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
good morning.
steven fisher -- ubs securities -- analyst
good morning. you mentioned that americas design customers are gearing up to award more work in the second half. do you have any sense from your conversations with them about what has to happen to give them the confidence to release those project and in what areas do you think you'll most likely see those project releases?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, i think, again it's difficult to pinpoint something, every client conversation is a little bit different. but, generally, it -- through the conversations, it's driven by -- it's, again, driven by sources of funding. and the sources of the funding that is becoming available or the confidence around it becoming available is improving. and in terms of the areas or the opportunities that we we're seeing, we certainly are seeing the opportunities in transportation, in water and also in environment. again, as i said, our construction management business is certainly challenged at the moment and the pipeline is still robust but we have not -- we're not seeing the pipeline or that we have the pipeline growing in the same way that we are in the design business, and certainly in those end markets; transportation, water and environment.
steven fisher -- ubs securities -- analyst
okay. and then just i'm curious -- a curiosity, as we're thinking about margin improvement from here, how important is increased projects, some activity to your plans and how would you characterize the work you're actually turning away at this point? is it more regions or types of customers or services?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
so i wouldn't say that we're turning away work at this point. however, i would say we've set -- we have set return targets for the work that we do. and so we certainly have a process by which we evaluate the returns on our projects and so there might be projects that don't meet our hurdles in terms of returns and there are some other measures that we use to make sure that we're appropriately managing the risk associated with the work that we do. but there is no -- again, there is no trends in terms of us turning away work. we're just thoughtful in terms of what we want to do to help our clients and making sure that it's going to be appropriate in terms of return and the risk that we're taking on.
steven fisher -- ubs securities -- analyst
got it, thanks.

adam thalhimer -- thompson davis & co. -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
good morning, adam.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
good morning.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis & co. -- analyst
wanted to ask about the slower decision-making because it sounds like through this call, it's a little more focused on the u.s. construction management business. is that right?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yes, that is right. i mean, think about it as just in terms of the work that gets done, a lot of the work that we do in that business, it's commercial work, it's been aviation work, and it's been sports -- and sports work. and, again, it's just what we're seeing is that through the pandemic, some of those capital decisions are being rethought or they're being -- again, they're being delayed. so it's not that there aren't those opportunities as we move out into the future. again, decisions around aviation projects, there certainly is a need for that similar to a lot of infrastructure investment. but some of the decisions today, just an environment that we're in, they're being delayed and they may be adjusted or changed.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis & co. -- analyst
and troy, i would think you guys are in the sweet spot for this next u.s. stimulus bill. even if that hit state and local and not transportation, specifically, how quickly could you benefit from that?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
well, it certainly -- if there is -- first of all, we don't have that baked into our result. that's why we're anticipating kind of, say, a flat year in terms of revenue. there is no question that if there is significant funds that are made available either through another covid relief package to support state and local governments or through an infrastructure initiative or program from the biden administration, there is a huge benefit to us and to our industry. but i don't see it being immediate. it takes -- it will take a while when those programs are put in place for then the customers to actually put together the projects that they're looking to receive that investment. so it's probably, certainly, quarters -- a number of quarters before you would see an impact in our business and it could even be a little bit longer than that.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis & co. -- analyst
okay. so it kind of pushes you toward what you said earlier, which is [speech overlap]
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
it does. it pushes us toward fiscal '22, yes.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis & co. -- analyst

will gabrielski -- senior vice president, finance, investor relations
thank you, operator. i would like to direct your attention to the safe harbor statement on page 1 of today's presentation. today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about future business and financial expectations. actual results may differ significantly from those projected in today's forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, including the risks described in our periodic reports filed with the sec. except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
we use certain non-gaap financial measures in our presentation. the appropriate gaap financial reconciliations are incorporated into our presentation where available, which is posted on our website. as a reminder, we sold the management services business last january and sold our power and civil construction businesses in october of 2020 and january of 2021, respectively. these businesses are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements.
today's comments will focus on the continuing operations of the professional services business unless otherwise noted. today's references to margins and adjusted operating margins reflect segment level performance for the americas and international segment. we will also refer to net service revenue or nsr, which is defined as revenue excluding subcontractor and other direct costs. our discussions of nsr growth rates will adjust for two fewer available working days in this year's first quarter as compared to the prior year period. our discussion of margins will be on an nsr basis, unless otherwise noted.
on today's call, troy rudd, our chief executive officer will begin with a review of our strategy and key accomplishment. lara poloni, our president will discuss key operational priorities. and gaurav kapoor, our cfo will review our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. we will conclude with a question and answer session.
with that, i will turn the call over to troy. troy?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you, will. and thank you all for joining us today. i'd like to begin by first acknowledging and thanking our 47,000 professionals who have contributed to a great start for the year and are the key reason for our success and trajectory. i'm proud of how our employees have responded over the past year and continue to focus on the health and safety of their families, clients and communities.
we have built a track record of consistently exceeding our expectations over the past two years and our first quarter performance continued this momentum. this is a direct result of the commitment of our teams to leverage the strength of our platform and delivering amid an uncertain backdrop.
in mid-november, we unveiled think and act globally which outlines the foundation of our strategy and the path forward for aecom with an ambition of setting a new standard of excellence in the professional services industry. we are well on our way. we have dedicated much of our time over the past few months toward implementing key elements of this strategy. as our financial results demonstrate, we are benefiting from a simpler operating structure, strong collaboration, investments in innovation, and delivering the full breadth of our portfolio to our clients across the globe.
i will now turn to a more detailed discussion of our financial results starting on page 3. we exceeded our expectations on every key financial metric in the first quarter. organic revenue increased by 2% and nsr declined by 2% from the prior year. backlog increased by 8% over the prior year and included record contracted backlog, providing strong visibility. our segment adjusted operating margin was 13.1% which marked a 140 basis point increase from last year and a 560 basis point increase from the first quarter of 2018. of note, international margins are now at 7%, which is more than 400 basis points better when we compare to the beginning of fiscal 2019. we are operating the business as efficient as ever, investing in business development opportunities to position for growth and transforming how we deliver through innovation.
adjusted ebitda increased by 9% to $189 million and adjusted eps increased by 35% to $0.62. both of these metrics were ahead of our expectations for the quarter and provide a strong start to the year. we set, as a measurable priority this year, to improve cash flow phasing and i am pleased with our results in the first quarter. operating cash flow was $7 million and free cash flow was a slight use of cash in the quarter. this compares to an average outflow of $230 million in the first quarter over the past two years. this performance, combined with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to repurchase nearly 9% of our shares outstanding since september.
we are increasing our eps guidance to reflect the strong start to the year, the accelerated pace of share repurchases and the lower interest expense associated with the new sustainability and diversity-linked financing. our guidance does not include any prospective repurchases. so it is our expectation that we will continue to deploy cash to buy back stock under the $825 million of capacity remaining on our current board authorization.
please turn to the next slide. reflecting on the first quarter performance, several key points are apparent. first, our teams have embraced our think and act globally strategy. this strategy is driving greater collaboration across the organization and serves as a foundation from which we are pursuing accelerated growth and expanding our industry-leading margins. as a result, we are more deeply engaged with clients. we are expanding our advisory practice to shape how clients plan and execute their priority projects. through our focus on program management, we are supporting clients through their largest and most complex projects. to support growth, we are investing in business developments and key client account programs and we are developing new and more efficient ways of working, led by deploying innovation and scale and executing our workplace of the future initiative to support the growing preference for greater workplace flexibility, and to reduce our real estate costs.
second, we have created a culture of continuous improvement and we are setting new standards for profitability in the industry. we are focused on driving efficiencies across the organization and for our clients. as a result, we are delivering industry-leading margins and unlocking capital to invest in growth and innovation.
third, we have narrowed our focus to our higher-margin and lower-risk professional services businesses. over the past few months, we completed the exits of our power and civil construction businesses. as a result, our leaders are now exclusively focusing their time and resources on our largest, fastest-growing and most profitable endeavors.
fourth, several inherent attributes of our business enable us to perform and continue to invest through periods of uncertainty. these include the proven agility of our workforce, a highly variable cost structure with low capital intensity, a substantial backlog with several years of visibility, industry-leading client satisfaction and strong cash flow.
finally, we are complementing our strong team with new leaders and fresh perspectives. last month, we announced the appointments of jennifer aument as global lead for transportation, and drew jeter as global lead for program management. both are world-class leaders who bring proven track records of success and we are energized by the positive response we have received from both our teams and our clients since their appointments. we will continue to strengthen our teams and invest in our people to ensure we achieve our collective ambitions.
turning to review of our markets beginning in the americas. our teams remain focused on building a sustainable future and we are bringing elements of sustainability to every aspect of what we do. it bears repeating, we are the number one environment firm, the number one transportation design firm, the number one facility design firm as ranked by enr. we are the leader in the pfas market, having spent decades supporting clients, both public and private. and today, we are organized around esg as a key priority within aecom.
the biden administration has outlined an ambitious and broad-based plan that touches nearly every element and what we already do for our clients every day in the markets where we lead. these include transportation infrastructure, clean energy, offshore wind, wetland and coastal restoration and pfas remediation, to name a few. needless to say, we are well-positioned to benefit from the prevailing direction of u.s. policy and funding.
in the near term, as we wait for clarity on a potential larger relief and infrastructure stimulus bill, our u.s. public sector clients continue to face funding challenges. we've seen clients slow their decision-making process and this has impacted our growth over the past several quarters. however, key indicators are trending positively. vehicle miles traveled have recovered notably since the prior lows in april. the enacted covid relief bill in december provides $45 billion for transportation, our largest end market, and includes $14 billion for transit systems across the country, which represents approximately 75% of normal annual funding levels. state tax receipts are benefiting from higher spending due to stimulus funding. these trends matter to aecom. u.s. state and local remains our largest client base at 24% of our nsr and approximately 40% of nsr in the americas.
moving to our construction management business. our contracted backlog increased by 26% and our pipeline remains strong. however, our total backlog declined sequentially and client decision-making has slowed. in addition, our backlog was impacted by a reduction in scope on a large project. so the impact of profitability was more limited as we continue to perform services for the client. positively, during january, we were awarded more than $600 million of wins in our core markets. and in times like these, the value of visibility afforded by our substantial backlog and our leading market position are apparent.
turning to international markets. in the u.k., our market position has greatly improved over the past several years. we've put in place the right people and strategy and we are taking market share. this includes gaining significant positions on several leading public sector frameworks, all of which provide substantial opportunities for growth and provide several years of visibility. in the middle east, our sizable backlog on key programs provides us with several years of visibility, especially in saudi arabia, where we have large rolled-on projects critical to the kingdom's economic diversification efforts. while others are pulling back from the market, given the slowdown in hydrocarbon-related activity, we are managing and delivery large complex and iconic projects, which plays to our strengths. in australia, we continue to execute several large infrastructure projects such as our work on the melbourne metro tunnel, which is supporting high levels of activity. in hong kong, our business was stable and work is progressing on key projects that is supporting high levels of backlog.
across the business, the next six months include a number of macroeconomic uncertainties and we will be constantly vigilant to manage the business and deliver. we are energized by our accomplishments and the level of funding and long-term commitments to infrastructure investments happening across our largest markets. our momentum instills great confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year, and i'm excited by the opportunity to create exceptional value for our employees, our clients and shareholders. i look forward to discussing many of these elements in greater detail at our virtual investor day on february 16.
with that, i will turn the call over to lara.
lara poloni -- president
thanks, troy. please turn to the next slide. as troy detailed, we are focused on driving growth and profitability through a simplified operating structure, greater collaboration across the enterprise and deeper engagement with our clients. we are in an enviable position from which to execute. we maintain a leading position in many of our key markets and our client satisfaction scores reflect the market's acknowledgment of this strength. in fact, our leading position was apparent last week with our number one ranking by fortune as the world's most admired company in our industry, which is a great testament to the value our people bring to their clients and communities every day. these strengths will further flow as the funding environment across our markets improve. and with the u.s. rejoining the paris climate accord and committing to invest to build back stronger, we are energized by the opportunities ahead.
to best position us for growth, we recently announced two key strategic hires with the additions of jennifer aument and drew jeter to further strengthen our already-strong leadership team. we are confident that with our established market leadership in these key practices, both jennifer and drew will hit the ground running.
as we look ahead, we have tremendous opportunity to leverage our competitive advantages, more holistically advise our clients and to gain greater share in the marketplace. a great example of this is the market share gains we have made in the u.k., in particular, where we've been selected for key positions on the $800 million scape framework, which is the u.k.'s leading public sector procurement authority. following several years of delivering for our clients, we successfully gained positions on multiple lots that significantly increased our exposure to this framework. a stated priority for this framework is to generate substantial social value through infrastructure, such as designing new bridges, adding electricity charging points to car parks, renew multiple refurbishments and school extensions.
in addition, we have gained framework positions with the network rail, highways england and transport for london that each has similar priorities on advancing infrastructure to benefit communities. these are precisely the sort of projects where our expertise can be best brought to bear and our focus on esg is directly aligned with our clients' top-most priority.
i'd also like to take a moment to highlight our commitment to advancing our esg initiatives, including our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and to further increase our diversity. we announced a new sustainability-linked credit facility yesterday, and i'm proud that we are one of the earliest u.s. company to do so. this agreement includes incentives and penalties around achieving our publicly stated science based targets for emission reductions, as well as targets for the percentage of women employees across our organization. we are literally putting our money where our mouth is.
we were also pleased with our announcement last month of our fourth consecutive year receiving a perfect score on human rights campaign foundation's corporate equality index. this is a great recognition reflecting our commitment to diversity and inclusion, especially for our lgbtq employees. our teams are energized by the opportunity to further advance our strategic esg and diversity initiatives, and i'm proud of the progress we have already made on this front.
with that, i will now turn the call over to gaur to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
thanks, lara. please turn to the next slide. our first quarter financial performance exceeded our expectations in every key financial metric, including a new high for the first quarter margins, strong ebitda growth and double-digit eps growth. importantly, to capitalize on this performance, we accelerated our repurchase plans, which is underpinning our increased adjusted eps guidance and was driven by our best first quarter free cash flow since 2018. while pockets of uncertainty remain in several of our markets, i am proud of our team's proven ability to deliver. looking forward, we will continue to benefit from our substantial backlog position, including record contracted backlog. in addition, with the highly variable cost structure and continued strong cash flow trends, we are confident in our ability to deliver value.
please turn to the next slide. in the americas, nsr declined by 1% on an organic basis. backlog in the americas increased by 9% including 15% growth in contracted backlog. our construction management backlog declined sequentially but our design backlog grew and affords us strong visibility. although decisions on a few larger pursuits in the construction management business has slowed in the near term, our sizable backlog will continue to provide visibility for the next several years. the americas segment had a 17.5% adjusted operating margin for the quarter and 80 basis points improvement from the prior year. americas margin performance demonstrates an ingrained culture of continuous improvement, even as we continue to deliver industry-leading margins.
please turn to the next slide. turning to the international segment, our nsr declined by 3% on an organic basis. contracted backlog increased by 6% and is at record levels, reflecting our successful efforts to gain market share and win key position on large frameworks. notably, our adjusted operating margin in our international business was 7%, a 230 basis point improvement from the prior year and a 440 basis point improvement since the beginning of fiscal 2019. we are proud of the progress the teams have made to operate more efficiently, while successfully positioning for growth, and we reaffirm our confidence to achieve double-digit international margins.
please turn to the next slide. turning to cash flow, liquidity and capital allocation. as we shared on last quarter's earnings call, we made it a key priority to drive greater consistency in our cash flow phasing. in the first quarter over the past two fiscal years, we have experienced negative free cash flow of approximately $230 million on average. with free cash flow use of $14 million in the quarter, we are pleased to see our efforts quickly translating to results. accordingly, we are reaffirming our $425 million to $625 million free cash flow guidance for the full year. as a reminder, at the midpoint, this reflects 75% unlevered free cash flow conversion of ebitda, which is our long-term forecasted conversion rate on a normalized basis, reflective of highly cash-generative nature of our business.
we continue to drive a strong balance sheet and financial position with gross leverage under 3 times, which is consistent with our long-term target. reflecting our strong balance sheet and business prospects, last night, we announced an amendment and extension of our credit facilities. this reduced our borrowing cost and furthered our commitment to achieving certain esg objectives, creating a cost of capital that is consistent with the high-quality nature of our business. since september, we have completed $630 million of repurchases, which reduced our diluted share count by nearly 9%. and with strong cash generation expected in the remaining three quarters of the year and our ongoing conviction that share repurchases offer the highest return on our capital, we will continue to execute repurchases throughout the year.
please turn to the next slide. this robust start to the year provides confidence in raising our outlook for the full year. we are increasing our adjusted eps guidance to between $2.60 and $2.80 and now expect to deliver 26% growth at the midpoint of our new range. this increase reflects the benefits of our accelerated repurchase activity, as well as lower expected interest expense due to our credit amendment. this guidance contemplates a fully diluted share count of 151 million shares, which only incorporates our repurchases to date.
with that, operator, we are ready for questions.
",2021-Q1,ACM
1.0,1.0,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from sean eastman with keybanc capital. your line is open.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. just in light of the bid activity and award flow improving exiting the quarter, it would just be great to get a little bit more color on how you guys are measuring success around the progress on the organic growth strategy and market share gains. what are you guys tracking there? a little more color on what's giving you confidence that you are indeed gaining share alongside this uplift in activity levels would be helpful.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. sean this is troy. i'm going to go back to just the beginning of the year because we said that during the course of this year, we saw growth being challenged and certainly in the first half of the year. but as we move through the year, we've seen an improvement, a small improvement in the markets that we're participating in and that's been reflected in the pipeline of bids. so that's going a little bit better than we had expected. at the beginning of the year, we said we need to focus on what we can control because we certainly can't control what comes to the market and what our clients have available in terms of funding. so, we focused on our clients and bringing the best that we could do globally for those clients and felt that, that would be improving our market share or our capture rates. and so one of the things that we measure in all of the work that we do in all of our bids is we measure what we call our capture rate, which is effectively, how much we win compared to how much we bid on, and during the course of this year, we've actually seen our capture rates increase 4%. so what that tells us is that improvement i can tell you where it's coming from, but it tells us that we're improving in terms of our capture rates in our market share.
the other thing to rely on and this is more anecdotal is we look at how we rank. and as i pointed out the enr is just gone through the updated rankings and in the markets that we're in, in transportation and environment and in facilities in the program management, we've retained our number one ranking. but more importantly in water, we moved from number three to number two and we did that entirely organically. so it's a combination of those things that tells us that we're taking some market share. and as we move forward, we certainly are seeing [technical issues] momentum building up and it's not going to translate into meaningful revenue improvement. this year, we certainly believe it will next year, but what we're seeing now is our wins in the month of april in our design business have picked up at a faster rate than we've seen in the first half of the year. we've seen our pipeline of opportunities in our design business improve so they are actually back to pre-pandemic levels in terms of what we're going to be bidding on in the future. so again that tells us that things are lining up, so that there will be growth in the business in the future.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful, troy. and i know these types of questions are little tricky to answer, but just in light of the backlog, taking down sequentially and this dynamic where construction management is kind of in more of a burn mode. how much longer does that last? do you think we reach sustained sort of positive inflection point in the backlog as we go into the second half, troy?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. so let me break it into two parts in just following along your question. so in our design business, we've seen our design business in our backlog grow. so during this quarter our design backlog was up 8% and our construction management backlog, obviously was down. but it's again as we had expected, we expected things to burn off that backlog in the quarter. those are the types of longer term decisions that effect even pushed off during the pandemic. but i'll say this, as we certainly did burn off backlog in the second quarter, but we were pleasantly surprised, because we won about $900 million -- little more than $900 million of work in our construction management in the quarter and that was a little ahead of our expectations. and again in terms of the pipeline we are seeing the pipeline of opportunities improve in our construction management business, but certainly not at the level that we're seeing in our design business. and again, just as a reminder, the profitability of the company is driven by our design business. 90% of the profit of the company comes through our design business and 10% comes through construction management.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
okay, got it. one last one from me, a little bit more high level. but one of your peers disclosed an annualized esg related revenue figure. where would you place that number for aecom or perhaps what portion of the aecom's revenue mix have you seen esg actually start to drive accelerated growth opportunities?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yes. so we actually don't have a measure of esg revenue. we haven't called it out separately. and the reason we haven't done that is because we're really seeing in almost all of the work that we're taking on and doing today there is some element of esg included in that. and so it might be focused on improving emissions or lowering carbon, it's focused on improving communities or healthy improve return to prominence. so there is a significant amount of what we're doing in almost everything that we're doing. so we don't look at it as we have a separate esg business. we look at it is that it's a significant part of everything that we're doing. so i'm not going to say that we're -- every dollar is esg revenue, but it certainly is a focus. and just to expand to on that, maybe lara, i could ask you just to give a little more background on scopex, because that really describes how we're including it in the work we do.
lara poloni -- president
yes, sure, thanks, troy. and so, look, i think there are some very big numbers being thrown around and very easy to sort of assign big numbers to entire segments of the market, but i think we're coming -- our strategy, our sustainable legacies strategy, which we just launched last month has been growing very positively by our clients and by our staff. and i would say it's unique in the industry at the moment because it is quite granular and that is because we have -- we are coming from a real position of strength, because we are the largest in the most diverse environmental [indecipherable]. we have some market leadership and real subject matter expertise, when you dig into areas such as climate adaptation or carbon capture and storage and resilience.
so based on some of the, what i would call specialty areas and to troy's point, we as part of our strategy to embed seeing everything we do, one of the commitments that we are really following up on is scopex, which is our project where we are embedding through all of our project work and through our design and action plan on all of our major projects and the commitment there is to reduce carbon impact by at least 50%. so that's pretty bold and i think that will really demonstrate again at a far more granular level just how strongly positioned we are and how we're really in a great position to capitalize on this big momentum in the market at the moment around esg. i hope that answers the question.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital -- analyst
yes, all very helpful responses. i'll turn it over. thanks.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thanks sean.
operator
your next question comes from michael feniger with bmo -- or sorry, bank of america. your line is open.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah, guys, thanks for taking my question. just firstly, you guys have repurchased 10% of your shares. you have the existing share buyback plan. you saw kind of all time highs, are you -- is there any thought troy slowing it down, shifting capital allocation to invest in other areas. i'm curious how you're viewing the capital allocation after repurchasing so much already of your buyback? and then the second question, just the fact that we are going into this growth environment and we're expecting funding to pick up, is there more investment required for you guys to support that. i mean 140 basis points of margin spent in the first half, can you see any temporary pause as you guys maybe invest to support that higher growth back up?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yes, thanks for the questions mike. i'm going to let gaurav take the first one and i'll take the second one.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
hey, mike. this is gaurav. so in response to your first question on repurchases, there is going to be no change to our capital allocation policy. we still continue to see a discount between our valuation and what our peers are currently trading at, where we believe we have superior earnings growth, clean results compared to our peers, our margin expansion story, investment in bd which troy is going to expand upon is going to position us to really capture and monetize on the global infrastructure trends, esg and sustainability that lara and troy just outlined, and this is also further supported by our plan to double our earnings per share by 2024. so repurchases continue to make the most sense for our capital allocation.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
and so with respect to your second question, there is no question that as you head into an environment like this, where there is a growth opportunity that you have to invest more in, in improving the opportunities that you're bidding and increasing the pace at which we're bidding. but as we said in the past, we expect to do all of this through our margins. so our objective is to continue to expand our spending on bd and at the same time, we will be living up to our margin improvement commitments. and the increased pace of bidding is already included in our results. we've increased the amount we've been spending on bd in time to change this pipeline and we will continue to invest in growth. but again, we will do it through our margins and all this is built into our longer term commitment to get to a 15% margin target.
operator
okay. your next question comes from andy kaplowitz with citigroup. your line is open.
andy kaplowitz -- citigroup -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. troy i wanted to ask you about -- good morning. so, global backlog and design as you said, has been up high single digits over the last couple of quarters, but revenue has been slow to turn at least in the americas. so what do you think the probability is that aecom could see a relatively strong revenue inflection as many of your state customers who now have unexpected surplus turn their fy '22 budgets over the summer, especially given the $350 billion that you mentioned. i know you've mentioned your pipeline is up double digits, maybe when the last time your pipeline was like this and what kind of revenue growth you were able to convert?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yes, andy. thanks. so if you go back, i think probably, again, i mean you go back a ways to kind of 2010, 2009 era where we certainly saw this kind of improvement in pipeline and backlog. again i can talk about our -- the industry and talk about [indecipherable], but at that time we had strong growth, we're talking at points in that time double-digit growth. and so over 10% growth in terms of revenue during that period of time. i certainly see there is a growth or revenue inflection that's coming. and to the point of time that you alluded to again, there's a lot of funding that is coming into place, but that funding is just being distributed now. so for example, the $350 billion that was in the american rescue package, that money is just getting distributed to state and local government. so it will find its way into budgets and the money was devoted to transportation infrastructure is just finding its way into budget. so i think the timing you described is right, is we're going to see an increase in the pipeline. we're going to see and expect -- we have an expectation that we're going to be bidding that work, we will get awarded during the second half of this year, leading to an expectation of an inflection point in growth in fiscal '22.
andy kaplowitz -- citigroup -- analyst
thanks for that, troy. and then this question might be for lara, it's kind of a similar question on the international side. contracted backlog up 16%, then that's a big improvement in terms of growth versus the last few quarters, obviously easier comparisons help, but it does seem like you're seeing a nice inflection in your international market. so could you give us color on where you're seeing the biggest acceleration? i know you talked about, it seems like kind of across the board uk, canada, hong kong, australia, but the improvements you're seeing just broad-based is stimulus ahead in these places versus where it is here in the americas? any more color you could give us?
lara poloni -- president
yes. sure. i think we see continued positive growth in terms of the infrastructure pipeline in particular. i think for sure our very deliberate positioning to secure market leadership across all of the fine work that we mentioned in the uk is one of those key examples, the net debt is now paying dividend and a number of the wins in this quarter in the uk were failing and squarely on the back of those frameworks. and then i think just our ongoing market leadership in markets like hong kong, australia where we had some great wins in transport infrastructure and there the markets also where we see continued positive growth in terms of the government commitments to infrastructure through the recent budget announcements. so i think it's looking really positive in terms of that segment of our business for sure. and i would say also just continued focus on our most important clients directly account management program, which we really doubled down on -- in the last couple of quarters as well.
andy kaplowitz -- citigroup -- analyst
i appreciate that lara.
operator
your next question comes from andy wittmann with baird. your line is open.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
great. and thanks for taking my question. i was just hoping to get a little bit more detail inside of the margin improvements. obviously this is been an important story for your company in your stock for some time. you talked about some of the things that you're going to be driving this. but maybe gaurav, if you could help us break down a little bit of what led to the improvements in your consolidated margins this quarter, including the benefit of utilization of your personnel from other things that would be kind of more episodic or structural in terms of how you've gone to find cost in your business and become more efficient?
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
sure. andy, specific to margins, the one thing i'd like to highlight, as you've already stated, as it did significantly improve when you compare first half of last year to what we experienced in the current year. however, compared to q1 and q2 they are quite consistent and it's a trend that we expect to continue, because we did go through a significant transformation last year, completed majority of our restructuring activities that included right-sizing of our real estate opportunities, investments in our global design center, our business support centers in manila that we spoken to previously exiting countries completing those exist in 2020. so this is a byproduct of all of those transformational activities that we executed upon successfully. and you're seeing it in our results.
one thing i would also like to say is your specific question to utilization. utilization was consistent with our expectations. but what troy alluded to earlier in regards to business development, we did have a higher investment in business development based on the pipeline of opportunities we're seeing in the current quarters, specifically in the americas, because we're keeping our eye on the prize in the future of what potentially could be coming down the pipe.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
great, that's helpful. and then, i guess so it's probably worth asking here on your guidance. you mentioned a couple of times on the prepared remarks that adjusted eps, ebitda, free cash flow there is even some other metrics that we are focused on network kind of at least a little bit ahead of expectations. the ebitda guidance stayed the same. i think the mechanisms on the eps with interest savings and the buyback are very clear, but i was wondering if you could speak to the fact that despite a little bit of outperformance here, not just in 2q, but also a little bit in 1q ebit is behind there?
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
sure. so just expand on that. when we started in 2021 off of last year, we had confidence in the guidance we had provided even though there were a lot of market uncertainties at that time. and you're absolutely right, we've delivered the first and second quarter above our expectations on all metrics, including even ebitda and today, most of our major markets are more stable than they were beginning of the year with improving outlook as troy has already spoken to, reinforcing our confidence in the second half. but at the same time we are being prudently conservative, despite every one of us on the call today, if you were to ask us, five weeks ago, what's happened in southeast asia, india, none of us could have predicted. so we're just being prudently conservative and confident in what we're going to deliver for the year.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
great. have a good day. thank you.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
thank you.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from michael dudas with vertical research. your line is open.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
good morning mike. how are you?
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
great, thank you. so maybe troy, share your thoughts on federal direction relative to infrastructure bill negotiations. you get optimistic one day and you get pessimistic next day. given your exposure in your leading markets and transportation water, is this water some of the opportunities, some of the consensus appear to maybe drive some funding and some opportunities in the water maybe before highway infrastructure comes through and do you get the sense that the administration in the focus of the washington are -- can get something together that will be meaningful for visibility beyond '22 and '23 certainly in the broad part of your -- of the services you provide?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yes. so mike, i'm going to answer this in two parts. the first part is that there is already been a lot of action taken by the federal government in terms of funding that will support infrastructure and state and local budgets. and so what we're seeing today is the state and local budgets have returned. and i think are healthy and improving in health and i mentioned that in my prepared comments. so i already think we've got a trajectory in terms of federal funding and local funding in markets that supports continued investments in infrastructure and certainly the places you described in transportation and in water and certainly in the environment. there are some things that are being done by the federal government to focus for example on things like pfas remediation. and so there is momentum already building and funding building.
and the second part of that is with an infrastructure bill, this would layer on top of that. now, i don't want to predict what i think the outcome will be. but it certainly feels like there is support for getting something done and it feels like there is support for finding some form of compromise to get something done. so yes, i'm optimistic about that. but if that happens, that gets layered on top and frankly, if you just took the president's proposal for infrastructure plant, in its current form we think that that would increase the addressable market spend for our us design business by 15% to 20% over and above where it sits today. so that would be incredibly meaningful if it got done. but again i -- our job is to prepare for that if that happens and we'll see what the ultimate is.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
well if that happens it will be a race for talent for sure i would think.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yes, it will be. and that's something that we're very conscious about today in preparing for the future, is thinking about that race for talent is attracting the right people to the organization. and a great example of that is drew jeter and jen aument joined us and then there are obviously a lot of folks that are joining around them to the business. the other thing we're focused on is just our -- continuing our -- to invest in technical and professional developments to increase the strength of the people that are here and attract more people to the workforce. and then -- and really important part of this, which lara mentioned, which is, we call it freedom to grow initiative, which is we're going to create flexible work environments, so that it helps attract people here.
what we've learned through the pandemic is that people really can be productive remotely and they can be working virtually. we've learned that our clients are very accepting of it. and at the same time we learned that it's what people want to do. we've also found that having everybody commuting to a major city to do all the work together maybe isn't the right answer every day, but maybe it's being around each other, so you can have a mentoring apprenticeship environment at the right time with your clients, but at the same time, offering the flexibility for people to be around their families and their communities. simple answer is we want to make sure that our people are able to be home on wednesday afternoon, 3 o'clock to go to their daughter soccer game. and so we're going to create an environment where that exists and we believe that's a competitive advantage to attract talent to aecom. so we are absolutely focused on that as we move forward.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst

your next question comes from steven fisher with ubs. your line is open.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks, good morning, good afternoon. i wonder if you could just give us a little bit more color on the larger pursuits. can you just remind us what do you consider a larger pursuit on the timing, how balance is it between say q3 and q4 and how broadly these larger pursuits are across the regions and end markets?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
well i have to say steve, i don't really think about the portfolio has large pursuits and small pursuits. we think about our portfolio is based around our clients and what's important to them and their initiatives. so what we are seeing, is we're seeing our clients coming to us with those opportunities to ask for help and the place that we're first seeing that is in our advisory business. so they're asking us to help shape what those outcomes will look like. and then that's the reason we're building the program management business and expanding upon that is to actually help them in take those projects through that lifecycle and deliver an outcome. so it's not so much that we're seeing, we're focused on the larger ones. i will say we are seeing more large projects come to market as we see the pipeline build, but our focus is on being there on day one to provide that initial advice. be there on day two to help the program management and of course throughout the process to help with design. and again i can't give you stats on big projects, we certainly are seeing more of them, but we're seeing our pipelines expand broadly.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and then i guess just building on some of those comments. it's not that long since your investor day, but i was just curious if there are any next key milestones or activities related to the consulting angle or program management initiatives that you have any more key hiring or wins or any other milestones we should be looking for now that you've kind of announced it or a few months into it?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yes. those are actually our milestones. it is actually key hires and key wins and so we're not going to announce those key hires, but certainly we have been making progress and bringing some people into those teams that will absolutely have an impact. but in terms of wins i did mention two wins for program management in the quarter. we can't talk about all the wins, because we're simply not allowed here, we have to have clients' permission to do that. but i can tell you that the program management that it is around those key wins and building that business and we've identified a number of projects that are priorities for drew and his team and that pipeline that they're bidding right now represents a little less than $2 billion of bids. so those winning more projects over the next 12 months will be important milestones.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
terrific. just one quick clarification on cash flow. i think it's always difficult to predict the timing with precision. but how q4 weighted do you think this year will be on cash flow?
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
hey, steve, this is gaurav. i'll respond to that question. historically we've always been a second-half weighted cash flow generative company. however, when you look in the current year, one thing we have been successful at is instead of being significantly negative for the first half of the year, we're actually breakeven. on its own it may not be a big deal, but when you look at the impact on return on capital and that made cash available for the first half of the year to execute almost $300 million of repurchases between mid-november to today, it's a significant advantage for us. it drives the right behavior for us in the business as well. so we will expect positive cash flow in q3 and the biggest quarter will be in q4, consistent with our seasonal trends.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
got it. thanks a lot.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
absolutely.

your next question comes from jamie cook with credit suisse. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good morning and nice, i guess -- good morning in your time and nice quarter. i guess two questions. you already answered sort of my question on the guidance, which seems conservative in particular on the margin front, just given the year-over-year improvement, you had in the first half versus what's implied in the second half. but i guess my question is, you also talked about business development costs spending there. just as you see the pipeline look more robust. i'm wondering if, just the bd costs in the relative to when you initially guided are higher than what you thought. so you can capitalize on some of this growth and that also i guess would imply maybe your margins are at a better point than you would have expected as well, even though you're not changing your guidance? and then my second question, obviously, based on the enr record very strong positioning in some of your key markets, but i guess as you look at what's proposed under the infrastructure bill or you're just in conversations with where clients want to spend their money, are there any areas that you sort [technical issues] of aren't big enough in where you would like to get bigger in? i'm just wondering if there is adjacent areas of growth that are under-appreciated. thank you.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thanks, jamie. so first with respect to margins and business development, we believe that over the course of the year, even though our business development needs are accelerating is already built into our margins. and we believe that, again in the second half of the year that we can bid all of the work that we want to in need to bid and still maintain our margins. so you could look at it as maybe we're doing all and margins than we thought we would be, but nevertheless we also anticipated reinvesting some of that money in the growth of the business in the future. we saw it as an opportunity. and we expect to some of our key markets, there absolutely are places where we should, we should and we will be investing in the markets. maybe if you can think about it in terms of our business lines and there places across all our business lines, we will be investing and investing in our people. but the places that we've said we're dedicated to building and recruiting is certainly in our advisory business, which covers all our business lines, in building up our digital business, we have a group that's dedicated to digital solutions. and then the last point is program management. we are absolutely dedicated to invested in that capability. we believe that is a huge opportunity for us. as i said, i think we can -- over the next few years, we can build that business not by percentage points in terms of growth but by multiples.

hey, thanks, good morning guys. i'm still little curious on the state and local side. how those customers are reacting to this cash infusion? could they have a backlog, a physical work that they are now working through or they earlier in their process?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
well, so, adam, i think it's very particular to each -- again to each particular client, but almost all of our clients have had some form of projects that they have in their pipeline, that they want to be doing. so they already have a long-term pipeline of things that they're working on. so again i'll just use here in los angeles. there is a lot of infrastructure being invested in to get prepared for the 2020 olympics. also there is a lot of work that local politicians want to do in terms of improving the economic conditions in their -- in local communities. and funding was difficult for that over the last year, but now that funding is become available, so that agenda can be funded and those new opportunities and priorities for the state and the local governments here now can be funded. so there is certainly is a pipeline that already existed is -- there are a whole bunch of projects over the last year that will come online, that will add inventory because of the ambitions that state and local governments and private clients have set for themselves.
if we go back a year ago, it certainly -- there certainly were these ambitions that were laid out that are better [technical issues] laid out today. and so that's where you're seeing the momentum for the new projects that builds along the already existing portfolio of projects that those clients want to fund. so there certainly is a lot of opportunity and now the funding is lining up behind it and that's why we feel confident about the growth as we move into 2022.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis -- analyst
okay. i think you said the construction management pipeline is improving as well. can you give some geographic color? i'm particularly curious about new york.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
i can tell you that we are certainly seeing an improvement in the pipeline in new york, and we are seeing the pipeline improvement in place where there is a growth in population. so, places like in the nashville area, the dallas-fort worth area. and so those are the places where we are seeing that growth opportunity or the increase in the pipeline. but certainly, again we are seeing the pipeline improve in new york as well.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis -- analyst
okay, thanks guys.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you.

on today's call, troy rudd, our chief executive officer, will begin with a review of our strategy and key accomplishments. lara poloni our president, will discuss key operational priorities and gaurav kapoor, our chief financial officer, will review our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
with that i will turn the call over to troy. troy?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you, will, and thank you all for joining us today. i'd like to begin by acknowledging our teams contributions to our success. despite the ongoing challenges posed by covid, we continue to focus on the health and safety of our professionals and their families, which has allowed us to deliver for our clients, communities and all stakeholders. today, some of the markets in which we operate are emerging from the worst of the pandemic. however, other markets are not. through it all, we have demonstrated agility and we are working more collaboratively than ever before. we are unified by our think and act globally strategy and as more markets recover, we are even better positioned than ever.
turning to our financial performance and outlook for the business. we entered fiscal 2021 with guarded optimism. trends in many of our larger markets have begun to stabilize and our focus on our higher returning and lower risk professional services businesses, brought a new energy and determination to the organization. against that backdrop, i'm very pleased with where we stand today. revenue trends are improving, including 1% nsr growth in the second quarter. this is consistent with our expectations for improved growth as we advance through the year. margins also continue to expand and lead our industry. we delivered a 140 basis point increase in our segment adjusted operating margin to 13.1%, a new high for the second quarter and consistent with our expectations for in at least 90 basis point increase for the full year. the actions we have taken over the past few years to streamline our global organization and to reduce our overhead costs are contributing consistently to strong profitability. as a result, adjusted ebitda increased by 11% and adjusted eps increased by 22%, both of which were slightly ahead of our expectations.
looking ahead, our backlog and pipeline are strengthening and this provides us with good visibility. backlog in our design business increased by 8% with growth in both our americas and international markets. this was offset by a decline in the construction management business, which was consistent with our expectations. however, we are now seeing a recovery in the construction management pipeline, particularly as our clients plan with greater certainty against a better economic backdrop. we are pursuing several meaningful award opportunities with decisions expected in the second half of the year.
across the business, our contracted backlog, which is a leading indicator of revenue growth increased by 30% in total, including 4% growth in our design business. our focus on our people, clients and communities has galvanized the organization, creating more and better collaboration and is resulting in a stronger and more valuable company to all stakeholders.
please turn to the next slide. as we turn to the second half of the year and beyond, several factors are contributing to our continued confidence in the business and increased optimism in our markets. first, our state and local clients, which represent our largest public sector client base are on stronger financial ground. the $350 billion cash infusion from the march covid relief bill combined with the benefits of the december relief bill, improving economic activity and strong tax collections have made nearly all 50 states hold [phonetic] for the revenue lost during the year. in addition, the relief bills also allocated nearly $70 billion to our transportation clients which reflects approximately 75% of the annual federal transit and transportation funding, which has led to an increase in our pipeline and improved pace of decision making. today, our largest state and local clients are funded at levels higher than pre-covid, and these clients are deploying these funds to job creation and infrastructure investment.
second, the debate on transformational infrastructure legislation in the us continues to advance, including both traditional road and bridge investment as well as a set of esg priorities. this set of broader priorities are also apparent in present binds proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure bill and the budget proposal for 2022. and in many instances are mirrored in republican infrastructure proposals, encouragingly these include several areas where we lead such as electrifying transit systems, pfas remediation, new energy, resilience and clean water. with federal infrastructure spending as a share of gdp at multi-decade lows, there is a growing backlog of critical projects it could be advanced should this federal funding materialize and we are already partnering with clients to be ready for the anticipated increase in funding.
third, our private sector clients are also prioritizing investments in esg, benefiting our industry leading positions in green building and green design, environmental compliance and remediation, energy efficiency and infrastructure resilience. many of these clients are engaging us specifically in response to ongoing stakeholder feedback to deliver on esg initiatives. aecom's position here is very strong. the challenges and opportunities facing our clients are global and require the depth and breadth of our consulting program management and advisory capabilities. fourth, growth outlook in our larger markets outside the united states are improving. in the uk, our largest international market economic growth forecast now projected recovery to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. we delivered a 1.2 book-to-burn ratio in the uk in the second quarter, reflecting these better market trends. in addition, we are benefiting from the actions we have taken over the past several years to reestablish our leadership position on key public frameworks where we are now seeing positive contributions. in canada, we delivered strong growth in the second quarter and we're successful on a large proceed in april that supports our confidence going forward, particularly as the federal government's latest budget continues to prioritize infrastructure investment. in the asia-pacific region, australia and hong kong continue to recover and our book-to-burn ratio was nearly 2 in the second quarter. our focus in our india business is on the health and safety of our workforce and their families and continuing to deliver on our clients' commitments.
finally and most important to our success, the strategic alignment of our professionals around new priorities has created a great deal of energy and momentum. as we discussed at our investor day in february, central to our strategic efforts are the actions to broaden how we engage with our clients. this includes expanding our role as key technical and strategic advisor, expanding our project program management business and continuing to bring the industry's best technical experts and digital solutions. as part of this effort, drew jeter joined aecom in january to lead our program management business. we were recently awarded a program management contract to oversee a $1.1 billion highway widening program, another large program management contracts from the dallas independent school district for the $3.5 billion bond program and we are pursuing several larger opportunities.
in addition, jennifer aument joined our organization in april to lead our global transportation business at a time when funding is set to benefit our key transit clients who are looking to advance complex multi-year programs. jen's leadership, in driving the creation and delivery of large programs will be a key asset and builds on our industry-leading market position. drew and jen are complemented by an already strong leadership team.
reflecting the momentum in our organization in our markets, bid submissions and active proposals in our americas design business are up by double-digits since the start of the year. and in april, we saw a decision making begin to accelerate in a number of larger pursuits converted to wins. importantly today our 47,000 people are operating for our market leading position. as indicated by enr, we are the number one ranked transportation design firm, the number one ranked facilities design firm, the number one ranked program management firm, the number one ranked global environmental consulting firm and just improve the ranking of our water business to number two, despite not making any acquisitions. even during these challenging times, we are confident we are taking market share. when combined with these steps we have taken to empower the organization to grow, we are better positioned than ever to deliver on our long-term financial objectives and outgrow the industry. these include a commitment to more than double adjusted eps and free cash flow by 2024 as compared to 2020, and to deliver industry-leading margins and return on invested capital.
with that i will turn the call over to lara.
lara poloni -- president
thanks, troy. please turn to the next slide. i echo troy's sentiments on the momentum in the business and the strengthened culture and strategic alignment across the organization. over the past year we have undergone a transformation in how we are organized, how we operate, how we go-to-market and how we serve our clients and communities. today our strategy, culture and capabilities are squarely focused on our people, clients and communities and we as leaders are inspired by our teams and energized by the opportunities we see in front of us.
i am particularly excited to see our results begin to reflect our renewed focus on best advising our clients. a great example of this is the tremendous success we've seen in the uk while being substantially improved our commercial position and taking market share through our positions on several large framework. as a result, our backlog in the country has increased by double-digits over the past year and we are seeing a return to strong revenue growth, which is contributing to our overall improved performance in our international segment. these successes underscore our confidence in our strategy and our ability to outgrow the industry over the coming years.
another key element of our strategy is our commitment to leading the industry in esg. building on the many actions we have already taken, in april, we announced our sustainable legacy strategy. this strategy integrates four key pillars that will invest in sustainable development and resilience across our work, improve social outcomes for communities, achieve net zero carbon emissions and enhance governance. this includes our commitment to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2030, which builds on our prior science based targets and shows we address the entirety of our impact our company has on the environment from our own actions as well as that of our suppliers.
expanding on this point even further and recognizing that the work we do for our clients has an even greater long term impact on our environment, we also unveiled our scopex process initiative. this includes our commitment to providing our clients with solutions that embed esg considerations into our designs. scopex focuses our teams on minimizing energy used, optimizing sources of renewable power and where feasible we will work with hand-in-hand natural habitat to eliminate carbon emissions. we will also embed net zero resilience and social value targets into our client account management program and the work we bid for. our sustainable legacies strategy also includes efforts to further commodity diversity of our workforce, including near-term targets to increase the percentage of women across the company to at least 35% and increase the percentage of women in leadership positions to at least 20%. we are also investing to advance the social value our company can provide through our operations and our project, including through direct investment in communities and in minority owned businesses.
a great example of sustainable legacies is our workplace of the future initiative that is focused on designing a flexible workforce model for our professionals. through these efforts, [indecipherable] associated with our teams, while also reducing our real estate footprint and creating more efficient office spaces. building on this, last month, we also began to implement our freedom to grow initiative, which allows our teams to design the flexible work arrangements they need to be successful. we have made the investments in digital capabilities to leverage remote working to best position our people for success and fulfillment in their careers and believe the strength of our platform and capabilities will attract the best resources in our industry going forward to support our focus on delivering industry-leading growth. needless to say our people are energized by how we are positively impacting the world.
with that i will now turn the call over to gaurav to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
thanks, lara. please turn to the next slide. our second quarter results were again strong on every key metric. our performance on ebitda, margins, eps and cash flow were ahead of our expectations in the second quarter and in the first half of the year. there is clear alignment across the organization on our priorities, new level of accountability to deliver on our targets and in energy within our teams that is building daily [phonetic]. to support the business and create certainty for our clients, employees and shareholders, we took additional steps in the second quarter to further strengthening our balance sheet with the refinancing of our 2024 bonds into lower-cost debt and we continue to deploy substantially all free cash flow to share repurchases consistent with our capital allocation priorities.
please turn to the next slide. in the americas, nsr declined slightly over the prior year primarily due to pre-covid comps. notably, our nsr increased by 7% sequentially, reflecting improving market conditions as we progress through the year. trends in our americas design business continued to improve highlighted by 5% backlog growth in the quarter. further, not only did our pipeline of opportunities increase by double-digits, but our capture rates on bids also increased as our think and act globally strategy starting to take hold. this provides us confidence that we are gaining market share into an improving market.
in our construction management business, we burned backlog in the quarter as expected. as troy noted, we are seeing pipeline trends improve in the cm business and our backlog continues to provide significant long-term visibility. as a reminder approximately 90% of our profit from backlog is driven by the design business due to the high level of past-due costs included in the cm business. the americas segment had a 17.2% adjusted operating margin for the first quarter, a 160 basis point improvement from the prior year. for the first half of fiscal year our americas margin was 17.3% underscoring the progress we have made in ingraining a culture of continuous improvement into a business that leads the industry on margins.
please turn to the next slide. turning to the international segment, our nsr increased by 3% reflecting strong growth in our uk, australia and hong kong businesses where we have grown our backlog in each by double-digit from the prior year. our efforts to position this business to capture market share are translating to results. notably, we continued to make progress on our margin improvement initiatives. our adjusted operating margin in the second quarter was 7.3%, a 130 basis point improvement from the prior year and a more than 500 basis point improvement since the beginning of fiscal 2019. this progression provides us confidence in our ability to achieve double-digit international margins.
please turn to the next slide. turning to cash flow, liquidity and capital allocation. a great example of how the organization has evolved and is collaborating better to deliver as a substantial improvement in the first half cash flow. in fact, our first half cash flow was the best we've delivered in three years, reflecting our very deliberate actions to improve our phasing. while our full year cash flow has consistently been within our guidance range in each of the last six years, our phasing had become true [phonetic] second-half weighted. improving this phasing, favorably impacts our return on invested capital. we put in place, sort of quarterly incentive targets to drive a better outcome and our teams in the business have responded. as a result, we are reaffirming our $425 million to $625 million free cash flow guidance for the full year. at the midpoint, this reflects unlevered free cash flow conversion of ebitda at 75%.
i'm also pleased with the series of transactions we have executed that together extend the maturity of our debt and reduce our interest expense. in april, we successfully tendered for approximately 75% of our 2024 bonds replacing the debt with a lower cost term loan b. the transaction builds on the benefits from the redemption of our higher cost 2022 bonds last year and amend and extend transaction of our sustainability linked credit facility that we executed in the second quarter. when taken together, these actions enhance our balance sheet, contribute to our plan to double adjusted eps by fiscal 2024 and support capital allocation flexibility. our strong cash flow and balance sheet have enabled us to continue to repurchase our stock. we have executed 125 million of share repurchases since our earnings call in february and have now reduced our fully diluted share count by 10% since september. importantly, we currently have $700 million remaining on our board authorization and with strong cash expectations for the second half of the year, we will continue to deploy capital to share repurchases going forward.
please turn to the next slide. we are raising our adjusted eps guidance for the full year to between $2.65 and $2.85 or 28% growth at the midpoint. this increase reflects our outperformance in the first half of the year including the benefit of our accelerated pace of share repurchases and the benefit of our debt refinancing. this guidance does not concentrate take any additional repurchases, although it is our plan to continue to buyback stock.
with that operator, we are ready for questions.

your first question from the line of sean eastman with keybanc capital.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
hi guys, nice quarter and nice update here. i just wanted to start on the -- on the top line. i mean, double-digit growth in the americas pipeline, maybe if you could just comment on how that pipeline is converting toward, i mean book-to-bill of 1.1 times is great, but do you guys see a kind of a step change coming in terms of the conversion of that pipeline toward what needs to happen, what kind of timeline are you thinking about around that dynamic?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, sean it is troy. thanks for the question. i'm going to give you -- i'm going to give you a little bit of detail on this sort of build into that answer, but we've actually seen the trends improving within our markets and within our backlog over the course of the last few quarters. and then behind that as we've said, the focus last year actually been gaining market share. so, while we're seeing our backlog improve 8% in particular in our design business and we're seeing our pipeline increase actually in the americas at double digits, and internationally in mid-single digits. it is lining up for us to have improved growth opportunities in the future. and then you combine that with what we've seen in terms of our ability in gaining market share and our higher win rate, in terms of the win rates on the proposals that we're bidding. i think it indicates that we're going to see an acceleration for growth into '22 and certainly beyond that.
but as i look back over the last few quarters, again, as i said i think we've, i feel like we've hit a bit of an inflection. we did grow a little bit in our design business, which is 90% of our business in the prior quarter, 3% this quarter and when i look at across our peer set the, the organic growth around our peer set was actually a decline of mid-single digits. so i feel like we're gaining ground and we've actually hit that inflection point and then lining up even behind that for us and for our entire industry. here in the us, i think we all have confidence that the infrastructure bill is likely to finally be passed, which will obviously create federal funding that we're exposed to very significantly, but also it will inspire some confidence with our state and local clients, who with that certainty of federal funding will be able to commit to projects. and so that all leads to the fact that i think we started to hit that inflection point. and as we move forward, i would see as i said in the prepared comments, growth accelerating. and again just a reminder is when we prepared our comments, we didn't see the infrastructure bill getting through congress. i think we're little more optimistic about that now, so that certainly was not built into our forward-looking guidance or thinking about the future. so that sort of a little bit of tailwind that was that we hope will be expected in '22 and beyond.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thanks, troy. and then you made comment on the margins being quite outsized, particularly in the americas this quarter. could you maybe update us on how we should be thinking about the trajectory from where we are exiting kind of in the mid 13% range exiting fiscal '21 toward the 15% by fiscal '24. i mean is this kind of an outsized performance this year or should we think about kind of an even sort of 50 basis points annually toward the 15%, any thoughts there on maybe how we're comping into next year from a margin perspective?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure, let me turn that over gaurav. he will look give you that answer.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
hey, sean. in terms of our margin in the current quarter, there was nothing one-time or peculiar to call out. in fact, it's our focus -- result of our focus on core markets, focusing our bb in those business lines where we expect to meet our growth margin and cash hurdles and it allows us then to deliver on these higher margin projects. and you combine that with the efficiency cost initiatives we've had it gives us a lot of confidence to your point, as we look forward to achieving our 15% to 2024 target. we expect that the margins are going to continue from a trajectory standpoint over the next couple of years as we -- as we come up to the 15% and then march -- continue to march forward on our longer term aspirational target of 17%.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
okay, thanks. again, nice update. thanks guys.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thanks, sean.

your next question comes from the line of andy wittmann with baird.
andrew j. wittmann -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
well, great. thanks for taking my question. troy, you had a comment in your prepared remarks about some hiring challenges and how that may have actually contributed to -- it sounds like you could have recognized even more revenue. so just wondering if you could give us some direction order of magnitude about how much that impacted you. where those in terms of the missed opportunities? because you didn't have those people or they are just going to have to be delayed and worked on in a different quarter rather than this quarter? and then, if you just talk about the kinds of end markets or geographies where those labor challenges are occurring? it seems like at least it seems, broadly speaking, that most of the labor challenges in the marketplace are for lower end jobs and obviously you've got professionals here. so i think your commentary on this is -- would be helpful. thank you.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure. thanks andy, for the question. so yes, we are -- i won't say that it's -- it's across the world where we're seeing those challenges in hiring. but in certain places in our business and in certain markets, we are -- we are seeing it being more difficult to hire people into the business. and again across some of our businesses, we certainly have people that performed different types of work. and when you look at our environment business in particular, we certainly see that in some of the work that we do in terms of remediation that we've had some challenges in hiring into that business. but i again i bring that up not because it's material to our results for the quarter, but as we move into a higher growth environment, i think it becomes more important and how we're thinking about it. so obviously we continue to need -- we need to up to bring people into the business, i mean to keep the people that are here. that is a priority for us and we're focused on creating a great place to work invested in the development, technical and professional development of our people and creating an environment where we create flexibility for them. so that is a priority for us. but the other things that we're doing and focused on is making sure that we can balance work around the world. because in the past, in the business and in the industry there has been ups and downs, you have hot market, people hire into it and when things slow down and you have few too many people in the business. we're looking to make sure that we take advantage of what we've learned over the last 18 months, so that we can more evenly share work across the entire business, which i think helps address that particular concern moving forward.
and then the other thing that we're focused on is innovation and we refer to it as our digital strategy, which is we're looking to extend the ability of our people to take on more but without having to spend more time to do it. so by focusing on investments in innovating how our work is delivered, we're able to extend the capacity without having to ask people to take on more work. and we think those are the combination of things that put us in a good position, even as we might be in a constrained labor environment moving forward.
andrew j. wittmann -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
got it. that's my only question for today. thank you.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of andy kaplowitz with citigroup.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
andy.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
good morning.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
troy, i just want to focus on the comment you actually made in your press release that you're focused on being well positioned to deliver even greater growth in '22 than you're going to deliver in '21, does that statement mean that you have relatively high confidence in delivering double-digit ebitda and eps growth in '22 given the current conditions you see and the pipeline you have or do you need for instance those us state and local customers still ramp up their spending. i mean it's good to see the senate pass the bill today, just few minutes ago, so i guess that will help if we can get to that.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, so i did. i intentionally said, i said i see our growth accelerating. and again, when i think about growth, i think about the overall profitability of the business and that is obviously, as we said in the past, a combination of growing the capacity of the work that we're performing for our customers and at the same time improving our margins. and we certainly see that accelerating as we move into '22 and beyond where we are today. obviously it's premature for us to offer any guidance, but i certainly wanted to offer that comment about our confidence to continue to grow the bottom line, the business itself is growing.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
that's helpful, troy. and then, is there a theoretical margin ceiling on your americas business. can you record 20% margins in the americas? and then back to your analyst day, you said you expect 180 basis points of tailwind from continuous improvement initiatives as you've been implementing those initiatives such as workplace of the future. would you say so far you've been able to find more savings than you expected ahead of schedule versus that 180 basis points?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
well, i guess it's -- i would characterize as two components. one is, it certainly as the efficiencies that we've been driving in the business and i would call, i would say that we are on schedule with that, but the other impact the actual work that we're bidding and how we're delivering it. we're actually within our projects and improvements in the overall profitability of the projects we're taking on and how we're actually delivering them. so i'm going to attribute that our margin improvement to a combination of the two. i don't want to pinpoint something for the americas. again it's always -- it's always a balanced equation, meaning we try and balance work in the business around the globe. so i would see us being on track and having a high degree of confidence in getting to the 15% target that we set for ourselves. and as gaurav said we're trying to look beyond that, but i think it's a combination of things. it's not necessarily just driving efficiency in the business, it's that coupled with the work that we're taking on and how we're how we're looking to change how the work is delivered.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
but troy, just to be clear, i mean you are getting up into kind of heady territory in your americas margin, there is no you could still do better theoretically in terms of mix and or utilization or execution? correct.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yes, yes, absolutely. and it gets back to the point that our focus was obviously the core of what we do is engineering and design. but we're also looking to build our advisory business and our program management business. and so building out those businesses offer the opportunity to do more work earlier in the process for your clients and ultimately program management, you're taking on longer-term larger pieces of work, which [indecipherable] to be more efficient in terms of your delivery, which also contribute to margin. so i think it's the strategy that we've adopted to move into certain markets and certain types of work from where we were. it's the focus on changing how we're delivering that work, as i mentioned through innovation and digital technology. and then obviously our operational efficiencies. we have to always be focused on trying to figure out how we deliver our work more efficiently every day.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
appreciate it. troy.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
great. thanks, andy.

next question line of michael feniger with bank of america.
michael feniger -- bofa merrill lynch -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. you guys just grew ebitda, i think was 15% year-over-year, the guidance implies that the growth slows or decelerate in the fourth quarter. i think you mentioned this extra week impact. is there anything else you're seeing today that should really suggest that level of slowdown in year-over-year basis. is it more conservatism, is there anything for us to read in to that fourth quarter that would indicate, maybe a slower start in 2022 that that would then pick up through the year?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah so michael, i guess, first, in terms of the year that we're in, we're certainly not intending to communicate that there is a change in the trajectory of our expectations. however, we said this in the past few quarters is that we think it's important that we are prudently conservative in terms of our guide and so i would say that we are maintaining that same view. we're just going to be prudently conservative, which means that we do expect our fourth quarter to -- the bottom line to grow year-over-year and we're certainly not intending on signaling anything with respect to '22. when we look forward, i think i made the comment that we see it actually accelerate. so without giving guidance i wanted to give an impression of the optimism that we have as we head into 2002.
michael feniger -- bofa merrill lynch -- analyst
perfect, troy. and i -- and there is apparently a lot of private equity money and just m&a and engineering space right now. you mentioned in your remarks how you're being prudent to not overpay in the top part of your strategy. but does it make you reevaluate your portfolio. do you still view construction management as core to the portfolio? and with some of this aggressive m&a, are you seeing more aggressive bidding out there on projects?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
i wouldn't test any -- i haven't seen the environment change in terms of bidding on projects. just to be clear, it's always a competitive environment. and i think that is unchanged and remains unchanged. the comment that i made about m&a wasn't intended to be focused on anything than our ability to deploy capital. we still believe based on the growth opportunity that we see in the business and where we're headed that we're much better to deploy our capital to acquire our own shares and not to be in the market thinking about large m&a. and for the reasons that you described is that the multiples for large m&a are in fact been driven up because there's competition for those deals, but also the risk of execution in terms of a deal and its integration is much different in terms of buying back our stock. so i just wanted to be clear that we see -- for us the best opportunity for deploying our capital is buying back our stock today.
michael feniger -- bofa merrill lynch -- analyst
fair enough troy. and if i could just squeeze one in, our markets obviously worried about inflation, troy. and i think you flagged that your win share is going up, but does that also mean how much more selective, can you be especially with the infrastructure bill coming through. should we expect the mix of your backlog to move at a higher margin areas? i think like your water business for example, do you have to price your projects differently as bidding starts coming out to worry about potential inflationary pressures and some of the labor constraints you were discussing earlier?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
well, i think the nature of -- nature of the industry and the nature of the businesses that we sort of have always bid work to include an estimate of inflation. so a lot of projects actually have the ability to price labor inflation into those projects based on the contract terms that exist. and we certainly do pay attention to that as we move forward. those are ultimately client decisions in terms of the ultimate cost of project. and so when we go to bid work, we're going to look at what's an appropriate turns for those projects for what we're contributing. and if that includes an increase in labor rates we will end up bidding it that way. so i don't -- i don't view us as in the medium term or even in the short-term having an impact from labor inflation.

your next question line of steven fisher with ubs.
steven fisher -- ubs securities -- analyst
thanks, good morning. so the construction management backlog, in fact, just curious how broad based where the drivers of that inflection and what does that tell you about the timing of when the construction management revenues could actually turn positive year-over-year, or at least neutralize to a large degree?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
well, so steven that point, we certainly have seen the opportunities in our construction management improve, again i'm going to say modestly, and our backlog grew modestly. the other phenomena is that there are a number of projects that were delayed or deferred. and so we actually see those projects gaining momentum to start or restart and so all of that is building to more optimism around growth in the construction management business. it's a little premature to pinpoint exactly when we see that, but i certainly think as we look forward into '22 and beyond, we have an expectation that business would start to grow. so, and in terms of your question about, how broad is that? it is fairly broad-based and in fact we're seeing the backlog and the pipeline grow in markets that might be little unexpected, but the markets that were strong. so certainly even within new york and manhattan, we're seeing that growth, but it is -- it is fairly broad-based, but again it's, it's in line with where we actually have the footprint of that business.
steven fisher -- ubs securities -- analyst
got it. and then on cash flow, you've had the improved phasing of cash flow this year and can you maybe just remind us of how much of that was within your control? and is that something that you can further advance next year or are we now at the kind of phasing that we should expect on an ongoing basis?
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
hey, steven. this is gaurav, i'll respond to that question. it was completely in our control and expected because that was a focus of ours as i've said in our prepared comments from the onset. and our teams have responded to it, just like on our margin improvement initiatives, where our mindset is continuous improvement i think all of these key initiatives of ours we have the same mindset. continuous improvements on '22, we will look for any and all opportunity to continue to better that phasing, but just remember, our first half of the year is always going to be burdened with certain one-time disbursements just from a timing standpoint.
steven fisher -- ubs securities -- analyst
understood. right, thanks a lot.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
thanks steven.
operator
your next question is line of michael dudas with vertical research.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen. lara.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
good morning.
lara poloni -- president
good morning.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
good morning.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
troy or lara, when you look at your state, local business you know there is -- there is discussion about the first stimulus, the $1.9 billion in the state and local money flowing through. can you maybe update us on what you're seeing there as that is starting to get better for you, does that give you assuming more confidence in like the next six months to nine months? and then when you think about eventual federal packages, however, it comes through. is there going to be -- what would you expect the time lag or as you -- as we start to think about this obviously we talk about that when you give out your guidance for the fiscal year-end, but the lag time and maybe one or two of the areas you think that could be may be helpful to the backlog and growth prospects in that state -- in your federal or state, local businesses?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
okay. mike, thanks. that was a -- i'm going to try and get all four parts of that question.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
four, i thought it was only three. i'm sorry. my bad.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
first, with respect to state and local again remember that's about 25% of over overall business, the nsr of our business. we actually saw in the quarter, our state and local revenue be around flat, maybe down a little bit which sort of indicates that there are some of those decisions that in fact are in our pipeline. but those decisions are being deferred. so we're seeing the pipeline increase, but we're not seeing those decisions being made, but again as i said, i think that as we move forward, there is more certainty about the business environment we're in with respect to the pandemic. there is more certainty around state and local revenues as we've seen the revenues improving substantially and then ultimately as there is more certainty around the federal funding that is contributing to the state and local decisions that all leads to an improvement in terms of the amount of awards that we'll see in the future. with respect to timing, i suspect that that starts now and will start to build over the course of '22. so i don't think it's going to be a linear ramp up in '22 and beyond. but i certainly think you're going to see it ramp as those decisions start to be made. and then those decisions actually turn into turn into projects.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
and you talked about esg efforts obviously internally, but also for your clients and 70% touching on -- in your somewhat esg focus, maybe you can share what types or what are the things you're seeing from the private sector. and is it -- certainly is it allowing for more advisory or project management work that comes in there, is it just really the early stage that could lead to much more chunkier, more thoughtful backlog opportunities as this emerges over the next couple of years.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. you know mike, i'm going to let lara answer that question.
lara poloni -- president
yeah, thanks very much michael for the question. and look at esg advisory services is probably the fastest growing element of our advisory story. and just, if we look at this last quarter, there have been dozens and dozens of significant wins at all levels of different public and private groups of clients. and if we look at the americas, for example. it was growth and awards from some of our more significant state based dot clients that you referenced earlier. it was transit clients and then it was also private sector clients. so a lot of -- and it ranges from climate adaptation strategies, vulnerability assessments of all of their assets due to extreme weather events, resiliency studies and obviously electrification is a lot happening in that space, and most of our big transportation clients have a very ambitious decarbonization agenda. and then there's building retrofitting work both in the us and in key markets like the uk. so it's definitely a growing element of our advisory service offering, which as you noted is a big growth initiative for us as is the program management business as well.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thank you, troy. thank you. lara.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
mike, i was just going to -- the third part of your question was it just the exposure to the infrastructure bill.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
yeah, sure.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
and i think it goes without saying, but i'm going to say it anyway is that i said in the prepared comments that we are exposed to almost every dollar in that proposed infrastructure bill. but the places that we see that just these large opportunities are clearly in surface transportation and transit. this is probably the largest rail investment that will certainly see in our careers, aviation a significant investment, water including managing through pfas [phonetic] and the cleanup of certain other emerging contaminants. so when we look at that, we're just -- we're just incredibly well exposed to that. and then there are some new things that are in there as well. the money that's going to be spent on the broadband build out across the country. we're certainly not going to building it out, but in terms of all the work that leads up to the permitting and then helping manage to those projects, we see that as a large opportunity as well.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
excellent. thank you, troy.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question line of adam thalhimer with thomas davis.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis & co. -- analyst
thanks guys. i wanted to take another shot at the construction management backlog growth. is it a different -- is it different kinds of projects driving that? i have to think that new high-rise office would still be under pressure -- some pressure?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
well, it's a good -- it is, it's a good question, right. because you think it would be a little counter intuitive, but actually in the markets where we have a pretty significant footprint we're actually seeing people in long-term view in terms of those infrastructure -- in terms of those are those high-rise investments. so it certainly isn't it -- it certainly not as in the condo market, but it certainly is in the office and mixed use development. and again, so we're seeing it in the places that you might question, but i think -- i again -- i think that folks are taking a longer-term view that those are investments that will have returns over three year or four year periods. and then we're also looking at certain markets where there is a significant amount of growth in certain cities. and then beyond that in that business there is -- i'm going to say they are infrastructure type investments being made that our construction management business participates in. and that's in aviation, healthcare and certainly in wind power.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis & co. -- analyst
okay. and then -- and then on the -- i wanted to ask the inflation question again from the standpoint of, at the very -- you guys are at the very front end right of, so i'm curious how clients are reacting to higher materials prices, shortages of craft labor, i think, how are they -- are they pulling back on their design aspects or are they still pushing forward with the design, but then maybe not pulling the trigger as fast on push and go on construction?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
well, if i look at our pipeline, our pipeline is up in design and in construction management. so i think it would be unfair to pinpoint an individual decision, but when we look broadly across the portfolio even with the increase in prices of materials and labor, we still see the list of opportunities improving.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis & co. -- analyst
great. thanks guys.

with that i will turn the call over to troy. troy?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you, will. and thank you all for joining us today. i'd like to begin by acknowledging the continued great contributions of our teams globally. in many parts of the world, day-to-day activities are beginning to resemble normalcy. however, the pandemic and its variants continue to impact our teams and their families. against this backdrop, i'm proud of how we are collaborating to deliver for our clients and communities. as the covid-19 variant spread, we all need to remain agile until we reach a point where the threat from the virus is eliminated. we have the best teams in the industry and our focus remains on keeping our people safe and enabling them to be successful in their careers.
turning to a discussion of our performance. four themes are apparent across our business. first, our third quarter results, extend our track record of delivering on our financial and strategic commitments. and with our strong year-to-date performance, we are increasing our guidance for fiscal 2021 and we are increasingly confident in delivering our long-term financial targets including doubling adjusted earnings per share from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2024. second, the success of our think and act globally strategy and investments in our people and innovation are contributing to accelerating growth. in fact our design business that accounts for approximately 90% of our profit, organic nsr, and backlog growth are at the top of the industry. and our strengthening pipeline pretends well for continued leadership. third, we expect to deliver strong results into the future, built around secular growth themes centered on infrastructure and esg-driven opportunities. with our increased focused on advisory and program management, we are engaging with clients much earlier than their planning for large investments and we are advising them through the execution, which expands our addressable market. and finally, we remain committed to creating shareholder value by investing in growth and innovation and enhancing per share value by allocating substantially all available cash flow to share repurchases. we believe these are the highest returning uses of capital as compared to large scale m&a were today's deal multiples are elevated and the execution and integration risks are higher.
turning to our results. we exceeded our expectations on every key measure. nsr increased for second consecutive quarter including accelerating growth in our design business. in addition, backlog in the design business increased by 8% and included 7% growth in contracted backlog, which is a leading indicator of revenue growth. our adjusted operating margin reached a new high this quarter at 14.1%, an increase of 90 basis points from the prior year. with this outperformance, we now expect to exceed our margin guidance for the full year. this performance includes growth in higher margin projects and efficiencies in how we deliver and is creating the capital to invest in our teams and innovation. as a result of this revenue and margin performance, adjusted ebitda increased by 15% and adjusted eps increased by 33%. we are also continuing to convert our earnings to strong cash flow. we delivered the highest third quarter and year-to-date free cash flow in four years. and consistent with our capital allocation policy, we repurchased approximately 12% of our shares outstanding as compared to last september when we began our repurchase program.
turning to our backlog and pipeline. funding across our markets is improving and our investments in growth are bearing fruit. we delivered $3.7 billion of wins and we had a greater than one book to burn ratio for the enterprise for the first time since the pandemic began. with the strong performance, backlog in the construction management business increased sequentially, albeit modestly for the first time in several quarters. in addition, our pipeline of opportunities in our americas design business has increased by double digits since the beginning of the year and the international pipeline increased by single digits. these are great signs for the health of our markets and the success of our strategy. the strength is before any material contributions from previously enacted stimulus funding and we do not include any benefit in our guidance from the proposed infrastructure bill in the us.
please turn to the next slide. our accomplishments reflect the benefits our think and act globally strategy and our focus on growth. over the past several quarters, we have prioritized investments in growth markets, simplified our operating structure and eliminated inefficiencies. today, we are a more agile organization and we are benefiting from stronger collaboration across the business. we've also invested in our key account program to ensure we deploy the best practices to all of our clients. this will be critical to outgrowing the industry. all these efforts are resulting in strong nsr, backlog and pipeline growth.
another key component of our strategy is leveraging our industry leading margins to invest in our people and innovation. demand is accelerating in the majority of our largest markets and aecom and others in our industry will be increasingly challenged to attract and retain the strongest talent. in fact, our growth this past quarter was constrained in some areas by the pace of hiring relative to increased demand. and what is noteworthy is that this constraint is apparent even as our pace of hiring has doubled as compared to last year.
as a leader in our industry, we have certain advantages against this backdrop. first, our workforce is global and we can draw on this global expertise to deliver anywhere in the world due to the investments we've made in technology to enhance collaboration. second, we also invest in professional development programs so our people can grow within aecom. third, we are using technology to extend the capacity of our teams and to deliver a new and innovative ways. and finally, we've implemented flexible work policies to provide our people even greater freedom to deliver for their clients in ways that work best for them and their teams. all of these efforts are centered on creating a culture where the industry's top talent can begin and build meaningful careers.
as we look ahead, several trends support our confidence in growth. first, we are winning and delivering critical projects that highlight our strong position in key growth markets. most recently, these include the first ever digital need for compliant environmental impact statement for a transportation client in the us, showcasing our investments in innovation and digital solutions. additional wins with major metros to advance more modern and equitable transit systems, key wins to advise clients on their long-term sustainability and resilience strategies, key wins in next generation energy, a smaller but rapidly growing practice within aecom that includes a presence in the northeast offshore wind market. wins in the healthcare sector that further broaden our client base and large program management wins from multi-billion dollar programs across the globe.
second, through our sustainable legacy strategy and commitment to esg, we are distinguishing ourselves in the market as our clients' advance complex, multi-decade initiatives. in fact, year-to-date there have been a record number of corporate commitments to emission reduction targets, outpacing last year's total already. and sustainable bond issuances are at an all time high. aecom is a leader in advising clients and delivering technical solutions to support esg goals. today, we estimate approximately 70% of our revenue is directly related to esg initiatives while nearly all of our revenue has at least some esg element as a driver. we are leaders in green advanced facilities design, energy efficiency, next-generation energy, sustainability, resiliency, environmental remediation, clean water systems and transit electrification. our services in these markets are in high demand and our leadership in these fast growing markets underpins our confidence inorganically outgrowing the market well into the future.
finally, our public sector clients across the world are benefiting from strong budgets and investments in infrastructure markets where we lead. in the us, strengthened state and local tax receipts, strong federal funding and ongoing stimulus measures are contributing to an improving environment for growth. similarly, our international markets are prioritizing infrastructure investments especially in our largest end market, transportation. in australia, the new south wales government has advanced $130 billion package for four years of transportation spending. well, in canada, there is more than $20 billion of public transit and green infrastructure spending. and in europe, the $1 trillion recovery fund requires 30% of spending to be dedicated to green and sustainable infrastructure. these initiatives are before you factor in a potential us federal infrastructure bill in our largest market. as currently proposed nearly every line item in the current draft would be addressable by aecom.
in conclusion, i want to remind, we are the number one transportation design firm, the number one facility design firm, the number one environmental science and environmental engineering firm, have grown to number two in water and lead in several other end markets all positioned for secular growth. no firm is better positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.
with that i will turn the call over to lara.
lara poloni -- president
thanks, troy. please turn to the next slide. we are building momentum within the business as a result of our strengthened culture and strategic alignment. one area where this is apparent is in growing demand for esg-related services. in april, we launched our sustainable legacy strategy to ensure we embed sustainability and esg into all elements of our business. this included our commitment to achieving science based net carbon zero by 2030, expanding diversity and inclusion across our company and advancing the impact we can have on the world by embedding carbon reduction principles into our work to clients.
since launching sustainable legacies, it has been exciting to see how passionate our people are to create a positive impact in their communities and what it means for us in the market. for example, we were awarded a sizable transportation project in the quarter to modernize the transit line for clients in the us. the ultimate determining factor in our selection was our sustainable legacies strategy and the community building and esg elements of our proposal. this success underscores how we are of building stronger, competitive advantages.
we continue to advance our think and act globally strategy to ensure we focus on the highest growth and margin opportunities while investing in our people and innovation. with demand for our services is increasing, we are focused on bringing new talent to aecom and investing in our teams to create the culture troy spoke about earlier. going forward, we are focused on ensuring we have the strongest workforce, which will be critical to recapturing the full benefits from increased demand. we also continue to make investments in our digital platforms and services to extend capabilities and enhance our teams productivity. we can deploy innovation at scale to enable our people to use their hours most productively for their clients. we already have several hundred digital consultants within aecom that are helping clients progress their own digital transformations. this is all part of the more than 1,000 digital practitioners we have across aecom working to ensure we remain an innovator in our industry. a great example of this is our plan engage platform that has enabled the first ever nepa compliant and fully digital environmental impact statement in the us. our solution streamlines engagement process and provides higher value services for our clients. our investments in these digital solutions and innovation will continue to be key differentiators as demand accelerates.
importantly, we know we are headed in the right direction as our people and our clients are responding favorably. i am pleased to report that our client satisfaction scores reached the highest level in our company's history this quarter. and i have no doubt that this will translate into a continued high win rate and growth going forward.
with that, i will now turn the call over to gaurav to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
thanks, laura. please turn to the next slide. our third quarter results reflect another quarter of strong performance. revenue increased and included accelerating growth in our design business. our pipeline and backlog grew, margins reached a new high and continued to lead the industry and earnings increased by double digits. our year-to-date performance is at the upper end of the industry. and looking ahead, our strategy inspires confidence that we will build on this lead.
i want to touch on the margin performance. compared to our fiscal 2018 margin, our third quarter segment adjusted operating margin of 14.1%, marks a 540 basis point improvement. with increased delivery of higher margin work and our operational improvements, we expects to exceed our prior 13.2% margin guidance this year and we are confident in delivering our 15% by 2024 goal and longer term 17% aspirational target.
i'm equally pleased to report that we have delivered more consistent cash flow phasing. this was a real focus of ours this year, and the organization has responded. as a result, we already have been able to deploy substantial capital toward share repurchases and continue to take actions that improve our cost of debt and extended the duration of our debt maturities well into the future.
please turn to the next slide. in the americas, design revenue increased for second consecutive quarter. total nsr declined slightly due to expected decline in construction management business, where we saw the deferral of a number of projects over the past 18 months. however, this trend is improving as evidenced by our sequential backlog growth and growing pipeline of pursuits. importantly, backlog in the americas design business increased by 8%. our investments in the development [phonetic] are translating to a higher win rate on our work and our pipeline also increased by double-digits at start of the year. adjusted operating margin was 18.9%, a 100 basis point increase from the prior year to a new high. profitability in both the americas design and construction management businesses was strong.
please turn to the next slide. turning to the international segment. our nsr increased by 7%. our adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 7.3%, a 160 basis point improvement from the prior year and more than 500 basis point improvement since the beginning of fiscal 2019. this progression provides us confidence in our ability to achieve double-digit international margin target.
please turn to the next slide. turning to cash flow, liquidity, and capital allocation. our third quarter free cash flow of $295 million marked the highest level in four years, putting us on a strong path to achieving our full year guidance of between $425 million and $625 million. with our strong cash flow, we have executed stock repurchases at attractive prices. since september 2020, we have repurchased $930 million of stock, which represents nearly 19 million shares or 12% of our starting share balance. in addition, we have strengthened our balance sheet through a number of actions taken to lower the cost of our debt and extend our maturity. during the quarter we completed the tender and redemption of all 2024 senior notes. we now have no maturities until at least 2026 and are operating with a high degree of financial certainty while driving a benefit to the bottom line. finally, while we have incurred costs related to the tender and redemption of the 2024 notes, the npv of the transaction was very positive and accretive to earnings per share.
please turn to the next slide. with our year-to-date outperformance, we are raising our adjusted ebitda guidance to between $810 million and $830 million or a 10% growth at the midpoint. we are also increasing our adjusted eps guidance for the full year to between $2.75 and $2.85 or 30% growth at the midpoint. this is the third increase to our eps guidance this year, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic and associated macroeconomic trends. our teams are [indecipherable] this guidance does not contemplate any additional repurchases, although it is our plan to continue to buy back stock.
finally, i should note that our fourth quarter comparisons will be impacted by the extra week we adjusted out of our growth rate in the prior year's fourth quarter. this impact should be considered when modeling and analyzing year-over-year growth trends for the coming quarter. an extra week is approximately 7.5% of our quarterly nsr.
with that operator, we are ready for questions.

thank you very much. [operator instructions]. our first question today comes from sean eastman from keybanc. sean, your line is open.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
hi team. great update here. i just wanted to start on the organic nsr guidance for next year. could you give us a flavor of how that 6% looks maybe by design versus construction management, international versus domestic? and if we're at 6% for fiscal '22 what's the updated cagr built into the revised fiscal '24 target?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sean, it's troy. thank you for the question. so first of all, when we look forward, we actually see that organic growth been relatively even across all of our businesses. when we think about our construction management and our us design business, part of what we've been working to accomplish is to have them work together. so when we deliver a project in construction management, there is a material of significant design elements to it. but again we look at the market backdrop, and it is increasingly positive and the business momentum is increasingly positive. so we see it across the americas. we also see something similar internationally. again, we see the opportunities across the entire portfolio of our business improving over the course of next year. and again it's been -- it's driven by the momentum that we're seeing in the business, but also by improved increasingly positive markets.
if we look longer term, the investment that has been made in infrastructure here in the us in the ijaa, and then the investment we're seeing we made in infrastructure globally is very significant and long lasting. and we actually see that to be accelerated by all the various public and private esg ambitions. so we think about it as a catalyst for really a large long-term investment we made in infrastructure. and we almost think about this as a global infrastructure investment renaissance. it's a really unusual time.
and again, so we're giving that guide for '22 based on the momentum in the business. and then in terms of the longer-term what's built in the model, i'll let that gaurav answer that question.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
hey sean, this is gaurav. we do have a 6% cagr built in for our long-term guidance as well. now keep in mind off the strong 2021 and actually a very strong start off 2022 in regards to win as well. what it does not include is any material impact in fiscal year '22 for the jobs act. and we are very confident in our projections for -- for long-term target of '24. jobs act provides a lot of certainty to that confidence now. but we really haven't fully baked that in either. as we get more clarity, it's possible there'll be more incremental upside to that growth target.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
okay, super helpful. and i guess the growth tailwinds in the us are pretty obvious around the jobs act. but in the prepared remarks, you guys highlighted some big pm wins in the middle east. it sounds like you unseated an incumbent there, talked about some strength in the uk. maybe you could just expand on the market share element in the international business. i just want to make sure we're getting the right takeaway there.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. so again, i don't think that our viewpoint on gaining market share is isolated to international. we really see this across the business. but specifically with international, we are seeing opportunities across the business in program management and in, again, as i said, in the larger programs. we've got the canada that's making very significant investments in infrastructure. australia is making those investments, the uk is making those investments, we see that in the middle east.
but then layer on top of that a lot of our private client customers that are also making investments in their own infrastructure. and again, they're driven around driving their environmental and their social ambitions that they set out. so again, we see this broadly across our entire portfolio. and again, the accelerant to that for us has been how we're delivering work for the clients, how we're focused on bringing the best that we have around the globe to those particular clients and opportunities, the focus that we have on providing that front-end advice and those program management services.
when you think about it this way, if there's so much capex being invested in projects over the next, let's say, between five and eight years because of the accelerated investments in infrastructure, our clients need help to manage that capex. so it's not just doing the design work and doing the construction work, but actually being there to help them manage these large capex programs, which are far larger than they've had in the past years.
and for us, investing and building a program management business is our way to participate in that. so we view this as we're participating in those projects sooner, in a more meaningful way and, frankly, longer by having our program management business.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
okay. excellent. well, i'll sneak one last one in. so 30 basis points of margin expansion for fiscal '22, you're also saying investments in bd, hr, digital are accelerating. what would you say the underlying expansion is there if we kind of neutralize those investments and what kind of tail should we expect on the level of investment in the business that you're highlighting here for fiscal '22?
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
sean, this is gaurav again. i'll take that question. so just keep in mind, we're coming off in fiscal year '21 where expectations were at 13.2% and we over delivered on those. simply put, even when you look at '22 and beyond, we're ahead of schedule in certain regards, way ahead of schedule. and nine months ago when we provided a long-term guidance of 15% being achievable, that being a ceiling today where we sit of what we've accomplished. 15% of the floor for us, 17%, which was ambitious, we now have building blocks that are taking place as part of the investments we're making into the business that we made in '21 and will continue into '22.
and what's really providing this tailwind to the second half of your question, it's simplification of our strategy where we're focused on our key geographies where we dominate in the business lines that we operate in those geographies and is taking what troy just alluded to, our think and act global strategy, 50,000 of the brightest professionals in this industry taking their ideas to our clients and delivering value to them, which you're seeing in our capture rates, highest ever we've experienced in our history.
and this is all before the infrastructure renaissance troy spoke to.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
very helpful. thanks so much, gents, i'll turn it over.
operator
thank you, sean for your question. our next question comes from andy kaplowitz from citigroup. andy, please proceed.
andrew kaplowitz -- citigroup -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
good morning, andy.
andrew kaplowitz -- citigroup -- analyst
so, troy, maybe you can give us a little more color into what you're seeing in core americas design. you mentioned your pipeline of opportunity is still up double-digits. americas contracted backlog up 20% -- 21%, although a lot of that is construction management. so did you see any acceleration for instance, from some of your state and local customers who i think last quarter seem to still be relatively careful about moving forward with contracts. and if not, when do you think they could start to move forward, especially considering the us infrastructure bill signed today?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, yeah. andy, so we did see an improvement in the overall americas business in terms of the client decision making. but more importantly we saw a willingness and some very clear agendas to put some long-term programs in place. and a lot of this was being done even without the support of the infrastructure, the federal infrastructure bill. but now, again we're working toward the assumption that it will be signed today at 3:00 pm and when it happens, it certainly provides support for even broader infrastructure investment at the state and local government level.
but i'd just note -- i'll just use example of new york and new jersey. there are plans for the large transit and transportation agencies in new york, new jersey area to invest over the next five years, almost $200 billion in capital programs. and that was before the passage of the iija, obviously this provides more support to that, but it provides more support broadly to those agencies. so we saw an acceleration in the pipeline. so first of all, what we were seeing in terms of the wins, but also in terms of the pipeline of opportunities, and then we see this been accelerated or expanded beyond what we've already seen and then into 2023.
lara poloni -- president
and andy, if i can just... [speech overlap]
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
sorry, lara.
lara poloni -- president
andy, i was just going to expand on troy's points. i mean in terms of the iija, we see all of our capabilities being brought to every single line item of investment in that, and that portfolio that's coming up is a good balance of long-term planning work for a lot of these infrastructure agencies as well as a very robust pipeline of design build. and the other thing i think that we're seeing a lot of near-term opportunities in is a very robust program of federal work where we are very strongly positioned as well.
so, i think we're in a great position to tackle that.
andrew kaplowitz -- citigroup -- analyst
helpful color. and would you say it's a bit of conservatism then that you're forecasting nsr to be up 6% in '22. i think it's up underlying 6.5% in q4. i don't think your comps get much more difficult. anything else going on to think about, because it seems like you could even have an acceleration of q4 levels.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. so again, i think as we tried to point aside in our prepared comments that we increased our longer-term view based on the performance of the business to date, and also, what we saw as the momentum being created in the business. they're what we -- again, the success that our people have been having with their clients into the investments that we've made. and so, we really haven't sorted out exactly what the iija will mean for our business.
we're in the process of doing that now. we started that a while ago, but we're working through exactly what that will mean. so simply put, i can say is we think it provides upside to our results. but maybe you've gotten a sense of this recently, but we try and at least be somewhat conservative in our views of the business. we don't -- we just don't want to be out kind of making some statements where we don't think we can absolutely back them up.
andrew kaplowitz -- citigroup -- analyst
thanks for that, troy. and just a quick one for gaurav, like just in terms of the free cash flow guide obviously down versus '21 at the midpoint. is that just extra capex and the investments you're making? anything else to think about in terms of conversion, '22 versus '21?
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
yeah, andy. it's exactly what you stated. we are making conscious investments in the business, again, to support the growth we see coming and also expansion of our margins, no longer like i said 15%, but really putting the building blocks and pieces for 17%. so it's investment in our digital, in our it investments and when you look at the convergent, the underlying cash flow of the business remains strong, and we've always said it will be in the mid '70s and that's what you see for fiscal year '22, free cash flow conversion, lower because of capex.
andrew kaplowitz -- citigroup -- analyst
i appreciate all the color.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
yeah. thanks andy.
operator
our next question comes from andy wittmann from baird. andy, please go ahead.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
thanks. great. i want to just keep going on the free cash flow question there gaurav a little bit. so i mean, it's i guess 40 -- capex is up like $40 million year-over-year. i mean, should we think of that full delta is unusual, it sounds like there's a little bit of added capex this year. and if you could also just refresh us. i mean, there's some other headwinds, i guess that are identifiable in your free cash flow guidance for this year. could you remind us the cares act headwind for you -- i think you have to payback half of that here in the fiscal first quarter. it looks like you've got $20 million to $30 million of restructuring costs. are those cash or non-cash? i just wanted to get a better sense of what the underlying free cash flow are. and maybe if you wanted to comment, was there anything -- are there any unusual collection to the positive in your guidance for this year that we should be aware of as well? sorry, there is a lot of pieces in there, but i think that will capture if you address those. thanks.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
no problem, andy. hopefully i respond to all of them. please let me know if i don't. so in regards to the capex, the $40 million, it is proper to think about it as a temporary investment we're making into the business for all the reasons troy and i have stated earlier. there's nothing unusual related to the cares act or restructuring. we've had restructuring cash flow in the current year, what we're expecting, the $20 million to $30 million of restructuring, which, by the way, relates to duplicative costs we will incur in -- predominantly in our real estate and it infrastructure as we progress to a flexible workplace of the future. those are going to be predominantly cash in the year, but we incurred that in 2021 as well.
and there are so many puts and takes, andy. it's hard to just point at one unusual item either in '21 or '22. we have tens of thousands of projects going on at a given point in time. so it's hard to be that precise.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
fair enough. and then troy, i thought we'd just check in with you on i guess, the staffing of the organization, the utilization of the organization and the capacity of your people that you currently have in the company to handle this more work. could you just talk about how much more flexibility your people that you currently have, have to do that work and what the recruiting environment looks like and what that means for your overall kind of compensation, labor inflation characteristics? i think you kind of understand where we're heading here.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. that was a very big broad question, so i'll do the same thing. i'll be like gaurav, hopefully i'll hit them all and if i don't, remind me. so just at a high level, absolutely, we're unlike -- we're not unlike anyone else. there certainly is constraints in terms of our ability to bring people on in the industry. and as we see the business growing, there is no question that, that becomes even more important, retaining and attracting very talented people to the organization.
in terms of this year, again, so far this year, we've added about 1,000 people to the organization. but as we move forward, we are focused on creating a great place for people to have a career. so the things that we're doing, flexible workplace is an important element of that, right. it's actually creating an environment where people are comfortable, they want to be, and it's a great place for them to be.
we're looking at investing in their technical and their professional development. we've also evaluated things like benefits and compensation and making sure that we're certainly at the market for that, which all of that does again, as you said, can create some labor inflation. but the nature of our business is that, a lot of those costs in our contracts are passed along to our customers. if you have time and materials or cost-plus contracts there's always escalations built into that.
and then as we move forward and bid projects, those costs get built into our rates and they get passed on to our customers. but more importantly, there's something that we're doing which we think is the more important element of this, which is through our investments in how people are delivering their work, we refer to this as an element of our digital investments on digital transformation. you certainly can't ask people to work harder than they are. so what we're doing is, we're looking to extend people's capacity by making these investments in digital and extending what they can -- what they're able to accomplish with their work day.
and frankly, at the same time, it creates a better work environment, it creates an environment that's more fun and more challenging in terms of your career. so we believe that's a really important element of addressing that market concern and a concern that we have. and then, the last thing is we're continuing to build centers of excellence so that we can take this extraordinary capability that we have globally and ask people to participate from around the globe on projects by being members who are participating in these centers of excellence or great capability.
so that's sort of how we look at it as an issue. we think that it's something that's not going to impact our margins because our industry passes along to customers. and we think we've done some things that position us very well so that we can manage through what would be a great problem to have. it's not something that our industry has been -- had to deal with for a decade.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
fair enough. thank you for the responses. have a good day.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
great. thanks andy.
operator
our next question comes from steven fisher from ubs. steven, please go ahead.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks, good afternoon and good morning. just wanted to come back again to the digital investments that you making. could you give us some sense of, are they all through capex or are there some that's going to the margin line item? and just some examples of, i mean it sounds like it's it, but maybe just some examples of what kind of investments you're making.
and then, just how confident we are that there will be a less visible drag after fiscal '22?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. so steven, i'm going to let gaurav answer the margin question. but first, just let me answer the second half of that question which is, we don't see this being a drag in the business or margins. we actually see this as an important path for us, again moving beyond the 15% target into the 17% range. how -- the value that we deliver to customers and how we deliver it is what's improving our margins. we're not cutting costs. and so there certainly is some money that we're investing in the business to get there and we'll continue to invest that. but we believe that's just -- that will be an ongoing journey. it's not a one-time investment. that's part of how we're going to continue to invest to change the way we deliver work.
the other important point here is that we're not announcing something new. we've actually been working on this and investing in this for about 18 months. what we're doing is we're starting to unveil the things that we're already having success with. and so i made reference to something that we call planengage in my comments. and planengage is a digital tool that we've been working with in customers throughout the globe for this past year. and they've been using as the tool to improve their community engagement and to speed up their environmental permitting process, especially during covid.
and so -- and this is something we think is going to become even more valuable, and we believe that this planengage investment in this product will actually become the industry platform for how our customers across the world, large agencies will use it to engage with their communities to get their projects approved. it really is a unique product.
and as i said, we're not unveiling it. we've already been -- we've already had success with it and with large transportation transit agencies around the world. so those are -- that's an example of the things that we're talking about.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
yeah. and steven, specific to opex versus capex, it goes through both, initially when we're developing it, they'll go through capex and once it's being monetized in the marketplace or if it's internally focused to troy -- what troy alluded to, to expand the efficiency of our workforce at that time it will go through opex.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. and then just related to the stimulus, given that, like you said, it's potentially being signed this afternoon, does this trigger any particular type of action inside the company? is this sort of like a -- or is it going to be more of a wait-and-see? like do you have any now internal stimulus task force to see how you're going to approach this and what to be prepared for? so just curious what today's activities actually triggers inside the company, if anything.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
well, i guess it doesn't necessarily trigger any new activity in the company because we've obviously had line of sights to this for a long period of time. and that activity has been talking to our clients to figure out how it's going to impact them and helping them understand how they can take advantage of it. so that dialogue and that planning has been going on for a while. obviously, as we've been getting closer to something getting signed, that activity has been accelerating.
and so, once it is signed, it's just a continuing ongoing discussion with our clients about helping them think through their plans and think through how they're going to take advantage of this. but more importantly, as they take advantage of it, how are they going to do it? again, you've got clients or agencies whose capex could be increasing by 10 times or more than that. and so that's why we say, having a program management team to help them through that is so important, and that's the investment we've been making. and so we're not doing anything all of a sudden as of this afternoon. we've been thinking about this more with our clients over a long period of time.
lara poloni -- president
and steven, it's lara here. i mean, back to troy's earlier comments, it's no different to the sort of one aecom approach that we're applying to all of the infrastructure programs around the world. and we see a similar very significant pipeline of opportunity. there's a very strong infrastructure outlook. and our program management capabilities that we're growing, our front-end advisory, they are the critical areas of support that all of these key infrastructure agencies are looking for and where we're very strongly positioned to address that at global scale going forward.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
terrific. thank you very much.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thanks, steve.
operator
our next question comes from michael feniger from bank of america. michael, please go ahead.
michael feniger -- bank of america securities -- analyst
yes. hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. we're seeing a lot of the m&a right now in the engineering space including private equity. just how are you balancing the view to reinvest in the business at this stage versus acquisition with where maybe multiples are today?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
good question, mike. there are obviously -- again, there are two points of viewing this. we have a very closed stated point of view, is that we believe that invest in organic growth and free capital for our shareholders [technical issues] why don't you just mute your phone? thank you. so this again, investing -- invest in organic growth, and at the same time, returning capital to shareholders is our stated point of view.
and i mean, there are all kinds of ways to look at it but we're looking at the long-term cagr of cash earnings. and if you look at a long-term cagr of cash earnings, we believe, as we said, we think that we're in the 20% range. if you do some analysis around the alternative, which is through m&a, you'll find that when you look at how capital is deployed, that the long-term cagr is perhaps lower than that.
now this also comes with the ability to actually integrate businesses and more importantly, integrate cultures, which can be a difficult thing to do and takes years to find out whether you're successful. so we just have our point of view that we believe now that we have the opportunity to invest in our business and have turned it into the highest-performing business in these industry with the highest margins. and we believe continuing to do that produces the best result for our investors, which is the highest long-term cash earnings cagr or cash earnings per share cagr.
michael feniger -- bank of america securities -- analyst
thanks, troy. and i guess just to follow up with that, you're, i think, 1 times levered. but if we assume the midpoint of your ebitda growth and another good year of free cash flow, i mean, your leverage would have moved down considerably just as status quo. so what is the right net leverage range for us to think about this business with the stability and the runway we see over the next year? is there any view of like instituting a dividend, given the stability of this business? just curious of how to think about that leverage range as well as we're moving into this growth period?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yes. so i guess, first i'll simply say that, that's an ongoing dialogue we have with the board, right? how we allocate capital is an important question that we have continued to evaluate and answer. and today, we're very clear on what that answer is. but you're right. as our business grows, our net leverage will decline, meaning that we certainly have more capacity.
we think that the net leverage of one is the right place to be for our business. if we look at -- if you look at the -- again, some different elements of this. when we look at the nature of the business, the long-term backlog that we have, the certainty we have around the business, the cost of capital that comes along with our current leverage -- our leverage position, but we just think we're in a very good spot to be, which is 1 times net leverage. and you're right, as we move forward, we will create an even larger opportunity to invest. and what you've described that other question about dividends, that's just an ongoing dialogue we have with our board about what is the right way to think about allocating capital. but today, we're very clear on what that answer is.
operator
our next question comes from jamie cook from credit suisse, jamie, your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, good morning. nice quarter. i guess two quick questions. you guys have made good progress on reducing the cyclicality or the seasonality associated with the free cash flow. so i'm just wondering if there's any more opportunities there or in 2022. and then i guess, just my second question. i know you're still committed to sort of the double-digit margins in the international business, but just sort of the time line to get there. are we ahead of schedule where you think you should be? thanks.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
jamie, this is gaurav, i'll take both of those questions. in regards to cash, we had a very strong conversion of 80%-plus in 2021. and the quality of the cash flow was very strong, phasing was good. but our focus across all key operational metrics is of continuous improvement. so there's always going to be opportunities to negotiate better terms, better working capital management. and that's what we're going to be focused on, to make sure that our phasing is optimal and we're extracting the maximum amount of conversions possible.
in regards to the margins for international, as i said in my opening comments, we had 80 basis points growth in 2021, and we expect that growth in margin to continue international as we march toward double-digit margin in the international business. it's all being supported by strong market dynamics, fantastic capture rates opportunities that we're able to go get in the market and executing upon them profitably. so, we see no hindrance to our ambitions in international margins.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thanks jamie.
operator
and our final question today comes from michael dudas from vertical research partners. michael, please go ahead.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning gentlemen and lara.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
hi mike.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
two thoughts. first, maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on the opportunities focused on transportation infrastructure. but on your water business, i would think that there's been some funding at some opportunity certainly here and abroad that could be very supportive. maybe share some thoughts on that. and then the follow-up with that, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, cop26 and the excitement thereabouts. how is the private and public sector balancing?
i'm sure there's a lot of work prior to this conference, but is that some -- an accelerant that you'll see that we see some visibility in some of the global design business and the opportunities for energy transition advice and efforts, certainly, obviously, the wind farm project infrastructure is quite a nice award last quarter, that going forward in your plan in next, let's say, next 12, 24 months?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
okay. yes, mike. mike, it's troy. i'll take the first one and then i'll share the second one with lara. so first of all, you're right, there is a substantial opportunity in the water business that is baked into the infrastructure investment and jobs act.
again, there's some large line items including $15 billion that are dedicated to improving drinking water infrastructure projects. there is a significant amount, and i think it's over $50 billion that is focused on pfas and eliminating emerging contaminants. and then, there's also money that will go and help improving water quality at the state level.
so again, this infrastructure bill is just so significant that we focus on the transportation element. but you're right, there's a lot of money that's going into aviation, a significant amount of money going into water, and certainly, in terms of environmental remediation and containments, which we'll participate in.
and then, there are other line items included in there. there's $21 billion being dedicated to just environmental remediation work for super fund sites. so there just are all of these line items that are scattered through -- that are in that budget. and as we've said, we believe that we participate in a meaningful way in almost every single line item in that bill.
and i'll let lara answer your cop question.
lara poloni -- president
yeah, sure. and thanks for the question. it's very timely. as you know, we in april, launched our sustainable legacy strategy. just last week, as troy said, we also released our sustainability report. so cop is very timely for us and such a great platform for us to showcase our tremendous esg capabilities, which we've had for a number of years, but i feel like we're really bringing all that together very strongly. and it was great to see and have such a strong presence and showing at cop and to see so many nations coming together to talk about the serious challenges of climate change and to talk about the sort of financial commitments that are going to be required to achieve that.
for us, it was just a fantastic opportunity to showcase all of that and to talk to many of our partners and clients about how we take that forward. so, we're -- it's a core element of our esg strategy going forward. and i think we're in the strongest position in the industry to make that one of our key growth strategies going forward.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. and just to add two quick points to what lara said, which is what's been happening in the last six months has been a little unusual in that we've seen private financial institutions, banks, insurance companies and other providers of private capital change their thinking about where they're going to allocate it. so toward esg-related projects, projects that provide return environmentally and socially and away from other projects. which again, we think is important because that's going into different types of infrastructures we're positioned to support.
and the other thing that has come on cop that for us is, we think is fantastic is we're participating determining how, in fact, decarbonization and sequestration is going to be measured because today, the standards for measurement and how you go about measuring that are still is yet undetermined. until that happens and there's certainty around it, it makes it very difficult to actually have markets, right, where you're actually selling carbon credits.
and so, we've been doing an investment in that. so we mentioned our natural capital project during the call. but we're also working again through a group that is setting the terms of -- standardizing the terms of actually measuring so that we can support decarbonization markets. so i really think that, that provides us a great leadership opportunity.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst

thank you, will. and thank you all for joining us today. i want to begin by acknowledging our teams across the globe whose contributions made fiscal 2021 a tremendous success. our people remain our greatest assets, and it's because of their commitment to our success that we are so well positioned for the future. i'm proud of our team's accomplishments, and i'm energized by the opportunity we see in 2022 and beyond.
turning to our results. we exceeded our expectations on every key metric, highlighted by accelerating organic nsr growth, record operating margins, double-digit earnings growth and strong cash flow. it really was a very successful year. our nsr for the fourth quarter increased by 6.5%, which marked a third consecutive quarter of accelerating organic growth and included the strong contributions from both the americas and international businesses.
we delivered a 14.8% segment adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter and 13.8% for the full year. both results exceeded our expectations and extends our lead over the industry. to put this performance in context, our margin in the fourth quarter is more than 600 basis points higher than in fiscal 2018. this performance directly reflects the high value we provide to clients and the actions we have taken to create the best industry delivery platform.
looking back to february, at our investor day, we set margin targets at the time that we were very ambitious. today, we are ahead of schedule on our plans, and we have even greater conviction in our 17% longer-term goal, which we now view as achievable rather than aspirational. importantly, our strong margins afford us the opportunity to accelerate investments in our teams to drive organic growth and into our digital aecom capabilities, which i will discuss in greater detail in a moment.
turning to earnings, we delivered at the high end of our guidance ranges for both adjusted ebitda and eps. full-year adjusted ebitda was $830 million and adjusted eps was $2.82, which marked an 11% and 31% increase respectively. free cash flow was $583 million and was driven by our strong earnings and continued high cash flow conversion. our cash flow result is a testament to the focus on efficiently converting our earnings to cash as well as the high quality lowest mix of our business. we have repurchased more than $1 billion of stock since last september, or 13% of the company. and we have $940 million remaining under our current authorization.
we remain committed to repurchasing stock with available cash and cash flow, which we believe is the best and highest returning use of our capital after our investments in growth. turning to our wins and backlog. our win rate remains high, and we continue to gain market share. we delivered $3.7 billion of wins in the fourth quarter, including a 1.2 book-to-burn ratio in the design business. our contracted backlog, which is a key indicator of revenue growth increased by 18% and included 4% growth in design business.
our pipeline of opportunities is up to double-digits in the americas design business. and based on our clients' strengthening funding backdrop, including benefits from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in the us, we expect our backlog to continue to grow. overall, our performance demonstrates that we are outgrowing the industry organically and capturing market share.
there are two areas in particular that highlight our success and showcase the value we deliver to clients. first, we set as a key objective to substantially grow our program management business and we are delivering. this is especially apparent in the middle east where we had several recent successes on high priority and larger programs where a combination of technical leadership, global thinking and program management expertise were instrumental in our success. this includes winning significantly expanded program management and design roles in transformational projects in saudi arabia, such as for alula city and a large transportation project in qatar, where more than 100 employees have joined aecom from the incumbent to support this work.
second, we are demonstrating our leadership on esg. our investment at the natural capital laboratory in uk is a great example. we established this project in 2019 to study the environmental change and biodiversity impact with precision by leveraging drones, artificial intelligence, gis data and thermal imaging. the ability to more exactly measure the impacts of decarbonization is a critical element of the global agenda to drive decarbonization and carbon sequestration. our investment in our work at the ncl underscores how aecom and our professionals are leading in the development of standards and methods to measure decarbonization which will be especially important for creating reliable markets for sustainability investments.
let's turn to the next slide. i mentioned earlier that our strong performance in fiscal 2021 has created the opportunity to accelerate investments and expand our advantages. we break these investments into three categories: people, clients and digital. beginning with our people. we are a knowledge-based business and our diverse professionals serve as our greatest advantage. therefore, it is critical that we have the right culture and programs in place to attract and retain the best talent in the industry. to do this, we've implemented a flexible work model designed to facilitate optimal work life balance.
in addition, we've enhanced the benefit programs and increased our investment in technical and professional development. most importantly, our people are winning and delivering the most challenging and iconic projects. all of this culminates in a culture of high engagement, high satisfaction and low attrition.
turning to how we deliver for clients. we are leading with our higher margin program management and advisory capabilities and investing across our key account programs to ensure our clients are benefiting from our best expertise globally. we're also developing technology to automate and pre-populate certain elements of our designs, which capitalizes on our vast expertise, accelerates the design process and extends the capacity of our workforce.
finally, today we unveiled digital aecom which brings together all of our innovative digital capabilities. after more than a year of focused investment and the launch of many digital solutions, we are now formally rolling out our digital products. a great example of this is planengage, a digital platform that reinvents the public engagement process for an infrastructure project by creating greater certainty on cost, time and stakeholder management. successful community engagement is a critical step in a project, but this process is really digitized. planengage simplifies this process by integrating all the key elements of a project into a digital tool, which allows our clients to capture information to make more informed decisions and advance projects more quickly. this solution is years ahead of the competition by our estimation. and we see planengage becoming the industry standard. with the passage of the infrastructure act in the us, this tool will be even more valuable.
across these focus areas, one theme is constant. our investment will expand our advantage as demand grows and labor constraints challenges some in our industry. please turn to the next slide. looking to fiscal 2022 and beyond, the spotlight on infrastructure has never been brighter. in the us, the $1.2 trillion infrastructure and jobs act marks a generational investment in america's infrastructure. this bill provides much needed long-term funding certainty across our strongest end markets such as transit modernization, electrification, environmental remediation and climate resilience.
importantly, we are positioned to benefit from nearly every line item in this bill. we anticipate this funding will increase our addressable market in our most profitable business by double-digits over the coming years. and we expect the most meaningful benefits in fiscal 2023 and beyond. in addition to the strengthened federal funding environment, all of our state and local clients are on an equally strong footing. today, state dot [phonetic] budgets are significantly above prior projections and the fiscal outlooks are stronger.
our public sector pipeline in us is up double-digits and with the strong funding backdrop now in place, we anticipate the pace of decisions will accelerate as well. our international markets are equally strong. conditions in our largest markets have improved, and we're delivering strong growth across all major international markets in the fourth quarter. in addition, we had strong backlog growth in each of our larger geographies. i'm especially pleased to see that our strategy with a focus on program management contributing to the success in places like the middle east and in key transportation wins in the uk, where regaining market share has been a key priority.
as the number one ranked transportation facilities and environmental engineering firm as well as the number two ranked water design firm, we are uniquely positioned to benefit. turning to our financial guidance. we've initiated adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps guidance of between $880 million and $920 million and between $3.20 and $3.40. this reflects 8% and 17% growth at the respective midpoints. underpinning this growth is an expectation for another year of accelerating organic nsr growth and at least 30 basis point increase in our margins to another record high of 14.1%. our guidance incorporates all the planned growth investments we are making in our people, business development, client delivery and digital capabilities.
i also want to comment on the 2024 financial projections we shared at our investor day in february. based on our strong performance to date and the returns we expect on our investments, we are raising our long-term adjusted eps guidance to at least $4.75 in fiscal 2024. this represents a more than doubling of our fiscal 2020 earnings and a nearly 20% cagr from 2021 to 2024.
with that, i'll turn the call over to lara.
lara poloni -- president
thanks, troy. i am pleased with how well our teams have responded to our new strategy and their many accomplishments in fiscal 2021. in particular, i'd like to highlight our success on some of our larger key pursuits, our global approach, technical leadership, program management capabilities, advisory expertise and multiyear investments are bearing fruit. a great example of this is in the middle east where we prioritize as a long-term growth opportunity.
we have gained market share with wins from megacities, including neom and alula in saudi arabia. key to these successes was the integration of global capabilities, including expertise from every region and market sector. our culture of collaboration has truly distinguished us from competitors, particularly as our clients work to address multi-decade investment programs that require more holistic thinking.
another great example is in the us where we were recently selected for a large program for a client who selected us based on our leadership capabilities in many verticals including in pfas, even as pfas expertise wasn't the main criteria in the pursuit. we are continuing to prioritize our time and capital on the best opportunities, which has been instrumental in our high win rate over the past year and in our confidence in continued market share gains.
looking ahead, our clients continue to prioritize investments in esg, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. at the cop26 summit earlier this month, this commitment was front and center as the most prominent public and private sector voices spoke with unity on the challenge and the opportunity.
in demonstrating how we are leading in esg alongside our clients, we published our global esg report last week, which includes disclosures aligned with the sasb and tcfd frameworks. this report is an important step in our esg journey and underscores our commitment to regularly communicating our progress on our sustainable legacy strategies.
finally, troy spoke about our focus on ensuring we attract and retain the industry's best and brightest. and i'm pleased to report we are operating from a strong position. to that point, we conducted a global employee survey in september that revealed very strong levels of engagement, including the vast majority recommending aecom as a great place to work.
high employee engagement is also leading to the highest client satisfaction scores in our company's history in fiscal 2021. with our momentum, we are in an enviable position from which to deliver another strong year in fiscal 2022.
with that, i will now turn the call over to gaurav to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
thanks, lara. please turn to the next slide. our fourth quarter and full year results serve as clear evidence of the strength of our business and the benefit of our focused strategy. we delivered: accelerating nsr growth; the highest margins in our company's history; another year of double-digit adjusted ebitda growth; more than 30% adjusted eps growth and; a seventh consecutive year of free cash flow at or above our guidance range.
our strong financial performance is creating increased opportunities to invest in organic growth while also bolstering our confidence in delivering on our long-term organic growth and financial goals. importantly, all of this was achieved while making critical investments in people, teams and digital capabilities that will sustain our advantages in fiscal 2022 and beyond.
please turn to the next slide. in the americas, nsr increased by 7% in the fourth quarter, including growth in both design and construction management businesses. contracted backlog increased by 21% to set a new record. this included growth in the design business and a large construction management project that moved into contracted backlog and firmed up our outlook for the year.
i should note that our awarded backlog was reduced by $1.3 billion as a result of this client only advancing the first phase of this project at this time. however, the economic impact of the shift is not material to our earnings outlook. and, our confidence in the growth outlook for the construction management business is higher than it ever has been in many years. the fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 19.8%, a 290 basis point increase from the prior year to a new all-time high and reflects strong execution.
please turn to the next slide. turning to the international segment. nsr increased by 6% in the fourth quarter, including growth across all of our largest regions, and backlog increased by 10%. this is a result of our organic growth investments, market share gains, steadily improving market conditions. our adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 7.4%, an 80 basis point improvement from the prior year. we continue to make progress on our margin improvement initiatives and remain confident in our goal of achieving double-digit international margins.
please turn to the next slide. turning to cash flow, liquidity and capital allocation. fourth quarter free cash flow of $299 million contributed to full year free cash flow of $583 million. our performance reflects the benefit of our improved cash phasing throughout the year, which allowed us to accelerate our stock repurchases. we have now repurchased nearly 20.5 million shares since september 2020, or approximately 13% of our starting share count at an average price of approximately $51.
as we look ahead, we will continue to make critical investments to build on our industry-leading organic growth. as a result, we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 to include investment primarily relating to the advancement of our digital strategy as well as ongoing investments to reconfigure our real estate footprint and support our flexible work programs. these investments will impact the conversion of our earnings to free cash flow in fiscal 2022.
however, the underlying cash generation within the business is firmly intact. to that point, we expect free cash flow of between $450 million and $650 million in fiscal 2022. importantly, our investments in growth and innovation will continue to separate us from our peers, and we are progressing toward our 17% longer-term margin target.
please turn to the next slide. for fiscal 2022, we are guiding to adjusted ebitda of between $880 million and $920 million or 8% growth at the midpoint and adjusted eps of $3.20 and $3.40 or a 17% growth at the midpoint. this guidance contemplates the improved market conditions we're experiencing today, our substantial backlog and pipeline and the benefits of our investment in our people, client and digital capabilities.
to be clear, this guidance does not reflect any expected benefit from the recently passed legislation in the us, which, as troy mentioned, is expected to benefit us more materially in fiscal 2023 and beyond. we expect our msr growth to accelerate to approximately 6% in fiscal 2022. this is all organic growth.
in addition, we project a further 30 basis points of margin expansion to 14.1% as we continue to expand our lead on the industry while investing in people, clients and innovation. i also want to emphasize that our adjusted eps guidance only incorporates the benefit of our share repurchases completed to date, though we expect to continue to buy back stock in fiscal 2022 as part of our capital allocation program.
also incorporated into our guidance is a 26% effective tax rate. we expect to maintain this rate going forward, reflecting changes in our operating mix and structure. finally, i should note that we expect our ebitda track with our phasing in fiscal 2021. our tax rate may be lower in the first quarter, and as a result, our eps phasing may be more first half weighted than our seasonal pattern.
with our outperformance in fiscal 2021, our expectation for strong growth again in fiscal 2022 and the successful launch of our digital platform, we are also increasing our long-term financial targets for fiscal 2024. this includes our expectation to now achieve adjusted eps of at least $4.75 in fiscal 2024, which is 10% above our prior projection and is nearly 20% compounded annual growth rate from 2021 to 2024.
with that operator, we are ready for questions.
",2021-Q4,ACM
0.9995,0.9979,,,":
operator
thank you very much. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from the line of michael feniger from bank of america. michael, your line is open.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. hey, everyone. thank you for taking my question. i just wanted to start off with the question on inflation.
you guys were able to get your margins up in the first quarter. good start to the year. i guess just where are you seeing inflationary pressure in the business? and maybe just how is this industry built to handle inflation? is it the contract structure that helps? and i guess how is aecom better able to handle an inflationary backdrop relative to peers? 
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. michael, it's troy. good morning. thanks for your questions.
with respect to inflation, i think if you go back and you look at the history of our industry, we certainly had some periods. we're not -- we don't have inflation like we do today, but we have had periods of inflation. and typically, that cost has been passed along to our customers. and so i think when you look at an industry like ours, and in particular, our business, a consulting business predominantly, that those costs continue to get passed along to our customers.
and what you pointed out in your question was, is, it is already part of our existing contract structures. we have wage escalations in, usually, our longer-term contracts. and then as we continue to bid, we put together our bid costs, and that will include the increased costs of either paying our professionals or the other costs that you have to incur in the -- but i'll take you back to one really important point, is there are a lot of long-term costs in our business that are typically fixed. so our labor is certainly a flexible cost and we certainly see an increased cost of paying our professionals.
but there are a number of costs like real estate and other items that are fixed costs in our business. and so we don't experience, at least, inflation today. and the proof point in terms of our ability to pass along those costs to our customers is the fact that you pointed, our margins continue to increase. and in fact, increase at a time where we're investing and growing the business and growing our backlog and investing in our people and investing in our digital profile while we continue to improve margins.
so again, inflation for the most part is not an impact on our business.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great, troy. and it was interesting to see you guys repurchase shares in the same quarter of a dividend initiation. good to see that. now you are seeing some of your peers are being much more aggressive in m&a.
some are even looking at software assets. i'm just curious, how does aecom kind of view the m&a landscape? and if there's any change in terms of how you guys are going about your capital allocation structure.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. so first of all, there's no change in how we're going about our capital allocation structure. i think we are perhaps a little bit different than a lot of people in our industry in that we believe that we're able to invest in the business through our margins. and we also believe that we have an obligation to return capital to our shareholders over the long term.
and in terms of paying a dividend, again, we think that sends a strong signal that we have, in fact, transformed the business to a lower-risk, higher-returning business with a track record of converting earnings to cash. and with our eps growth, it gives us even more confidence to increase the permanent return of capital to our shareholders. so again, i -- no change in how we're thinking about capital allocation. and we think we have ample capital to deploy to increase the value of the business and to grow the business.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. i'm just going to sneak one more in there on the cr. are you seeing any disruption on your business with the cr? does that impact your view of infrastructure hitting 2023? you still had good organic growth even with the cr right now. but how should we -- how do you see the cr kind of playing out in the next few days? and is there any impact it would have to 2023? thanks.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
well, that's a good question. first of all, i'm not in the business of predicting what the federal government is going to do, so i'll decline to answer that question. but there is a decision to be made in the next few weeks about whether the federal government will continue to operate with a continued resolution or in fact they'll put in a budget in place, which if a budget is in place, then it creates the appropriations for funding under the infrastructure bill. but again, we view that, that is going to happen.
there is a lot of bipartisan support for infrastructure. and so again, we see the funding eventually coming in place, and we believe that there's probably an impact on our business in 2023. but putting that all aside, putting that aside, again, we've seen our business grow. more importantly, in the americas, we saw our book-to-burn grow at 1.4 times.
and i think that's just an indication of the funding that exists broadly across our customer base in the u.s. so again, i think about that the continuing resolution and the infrastructure bill being upside for our business in the long term.
operator
our next question today comes from the line of andy kaplowitz from citi. andy, your line is open.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
good morning, andy.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
troy or lara, so 8.2% adjusted margin in international, i think, was the highest quarterly result we've seen from that segment. we know the result is just part of the progression to get to 10%, but international margin, i think, was stuck in the low to mid-7% range for all of '21. so did mix improve in the first quarter? is this really just the shared service centers kicking in now? and does it mean that as sales continue to increase here, we should see aecom progress through the 8s for the rest of '22.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. andy, thanks for the question. and i'm going to pass it off to gaur to answer it.
gaur kapoor -- chief financial officer
yeah. andy, thanks for the question. our international margins, to your point, increased significantly year over year and very consistent with our expectations. as you probably recall, we've invested quite heavily to uplift those margins in the marketplace and operational efficiencies, which we're starting to see come through at a higher clip now.
we're going to continue to march toward double digits. it's not just 10%. our longer-term aspirations overall for the enterprise, to remind everybody, is 17%, and international is going to be a large part of it. now, specific to 2022 and progression of the margins for international, we will see consistent margin for the international business like we did last year.
we're not incurring significant restructuring charges, our results are very clean. and therefore, the phasing is very consistent throughout the year.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
thanks for that, gaur. and then maybe i could ask you about phasing of revenue. so you did 5% nsr in q1, you're down to 6% for the year. we know you've said the infrastructure bill really kicks in more in '23.
but do you continue to see like a slow and steady ramp-up from here? normal seasonal cadence? should we be concerned at all about disruption from omicron or supply chain? or is it sort of steady as she goes and then maybe we see some money from the infrastructure bill late in '22?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
so andy, troy again. look, i think we're going to just see a steady improvement in growth throughout the year. there's certainly some seasonality to it. but also, again, we do see in certain markets, the funding from our clients and the project ramp-up incurring over time.
so again, i don't see anything but sort of continued slow, steady growth. you were right to point out that covid did impact everyone's business, and we were certainly not immune from that. we certainly felt the impact of that in december and through january. but putting that aside, we still grew the business in the first quarter at 5%.
and our backlog grew fairly substantially, replacing those orders and adding to it significantly. so, again, i see nothing that holds back from just a continued, steady improvement in growth over the remainder of the year.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
appreciate it guys.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thanks, andy.
operator
our next question comes from sean eastman from keybanc capital markets. sean, the floor is yours. 
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
good morning, team. i'm just trying to think about the risks to this anticipated top-line growth acceleration. and of course, the war for talent tends to be front of mind there. so can you update us on the pace of hiring? and perhaps what aecom has been working on in terms of productivity enhancements and leveraging that employee base.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. so first of all, i think there's two things that go into revenue growth. first of all is winning. and you've got to win what matters.
and i think we were clear in our prepared comments that we really feel comfortable based on what our people in the market -- our professionals are doing in the marketplace. and certainly, we're winning the things that matter to us. so that's -- again, think about it, tick that box off. secondly, you point out talent.
you have to have a great group of professionals to deliver on that work. and it certainly is a market that is challenging, but we did see an increase in our professional headcount during the quarter. so we continue to add people to grow the business. but also we are making other investments.
again, those investments are in our people, and in building a business that more people want to work. we talk about it as building a place where people want to have a career. we are absolutely focused on that, and investing in our people, investing in their technical and leadership development and offering opportunities for them for the long term. we're also investing in digital tools, which is, part of that investment is extending the capability or the capacity of our people.
so they're able to actually accomplish more in the same day than they would have been in the past and that's a focus. and then the third thing is we've been investing in building capability centers so that we have the opportunity to take work and to put it in among these groups, so ultimately, we can improve the efficiency or productivity on that work. so really to address that second challenge, which is, are there enough talented people in the marketplace to deliver all this work? we're addressing in those three ways.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
all right. that's interesting. and going back to the inflation discussion, it's clear that sort of the price cost element is not really a concern. it's probably more how inflation ultimately impacts demand.
and i'm just curious how you would characterize the sensitivity of the core growth drivers behind that 6% organic target over the next couple of years around the broader macro. and to the extent inflation does degrade the business cycle, how much risk there would be to that 6% that you've outlined.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. well, i guess maybe the easiest way to answer that is that we are seeing an improvement in our pipeline. so the opportunities that we're pursuing in the americas business and the international business, as you said, are both increasing. and if i sort of look at the underlying conditions, we certainly see, within our customer base, there is a significant amount of ambition to undertake infrastructure projects, and a lot of that is esg-driven.
but also, there's a tremendous amount of funding that has been made available. and typically, when that funding is becoming available, it isn't that sensitive to the increase of -- in costs that we're currently seeing now. so again, we're just not seeing as a result of inflation a change in the ambition and a change in funding within our customer base.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
understood. thanks for the insights.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, sean.
operator
our next question today comes from steven fisher from ubs. steven, please proceed with yoru question.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning. you mentioned that your win rate is very high. can you maybe quantify what that was? and how sustainable you think the underlying conditions are that support that level of win rate success.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
so steve, your question is a little difficult to understand, but i believe you were asking about our win rate and whether our win rate is sustainable. so our...
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
[inaudible]
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sorry, steve. you were breaking up. but i'll try and answer that one question, which is our win rate has been improving steadily over the last four or five quarters. in this last quarter, again, for us, it hit an all-time high.
and we're capturing almost 50% of the work that we're bidding on, which is, for us, it's an extraordinary result. and i look at the underlying conditions, so there's great competitors in the marketplace. there's no question. there are really good companies that we compete against, that's not changing.
and in terms of what we're doing to win, those things that we're doing to win aren't changing. and those things that we're doing are we're bringing the best to our organization, globally to those clients that matter. we are investing in digital tools to win the work and differentiate ourselves. and we've been growing and invested in building an advisory and program management business.
so it actually gives us an opportunity to bid on more than we typically have in the past. and i don't think -- again, i don't see us changing what we're doing because it's working, and i don't see the competition changing. so it's a long-winded way of saying i don't see a change in the underlying conditions. i expect us to have a high win rate for the long term.
operator
our next question today comes michael dudas from vertical research. michael, please go ahead.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen and lara.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
good morning, mike.
lara poloni -- president
good morning.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
just to follow-up on your answer to steven's question about your project management, advisory business. so i was intrigued on the chart in the presentation of the opportunities that you see for that business. how different is that just to grow, whether you're growing other -- the traditional core design, engineering services business relative to what you have? and do you have the talent promoted within to do that? or is it the -- bringing in the experts from other companies to get to that point? and is there a difference in the type of cost or i'm assuming there's a difference in the margin profile over the lifetime of the project around the project management, if you have all the design and engineering below it or separate from that? maybe if you could just maybe elaborate on that. and looking at that market size, how much that could be important to your margin improvement in the u.s.
and i assume abroad as well.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. that's -- again, mike, thanks for the question. so we see our opportunities over the long term expanding as our clients, again, gain more funding. so again, we see the market, the size of the market increasing.
but as we've added advisory and program management and a building of businesses, what they do is they allow us to have a much greater share of that growing market. so we're now exposed to more of that addressable spend. in the past, we were focused on a design business. and now adding program management advisory, we believe that we're exposed to a multiple of what we were exposed to in the past.
so that could be two or three times what we were exposed to in terms of those project budgets. the other thing it does, by adding advisory and program management, it means that we actually will participate in those projects sooner or earlier in the process. and it means that we have the opportunity to be -- to participate in those projects for, obviously, a longer period of time. so again, that's why we thought it was important to build those businesses because it obviously is complementary to what our design team -- our design business does.
and the skills of our designers and our design business work perfectly, they match perfectly, with an advisory and program management business. so your second question was, are we hiring or are we building from within? and the answer is we're doing both. we're actually adding folks into that business from outside, and we're also then having our people who have those great skills already from the design business participating in that work. and with respect to margins, i'll turn it over to gaur to answer.
gaur kapoor -- chief financial officer
yeah, michael. for margins, specific to our pm business, it's very consistent with our core design business. the reason for that is when you look at the overhead that business needs, it's minimal. the utilization is much higher, they're longer-term projects, the utilization is much higher compared to the core design business.
and other overhead costs are minimal as most of those employees are within the facilities of our clients. now clearly, our advisory services does -- is a higher-value services we provide, better margins. and those are all embedded within our respective business lines and geographies. so it's part of the design business.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
thank you. and is there certain end markets or clients, or regionally, that your program management platform can generate better, faster, more profitable growth than others?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
again, mike, i'm going to turn that question over to lara to give you kind of a flavor of how the program management business rolled out across the globe for us.
lara poloni -- president
yeah. thanks, troy, and good morning, mike. we definitely see substantial opportunities in the infrastructure space for government clients in particular. there's obviously a lot of pent-up demand for major infrastructure schemes around the world, beyond the americas as well.
so those clients are looking for those front-end advisory services to help them with rapid business case, project prioritization and then the longer-term involvement that we can provide through full project life cycle program management. we'll assist with ensuring that those projects are delivered with cost and time certainty, that we can get earlier engagement with some of the contractors to provide construct-ability reviews. so as troy said, we are providing front-end advisory services and really extending our involvement so that, that support is much earlier, but it extends much longer through the program management role in particular. but it's predominantly those big infrastructure schemes where we see tremendous demand in particular.
but even in the private sector, there are clients, for example, that need our assistance approaching us every day with even just some of the front-end services like esg advisory. how do they gear up for that? how do they manage their energy transition? all of those things. so i would say very fertile ground for us to grow that service offering.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
excellent. thank you so much, guys.

our next question today comes from jamie cook from credit suisse. jamie, your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey. good morning. nice quarter. i guess just two questions.
one, the free cash flow conversion struck me in the quarter. obviously, it was a record free cash flow quarter for you guys. so can you talk about what changed there? is there any pull forward or is this just a structural improvement? and why isn't there upside to the free cash flow guide, given where we are in the first quarter? and then i guess my second, quarter 2. the margins are performing better when a lot of other companies are talking about headwinds associated with covid, supply chain, people calling in sick because of omicron.
so i guess while your margins are very good, i'm wondering if they're being weighed down by that to some degree. so perhaps, your underlying performance is better or we're closer to where we need to be on your longer-term targets. thanks.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
great. jamie, thank you. so just a high-level comment and then i'm going to turn it over to gaur to answer your specific questions. but i think over the last two years, the one thing that we have learned is we learned that we have to be agile.
being it in the -- as we move from week to week, month to month, quarter to quarter, we're faced with all kinds of challenges in the business. and i think our professionals and our leaders here have proven that they just have their way to -- they've proven that they can navigate through those changing and sometimes difficult environments. and i think that's reflective in our results. but with respect to your specific questions on free cash flow and margin, i'll let gaur answer that for you.
gaur kapoor -- chief financial officer
hey, jamie. so specific to cash flow, you've heard me say this before, where we're fostering an environment which focuses on continuous improvement, and that includes cash. focus on cash has allowed us, as we've said before, better phasing throughout the year. that's always a priority for us, and you saw that in the first quarter.
our focus for the remainder of the year is to make sure that the first half cash flow phasing is better than last year, while also acknowledging that seasonality comes into play. and that's why our cash flow is always going to be weighted more toward the second half. but this is -- we're always going to strive to get the best result on cash because you can see what it delivers in terms of capital allocation. it allows us to repurchase stock, it allows us the stability to issue, initiate and issue dividends.
and we'll continue to do that. on the margin part, it's also part of our continuous improvement culture, but at the same time, acknowledging, to troy's earlier comments, of how our operationals, our professionals operate over the last couple of years. they're not being reactive, right? they're really being thoughtful in how they plan and execute projects, their businesses, regions and business lines. and that includes us investing strategically in our advisory and pm businesses, which are higher up the value chain.
to the earlier question we got from michael dudas, it also includes investing in digital and innovative solutions which expand our internal capacity for efficiency of our employees and also in the marketplace that troy and lara has spoken to the various digital tools we have available, focusing on our international margins, our workplace of the future, which we have talked about, that includes continued focus on real estate and also utilizing our global design services and business services capability that we have talked quite a bit in the past as well. so all those things have helped us strategically alleviate potential inflation pressures that are coming through because we will continue to invest in our workforce. and you're seeing the results of that in our margins, where we continue to expand year over year. and the last thing i'll add to all of that is our results are clean.
when you look at our gaap results to adjusted results, we're not going through massive restructuring. this is all very well-thought strategic initiatives put in place to deliver the results you're seeing.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok, thank you.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thanks, jamie.

our next question today comes from adam thalhimer from thompson, davis. adam, please go ahead.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. congrats on the good start to the year. i wanted to ask just in general, how are your customers responding to higher materials prices?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
again, i think that the best example of how they're responding is they're continuing to let out more work than they have in the past. again, just at a macro level, we look at the funding environment is strong and improving and will improve over the long term. and our customers, again, have ambitions to take on more infrastructure projects and more work, and we're seeing our pipeline grow. so i said a macro level, we're just -- we're not seeing a dramatic impact from inflation on our customer base at the moment.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis -- analyst
great. and then i wanted to ask quickly about your construction management business. what are you seeing in your core metros there?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
so we're actually seeing opportunities to grow. the pipeline in our construction management business, which is typically driven around core metros, has actually been growing. and again, sort of the work that we win in that business is lumpy from quarter to quarter. but in terms of what we're pursuing, the opportunities have expanded.
i mean, one of the things that we're doing is we're being quite thoughtful and selective in how we're moving forward. one of the things that happens in a marketplace like we're seeing now where the opportunities are expanding, sometimes, you have the appetite to maybe take on things very aggressively. and we're just really managing what we're pursuing and how we're going to grow that business. but for the time being, we've got $20 billion of backlog and a lot of that has been won over the course of the last two years.
and they are great projects, some of them very significant size in the metro course.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis -- analyst
great. thanks for the time.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
those are all the questions we have for today. so i'll now hand back to our ceo, troy rudd, for any concluding comments.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
great. thank you, operator. again, i want to thank our teams and our professionals for their great contributions that have got us off to a really strong start of the year. we feel like we put ourselves in the best position possible to move forward in the year.
and we're again, increasing our confidence around the results we'll deliver for the year, and frankly, the results we'll deliver in terms of achieving our long-term objectives. again, thank you, everyone, for participating this morning. we look forward to talking to you on the next earnings call. have a good day.

troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you, will, and thank you all for joining us today. we are incredibly pleased with our first quarter performance, and momentum is building across our business and our markets. i would like to begin today's call by thanking our professionals around the world who are working collaboratively to deliver outstanding results for our clients. our success is a result of the passion and dedication that our teams bring to their work and clients every day.
this excellence was highlighted last week when fortune reaffirmed our no. 1 industry ranking on its world's most admired companies list. the elements for uninterrupted multiyear infrastructure and esg investment growth are well established. these include the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law in the u.s.
and the global commitments by our clients to deliver on increasingly well-defined esg objectives. a global infrastructure investor renaissance is beginning. and our strategy, focused on our teams, clients, communities and innovation has us better positioned than ever to win. through our expanded services, including advisory and program management, a greater share of a growing market is now addressable by aecom, and we are working to shape the priorities of our clients and deliver value for our stakeholders.
turning to our first quarter's results. we exceeded our expectations on every key financial metric. nsr increased by 5% with strong growth in both our americas and international segments. importantly, we are winning work at the highest rate in the history of our company.
wins totaled $3.6 billion with a 1.4 book-to-burn ratio in our americas design business, and a 1.2 book-to-burn ratio across our global design business. our strong book-to-burn is worth emphasizing given our four quarters of consistent organic nsr growth. we also had key wins in our construction management business, and our pipeline has never been stronger. the segment adjusted operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 13.7%, reflecting continued investments in organic growth and innovation, the benefits of our highly efficient global delivery capabilities and the high value our teams are delivering for our clients.
our margins lead our peers, but plenty of opportunity for improvement remains. our focus on deploying innovation and digital tools to transform how we deliver for clients against a backdrop of increasing demand for advisory and program management services supports our guidance for this year and our 17% longer-term margin target. adjusted ebitda increased by 10% and adjusted eps increased by 44%. our eps is benefiting from the execution of our focused strategy, strong operational performance and accelerating organic growth as well as from share repurchases.
including $213 million of stock repurchases in the first quarter, we have now repurchased $1.2 billion of stock since september 2020, when we launched our repurchase program, or 14% of our outstanding shares. this capital allocation benefit to shareholders is driven by our strong conversion of earnings to cash flow. in fact, cash flow in the quarter was one of the highest in our company's history for a first quarter. the attributes of our business, including a high returning and low-risk profile and a capital-light business model with a highly variable cost structure, underpin our expectations to consistently deliver strong cash flow and to deliver on our capital allocation priorities.
reflecting this confidence, we initiated a quarterly dividend program in december and our first dividend payment occurred in january. it is our intention to increase our per share dividend by a double-digit percentage annually. this marks a milestone for our company's history and demonstrates our steadfast commitment to use capital allocation tools to maximize total shareholder return. please turn to the next slide for a discussion of the trends across our markets.
beginning in the u.s., our largest market, conditions are strong. our federal, state and local clients are gearing up for several years of sustained increases in infrastructure investment, which includes the expected benefits of the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law. this represents a generational investment in u.s. infrastructure and arrives at an opportune time.
typically, federal support for infrastructure has been inversely correlated to state and local fiscal health. however, our state and local clients, which account for nearly 25% of our nsr, are reporting record revenues and budget surpluses, which is resulting in a very favorable backdrop. in addition, our public and private sector clients are increasingly prioritizing investments to advance esg. today, nearly every project proposal has an element of esg in its scope, and our clients are demanding more holistic thinking and a broader advisory relationship to help them achieve their multi-decade ambitions.
our momentum and the expansion of our addressable market are apparent in our pipeline growth, which is up by double digits. this is noteworthy when you consider how strong wins and backlog growth were this quarter. the pipeline growth we are seeing is especially encouraging, considering the benefits of the bipartisan infrastructure law aren't likely to be material until our fiscal 2023. international markets are experiencing a very similar positive trajectory.
esg is front and center in our clients' agendas and we are seeing strong demand for our advisory services and technical expertise. our pipeline increased by high single-digit percentage and our backlog increased in each of our largest international markets, highlighted by key transportation and infrastructure frameworks in the u.k., expanded program management roles in the middle east and high win rates for key clients in the asia pacific region. looking ahead, the strong foundation we have built and favorable end market trends have positioned us well for sustained multiyear growth. we spent the last two years narrowing our focus on our higher-margin, lower-risk professional services business and implementing our think and act globally strategy.
the strategy is built on our leading technical capabilities, global expertise, and on bringing new ways of solving our clients' biggest and most complex challenges with innovative digital solutions. we continue to advance our digital aecom strategy, and with our success, we are accelerating our investments in this area. over the course of the year as the solutions establish a market position, we will announce their launch similar to planengage, which we announced last quarter. planengage, our digital platform that reinvests the public engagement process for an infrastructure project, is quickly being introduced as the platform for community engagement across our global client base.
as funding from the bipartisan infrastructure act in the u.s. is connected with these projects later in 2023, our planengage tool will become even more valuable. across our business, one theme is constant: our investments will expand our advantage as demand grows and labor constraints challenge the industry. we are consistently winning our largest and highest priority pursuits, with our win rate at all-time high levels.
for example, our leadership team identified 10 global pursuits that we deem to be a top priority for strategic positioning and for delivering on our accelerating growth expectations. i'm very pleased to report that we've already won eight of these 10 projects, and two are still pending decisions. in addition, we've had several other key wins over the past few quarters, including a nine-figure takeaway from a key competitor in an international market, a nine-figure takeaway from a key incumbent on a high-value u.s. federal environment program, and we have been selected for numerous other key pursuits that underpin our confidence.
i can't say enough about how our culture of winning and excellence has expanded and what it means for our future. with that, i'll turn the call over to lara.
lara poloni -- president
thanks, troy. please turn to the next slide. i couldn't be more pleased with what we have accomplished to date and how well positioned we are for the future. against the backdrop of strong client demand and with our foundation for success now in place, we are taking action to fully capitalize on the opportunities ahead.
first, we are fostering a culture that celebrates winning. this includes prioritizing our time and investments on the best growth opportunities and highest value pursuits. as leaders in areas including electrification, transit systems, environmental assessment, remediation, water infrastructure, resilience, climate change and new energy, we are poised to benefit from our exposure to rapidly growing markets. this is giving us the opportunity to also be selective and disciplined about the types of opportunities on which we invest time and capital with a focus on profitable growth and strong returns on capital.
second, we are continuing to invest in program management and advisory capabilities. through these capabilities, we are expanding our addressable market opportunity by adding services that lead to earlier engagement with clients. we have onboarded key talent to support several large wins over the past year, including the neom and alula programs in saudi arabia. looking ahead, as the scope and complexity of infrastructure and esg initiatives expand, high-value program management and advisory will take an even more central role in helping our clients and will distinguish aecom in the market.
third, we are investing in digital aecom to develop and deliver products that extend the capabilities of our teams and transform how we engage with clients. our planengage tool and commercialization of de-fluoro, our proprietary solution for the destruction of pfas compounds, are great examples. in addition, we are advancing the development of key digital solutions in the transportation and facilities market that will offer leading parametric and iterative design tools. finally and most importantly, we are investing in and building teams to deliver in a growing market, which will be increasingly important going forward.
we are focused on ensuring aecom is the best place in our industry to build a career. at this point, i am pleased to report that the results of our recent employee survey reflects our continued high levels of employee engagement. most notably, this included further increases in the percentage of employees that would recommend aecom as a great place to work. there is no higher acknowledgment of our commitment to building a great culture than this measure, and this gives us confidence we will remain at an advantage as the overall labor market tightens.
with that, i will now turn the call over to gaur to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail.
gaur kapoor -- chief financial officer
thanks, lara. please turn to the next slide. we exceeded our expectations on every key financial metric in the first quarter. we delivered another quarter of positive organic nsr growth, a record first quarter margin, double-digit adjusted ebitda and eps growth and one of the highest first quarter free cash flows in our company's history.
tax was a $0.04 benefit to eps compared to our plan due to the timing and quantum of discrete items. we also delivered on our capital allocation commitments, including ongoing investments in our teams and digital aecom, more than $200 million of share repurchases and the initiation of a quarterly dividend program. the dividend is a complement to our share repurchases. we have a strong balance sheet and highly predictable cash flow, which allows for investments in the business as well as consistently returning all available free cash flow to our shareholders.
importantly, we are winning work at a high rate. our pipeline across the business is up double digits, and we have not yet begun to see material benefit from the bipartisan infrastructure law. please turn to the next slide. in the americas, nsr increased by 3%, highlighted by growth in both the design and construction management businesses.
our book-to-burn in the americas design business was 1.4, and total backlog in design business increased by 5%, which continues to include a near-record level of contracted backlog, which provides for strong revenue visibility. in addition, we are benefiting from strengthened conditions in our construction management business and believe backlog will increase over the course of the next year. first quarter adjusted operating margin was 17.7%, a 30-basis-point increase from the prior year. this result reflects both ongoing investments we are making to support growth and ongoing benefits from the actions taken to operate a more streamlined organization that delivers more efficiently.
please turn to the next slide. turning to the international segment. nsr increased by 7%, with growth across all of our largest regions. our wins were strong and backlog increased by 6%.
we continue to gain share in the u.k. public sector, are building our gains in the middle east and have been successful on a number of key pursuits in hong kong and australia. our adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 8.2%, a 110-basis-point improvement from the prior year. we are realizing the benefits of the actions we have taken to eliminate inefficiencies, regain market share and better scale our cost structure, including increasing utilization of our global shared service centers.
please turn to the next slide. turning to cash flow, liquidity and capital allocation. first quarter operating cash flow was $195 million and free cash flow was $163 million. this was better than we expected and is consistent with our focus on delivering more consistent phasing throughout the year.
this improves our return on capital and allowed us to execute substantial repurchases earlier in the year as a result. as troy noted, our capital allocation policy is focused on returning substantially all free cash flow to investors in order to maximize total shareholder return and returns on capital. this included the milestone announcement we made during the first quarter of the initiation of a quarterly dividend program and our intent to grow our per share dividend at a double-digit annual percentage. our first quarterly dividend payment was made on january 21.
the dividend is a testament to the steps we have taken over the past two years to reduce our financial and operational leverage, which has contributed to consistently strong earnings and cash flow. as we look ahead, we continue to expect to convert our earnings to cash flow at a high rate, and we continue to expect free cash flow of between $450 million and $650 million in fiscal 2022. as a reminder, our cash flow is typically weighted more strongly to the second half of the fiscal year, though we expect our first half cash flow to improve from the prior year. please turn to the next slide.
we are increasing our fiscal 2022 adjusted eps guidance to between $3.30 and $3.50, which would reflect 21% growth at the midpoint. this increase reflects operational outperformance we delivered in the first quarter, the benefits of our share repurchases completed in the first quarter and a lower-than-planned tax rate. as a reminder, our adjusted eps guidance only incorporates the benefit of already executed share repurchases, but we expect to continue to buy back stock as part of our capital allocation program. we also continue to expect to deliver adjusted ebitda of between $880 million and $920 million, which would reflect 8% growth at the midpoint of the range.
based on our strong start to the year, we are also reaffirming our expectation for organic nsr growth of 6%, a segment adjusted operating margin of 14.1% and our long-term 2024 financial targets, including adjusted eps of greater than $4.75 and approximately $700 million in free cash flow. we expect our full year tax rate to be 25%, which incorporates the impact of our first quarter tax rate and the expectations for approximately 28% for the rest of the year. longer term, we expect our tax rate to be in the mid-20s. with that, operator, we are ready for questions.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. and the first question comes from a line of michael feniger from bank of america. please michael, your line is now open.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hi. yes. thanks, guys. thanks for taking my call.
just to what you're referring to on the free cash though i'm curious, you reaffirmed your full year 2022 outlook, even you're 2024 target. so it sounds like you have that visibility into growth. you know in q1 you repurchased $200 million worth of shares. i think this quarter is only $80 million.
so just with balancing out the dividend strategy, some of these internal investments and your outlook, is repurchasing still really part of that capital allocation priority list?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, michael. it's troy. thanks for the question. the simple answer to your question is, yes.
but remember what we said at the beginning of the year is that we were going to match our purchases with cash flow during the period, and so we feel like we're a little bit ahead of where we intended on being, because we had stronger cash flow in the beginning of the year. but it is clearly our intent to continue to return capital to shareholders through repurchase and through our quarterly dividend, so nothing has changed.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
fair enough. and when you think about out of 2024 troy, i mean how does your portfolio kind of start to shift by that. i mean do you see, some of your more cyclical areas if you even, if you called that the construction management. will not be slowing down by then and the contributions from areas like environmental and water be a higher portion of your portfolio? could the public customer be a bigger part of the pie there? anything you kind of see around those verticals as we kind of move through the second half of 2022, but really into 2023 and 2024.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
ok. yeah, first let me just start at a high level and we think that our future is actually dominated by some pretty strong macroeconomic trends or cycles, and first we mention that as there is clearly a long term investment in infrastructure that's been made. and so you know it's  and we're exposed to it in all of our businesses, and whether that's construction management or water or environment, but certainly transportation. so we are heavily exposed to what we see is a really good long term trend.
and in addition to that, there are some other long term mega trends. one is just that the investment in esg and for us what that means is, the world is valuing infrastructure and it's doing a little bit differently than it has in the past. and so you have to be prepared to adjust the out quarter or the obligations that we have restructured to focus on some environmental and social objectives. and then the third thing is clearly there is a repositioning of investment infrastructure around the world as a result of what we see in the supply chain.
and so it's those three trends that give us good long term visibility, and again, everything is sort of lining up that way. if you look, again simply in the united sates while we have had the iija, we actually didn't have a budget that authorized funds. now there is a budget in place that's authorizing the funds and it will support a very strong state and local budget. so again, when i look across the business, as a long winded way of saying, i think all of the businesses that we're in today and around the world are enclosed in some really good looking long term trends and we see ourselves positioned to take advantage of it as we continue to progress forward.
there are  i'm going to add one more thing to it. obviously there is a discussion of a possible slowdown or a recession, but again, it's not something we certainly ever hope for, but you always have to be prepared for it, and i think we've shown in our business through the last years that we're agile and we have the ability to react, but also there are some really good inherent attributes in our business and that gets to these large investor megatrends and high quality clients that we have, the significant long term backlog that we have, and it's also important that we have an asset light business. i mean we don't have to continue to invest heavily to fund growth unlike some other industries. michael, it was sort of a long answer to your question.
hopefully it's helpful.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
yeah. that was, troy. i guess just a follow up, just to round out the discussion, you know your construction management part of your portfolio, i think there is a perception that that is viewed as more cyclical than maybe some of the other areas. i'm just curious if you can kind of comment a little bit more specifically about that area, how big of it is it for your operating profit, and you know how cyclical do you see that in the face of this type of slow down.
thanks, team.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
ok. sure. so first of all, the construction management business represents about maybe say 9% to 10% of our overall business. but even today with you know again commodity inflation and wage inflation, we're seeing the business grow its backlog and we are seeing the pipeline continued to expand.
and i think that gets to the fact that the portfolio in that business is diversifying. so we're having great success in aviation, which again there is a long term trend for an investment in aviation infrastructure. we're seeing significant wins and opportunities in convention centers or you know large meeting places. that as a result of coming out of covid, there is a demand for places to be together in large cities and there seems to be a lot of competition to invest in that.
we still think strength in commercial and residential real estate, but to be fair, if you head into a recession, it is one place you would see a slowdown. and then we are having success in sports in that business and those are really the three things that drive the success of that business. but again, at the moment we would think that we might see a slow down because of inflation, but we're not, and that's evidenced in our growing backlog and our growing pipeline.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of sean eastman from keybanc. please, sean, your line is now open.
unknown speaker
hi. this is alex on for sean this morning. thanks for taking our questions.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
of course.
unknown speaker
so first, just taking a look at the impact segment level margin guide, it implies that the year-over-year margin expansion trend kind of flattened out in the second half of the year compared to what we've seen over the past two years. i just want to get your thoughts on why this would make sense, is it seasonality or sub-comp or if there's just general conservatism baked into this given the economic uncertainty this year?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'm going to let gaurav answer, take that question.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
hey, alex. thanks for the question. so one thing i would say is, you're right. our first half margins have been very strong and consistent with the plan.
in fact, if you look at our international business, it's a little bit ahead of plan, and that gives us so much confidence going into the second half where we typically see a little bit of seasonality. where we sit today, we could not be happier where our margins are, and not because we lead our industry in that category. but if you look at what's happened in the first half, comparing to some of our peers, where they have seen margin contraction, our teams, our professionals continue to deliver year-after-year, quarter-after-quarter of margin growth consistent and ahead of expectations, and this was while we're making significant investment in the business. in the various opportunities we have, '22 is one of the biggest investment years we've had it aecom over a long period of time.
so irregardless of what the macroeconomic headwind may be, you know let it be inflation or another variant or geopolitical issues, logistical issues as troy articulated earlier, we continue to deliver on margin targets, and that's why not only are we very confident in our 2022 target of 14.1% plus, but 2024 targets of 15% plus and our long term ambition of 17% that we feel very confident as time passes by, because of how our teams are delivering and leading the industry.
unknown speaker
thanks. that was very helpful. and secondly, does the momentum we've seen in the backlog reflect any tailwinds from the iija yet? and if not, do you have any updated thoughts on when you think incremental funding will start to be visible in the bookings?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. the answer is, we have seen some impact, but it is not material at this point. what we are seeing is a lot of work going on with our clients to position for iija funding, and that really means it's not just working with federal clients, but working with state and local clients as they work through that, so. at a high level what we would expect is, a lot of activity with our client positioning for that funding, followed by a very strong award season in the second half of this year and heading into '23, and then we would expect to see the impact of those awards, impact our business in '23 and beyond and for a long period of time.
unknown speaker
thank you.

thank you and good morning. i just had a question on the comments about absenteeism impact to the quarter troy. could you or gaurav, either one of you, could you just talk about how much of an impact that was and against expectations for accelerating growth through the year, you know this quarter in the first half year of the year. obviously not your seasonally strongest quarter, but not seeing a lot of inflection yet, so maybe gaurav if you could decompose a little bit about that what the differences between the relative growth rates in construction management versus the underlying americas design business would be helpful, and us understanding and assessing the net service revenue growth in the quarter.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
yeah. absolutely, andy. two parts to the question. i'll take your first part as to what would the impact of the omicron variant  and andy, i'd like to start by saying, you know consistent with the question alex had, irregardless of the macroeconomic headwinds that comes through, one thing we're very proud of is our teams are nimble irregardless of what it is to continue to deliver to our target and not using anything as an excuse, and a lot of it is by design, right.
we have an enterprise today that takes advantage of our scale. so if there is labor pressures or varying pressures in a particular region, we're going to use our ecc to drive growth and we're going to utilize our skilled in-program management and advisory services to continue to deliver on the growth expectations. but if you were to just isolate omicron, which again we're not using that as an excuse, we've beaten on every single metric, it had approximately i would say 100 basis points of impact in the current quarter. and second part of your question, you know the real nsr growth quarter-over-quarter, if you look at our design business, our design business delivered 5% compared to 4% last quarter.
our construction management business had a negative growth, it was minus 3%  4% in the quarter, which was expected. if you would recall specifically in the second quarter of last year, there was a lot of pent up demand for covid related work as lot of people were coming back to work. so that came through in the second quarter of last year. going forward we expect construction management business to be positive on back of the significant backlog wins we've had and continued pipeline expansion.
andy wittmann -- robert w. baird and company -- analyst
great. thank you very much.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of sabahat khan from rbc capital markets. please, sabahat, your line is now open.
sabahat khan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks and good morning. just i guess a question on the international segment and particularly the europe side, and on the u.s. the iija is expected to be lift to infrastructure spend over the next few years.
but i guess, how are you thinking about the european green deal or the uk leveling up agenda that you talked about. now is that  over the  through to your 2024 plan, is that expected to be a material, of course there's run rate spend or you know is that just replacing maybe some of the old spend? how are you baking that into your through your outlook?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
so it's troy. look, i assume we'd have  i would describe it as we have that baked into our long term outlook. you know we have seen a significant investment in europe and outside of the united states and infrastructure for a long period of time, and these again, these are just the plans in place like leveling up. that will continue to provide investment in transportation infrastructure, in particular for rail where we're very strong.
so i wouldn't call this out as being something incremental, but we think about this as these are the long term programs that provide us great long term visibility and the opportunity to grow the business.
sabahat khan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. great. and then i guess just within the  i guess the iija outlook and i think you're indicating that probably more that will start to come through in 2023. you know i guess, can you maybe talk about where the discussions are right now? is the  you know we heard some of the money that's not been allocated, but it's been, you know starting to be discussed.
can you talk about how you are talking to investors or your clients about it right now? what stage of planning they are at and you know which areas do you think the first kind of legal spending probably comes through, even if it is in 2023, kind of which end markets are you probably expecting to see the initial benefits?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. so i'm going to answer that in reverse order. first of all, we really see the opportunity across all of our end markets here in the united states or all of our business lines in the u.s. clearly everyone is talking about the money that's coming into transportation.
there's also significant money being invested there we will see in our water business, and then as a result of those projects, they also include the capabilities that are in our b&p business. and then a part of all that, whether it's the terminating part of the process or its money that's in the iija that's going to go to remediation or curing the environment, there's a huge opportunity for that. and i've already made mention of our, you know, our pfas technology. we think that with the funding and some long term regulatory changes that we expect in the u.s.
from the epa, that that also provides a significant long term benefit to the business. so again, it's very broad based for us, our participation in it. but in terms of the client dialogue, there are a lot of clients that have built their long terms plans and ambitions about how they are going to invest in infrastructure and those conversations have been going on for a long time. right now the conversations are working to fill in the funding gap, the expectation and part of that money comes through the federal government and through this budget, and so that dialogue is going on to provide that additional incremental funding, so that those budgets can be rounded out and they begin the projects.
but also, there is a lot of new money that's coming to the market where our  you know again, these are new programs and new processes and so we're spending a lot of time actually having conversations with our customers about how they access that money and that was even one of the important things we did during the quarter, was we actually built a tool to make ourselves a little bit more user friendly and expedite that process with clients, and we talked about our iija too. lara did in our prepared remarks. and so that's an important tool that allows those conversations to pick up momentum, and along with our professionals allows our clients to sort of how they quickly access that money to accelerate their programs, but again as i said, we don't see that having a significant impact on our business until we get to 2023 in terms of generating revenue.
sabahat khan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. if i could just squeeze in one more just quickly on the  just the international segment, you know i guess fx is being talked about as a bit of a headwind. can you maybe talk about how that affected the quarter and then just maybe how you're thinking about it for the rest of the year? obviously you reiterated guidance, but just thinking how you're taking into account the fx headwind maybe?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. i'll let gaurav take that one.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
hey, sabahat. thanks for that question. it is built into our guidance that we have reconfirmed. so any little positives or negatives as i've said before, you know we're not going to make an exception for it.
our focus is to deliver on the results and commitments that we have made, which we're doing for the first half and have full power to do in the second half of the year.
sabahat khan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of andy kaplowitz from citigroup. please andy, your line is now open.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
good morning.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
troy, you mentioned that embedded inflation protection you have in your contracts. maybe if you could give us a little more color around that, and given all the demand that it seems like you're seeing how can or are you adjusting you're pricing of your contracts to adjust for inflation?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. i'm going to answer that in two parts. i guess first of all, in terms of our business, we have mechanisms that are already embedded in our clients, which give us the ability to pass along the costs for them, and that represents a significant portion of our contract. and the second thing is, is that we have  you know we do have fixed price work, and sometimes it has escalations in it, but if they are not significant enough to reflect that, then you sometimes have a short turnover.
so you know as they turn over, we just adjust the pricing, and so the market accepts those adjustments in additional labor costs. but really the proof here is in the pudding. the fact is that it's not affecting our business, because you see our margins continuing to improve, and typically if we couldn't pass inflation costs along to our customers, given that labor is the largest component of the cost in our business, there will be proof that in fact that we're not able to do that. but because our margins are increasing, and at the same time we're investing to grow the business through those margins, we're able to prove in fact that is true.
but the second answer to the question is you know our customers also have the experience of inflation in their costs, and at the moment what we're not seeing is we're not seeing that influence either in government or in our private customer base. their investment decisions and part of it i guess is the fact that even though there has been inflation, the revenue side of the equation for them when they look at the long term, has actually improved beyond the additional cost. now i don't know if that's going to hold true for a long period of time. but today that holds true and that's why we still see our pipeline growing, even in this highly inflationary environment.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
so in regard, can i ask a quick follow-up to that. just in terms of q2, if you look at the americas, the margins were flattish sequentially. did you up your investment costs or is it costing more to hire new people or train new people when you look at the americas business?
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
yeah. no. a good question, andy. if you recall, when we put the plan forth at the beginning of this year, our margins included significant investment in practically every single business of ours and our people, and as you see, you know our utilization is very consistent with our plan, and we're marching along exactly where we thought we were in americas.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
ok. thanks for that, gaurav. and then troy, i know you're sticking with your guidance of 6% nsr growth for the year, but what would hold your growth back from starting to rise significantly toward your contracted backlog growth. you know i think in america you said 24% up.
usually the funding needs to be in place, but it's increased. you know is it because this contracted backlog mostly is for '23 or should you now start to really see the uptake in your nsr revenue?
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
yeah. well, i think we've already seen the uptick in our nsr revenue for the  again, so it's slowly building for the last five quarters. but again we don't everyone  i never want to leave anyone the impression that all of a sudden we're going to be growing at 24% along the lines of the contracted backlog. the fact of the matter is when you grow your backlog significantly like that, it's usually large chunky programs that have a longer life.
so what this means is, we believe we're still going to grow around that same rate, but what we do is, we believe that this gives us much more visibility into the future and certainty to achieve a net outcome and which again, as we look longer term, with the additional funding coming into the market and as a result of the budget authorizations during the iija, we see that as we look forward there should be some more opportunities to grow. but as we said in the past, there is a limiting factor. the limiting factor is capacity for us in our industry and that's why we've been investing in our people, adding that headcount during the quarter. we are investing in our capability centers to create capacity for the future and again, we're also focusing on making digital investments to think, to change the way we can deliver things to create capacity.
so while we're investing deliberately and winning our winnings, we are also deliberately investing to increase the capacity of the business for the future.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
appreciate all the color.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, andy.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of my michael dudas from vertical research. please michael your line is now open.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen and lara.
lara poloni -- president
good morning.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
good morning.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
troy, you guys generated a pretty healthy book-to-bill, book-to-burn ratios of this quarter. maybe you can touch a little bit about like where there's certain areas, certain end markets, international, domestic that impacted that. and how is your program management business aiding that trend and certainly i think you know going forward on a mixed basis with margin, upward margin pressure because of the mix of your business improving on such those good orders have come in.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
so mike, we are  we received success across the business, success across international markets and we are also seeing it here domestically in the u.s., but we are also seeing this as a trend. we have  again, we said 1.6 times this quarter book-to-burn globally. it was about the same internationally as it was in the u.s., a little higher in the u.s., but if you recall last quarter our book-to-burn in our americas business was 1.4 times. and so again, we're seeing this  i would characterize it as a trend and it is across the entire business.
and i think fairly, you're right to ask the question and point out that program management is an important part of that. our program management business in the first half of this year has had very strong double digit growth. we're winning these big projects that we think are important to us, at a very high win rate in what we've defined as being important to win, and we're seeing again backlog growth higher than the average in our program management business as well. so it is a significant contributor to the business across the world.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
and my follow up is, maybe for gaur, i think in your prepared remarks you talked  you've consistently talked about investing in the business and still generation very good margins and margin outlook. did you indicate that maybe, this as you put out this plan though '24 was this the, i want say [inaudible] the strongest year of this year of this type of investment, is it going to be at the similar levels as we look forward or because the markets are changing, opportunities change, that type of investment will continue into '23?
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
yeah, mike. we will always be focused on investing in the business and keeping our eye to the future, and that's because we have a lot of confidence in what we're delivering and the commitments that we have made today for fiscal year '22, including our 2024 plans. and that's where you've heard say before, we're not going to be penny wise and pound foolish. we're not just satisfied with delivery 14.1 end of this year, we're not just satisfied delivery 15% plus by 2024.
our focus is to transform this industry, where we're going to be delivering 17-plus margins in the long terms and we're putting those building blocks together by investing in the business, in the enterprise and most importantly, in our people to do that.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
great. ok. thank you. thanks, gentlemen.

thank you. our next question comes from the line of jamie cook from credit suisse. please, jamie, your line is now open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey. good morning, and nice quarter. i guess just one follow-up question given its way, you know your earnings in the first half of the year would imply we're trending to the high end of the range and you haven't narrowed your guidance. just any color around that, you know, with only two quarters left.
thanks.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
hey, jamie. this is gaurav. i'll take that question. thank you for the comment.
the team continues to deliver in a pretty challenging environment, with all the macroeconomic headwinds we are talking about. one would argue today, you know the environment maybe sometimes more unstable than it ever has been. but irregardless, our teams are putting together a track record of professionals, are putting forth the effort to deliver quarter-after-quarter. so that gives us a lot of confidence given what we've delivered six months to-date.
and i'll remind you, consistent with prior year, we're going to continue to be prudently conservative given the environment we're operating in.
andy kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
thank you.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you, jamie.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of steven fisher from ubs. please steven, your line is now open.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning. i just  you were talking to andy kaplowitz about the growth rate of total nsr for the rest of the year.
curious if you could give a little bit more comment on the design piece of that. you know it was an acceleration in the quarter. it sounds like it may have even accelerated a little bit more as the quarter went on. so i guess i'm curious, with your overall nsr looking to be about steady, i think you said in the second half, but i guess your construction management should be turning from negative to positive.
what does that imply about the design piece? can you just give a little bit more color on the design nsr for the rest of the year?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure, steve. so first of all, for the balance of the year, we still hold the expectation of having nsr growth of 6% for the business. and it's difficult for us to differentiate that, because we really view the whole business as a professional services business. but nevertheless that implies for a design business as we continued to see accelerating growth through the year.
our growth in the second quarter for the design business was a little bit better than the first quarter and that has been a continuing trend for the last five quarters. so that, you know i guess without getting into much detail of what happened intra quarter, there were some things that impacted growth in the quarter, but i look at it as having a successful growth, successfully grown the design business in the quarter, even in the absence of some things, some headwinds that happened during the quarter like omicron.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
ok. fair enough. and then maybe can you just give us an update on some of the progress of your core margin initiatives? you know there's been some real-estate alignments, there has been your centers of excellence and designs and your back office processing. what are some of the digital initiatives? can you talk about what stands out in the first half that you accomplished and what we can expect in the second half please?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. i'll let gaurav take that question.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
sure. specific to the various initiatives that we have underway, as you just mentioned real-estate is a continual process through the year. it's consistent with our expectations, we are executing to it. we expect to complete whatever we have projected in the second half of the year.
now just to put it into context, we had approximately $30 million of restructuring expense related to various initiatives that had double expense, real-estate being one of them. in total we have incurred $7 million year-to-date and it will accelerate into the second half of this year in q3 and q4. this also includes us continuing to take advantage of what we call our scale, scale for our benefit. this is our global capability centers.
so as troy and lara have discussed, the market ramps up, the demand for our services ramp up, we're able to take advantage now of these global capability center irregardless of where the demand may be coming from, to position our labor force, our scale to deliver it. and lastly, also looking at our support functions, we continue to look for the most efficient way to deliver the services to our professionals, through our support functions and that includes taking some repeatable tasks that we can put into our captive centers and deliver them not only efficiently, but more effectively than we have, so all of those things continue to trend very positively. and last is our flexible work arrangements. that, given the challenges that we face is one of the key reasons why you see our growth continuing to accelerate in our design business and we expect that to provide benefit to us going forward as well.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
sure, and thank you.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer

thank you. our next question comes from the line of adam thalhimer from thompson davis. please adam, your line is now open.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis and company -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. first i want to ask about the iija. what's your current thinking on how much incremental funding could come from that?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
well, again, i would think about it in this way. over the next five years, that you can kind of -- again, its uneven because it happens in different places, it comes through, throughout our business. but through our client base, sort of thinking about it as an increase of 10% in the quarter funding year-over-year-over-year for our customer base. that's probably the way to think about it with the rule of thumb.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis and company -- analyst
so kind of a compounding 10%.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, yeah. i mean  again, yes. i mean there are obviously other factors that you know is there, right, like state and local government expanding budgets. but again, our state and local government right now they have surpluses and so you know there's possibly an opportunity for that even to expand.
but it's hard  again hard for me to say, if you out five years that's what's going to happen. what we can tell you is with the iiaj approximately it's  you know i think about 10% in terms of expanding funding for our customers.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis and company -- analyst
great. and then just real quick on aecom capital. what's the high level thought on that as a capital allocation priority going forward?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. again, we still have a business. it certainly had some great people, some great projects and has contributed to our success. but the most important element of that is, we are using third party capital to deploy on those projects, not our own capital.
but it is, it's sort of its  it's part of the fabric of our business, and many times the offering and the discussions that we have with clients.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis and company -- analyst
ok. thanks, guys.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. we currently have no further questions. so we'll hand over it back to troy rudd for any final remarks.

[operator instructions] i would like now to turn the call over to will gabrielski, senior vice president, finance, treasury, and investor relations. please, will, go ahead.
will gabrielski -- senior vice president, finance and investor relations
thank you, operator. i would like to direct your attention to the safe harbor statement on page one of today's presentation. today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about future business and financial expectations. actual results may differ significantly from those projected in today's forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, including the risks described in our periodic reports filed with the sec.
except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. we use certain non-gaap financial measures in our presentation. the appropriate gaap reconciliations are incorporated into our presentation which is posted to our website. references to margins and adjusted operating margins reflect the performance for the americas and international segments.
we will refer to net service revenue or nsr, which is defined as revenue excluding pass-through revenue. nsr and backlog growth rates are presented on a constant current basis unless otherwise noted. today's remarks will focus on the continuing operations of the professional services business, unless otherwise noted. during the quarter we announced our immediate exit from russia, and we incurred a $69 million pre-tax impact, which is excluded from our adjusted earnings results.
the expected cash impact from our exit from russia is approximately $10 million. on today's call troy rudd, our chief executive officer, will begin with a review of our key accomplishments, strategy, and growth updates and our outlook. lara poloni, our president will discuss key operational successes and priorities going forward; and gaur kapoor, our chief financial officer, will review our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. we will conclude with a question-and-answer session.
with that, i will turn the call over to troy. troy? 
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you, will, and thank you all for joining us today. i would like to begin by expressing my deep appreciation to our professions for their focus and commitment to their work and their clients. at aecom we are inspired by shared purposes delivering a better world and prepared for the huge opportunity ahead of us as the world embarks on the long-term transformation of our infrastructure. i'd also like to expand on the decision we made during the quarter to immediately exit our operations in russia.
we are saddened by russia's ongoing invasion of ukraine. this action is inconsistent with our values. as a result we accelerated our immediate exit from this market in february. while seizing operations, our priority was providing our colleagues with support during this transition, which includes an emphasis on safety, security and well-being of our team.
i want to thank our aecom teams and their families in romania and poland for their tireless efforts to aid the families leaving the ukraine as a result of the invasion and all of our professionals for providing support for these humanitarian efforts. turning to our results. we delivered strong results on every key metric in the second quarter. in the design business, nsr increased by 5% despite high levels of omicron related absenteeism in january and february that have since subsided.
importantly, the u.s. government passed its fiscal 2022 omnibus budget in march, which creates optimism around the pace of growth for our government clients in the u.s. in the second half of this year and fiscal 2023. we also delivered a record second quarter margin of 13.8%, which remains at the top of our peer group.
our margins reflect the value we bring to our clients, as well as the positive contribution of our digital, advisory and program management capabilities. against the backdrop of rising inflation, we are consistently delivering strong profitability, which is a direct representation and the inherent attributes of our professional services business model and the embedded inflation protections built into our contracts. importantly, our growth and strong margins are translating to the bottom line. for the quarter, adjusted ebitda increased by 10% and adjusted eps increased by 24%.
across the business our end markets are strengthening and a win rate remains at an all-time high. our book-to-burn ratio was 1.6 and was highlighted by strength across the entire business. contracted backlog, one of the best leading indicators for our future growth increased by 20% and the total backlog increased by 4%. we are realizing the benefits of our think and act globally strategy, which emphasizes collaboration and focuses our time and capital on the highest returning opportunities.
i'm also pleased to report that our free cash flow in the first half of the year was one of the highest in our history. we returned nearly $300 million to shareholders through the first half of the year, which was ahead of our normal cadence, and is an accelerant to value creation. i'm proud of our performance and what our professionals have accomplished over the past two years. today, we are a highly agile professional services firm with market leading franchises and a very well defined and focused strategy.
we're allocating resources to our largest, fastest growing and most profitable geographies and market sectors. and we're expanding the addressable market and enhancing our client value proposition by investing in high value digital, advisory and program management services. we had rising inflation, the lingering impacts of the pandemic, supply chain distributions, war or integrated esg into client investment decisions and planning, the pace of change is accelerating. against this backdrop of rising macro risk and geopolitical uncertainty, the inherent advantages of our business are driving consistently strong performance.
please turn to the next slide for a discussion of the trends across our markets. in the u.s. the outlook for the next several years is strong as it's ever been. state and local clients have record levels of funding and are set additionally to benefit from the iija funds.
our u.s. federal clients are also prioritizing investments in areas where we excel, including environment, sustainability and resilience. as a result, we expect a strong level of federal task activity in the second half of the year and a growth to persist in to 2023 and beyond. in addition, pfas investments are accelerating and our leadership in assessment and destruction are leading to substantial growth opportunities.
in fact, the u.s. powered our groundbreaking pfas destruction technology, defluoro, is now well underway and we're advancing our plans to commercialize this proprietary technology at scale to meet a multi-billion dollar demand opportunities. internationally markets are also strong. in the u.k.
revenue continues to increase and there are several tailwinds for our business, including growing investments in rail and transportation, markets where we lead. in addition, the u.k. government's leveling up strategy, which includes key prosperity and equity focused initiatives that touch on all elements of infrastructure are creating opportunities for aecom. in the middle east, investments trade modern esg focused cities such as neom and aiula are drawing on all of our expertise, and are creating several years and visibility.
in australia, our revenue and backlog increased and the outlook for growth across our market remains strong. at the same time we are managing through ongoing covid related shutdowns in china. there as we always do, we are remaining agile and don't expect these impacts to be material. please turn to the next slide.
across the business we have both the platform that positions our professionals to innovate and deliver on three mega trends that will define the next several decades of investment. these are a global infrastructure investment of renaissance, esg investment and the adaptation of infrastructure to a post-covid world. i'd like to discuss a few examples that bring to life how aecom is capitalizing on these opportunities. first, we're leveraging our strengths as esg leaders to capitalize on growing demand from our clients to decarbonize and advance sustainability initiatives.
most recently we were awarded a contract for a top tier cruise operator through these emissions at the cruise terminals, which alone account for a large portion of the total emissions footprint and are critical to achieving of their emissions reductions plans. we were also awarded a contract for one of the largest mine remediation projects ever in canada. as these wins evidence, the capabilities of our nearly 50,000 industry leading experts are creating competitive advantages in the marketplace and positioning us for strong growth. second, our advisory and program management business continue to create opportunities for high value, long duration contracts for long-standing clients.
this was highlighted by our selection in the quarter for the airside master plan at the dallas fort-worth international airport. we've delivered nearly $1 billion of work for this client over the past decade and are pleased to see our success translate into further growth opportunities. finally, our scale, experience, and global execution capabilities are leading to success on complex mission critical programs. this was apparent on our successful take away win from a competitor of the atlantic region, navy's navfac clean environmental action program.
we brought the capabilities our whole company to bear to distinguish aecom from the incumbent. our comprehensive proposal, which also embedded our industry lead pfas capabilities, was a critical determinant of our success and a great representation of the power of our organization when we think and act globally. in closing, our business and brands are built on nearly 50,000 of the best professionals in our industry. despite the numerous headwinds impacting various parts of the economy, we continue to deliver for clients and a great value for stakeholders.
as a result, i am as confident as ever that our strategy, focus and discipline will allow us to continue to succeed into the future and capitalize on the opportunities ahead. with that, i will turn the call over to lara.
lara poloni -- president
thanks, troy. please turn to the next slide. the strength of our professionals is at the heart of our success. our leading position in numerous key end markets was reaffirmed last month when we were again ranked by enr as the no.
1 transportation and facility design firm and we continue to hold top rankings in several key growth markets, including environment, green design and water. of note, our leadership in the transportation sector positions us at the top of the market fit to benefit the most from increased funding. in fact, some of the most immediate and largest priorities within the iija will leverage our number one position in the transportation sector, be it our leadership in a highly technical and critical discipline like tunneling or our ability to invade esg and digital solutions in transportation design and program management. to this point, we are taking key steps to focus our time and resources on aligning our strategy and competitive positioning to capitalize.
first, we are investing in our esg advisory practice to make searching demand to reduce clients' greenhouse gas emissions and improve social outcomes. infrastructure accounts for up to 50% of all emissions globally and more than 1,500 companies have set their own net zero commitments, creating a large need in the marketplace. by positioning with our clients early in their planning with our advisory services, we are forging key partnerships to help shape our client plans and manage these programs through execution. a great example of this is our work for network rail in the u.k.
we engage through our advisory practice to develop and execute a strategic review, analysis and drafting of a plan to achieve net zero and sustainability objectives. from this initial scope, we expanded our role multiple times over. we've demonstrate the importance of our advisory practice in creating meaningful and lasting relationships with key clients. this is just one example of the growth opportunities in the u.k.
rail sector. second, we are constantly challenging ourselves to push the pace of innovation. for instance, we recently developed and unveiled a proprietary iija specific digital tool as part of our digital aecom offering. this tool was built organically by our experts in response to urgent demand from clients to best position their projects for iija funding.
our teams leveraged our existing clients' band platform and building geospatial machine learning and other ai capabilities to help clients navigate the complexities of the competitive grant process for iija funding. client feedback and demand have been overwhelmingly positive. we also recently rolled out our program management delivery system and toolkit, bringing together digital tools and technical capabilities to create a repeatable aecom way for delivering world class program management services. this is a critical element to our growth ambitions and will provide both a delivery benefit to aecom, while also reinforcing our value proposition for clients.
in addition, we recently entered into a partnership with microsoft to leverage its leading cloud technology and further enhance our planengage offering. planengage is now being promoted by microsoft, creating another channel from which we can deliver our innovation to the marketplace. finally, we are prioritizing recruiting and career development initiatives to best position aecom to win. our headcount increased in the second quarter and we have an incredible platform on which careers can be built, these skills can be learned and innovation can flourish.
to expand our advantage, we are investing in new career and leadership development, to expand avenues of advancement for our professional and we are also focused on increasing the diversity of our workforce. diversity is an asset, especially when addressing complex challenges on a global scale. as a result, we are expanding focused campus recruiting efforts and implemented regional diversity targets to ensure we are building the strongest and most diverse workforce. with all of these initiatives well underway and producing results, we are confident that aecom will lead the way of long term funding growth coming to our industry.
with that, i will now turn the call over to gaurav.
gaurav kapoor -- chief financial officer
thanks lara. please turn to the next slide. our second quarter performance reflects the benefits of our disciplined growth strategy, the commitment of our highly talented professionals and the strengthening trends across our largest and most profitable markets. despite an elevated level of global uncertainty, we have delivered five consecutive quarters of nsr growth, continue to expand profitability and delivered another quarter of double digit adjusted ebitda and eps growth.
while inflation is a headwind to many industries, the inherent attributes of our business model and contractual structures create a natural hedge against rising costs and allows us to maintain strong performance through varied environments. these advantages have resulted in strong cash flow and we returned nearly $300 million to investors in the first half of the year. in total, we have repurchased nearly 15% of our shares outstanding since september 2020 and we are committed to deploying our consistently strong cash flow to accelerate shareholder value creation through ongoing stock repurchases and dividend payments. our backlog and strong wins underpin our confidence in delivering on our financial commitments this year and on our 2024 financial goals.
please turn to the next slide. our performance in the america's was highlighted by 4% nsr growth in the design business and a 1.6 book-to-burn across the segments. contracted backlog increased by 24%, which supports our expectations for accelerating nsr growth. we saw an acceleration of growth in march and with the passage of u.s.
federal budget for 2022, we are confident in our growth expectations. we continue to expect iija funding to accelerate into fiscal 2023 and beyond, which will further benefit our industry leading franchises. with respect to profitability, margins expanded 50 basis points from the prior year to 17.7%, which reflects growth in higher margin areas, including advisory and program management. please turn to the next slide.
we delivered another quarter of strong growth and profitability across the international business. nsr increased by 6%, led by growth in the u.k. and middle east. we also had another incredibly strong quarters win with book-to-burn of 1.5 and double digit backlog growths.
our wins are concentrated in our largest and most profitable markets, reflecting our leadership in growing transportation, water, esg and program management disciplines. margin expanded to 8.3%, up 100 basis points from the prior year. this was the seventh consecutive quarter of sequential margin improvement. we remain committed to achieving a double-digit margin in this business and are pleased with our progress against this goal quarter-after-quarter.
please turn to the next slide. turning to cash flow, liquidity, and capital allocation. we delivered strong cash performance in the first half of the year with operating cash flow of $193 million and free cash flow of $145 million. this compares to a free cash outflow of $11 million in the comparable period last year.
this improved phasing is consistent with our focus on delivering more balanced cash flow throughout the year. our strong cash performance enabled us to accelerate our capital allocation strategy. through april we have repurchased more than 260 million of stock this fiscal year, and we have made two dividend payments under our recently established quarterly dividend program. as a reminder, we remain committed to growing our dividend per share by a double-digit percentage annually going forward.
please turn to the next slide. turning to our financial outlook. we have reaffirmed all of our financial guidance metrics for fiscal 2022 and our long term financial targets. for fiscal 2022 we continue to expect to deliver adjusted ebitda in the range of $880 million to $920 million.
at the midpoint this would reflect 8% growth and are supported by our expectation to deliver approximately 6% organic nsr growth and at least 14.1% segment adjusted operating margin. we also continue to expect adjusted eps for the year of between $3.30 to $3.50 or a 21% growth at the midpoint. per share value creation enabled by accelerating nsr growth, expansion of our industry leading margins, strong free cash flow conversion and disciplined capital allocations remain our top priority. as a reminder, our adjusted eps guidance only incorporates the benefit of already completed share repurchases, though we expect to continue to buy stock as part of our capital allocation program.
we also reconfirmed our free cash flow guidance for the year of between $450 million and $650 million. as we look ahead toward our fiscal 2024 target, our strong progress to-date and strengthening end market support our expectation for an at least 19% adjusted eps cagr from fiscal 2021 to 2024. built on expectations, we're accelerating nsr growth, a segment adjusted operating margin of at least 15% in 2024 and continued return focused capital allocation supporting a greater than 15% roic. with that operator, we are ready for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from sean eastman of keybanc capital markets. please go ahead.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
hi, everyone. thanks for taking my questions, and nice quarter. i wanted to hone in on the win rates, which have been hovering around all-time highs all through this year. i mean, obviously, from a headline perspective, that sounds positive, but i wondered if this elevated win rate is optimal.
i mean, particularly with end market activity levels continuing to accelerate. i wondered if perhaps the returns targets embedded in bids actually need to be raised as we go into next year.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sean, thanks for the question. so there's certainly a balance to be struck in terms of what your expectations are and what you're focusing on. but i mean, no doubt a high win rate is an important thing because it allows us to maintain that balance for investing in the business and invest in the future and also finding that balance of improving our margins. so that's no.
1. no. 2, is we're very deliberate in terms of what we're focused on. it's -- while our win rate is very high, a really important element to that is the quality of the backlog that we're winning.
we are winning projects that are complex, they are long in durations, they're for key clients. they're -- and differentiating ourselves by the level of importance in the communities that we're working in. and ultimately, those wins are momentum changing for the business. and again, not all wins are equal.
and so, when we talk about that high win rate, we believe that's important because it talks to the -- our thinking about disciplined investing, but also again, the quality of the backlog is important because the things that we win change the momentum of the business and they have this flywheel effect that want more people to join, clients are more interested in what you're doing and it attracts larger and better opportunities. so we're focused on two of those elements, and that second element of quality backlog doesn't typically come through in the numbers we discuss, but it's an important element of what we're doing.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
and then i wondered just relative to the tight hiring environment, would you say this is becoming more or less of a concern as it relates to that being a governor on growth over the next 1 to two years versus, say, the start of the year?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, again, i would -- we think of it as a governor on growth, there's no question about that. because while we're doing things to improve the way that we deliver and how we deliver so that we can create, again, more capacity in our people's days to work. there's no doubt that in our industry, there certainly is a constraint on experienced and seasoned professionals to deliver the work that we do. so we think about this in a couple of different ways.
one is we're entirely focused on investing in our people and creating the greatest opportunities for them. and we think about that, the employee value proposition to attract the best to the firm. and then, the other things we've been doing is, again, investing in digital to extend the capacity of what our people do. and then, we're working to invest in capability centers.
so we can become better at distributing the work around the network and become more efficient. and those are the three things we're focused on to try to address that constraint. but certainly, in the short term, it is a constraint. as we go forward, we expect that it will still be a constraint.
but in the world where people are saying we're in a recession or projecting a recession, that those conditions could change.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok and i'll just -- and i'll just sneak one more in. i mean, obviously, there's a lot of tailwinds in the business exiting fiscal '22, but i feel like we probably need to calibrate the model around the moves in fx rates so far this year. so this is maybe one more for gaur, but what are the known kind of bridge items there going into fiscal '23? we have this 300 basis point drag on nsr from fx in the fourth quarter. how does that roll into next year? and are there any margin nuances associated with that that we should be aware of?
gaur kapoor -- chief financial officer
sean, thanks for the question. this is gaur, i will respond to that one. you're right, fx has been a headwind for us in the third quarter, and we expect it to continue in the fourth quarter, put it into perspective for six months fx is a headwind of approximately $15 million. but as we said in our prepared comments, our operational outperformance during the year is allowing us to overcome it.
if it weren't for the fx headwind, we would be at the top end of our range we have provided, committed to. if you look forward and say, these spot rates will hold, there's no doubt it will be an impact to fy '23. but currently, we're going through our planning process. can't really comment on what fy '23 bridge will look like, but in the coming quarter, we will definitely provide more clarity to it.
sean eastman -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
ok, thanks, guys. i'll turn it over. appreciate it.
gaur kapoor -- chief financial officer
sure. thank you for your question.
operator
our next question comes from michael feniger at bank of america. please go ahead. your line is open.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for taking my question. just with -- you guys reaffirming the 2024 eps target, $4.75, i know this just got touched on earlier. but just for the moving pieces for us to think about with next year and to get to 2024, is it smooth and linear for us to kind of get to that 2024 number? obviously, you mentioned fx.
should we have to invest a little bit more, hire more people, invest in the growth that we could see even more in 2024 and get that operating leverage? i guess i'm just trying to think about where we are exiting this year and to that 2024 number, how we should kind of be thinking about the step-up over the next two years there.
gaur kapoor -- chief financial officer
sure. michael, this is gaur, i'll take that question as well. so we just reconfirmed our 2024 long-term targets. no additional comments specific to that.
but consistent with what troy said earlier in his comments, we've really created a platform here that's providing us a competitive edge. and let me explain what i mean by that. not only are we winning better than our share in the market, we're winning what we want in the market. we're operating at the top of our peer group in terms of execution of projects, delivering on margins and making strategic decisions on various other matters.
a great example of that is capitalization of our balance sheet, where we have created certainty on interest costs and a capacity to use. and all these things are driving to that competitive edge that we want. and it's all backed by the investments we're making in the business to allow for sustained value creation.
michael feniger -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
makes sense. and i think i just -- i think this is -- my next question kind of touches on that. and troy, you mentioned it a little bit earlier. we are seeing a very big step-up in m&a across the engineering space.
even last night, another one of your peers made another acquisition announcement. i mean how does aecom view just the pickup in the sector broadly in acquisitions. is aecom missing out. or do you feel you have enough of an investment and breadth to compete? and basically, are there any indirect benefits for aecom as all this m&a is occurring for you just to go and deliver your strategy? anything we should kind of be thinking about as we see all these acquisitions happening around you over the last 12 to 24 months?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, that's a great question. so first of all, we have confidence in the strategy that we've adopted. and i think that we've been showing, again, discipline in what we're doing, and it's coming through in our results. and i'll describe it a couple of different ways.
first of all is that we think that investing in organic growth, and ultimately, that means investing in our people and our markets and our clients and doing things that create a long-term competitive advantage for us are the right things to do. and it's coming through in our results. and when you think about what we're trying to accomplish in the long term is, we're trying to be -- we're trying to again, to get the highest return that we can the capital that we invest. we're trying to do it with the least risk possible.
and we believe that in this environment, invest in organic growth and returning to shareholders is the right way to go about doing that. and again, i'll just make this simple comment, which is i think our job is to create long-term competitive advantage. and when you create long-term competitive advantage, no matter how people are allocating capital, it pays off. and to create that long-term competitive advantage, we believe the right way to be doing this is into investing in our own business.
and we believe that's again, the least risky way to do that. at the end of the day, how it pays off is it pays off in your eps, your cash eps cagr. and when we compare ourselves to our peers that are doing m&a, we see ourselves as having the highest cash per share, eps cagr. and so, ultimately, it gets confusing when you look at companies doing m&a and how they're growing when you compare it to how we're doing it organically, but at the end of the day, we end up having a higher cash eps cagr.
and then, another really important point is you said, does it impact your ability to compete? well, heck, no. we're already no. 1 in the markets that we're in. and even with our competitors doing m&a, we reaffirmed our position.
for example, as the #1 engineering environmental engineering firm, and we increased that gap, surprisingly. so again, in terms of our ability, our need to do m&a to compete, we don't need to, because we're no. 1. thank you for your question.
operator
our next question comes from andrew kaplowitz at citi. please go ahead.
andrew kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
good morning, everyone. can you update us on what's going on in your international business in terms of margin, you've obviously recorded your highest margin segment this quarter. but as on nsr, that was the lowest so far this year. so we know you've been taking restructuring, i think, for real estate consolidation.
is that the biggest reason on a higher margin? if so, where are you in that progression, or is it more mix related?
gaur kapoor -- chief financial officer
yeah, andy. this is gaur, i'll take that question. the restructuring that we took, just to clarify, it's predominantly for our global business center where it's our captive center and we provide support services globally. it impacts all of our businesses.
and there are some duplicate real estate it costs as we renew leases that come through that are also going through it. but it's duplicate costs that are going through. specific to the international margin question that you asked, that has been a focus of ours. we are being very tactical by investing in the business, pm and advisory opportunities, digital and focused execution where, again, probably going back to the last question that was asked, we're not interested in building scale just for the purpose of having scale.
we're interested in driving sustained shareholder value. and this is, again, a continuing result of what you're seeing, our commitment not only to get to double-digit margins in international, but just like we are in the americas, to be the leader of the pack in margins as well.
andrew kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
and gaur, maybe i could ask you about free cash flow. obviously, almost $330 million through q3. i know you've said in the past that you're trying to smooth out cash over the quarters, but given just usual seasonality, wouldn't you be at the high end of the $450 million to $650 million if you deliver a normal q4? and then just maybe a clarification on capital deployment. if this inflation reduction act does pass, do you think there's a 1% excise tax on share repurchases.
does that impact your behavior at all around repurchases?
gaur kapoor -- chief financial officer
sure, i'll take both of those questions on cash flow and on the tax repurchase tax. so first on the cash target, we've delivered on our cash commitments seven years in a row, and this year will be no different. we will deliver on it. our priority is not only on delivering on that annual commitment, but making sure we have the best phasing possible so we can take advantage of our capital allocation strategy as efficiently as possible.
and andy, yes, our cash flow, if you look year-to-date is up 15% year over year because of that phasing. but we have 40,000 to 50,000 projects at any given point in time. it's not 10 or 20 that can really pull through and gives us the confidence that we will be in a certain place. but what we do have confidence, and like i said, we've delivered seven years in a row on our commitments either at or above our commitment, and this year will be no different.
now, specific to the tax repurchase tax. we're always going to be committed in investing in what provides the best shareholder value creation opportunity. and for us, that's looking at roic, it's looking at eps growth to deliver the best tsr. our stock continues to be undervalued, even though we have consistently outperformed our commitments.
and we see no change in that. the plan put forth, no doubt is unfortunate. it impacts individual investors who own aecom shares through investments with institutions. so it's a triple taxation.
and let's see where it goes.
andrew kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
appreciate the color. absolutely perfect.
operator
thank you for your question. our next question comes from steven fisher of ubs. please go ahead.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning. your contracted backlog was up double digits year over year, but it was down sequentially. i think some of that was fx and maybe some of the building construction business.
i guess what's your take on the trajectory of the contracted backlog from here? and i know you've highlighted that as an important leading indicator for the business. so just curious what you're expecting going forward on that.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, steve. thanks for the question. again, i think you actually made the important point for us is that contracted backlog is a leading indicator of the future. and so, again, we look forward and we think that certainly is going to be helpful as we exit the year and head into next year.
but there's a couple of other things that i think are important as well to indicate the future trajectory of the business. and one of those that we haven't spoken about is just pipeline. and we're constantly looking at how our pipeline is doing, giving us an indication of what the longer-term future looks like. and certainly, we're seeing our pipeline.
it's been increasing mid-single digits consistently over the last three quarters. but what's really interesting in that is that when we look at what we referred to as the part of the pipeline that we believe is moving to later stages. we see sort of a significant increase in that pipeline and what's moving to those to later stages that we're going to bid on in the relatively near future, and that has increasing at a faster rate. so when you take that combination together, an increase in pipeline and an increase in the things that we're going to be bidding on in the relatively near future and our contracted backlog, all of those things point to good long-term trends for our business.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. i guess maybe to follow up there, to what extent does that pipeline commentary include the construction -- the building construction business? i guess i'm curious if that has maybe kind of bottomed from here? have you kind of stress tested what that business could mean? i know it's only like 9% to 10% of overall revenues, but do you think it's now kind of maybe stable from here in the backlog, or do you see things in the pipeline that will actually get that to grow again going forward as well over the next handful of quarters?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah, steve, good question. look, when i made in my comments, i was referring to the entire business, but i'll address cm separately. and the fact is, is that the backlog is a little lumpy as it grows. but nevertheless, in the quarter, our book-to-burn was one times, and that backlog has been growing consistently when you take out the lumpiness.
but to your point about what do we see in the future? our pipeline in the construction management business is at an all-time high. and so, it's been increasing as well, consistent with what we see in the design -- the global design business. so that's -- again, that's also good news across our entire portfolio. and just a couple of comments around why we see that at all-time high.
i think it's the nature of our diverse portfolio that we have. that business, if i look at 80% or 85% of the work they do, it falls in the categories of aviation, office and residential buildings, sports venues. and within that, there's actually a large investment to be made in the u.s. and convention centers, which is something that i don't think was being invested in certainly during the pandemic.
and now we're seeing a fairly significant and broad opportunity and investment cities are making in convention centers to attract people to these cities and promote hospitality. so when we look at, again, our construction management business, the pipeline is at an all-time high. so we feel -- again, we feel good about that. the other thing about our construction management business is we have been winning and right now, we sit with, i think, a little more than three years of work in our backlog, almost four years of work.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
ok. nice try. very helpful. yeah.
operator
thank you for your question. our next question comes from sabahat khan at rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
sabahat khan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thanks. good morning. just, i guess, a question on the international segment. i know you've been working as an organization toward improving those margins for some time.
i guess, given where they are today, how much of that is kind of the restructuring and the reorganizing work you've done? and i'm assuming there's some contribution from these bigger projects like neom there. just thinking over the long run, that some of those projects cycle out, is there a further reorganization or just kind of fixing up that business? and how much is this -- how much of the margins do you think are more structural that will kind of stick through over the next two, three, four years?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
and i would think about -- again, our international business, the work that we've been doing over the last few years to strengthen that business has paid off. first of all, that business is very strong. so our international business is very strong, and it's winning large transformative projects at a very high win rate. and i don't see the trajectory of that business changing.
there are great long-term opportunities around the world for that business to be pursuing with our customer base and the business is very healthy. but like, again, all businesses -- our entire business, we're always looking for opportunities to make sure that we continue to drive efficiency and improve the overall business. but that's not going to be massive changes, but we're always looking to make incremental changes. but again, i just -- i look at our international business, and it's an incredibly healthy and strong business for the long term.
sabahat khan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then, just some of your commentary earlier around the pipeline, can you maybe give a little bit of color on how the feedback or the mix of the business you're building across public versus private. is it more tilted toward one side? and have you seen any change in tone at all based on where kind of the macro is headed at all?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
sure. i guess, first, that's an easy question to answer. so we really don't see a significant change in the mix between private and public customers. our government customers represent about 60% of the work that we do, and it's fairly consistent in our backlog.
and then, in terms of the overall mix, think about it this way as, our mix of business is really driven by the longer-term mega trends that we've been talking about. i mean, there just clearly is a significant investment that's coming across the globe in infrastructure. and that's feeding our transportation, our water, our environment business and our buildings in places business. so it's a very -- again, it's a very diverse investment, infrastructure and we're well positioned for that.
so there's nothing unusual in the trends that we're seeing, but those trends are broad, and they benefit of the entire business.
sabahat khan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. thanks so much for the call.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from michael dudas at vertical research. please go ahead.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen. just in your prepared remarks, i think, troy, you mentioned about nsr growth in americas design was i guess, 6% this quarter and you said it's accelerating into 2023. so i assume with similar numbers fourth quarter and can that growth, i guess, given the backdrop that you've positioned, accelerate from that 6%? just early look into 2023.
gaur kapoor -- chief financial officer
michael, this is gaur. i was the one who commented. americas organic growth was 4% in q3, and we did reconfirm that we will approximately have 6% msr growth companywide, consistent with our commitments. and that's at constant currency.
no comments on fy '23, but a couple of things you could take a look at is what troy alluded to earlier. our contracted backlog is up significantly. specifically in the americas, it's up 8% year over year. that provides us a lot of confidence going into q4 and into q3 on accelerating growth before the iija funding hits the ground.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
got it. i understand that. second question, can you remind us what you do for your clients and your exposure to clean energy and certainly all the buzz and noise out of last has been with all of the excess funding that's going forth. how does aecom get in that mix? and is that an area that can support maybe some differentiated growth for you guys over the next several years.
lara poloni -- president
yeah, michael, it's lara here. i'm happy to take that question. we are investing significantly in our technical capability. and a great example of that is a new global leader for offshore wind.
we see significant wind opportunities across all of our operations. and then, there's obviously so much activity in the ev space as well, and that's another great example of where we're applying some of our digital tools in particular. so the combination of continuing to invest in technical capability in some of these rapidly growing areas in conjunction with the application of the digital tools i think gives us a lot of confidence about the growth in that segment of our business.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
is it going to be a better growth than some of the other areas because it's from maybe a different base or just the fact that you're going to be adding some more skill sets and tools to be able to penetrate some market share there?
gaur kapoor -- chief financial officer
michael, this is gaur, so i'll take that. we don't break our growth targets into that level of detail, but we do provide our long-term guidance. no doubt to lara's point, based on the investments we're making, we do expect to receive some significant return on our investments as we move forward based on our pipeline.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
great. thanks. thanks, everyone. thanks, mike.
operator
our next question comes from adam thalhimer at thompson davis. please go ahead.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis and company -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. nice quarter. troy, i think you said something.
it might have been a transportation comment at the pipeline of identified programs is up 40%. is that right?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
i don't think i said the transportation pipeline was up 40%. what i mentioned was is within our pipeline, we have different categories of pipeline. and so, think about it as the initial prospect all the way through to placing the bid. kind of in the middle of that, we have a clear line of sight to projects that are coming to market.
i'm going to use our own terminology, which is, again, it's our own terminology, but we view that as a place where that work is in the capture phase. and so, we know that it's coming to market, and we're going to bid it. and so, our pipeline, when we look at, it's not linear in terms of its growth. we see lumpiness in that phase.
and that piece of our pipeline is up 40% year over year, which means that there's a big lump of stuff that's going to come to market, and we expect that to come to market in '23. and so, again, that bodes well for the long-term health of the business.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis and company -- analyst
how do we think about that in terms of your win rate? that gives a big number, plus 40%.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
i would be very positive. i think you look forward and you think, well with the win rate, the things that we're doing to create long-term momentum in the business and create competitive advantage, that certainly bodes well for the long-term health of our backlog of the business and the business itself.
adam thalhimer -- thompson davis and company -- analyst
so stay tuned. ok. and then, just quickly, the arizona charging award, i was just curious what's your scope on something like that? are you looking at the resiliency of the grid in addition to just the -- just the charging infrastructure?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
yeah. so it's -- again, it's a broader advisory engagement. i'm not going to talk about the specific scope of a client engagement, but it certainly is an advisory engagement to help build the plan for the state to figure out how do they build toward their defined ev goals in the future. when you think about that that really is a really important part of what we do.
we look around the world and we see people define these large long-term ambitions, but as we've seen over the last number of quarters is that, a lot of people have yet defined the solid path to get to the end state. and so, think about this as there's an important goal that the state of arizona has set. and we're working with them to build a long-term plans for them to get there. and so, it's fairly broad in its ultimate approach.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from jamie cook at credit suisse.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning. nice quarter. most of my questions have been asked.
i guess, troy, just your portfolio today, obviously, and your focus is very different relative to the prior aecom. just wondering if we are to go into a recession or in a recession, which parts of the business do you think would be most impacted? and how resilient would aecom's earnings be just given some of the secular growth tailwinds and maybe internal levers you have to structurally improve margins?
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
ok. thanks, jamie. so again, first of all, say that when there is a recession, everybody's impacted by the recession. but i would describe us as not being as impacted as others and for a couple of different reasons.
one is i think even within a recession or recessionary trend that we see a lot of funding that is coming into infrastructure and it's coming in to continue to transform the world in terms of environmental and social improvement. and frankly, there are some longer-term trends post-covid. and so, even if there is a broad recession, we look at this and say, well, with inside that recession, the things that we do are going to receive funding and funding for the long term. so that bodes well for the long-term health of the business even in a recession.
but then i look at as you described, right, there's some attributes to the business that put us in a very good position to work our way through that. one is our backlog. we have long, live backlog in the business. we also have an asset-light business, and a business that can be made all agile to react to shorter-term market volatility.
and then, the other thing that happens is, again, just sort of being where we are in the no. 1 position in our industry is customers typically coalesce around the no. 1 company in terms of a recession. so the recession usually hits the smaller organizations or in organizations that don't sort of sit at the top of a particular industry.
and then, i'll just point out that we certainly have had experience with this in the past. but if you go back to 2008, there was a recession, and it was fairly dramatic. the aecom business at that time was a consulting business, and a design business, and we grew 2009 through 2012. so i think that's threw a proof point to the resiliency of the business for recession.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
thank you.
operator
our next question is a follow-up question from sabahat khan. please go ahead.
sabahat khan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks. there's a little bit of commentary earlier on the call around the labor situation. i guess, how are you planning for that just given some of the potential recession concerns but also with the iija ramping up next year? kind of how are you balancing the two and making sure you have enough people and see it when the demand flows through?
lara poloni -- president
thanks for the question. it's lara. i'm happy to take that one. i think we're pretty optimistic.
just in this last quarter, design headcount increased by over 4% year-on-year. so we have -- it's certainly one of our focus areas at the moment. and not only have we really ramped up in terms of talent acquisition capability. but another key part of our strategy is the enterprise capability centers, where we are building long-term capability and centers of technical expertise.
and a great example of that, we see continuing trend for transit, for example, or the pent-up demand and congestion in all of the world's major cities. we have our #1 position in transit. so we have quite deliberately built up capability centers in madrid and the u.k., for example, to have that capability for the longer term. so it's a combination, obviously, of short-term hiring in local markets, supplemented by our enterprise capability center strategy, which gives us a lot of confidence.
sabahat khan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you.
operator
at this time, there are no further questions. i'd now like to pass over to troy rudd, ceo, for any final remarks.
troy rudd -- chief executive officer
great. well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. and again, i'm just going to finish the call by complimenting the people here at aecom. they've done a fantastic job in finding the right balance between pursuing profitable growth today and for the long term, while continuing to recognize that we can continue to improve by expanding margins, and while doing all of that, continuing to make investments in the business to drive a long-term competitive advantage.
so i thank them all for their dedication to our mission. everybody, have a nice day.

will gabrielski -- senior vice president, finance and investor relations
thank you, operator. i would like to direct your attention to the safe harbor statement on page one of today's presentation. today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about future business and financial expectations. actual results may differ significantly from those projected in today's forward-looking statements to the various risks and uncertainties including the risks described in our periodic reports filed with the sec.
except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. we use certain non-gaap financial measures in our presentation. the appropriate gaap reconciliations are incorporated into our materials, which are posted to our website. any references to segment margins or segment adjusted operating margins will reflect the performance of the americas and international segments.
when discussing revenue and revenue growth, we will refer to net service revenue or nsr, which is defined as revenue excluding pass-through revenue. nsr and backlog growth rates are presented on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted. today's remarks will focus on continuing operations. financial impacts from the previously announced exit of our operations in russia are excluded from today's discussion.

troy rudd -- chief executive officer
thank you, will, and thank you, all, for joining us today. i want to begin by acknowledging the unwavering commitment of our professionals to our clients and to our shared purpose of delivering a better world. we take great pride in what we do. to that point, we are proud to have once again been ranked as the no.
1 company in our industry on fortune's world's most admired company list, and have recently been recognized as one of the world's most ethical companies by ethisphere. i'm also pleased to report that this month's engineering news record affirmed our ranking as the no. 1 environmental engineering services firm. placing us well ahead of our professional services peers.
our teams are the best in the industry. a great example of this is the nomination of shailen bhatt by president biden to lead the federal highway administration. shailen is a great industry talent and reflects the caliber professionals that reside at aecom. the proof point of how the strength of our professionals translates to value creation using our eps growth.
we grew adjusted eps 31% last year and 28% year-to-date through the third quarter. turning to the business, five key themes underpin our confidence. first, we are consistently delivering on our financial and strategic priorities. these include accelerating organic nsr and backlog growth, gaining market share, expanding margins and delivering strong per share earnings and free cash flow growth.
i'm proud of the discipline our leaders have exhibited in balancing organic growth with margin expansion and profit growth while we continue to invest in the business. when you look around the industry, you can see these characteristics make us quite distinct. second, our think and act globally strategy has transformed how we operate and how we deliver by prioritizing collaboration and innovation and emphasizing return on time and on capital. this has translated into a record high win rate, design backlog and pipeline of opportunities.
third, our investments in digital advisory and program management have expanded our addressable market, deepened client engagement and enhanced the value of our technical capabilities. as a result, we are supporting clients more broadly across the life cycle of their investments and enhancing value for both us and our clients. fourth, the markets in which we operate remain strong despite recessionary pressures. a global infrastructure investment renaissance, investments in environment, sustainability and resilience, and adaptation to a post-covid new normal are secular mega trends that will continue to create growth opportunities for several years to come.
finally, our balance sheet is in great shape. this is a competitive advantage that creates certainty and allows us to deploy capital to drive value creation. please turn to the next slide and a review of our financial performance. organic nsr growth accelerated to 6% and was driven by a strong backlog, accelerating funding in our markets and strong execution.
i should note that our growth does not yet reflect any material impact from iija funding, which i will discuss shortly. importantly, we are driving increased profitability as revenue growth accelerates. our adjusted operating margin was 14.6%, an increase of 50 basis points over the prior year. we are investing at a high rate to expand our capabilities and prepare for increased funding.
our margins remain the highest among our peers, which in turn maximizes the value of revenue growth. adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps increased by 7% and 18%, which were both a little ahead of our expectations. free cash flow was also strong at $183 million. on a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow increased by 15%, and on a per share basis increased by more than 20%.
in addition to the investments in organic growth, we've returned more than $400 million to shareholders so far this year. over the past four quarters, we have returned cash equivalent to 6% of our market capitalization. as our results demonstrate, we have created competitive advantages that are differentiating our performance. despite an unexpected market headwind from unprecedented u.s.
dollar appreciation, we have raised the midpoint of our fiscal 2022 adjusted eps guidance for the second time this year, and we have reiterated our fiscal 2024 financial targets. as we have consistently proven, our teams are agile and the inherent attributes of our business model and strategy result in a more predictable and resilient business. please turn to the next slide. now, turning to our backlog, key wins and pipeline.
our backlog in the design business, which accounts for 90% of our nsr and profit, increased by 10% and total backlog is now more than $41 billion, a 5% increase. this performance reflects our high win rate and our focus on pursuing and winning high-quality backlog. our book-to-burn ratio in the quarter was 1.2 times, led by 1.5 in the americas design business. with this performance, there are a few key wins and trends that demonstrate the success of our strategy.
to that point, we were recently selected for a nine-figure program management contract for one of the largest greenfield transportation projects in the united states. our bid emphasize collaboration across the business. in addition, we embedded key digital elements into our proposal, including the program management digital toolkit we announced last quarter to create a differentiated offering for the client. we also had several wins that showcase our sustainability and decarbonization initiatives in the transportation sector.
we were selected by the arizona department of transportation to develop a statewide plan to deploy ev charging stations. in addition, we were selected by new jersey transit to provide design and engineering services to advance the agency's zero-emission strategy. electrification and vehicle automation are key growth markets for aecom, and we are leading with innovation. we have developed proprietary digital tools to accelerate growth.
for example, ev-readi is a tool to help clients integrate electrification of transit systems into existing infrastructure. these tools are in the market today, helping clients advance their strategies, which is furthering our reputation as a partner of choice. i'm also pleased to report that we were selected for a substantial water reuse project in california. persistent droughts have pressured water supply, and this is a signature win that showcase our leadership in the water reuse market ahead of a substantial expected spend in the coming years.
finally, our leadership in the growing pfas remediation market was reflected in a win to design a pfas treatment system for the city of madison, wisconsin. we will be tailoring the design to match iija requirements and best position the project for future iija funding. this project is emblematic of a number of wins and opportunities we are pursuing, with smaller upfront work being awarded as our clients' position for the greater iija funding, now becoming available. please turn to the next slide.
turning to trends across our markets. in the u.s., there has been $114 billion of iija funding announced as available, and notices of funding opportunities are accelerating. consistent with our prior forecast, we expect funding will most meaningfully benefit our markets in fiscal 2023 and beyond. today, clients are beginning to mobilize for this expected growth.
we can see this momentum in our pipeline where identified opportunities have increased by nearly 40%, and we expect bid submissions to accelerate in coming months as a result. the strength in federal spending is coming in an opportune time. our state and local clients, which represent 23% of our nsr, are also in a strong position. budgets are at record levels which creates a backdrop for predictable market growth for us against the broader market volatility.
turning to our international markets, in the u.k., we are benefiting from the key framework positions we have secured over the past several years, supporting strong growth in the quarter and confidence as we look ahead. in the middle east, work is progressing on our large multiyear program management and design contracts for the substantial investments being made in neom and alula. we also grew in australia and hong kong, where demand for large-scale transportation projects remain strong. however, in mainland china, the ongoing uncertainties created by covid policies continue to impact us, though we are managing through this with the performance of other parts of international business.
broadly across the business, we are delivering high-value organic growth in a highly disciplined way despite the ongoing fierce competition for talent in our industry. our disciplined approach is resulting in profitable growth. please turn to the next slide. as our results demonstrate, we are operating from a position of strength with great momentum in both our business and across our markets.
our investments in digital, advisory and program management have created new opportunities, differentiate us from peers and expanded our addressable market. our deliberate capital allocation policy has resulted in strong shareholder value creation. we have not been distracted by risky and expensive m&a. instead, our focus is squarely on executing our profitable growth strategy, as well as returning cash to shareholders through stock repurchases at a discount to peer and m&a valuations and our quarterly dividend program.
underpinning all of this is our strong balance sheet, which is a competitive advantage. taken together, we are well positioned for sustained growth and success, which supports our financial guidance for this year and through 2024. with that, i will turn the call over to lara.
lara poloni -- president
thanks, troy. please turn to the next slide. to echo your comments, our think and act globally strategy has transformed how we operate and go to market in several ways. first, we have created a culture that inspires and demands collaboration, and as a result, we are collaborating like never before.
when we pursue a must-win opportunity that can transform our position in the marketplace, we bring the totality of our global capabilities and experience to bear, which has resulted in a record win rate, market share gains and created a positive client feedback loop that is reinforcing this approach. second, we are investing at high levels in the professional and technical development of our nearly 50,000 people. this includes regular technical academies where our experts share best practices and technical know-how to our teams. the result is even greater alignment on our vision and greater collaboration across disciplines.
we are ensuring our clients get the best of aecom's capabilities every single time. third, we are attracting and retaining the best talent in the industry. we emphasize the superior career opportunities at aecom to meaningfully benefit clients and communities. in addition, we have enhanced our benefits, and we are supporting our employees' desire for increased flexibility through our freedom to grow initiative.
i am pleased to report that our efforts are paying off. in a recent companywide survey, 75% of our employees said they would recommend aecom as a great place to work. fourth, we are building our capabilities to address growing demand for environment, sustainability and resilience priorities. we are winning projects that reflect our multi-disciplined leadership in this area.
a great example of this was our selection to provide environmental master planning services for the greater toronto airport authority. our client is pursuing ambitious sustainability targets, and we are best suited to help them deliver. across all pursuits, our focus on environmental improvements, positive social impacts, energy savings, productivity enhancements, digital solutions and overall efficiency are becoming instrumental in our success. and i am pleased that our leadership position in this area remains very strong.
in fact, last week, our no. 1 position in the environmental engineering and science markets were reaffirmed by engineering news-record, and we improved to the no. 2 environment firm overall, eclipsing all of our professional services peers. finally, our growing suite of digital aecom products and tools have deepened our engagements with our clients.
for instance, our proprietary iija digital tool is helping clients best position for specific funding programs, and is also allowing us to engage with clients earlier and more meaningfully in their programs. importantly, our headcount of digital experts and data scientists is over 2,500 strong and growing. few firms can bring innovative solutions at this scale to their clients globally so quickly which creates enduring competitive advantages. with a strong foundation in place and further progress on our strategic priorities, we are confident that aecom will continue to lead the industry with our expectation of delivering growth over the long term.
with that, i will now turn the call over to gaur.
gaur kapoor -- chief financial officer
thanks, lara. please turn to the next slide. we delivered another strong quarter, demonstrating the strength of our professionals and benefit of our think and act global strategy. organic nsr increased by 6%, year-to-date adjusted ebitda increased by 9%, and year-to-date adjusted eps increased by 28%.
our margins were also strong and continue to lead our industry, reflecting our focus on high returning organic growth opportunities and our culture of continuous improvement. year-to-date, our operating margin has increased by 60 basis points to 14% and we are on track to deliver at least 14.1% margin for the full year, consistent with our guidance. the underlying outperformance of the business gives us confidence to consistently deliver on our commitments. this performance and outlook further supports our expectation for approximately 6% nsr growth in fiscal 2022 across the company.
please turn to the next slide. nsr growth in the americas was 4% with strength across the business. we also had 1.5 book-to-burn ratio in the design business and contracted backlog increased by 19% in the americas. our wins and pipeline were strong.
and when combined with the expected increase on iija funded projects and strong state and local budgets, we continue to expect nsr growth to accelerate into fiscal 2023 and beyond. with respect to profitability adjusted operating margin was 18.5%, which reflects strong execution and the high quality of our backlog. please turn to the next slide. the international segment delivered 8% nsr growth, which included growth in all of our largest geographies.
backlog increased by double digits highlighted by europe, middle east and australia. contracted backlog also increased and is near a record high, which is a great leading indicator of growth. margins expanded to 8.8%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. this was the eighth consecutive quarter of sequential margin improvement, reflecting tremendous progress on our goal of achieving a double-digit margin in this business.
please turn to the next slide. turning to cash flow, liquidity and capital allocation, our capital allocation policy is unchanged. we are investing at a high level in key initiatives to drive growth, expand margins and competitively differentiate ourselves. we are continuing to deploy substantially all available cash flow to share repurchases and dividends.
during the quarter, we bought back 105 million of stock, and through the first three quarters, we have bought back nearly 400 million of stock. in total, we have now bought back approximately 25 million of shares over the past two years or more than 15% of our outstanding shares. including our july payment, we have also paid more than 60 million of dividends this year. as a reminder, it is our intent to grow our per share dividend by a double-digit percentage annually for the foreseeable future.
our ability to deploy capital is supported by strong cash flow and balance sheet certainty. operating cash flow was $205 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $183 million. our business has inherent attributes that lend to consistently strong cash flows through cycles. these include a highly variable cost model, strong backlog visibility, a high-quality and diverse client base and a highly agile culture.
as such, we expect to achieve free cash flow within our guidance range for an eighth consecutive year. we also have a strong balance sheet, which creates certainty for us as debt markets and rates have been more volatile of late. we have a high degree of certainty on cost of 80% of our debt over the next several years, and we have no bond maturities until 2027. we believe our balance sheet is a competitive advantage.
please turn to the next slide. turning to our financial outlook. despite unanticipated external headwinds, we are delivering. as a result, we are increasing our adjusted eps guidance for 2022 for a second time this year, and we now expect to deliver between $3.35 and $3.50, which would reflect 21% growth at the midpoint.
we have also narrowed our adjusted ebitda guidance to between $890 million and $910 million or 8% growth at the midpoint. while we could point to foreign exchange or other factors that are impacting the market, the business is outperforming our initial expectations. i should note that for modeling purposes, our nsr guidance is on a constant currency basis. but you should factor in approximately 300 basis points to your revenue forecast for the fourth quarter to reflect the impact of foreign exchange translation.
the impacts to margin and profitability are already captured in our guidance. we continue to deploy our strong cash flow to buy back our stock, though i will note that our guidance does not incorporate any benefit from incremental share repurchases we expect to execute in the balance of the year. our accomplishments to date and favorable long-term market trends support our confidence in our long-term 2024 financial targets, including our expectations for at least 19% adjusted eps cagr from fiscal 2021 to 2024. with that, operator, we are ready for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of andrew kaplowitz of citi. your line is open.
andrew kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
good morning, guys.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
good morning, andrew.
andrew kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
mike, everything sounds good at cs when you talk about the strong building construction bookings, the better-than-expected civil construction business, and the progress you're making on your power project. but you obviously continue with your strategic review and you decided to exit at-risk international projects. building construction was down in the quarter on a revenue basis, so when we step back, how should we look at the business going forward? is cs just going to be a smaller business? how much at-risk international construction is in the backlog? can you give us your confidence level that building construction revenue grows in fy '19 because i think you said last quarter that it will be flat.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, so i make sure i got all the components of those questions, andy. but first of all, the international at-risk construction is about 0. there might be one small project that we are finishing up, but it's about 0 and will be 0 going forward. the backlog -- you take the overall cs business, exclusive of -- civil is doing well.
power, we've scaled back our market exposure there. in our quest to derisk that business, we have scaled it back but building construction overall continues to grow. we had significant multibillion-dollar wins in the -- in this quarter already, about $2.4 billion of wins in january and february already. we've got about $20 billion of backlog in building construction alone.
so that's about three and a half years of revenue. we've got about another $10 billion of decisions that we're waiting on just in the next 12 months alone. and the importance of that business -- you and some others have asked about the exposure to the real estate markets and are we close to the peak? i think our backlog and growth in that backlog is evidence that a couple of things are happening. one is, we are still the premier provider of tall vertical construction across the u.s.
we continue to win sizable projects in new york city, including $1 billion win in the month of january. we spent a lot of time repositioning that business and diversifying it outside of the new york market. despite the significant wins in new york, we've now grown that business in the west coast markets of los angeles that has been booming for us. we have -- also as we've talked about over the past year and half, we started to reposition our expertise into the aviation markets because we see here in the u.s.
alone about $100 billion of opportunities in the aviation markets. and as you've seen, we've had about $7.5 billion of wins year to date in the aviation business and we continue to look at taking our relationships with some of the top-tier developers that we're developing in the tall vertical market that are now developing in the aviation markets. you're starting to see projects in newark, projects at jfk that are being done by private sector developers, which were clients of ours in the high-rise vertical markets. so all in all, we feel pretty good about that market.
we feel that the building construction business will continue to grow. and when i look at that backlog, that $20 billion of backlog, it tells me that in fy '20, we're going to grow even faster than we will grow in '19.
andrew kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
ok. mike, that's helpful. let me shift gears and talk about dcs for a second. i mean, you progress with this g&a savings plan i think a little faster, being basically done at this point.
i think you said by q2, you'd be 90% done. so when we look at margin going forward, should you experience a decent increase here in q2 from q1? i know you mentioned sequentially -- sequential improvement, but i guess there's a balancing act here between the improvement from the restructuring and maybe a little bit of u.k. underutilization. is there any risk to that 7% guide that you have if the u.k.
continues to be a drag?
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
why don't i let -- troy, you want to take that?
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yes. andy, so as you pointed out, we are ahead of the pace we said we'd be in terms of completing the restructuring, and we will see the impact of that in our design business in the second quarter, so margins will improve. and we still are on track, as we said, to exceed the 7% number for the full year. in terms of the balance, again, as mike pointed out in his prepared comments, that we have actually undertaken restructuring in the u.k.
to position ourselves for the softness in that market. so at this point in time, we don't see that being a risk to the overall margins in the design business. and also, i will remind you that in the u.k., that does present 4% of our overall income, so a decline may have from where we are now would have a modest impact. but, again, i'll reiterate our margins.
we're on track for the 7% -- margins are exceeding that 7%, the target we set out at the beginning of the year.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, and also, andy, you may have seen the announcement last week in the u.k. that we won a $100 million engineering design fee for network rail, which is the biggest win we've had for design work in the u.k. in probably in a couple of years. so -- that happened just last week.
so that portends well for the rest of this year and into '20.
andrew kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
and, troy, just one quick follow-up on cash. do you think you'll catch up to the normal seasonality as you go into q2? or is it just going to become more backend loaded, given the government still seems to be a little bit uncertain as to what it's doing here over the next few weeks?
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yes, so i guess, first, the answer is, yes. i see us clearly catching up. we're reiterating our full year guidance of $600 million to $800 million of free cash flow. and there is no question that we were impacted by the shutdown during the first quarter.
i mean, in fact, it would be difficult to find -- it could have been worse timing for us. we already have seasonality in our cash flow first -- for the first half of the year and second half of the year, and so this impacted that. but we see that-- we see courselves catching that up in q2 and q3. we also -- with growth in the business, we are consuming some cash to fund that particular growth in working capital as well.
and in terms of the timing, we did have a pretty significant impact from one of our projects, just to give you an example. we have the storm recovery work that we are performing in the caribbean in the u.s. virgin islands, and we had at the end of the quarter $185 million of net ar that we had anticipated collecting. and frankly, that money to get collected, it has to go through a lot of hands because it has to be approved by the customer and also because it's u.s.
government-funded, it has to be approved by the agency that's funding that contract. and with the shutdown, those approvals just stopped. so, we are seeing now money being collected last week and this week on that particular contract. so we do expect that being collected over the course of this quarter and into q3.
so i'd say there is -- just in terms of our overall cash flow, we do have confidence around that full-year number. and underlying that there's no real changes in our processes or the reward systems that we have across the company or the nature of the underlying clients, so we see this as timing, not collectibility, and we will expect to recover that over the course of this year.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, andy, listen, if i could just expand on that or reinforce that, i am not worried about cash flow. of course, i would have preferred the u.s. government paid our receivables in the quarter but having receivables of that level outstanding from a very high credit quality client is not a good concern to me, for one. but also, as troy pointed out, when you have 7% organic growth in the dcs business and a 17% growth in -- organic growth in the ms business in the quarter that chews up some working capital that i think is a really good use of working capital to see that kind of outsized growth.
we've had over the past four years aggregate of $2.7 billion of free cash flow over the last four years, so i think our track record on that is pretty strong and that gives us a high level of confidence that we're going to hit our cash flow numbers for fy '19.
andrew kaplowitz -- citi -- analyst
thanks, guys. appreciate it.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of michael dudas of vertical research. your line is open.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
good morning.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
michael, talk about -- maybe you can expand on your comments about the better visibility in the doe and dod pipeline. what kind of change? and is it more -- what type of specialties or types of skill sets that you are bringing to these different and more expanded contracts or different agencies that is allowing you to get better positioned to fulfill some of this work?
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, mike, randy will take that question, if you don't mind.
randy wotring -- chief operating officer
yes, what we've said, michael, is that the pipeline continues to grow. one is because we are better positioned across the marketplace in terms of our footprint with agencies, the projects that we're qualified to perform on, and the experience we have, and as well as the key personnel that we bring to the table. so over the last few years, the pipeline has been heavily weighted toward department of defense opportunities. as we look forward though, we see, as i think described as a shift mix to more -- a higher number of doe opportunities that we are extremely well positioned for.
we are currently a leader in the environmental management marketplace in doe and we look to over the next few years expand our presence into the nuclear security administration type work too, the defense type projects within the department of energy. so again, half of the pipeline increase that you've -- that we've announced moving from $30 billion to $35 billion is in doe projects alone.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
i appreciate that. just second question would be on the -- just thinking about the construction services business, one about -- talk about little bit about you're talking about you're getting out of the at-risk international type projects and refocusing on what kind of maybe domestic ones you're shying away or repositioning. maybe you can explain on some of the projects that you would have done in the past you're not going to do in the future. does that have any impact on some of the design or kind of like combined work that you've been able to generate from those types of projects either design or program or construction management fees? and following that up, how long before we get to see the visibility and the benefits on the margin side in cs as that works through the system?
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
so, a prime example of derisking the portfolio, which we've talked about for quite some time, we are clearly evaluating all strategic options to derisk our construction portfolio, one piece of that is to no longer take on at-risk construction outside the u.s. a second piece of that, a prime example, is last year, our decision not to pursue any more combined cycled gas power plant business. it's also a strategic decision on our part to change the risk profile of the projects we are willing to take on across the portfolio as well as considering strategic options for segments of construction services. at the end of the day what we expect to have is a higher-margin, lower-risk business, much more akin to construction management consulting work.
that's our objective. that's where we're heading. with respect to margins, we fully expect this year to hit our target of 2% margins in the cs space. and when you think about that business going forward, think about a construction management business that has on a net service revenue basis margins that are in excess of 20%.
think about a business that has a negative net working capital, and so you have a very high return on invested capital, a very low- risk business, with very high net service revenue margins. that's the type of business you should be expecting to see as we evaluate our strategic options and execute against that.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
i appreciate the comment. final thought, mike, you want to pick a swing at what might come out of the state of the union tonight and maybe an update on your thoughts on infrastructure build?
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, i've been predicting what's going to come out of the white house for quite some time. and i have a very good track record of being wrong every single time, so with that caveat --
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
you're not alone.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
with that caveat, we have been expecting for quite some time that infrastructure actions would come out of the white house. we clearly have broad bipartisan support for infrastructure. right now both sides of the aisle want to get some thing done. we clearly expect that infrastructure is going to be one of the top 5 points in the state of the union tonight but beyond that, i'd be speculating.
michael dudas -- vertical research partners -- analyst
that's great. thanks for your thoughts. i appreciate it.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of andrew wittmann of baird. your line is open.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
great. thanks and good morning.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
i just wanted to get a technical question out of the way. it's not new that you guys have been having a significant contribution from storm. i think in the past you've given us some brackets around that. troy, can you just help us quantify that in the quarter, just knowing that it's a lumpy business we like to get a handle on what's -- how much it's actually contributing?
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yes. if you think about what we said about our dcs americas business, which was up 12% year over year in the quarter, i guess simply if i think about absent the storm work, we would've had single-digit growth in that business.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
got it. mid-single-digit or i mean, single digits?
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
sorry. yes, yes, yes. i'm going to say low single digits.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
ok.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
but just to be clear, i mean, i don't want to suggest -- i don't want to draw the wrong conclusions from that, had we not been pursuing storm recovery work, we would have been pursuing other opportunities. and so, i don't think we ought to be concluding from that that you take out all the storm work and we'd be growing at 3% or something. it's still -- there's a bunch of resources that would be deployed toward something else.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
sure. ok. that makes sense. and then, i guess, mike, for you, as i understand that the line that's called non-core operating losses in your statement, it contains a number of things.
i think the biggest chunk of that has been some of the oil and gas businesses that you're trying to get out of in canada but i think it also includes this quarter some of the other international businesses and offices that you're looking to exit as well. i guess, my question for you, is just an update on the process around selling or monetizing or even just shutting down any businesses here? and when we can expect to see that line of -- to moderate and get closer to 0 rather than the numbers that have been up the last couple of quarters?
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
troy, you want to want to take that one?
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yes. yes, i'll take that, mike. so, andy, you're exactly right. that relates to the oil and gas business that we described that we were exiting in q2 of last year.
we're still continuing that process. and then we also are closing down the 30 countries and we're about 25% complete. so at this point in time, we have eight countries that we're considering dormant. we're still continuing that process through this quarter, but maybe a way for you to think about this is as we get to q3, that there should be no continuing financial impact as we get through those actions in q3.
andrew wittmann -- baird -- analyst
ok. that's perfect. thank you. i'm going to leave it there.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of tahira afzal of keybanc, your question please.
tahira afzal -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much, mike, and congrats to your team on a good quarter.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
thank you, tahira.
tahira afzal -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
mike, i guess, first question, you had very good execution you said. internally, you outperformed. does that make you a little more comfortable around the midpoint of guidance for the full year? and i guess, what i'm trying to get out is if you haven't adjusted your guidance up, is that partly just because it's too early?
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i -- first of all, it has increased our confidence. when you beat your internal expectations for the quarter and you come out and put $4 billion of wins up in the first five weeks of the quarter here, we feel pretty good. the government is back open for business, so there's no question, it increases our confidence level but it's a little early in the year to start putting up an increase in our guidance. but -- and we also had the aecom capital gain in the quarter.
we expected that in q1. and so the fact that moved to q2 and we still exceeded our expectations for q1 tells you that we significantly outperformed our internal expectations for q1. so, there's no question we have more confidence in our guidance range throughout the year, but not prepared to increase that guidance just yet.
tahira afzal -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
got it. ok, mike. and, mike, if you look back 10 years ago when the whole world was falling apart and really look at this macro downturn, which hopefully will be a little milder, how do you see the visibility in your backlog? when i did an analysis, it suggested longer durability and higher visibility projects in terms of funding sources.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. so, tahira, if i think back to 10 years ago, when we would look at our backlog at that point in time, we would say 75% of the next year's revenue was in backlog. and so, you had maybe a year and a half duration to backlog going back 10 years ago. one of the things that has really changed in our business over the past few years is the duration of the projects that we won.
and so, with backlog in excess of $60 billion now as of today, that's obviously -- that's almost three years of revenue. so, our duration has doubled over the past 10 years. our -- and if i look at our business in some of the areas in the private sector, which generally we hear as a concern sometimes, i look at that business, the $20 billion of backlog, that's three and a half years of visibility with growing demand in the public sector aviation space. so, our backlog is of much longer duration than it was 10 years ago.
it's much more diverse than it was 10 years ago, and gives us a lot more confidence than we would have had at a similar point 10 years ago.
tahira afzal -- keybanc capital markets -- analyst
thanks very much, mike.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jamie cook of credit suisse. your line is open.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning. a couple of questions. first, mike, obviously the organic growth has been very strong within the management services business.
so, can you talk about understanding the [inaudible] a little more difficult. and the remaining nine months, how we should think about organic growth in that segment? my second question, your ebitda guidance for the second quarter, the 23.5% of total year ebitda, just understanding you started the year at $207 million, if you add back the gain from aecom capital and then you assume you get some benefit from the restructuring actions you've taken, which you're ahead of where you wanted to be, why shouldn't that number be greater as a percent of total earnings relative to normal seasonality? and then my last question, troy, i guess is to you. just on the free cash flow side again, understanding the nuances of the quarter, but just given the issues with the government and the working capital requirements you talked about, is it more prudent for us to think about the low end of the range or low to mid-point end of the range versus high end? thanks.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
ok. jamie, let me -- i'll try and orchestrate the different parties to answer that multipart question. so maybe randy will touch on the organic growth in ms and what we might expect for the rest of the year on that and then troy will take on the cash flow and the guidance piece for q2.
randy wotring -- chief operating officer
jamie, what i'd tell you is that i think we have great momentum in our growth activities in the ms organization, both in terms of generating pipeline that we qualify quite a long time out and we have great visibility on our bidding activities over the next three years in that business and in our win rates and capture rates, so both have been outstanding. we have a lot of confidence that the bids that we currently have under evaluation, we feel good about those. and we expect the savannah river site to be awarded any day now or some news about that particular bid. and the best predictor, i think, of our ability to capture business on a go-forward basis and to continue to bring in backlog and organic growth there is performance.
and i'll tell you that, that organization continues to perform well across all of our contracts. we -- last week, we received our latest award fee score on savannah river site and again, we received an excellent rating. i think capturing over 95% of the award fee. so, in my nearly 40 years of experience in this marketplace, the best predictor of capturing growth is performance, and that organization continues to perform well, invest wisely, and capture business.
so i'll leave it at that and pass the ball to troy on...
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yes, so, jamie, your question just on q2 guidance. look, i think when we created the q2 guidance we were trying to find the right balance. so, reflecting the optimism that we have in business based on what we've done in q1, the restructuring that we've undertaken, and what we've seen in terms of wins. but we're also trying to balance that against some of the macro events that we're facing, including the possibility of a shutdown in a few weeks in the u.s.
government business. so, the best way to describe this is, this is consistent with what we've typically seen in our quarters in the past year, being around 23%. and we want to set a plan that we believe we will achieve and we'd like to drive outperformance as we have in q1. and in terms of cash flow, i haven't changed my particular view that we should be guiding to the low end of that range.
that range is still intact for us. we have confidence in achieving a number within that range. as we said in the last four years, on average, we've done $675 million of free cash flow. so, we've got a path based on the expectations of business performance to get into the middle of that range.
and then, there are some things that can go our way, a few lumpy collections around the quarter that can have a -- still in the high end of that range. so there is no real change in our confidence coming in -- coming within that guidance range at this point.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you. i'll get back in queue.
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
thank you.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, jamie.
operator
thank you. the next question comes from steven fisher of ubs. your line is open.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning. i'm just wondering about the organic growth outlook in the dcs segment. you gave us the 3%-or-so ex-storm work.
but as you do lap that storm work in the second half, how easy or hard do you think it will be to continue to show positive organic growth when you lap those comps? i mean, should we put a decline in there and then parse it out between storm, no storm or do you think you can kind of keep it positive overall?
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yes. so, steve, i think we'll keep it positive overall. you're right in pointing out that there are difficult comps as we move through the year. but when you look at our contracted backlog in the design business, it was up 6% in the quarter and in the americas, it was up a higher number.
so there is a very clear relationship between contracted backlog and growth in the next 12 months. and so, we see -- based on our contracted backlog, we see sustained growth over the course of the next nine months or the three quarters of the year.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
and, steven, just to point out, we still have $2 billion of bids that we're pursuing for storm recovery work. we've generated about $1.1 billion of wins to date, but we still have another $2 billion of opportunities that we're chasing. we don't see that abating. we are just -- we just finished this year a project from hurricane katrina, which you'll remember that was 2005, so 14 years ago.
this gives you a sense for the long tail on the storm recovery work. so yes, they are difficult comps, but we now have -- well, how many quarters of backlog growth in dcs americas? will is telling me nine quarters of backlog growth in a row in dcs americas. so, we're continuing to get after the market.
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
and, steve, it's troy, again. just to tack one further point on that is, organic growth is now more valuable than it was in the first quarter because having undertaken the restructuring, we're adding 110 basis points through our dcs margins, which means we're adding 110 basis points to the backlog that we currently have. and that means that, that growth even at mid-single digits has become more valuable.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
and just to follow-up there, do you think your book-to-bill on a contracted basis within the dcs segment is going to start to go over one? because as you point out the backlog on a contracted basis is growing year over year but basically, it was 1 times book-to-bill this quarter. do you think we will see it above 1 times? and if so, kind of what pieces of the business are going to drive that in the next few quarters?
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
so, the simple answer to that question is, yes, we do expect the book-to-bill -- our book-to-bill to be greater than one for the full year and certainly in the next three quarters. and again, we go to our largest markets, where we're continuing to see the largest opportunities, which is, in our americas business, our asia pacific business, we're seeing the largest growth opportunities.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
and, steven, i just hear your point on the contracted backlog, i just -- i can't help myself here, but to reiterate that distinguishing between awarded backlog and contracted backlog is not all that meaningful. it is very, very rare that we have an awarded backlog that doesn't move into contracted backlog. and so, i'd just be careful in trying to do too much analytics on just the contracted portion because it's -- in my mind, a distinction without a difference.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
ok. fair enough. thanks a lot.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of chad dillard of deutsche bank. please go ahead.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everyone.
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
hi.
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, chad.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
so, i just want to go back to your review of your at-risk construction business. just to understand what sort of accretion opportunities there are. can you just help us like, i guess, understand kind of what the margin profile is for that type of business as well as the cash flow conversion rate just so we can get sense for what the go-forward business will look like?
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm not sure i understand the question. are you asking for what is our cash flow conversion and our margins go-forward? let me try, and if i -- i think i know what you're asking. when we go-forward on a -- we expect to have a low margin -- i'm sorry, a low risk, high nsr margin, low working capital business. so, let me try and take that in pieces.
on a gross revenue basis, we expect margins to be north of 2%. on an nsr margin basis, we expect that to be around 20%. we expect to have negative working capital in that business. so, it produces a very high roic.
and so hopefully that helps you understand the business that we're aiming for after we get done with our strategic review. does that answer your question?
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
yes, no. no, that was helpful. and then, just switching over to dcs. can you just give some color if you can, some quantitative color on the bidding pipeline, how that compares year on year? and then what you're seeing in terms of relative strength for region for new work that has not been won yet?
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, i mean, well, i think the 12% organic growth in the americas business tells you a lot about the market conditions. our backlog continues to grow. the opportunities in front of us continue to grow. we are -- as we take our attention away from some of these markets that are far a field as we start to retrench from 30-some-countries, we're getting more of our resources focused on the hot markets of north america and canada.
we now have about 80% of our business in north america right now. that market continues to be hot. we saw in the end of '18 november election cycle, $40 billion of new ballot measures. we see strengthening -- late in the cycle strengthening across the infrastructure markets here in the u.s.
and hopefully, if there is a federal infrastructure build, it starts to gain momentum coming out of the state of the union tonight. that will be even further fuel to the fire here. so, we feel pretty good about that market. and the other thing that we feel really good about is this 100-basis-point improvement in our margins in the dcs americas business with an expectation of another 50 basis points in fy '20, and we're not stopping there.
so, we're seeing organic growth, we're seeing growth in the backlog, we're seeing strengthening markets and more importantly, a 150-basis-point improvement in the margins that we expect to drive from the backlog over the course of the next year and half.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. at this time, i'd like to turn the call over to mike burke for any closing remarks. sir?
mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, operator. so, before we conclude the call today, i just want to emphasize a few points from our first-quarter results. as you heard me say a few times now, we're continuing to deliver positive organic growth. but most importantly, that organic growth is coming in our higher-margins dcs and ms segments.
and as a result, it contributed to a 16% growth in our adjusted ebitda, puts us fully on track for our full-year guidance of between $920 million and $960 million of ebitda. secondly, we are exceptionally well positioned to continue to drive profitable growth. our backlog grew 22% in the quarter to an all-time high. we had another $4 billion of wins in the second quarter to date.
that's just in the past five weeks and we expect more wins on the horizon. but even more importantly, we have taken very quick decisive strategic actions to maximize the value of our recorded backlog. we're well ahead of plan on our g&a reductions that will produce more than 100-basis-point improvement in dcs margins this year and another 50-basis-point next year. we're continuing to derisk our portfolio and the types of projects we're taking on as well as evaluating options to spin off pieces of that business that would further optimize our portfolio going forward.
so, we're increasingly confident in our ability to drive substantial value for aecom and our shareholders going forward. and with that, i'll look forward to our next discussion in may. thank you and have a great day.

mike burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, will. welcome, everyone. joining me today are troy rudd, our chief financial fficer; and randy wotring, our chief operating officer. i will begin with a discussion of aecom's results and discuss the trends across our business.
i will also provide an update on the strategic actions we have taken and continue to take to enhance the value of our record backlog. then troy will review our financial performance and outlook in greater detail before turning the call over for a question-and-answer session. please turn to slide 3. our first-quarter results were ahead of our expectations on nearly all metrics.
as a result, we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2019 financial guidance, including our expectation for continued revenue growth, 12% adjusted ebitda growth, and $600 million to $800 million of free cash flow. organic revenue increased by 5%. this was led by a continued momentum in our highest-margin businesses, including a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the americas design business and 17% growth in the management services segment. both businesses are benefiting from favorable market conditions and near-record levels of backlog.
strong revenue growth and solid execution contributed to 16% adjusted ebitda growth, which was ahead of our expectations. additionally, shortly after the quarter closed, we completed the sale of an aecom capital property, which resulted in an approximately 40% irr and provides a strong start to our second quarter. wins of $11 billion set a new high for the company and have exceeded $6 billion for five consecutive quarters. our book-to-burn ratio was 2.0, resulting in a record backlog of $59.5 billion, which is a testament to our competitive position and our investments in growth.
our successes were highlighted by the contract for the $7 billion terminal one project at jfk airport in new york city. in addition, backlog in the americas design business increased for a ninth consecutive quarter and we also delivered a 1.3 book-to-burn ratio in management services, where our pipeline of qualified pursuits increased by 20% to $35 billion. the second quarter is shaping up to be another stellar wins quarter, including awards for two projects in building construction valued at approximately $1 billion each. as a result, we expect backlog will increase, again, in the second quarter.
the partial shutdown of the u.s. government had varied impacts to aecom in the first quarter. approximately 25% of our total revenue is for the u.s. federal government, primarily in our ms and dcs segments.
nearly 80% of this revenue is for the dod and doe, which are funded through this fiscal year and our work was not interrupted. however, the shutdown's impact was more material to the phasing of our cash flow, which troy will detail. outside of the shutdown impact, cash flow met our expectations, and we expect to achieve our full cash flow guidance. i also want to provide an update on the strategic actions [inaudible] take to maximize the profitability of our record $59.5 billion backlog.
first, we have taken nearly all the required actions to achieve our targeted $225 million of g&a savings. net of estimated leakage and reinvestment, we expect to reduce g&a by $140 million in total, including $85 million expected to be realized in fiscal 2019. these cost reductions are enabled by our investments in it systems, shared services, and other efficiency drivers. with these actions and underlying market strength, we are on a trajectory to significantly enhance our margins.
second, we continue to simplify our operating structure and hone our focus on our fastest-growing markets where our competitive advantages are greatest. we have completed approximately 25% of our planned country exits and continue to target the exit of more than 30 countries, which will ensure management's time and capital are allocated to our best-growth opportunities. in addition, we recently completed the spin-out of the infrastructure investment business, which further narrows aecom capital's focus on the real estate market. finally, in addition to the previously announced decisions to exit the fixed-price combined cycle gas power plant construction market and certain non-core oil and gas businesses, we will no longer pursue at-risk construction projects in international markets and we are continuing to review our at-risk construction exposure.
upon completion of these initiatives, we will have a greater concentration of higher-margin and lower-risk professional services work, which we believe will result in substantial long-term value creation. to take advantage of this value creation opportunity, we have repurchased $210 million of stock under our $1 billion board repurchase authorization. going forward, we intend to synchronize repurchases with our cash flow, which is typically second-half weighted. our conviction remains high that repurchasing stock at current levels is the best and highest use of our industry-leading free cash flow.
please turn to slide 4 for a discussion of our business trends. beginning in the dcs segment in the americas, revenue increased by 12% with strength across nearly all market sectors. performance was led by continued high levels of storm recovery work in the southeastern u.s. and ongoing growth in the transportation market.
to date, we have won more than $1 billion of storm recovery work and we continue to pursue nearly $2 billion pipeline of opportunities. as such, we expect this market to continue to create opportunities for growth, and our scale and agility position us well to capitalize. transportation, our largest market in the americas is benefiting from increased state and local funding, which accounts for more than 70% of public infrastructure investment. total funding has benefited from the more than $40 billion of transportation-specific funding initiatives in 34 states that passed into 2018 election cycle.
these measures, which build on the more than $200 billion of infrastructure-specific [inaudible] measures that passed in 2016 and ongoing fast act investment demonstrate our clients' commitment to developing a diverse set of funding sources to meet demand. turning to our international markets, beginning in the asia pacific region. increased public sector infrastructure investment in australia and stable trends in hong kong contributed to another quarter of revenue growth. in the emea region, uncertainty related to brexit has negatively impacted business confidence and foreign investment into the u.k., and our revenue declined slightly in the first quarter.
even so, the pipeline for major infrastructure projects remain strong and we were recently selected for nearly $100 million contract for network rail to support rail investment. we have already taken actions to align our cost structure with uncertainty ahead of the march 29 separation date and we are well situated to benefit from a recovery in activity .turning to the management services segment. following several years of investments in organic growth, revenue increased by 17% in the first quarter. we had $1.4 billion of wins, including a nearly $500 million defense project in the u.k.
and increased scope on a number of existing programs, including our classified work. as a result, our backlog remains near an all-time high. importantly, the funding outlook is strong for both the dod and doe, our largest clients. as a result, our total pipeline of qualified opportunities has increased by 20% to $35 billion and is dominated by pursuits for these two clients.
this pipeline features a growing set of higher-margin doe opportunities. as a result, we are reiterating our long-term 7% operating margin target. pivoting to construction services. in building construction, we remain on track for a fifth consecutive year of growth, supported by a record nearly $20 billion backlog.
wins in the first quarter included a new $7 billion terminal one at jfk airport, underscoring our successful efforts to diversify the business. while our record wins and 51% backlog growth demonstrate our successes in the market, they do not tell the complete story. we were also selected for additional projects valued at nearly $1 billion in the first quarter, including another large aviation win. the full value of these wins is not reflected in our wins or backlog due to the accounting treatment of agency-basis work.
as i mentioned earlier, after quarter closed, we were awarded two additional projects valued at approximately $1 billion each, which adds to our unprecedented visibility. performance in the civil construction business exceeded our expectations in the quarter. the pipeline of opportunities is robust and as-sold margins continue to improve, creating a favorable backdrop for continued profitable growth. in power, the alliant riverside gas power plant is approximately 85% complete and remains on schedule and on budget.
we reached another major milestone in december with all buildings now substantially enclosed and we expect to complete this project later this year. finishing with aecom capital, i am pleased to report that in the second quarter, we closed on another property sale, which generated approximately 40% irr and $10 million gain on our investment. activities are well under way to support our new third-party real estate investment joint venture with canyon partners. importantly, we remain poised to fully benefit from the expected embedded gains in our existing portfolio while limiting future investments of our balance sheet.
our strong first-quarter results are a testament to the progress we are making to hone our focus on our higher-margin and lower-risk professional service markets. i will now turn the call over to troy, who will discuss the quarter in more detail.
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. please turn to slide 6. our strong first-quarter results, including record wins and backlog, continued revenue growth, and 16% adjusted ebitda growth inspire a great deal of confidence toward achieving our fiscal 2019 guidance and our five-year financial target. as mike detailed, we have made substantial progress on derisking the business and honing our focus, which will allow us to maximize the profitability of our record backlog.
we've already taken nearly all the necessary actions to achieve our $225 million g&a reduction plan. the benefits of these actions are expected to result in higher margins, primarily in our dcs segment, where we expect to achieve a 110-basis-point margin improvement this year and further improvement in 2020 and beyond. importantly, we expect to deliver 12% adjusted ebitda growth this year, driven by continued growth in higher margins. as a demonstration of this confidence, we've been actively repurchasing our stock under our $1 billion board authorization and continue to believe allocating capital to repurchases is the best use of our cash flow.
please turn to slide 7. revenue in the dcs segment increased by 7%, led by 12% growth in the americas, growth in the asia pacific region, and a slight decline in the emea region due to reduced level of activity in the u.k. the adjusted operating margin was 6.2% in the quarter, which is a 150-basis-point improvement over the prior year. this operating margin was consistent with our expectations and we expect to achieve a margin of at least 7% this year with sequential improvements as the year progresses.
please turn to slide 8. revenue in the ms segment increased by 17% in the first quarter, reflecting the full benefit from our large wins and record backlog. the adjusted operating margin was 6.1%, which was consistent with our expectations and reflected solid execution across the business. we continue to expect the adjusted operating margin to approximate 6% this year.
we are committed to our long-term target of 7%, supported by favorable mix shift in our pipeline of pursuits and our continued high win rate. the return profile of this business is highly attractive. we require very little capital grow and as a result we generate a high return on invested capital with very little execution risk. please turn to slide 9.
revenue in the cs segment declined by 2%. power revenue declined as expected due to our decision to derisk the business. we also faced a very tough comparison for the building construction business, where revenue increased by 22% in the year-ago period. however, we are confident that our building construction business backlog and recent wins will result in another year of growth.
the adjusted operating margin was 1.5% in the quarter. reduced activity in the power business contributed to the decline in the margin, but we remain confident in our 2% expectation for the year. please turn to slide 10. operating cash flow was a use of $200 million and free cash flow was a use of $222 million.
while cash flow is typically weak in the first quarter, the partial shutdown of the u.s. government and the cash cost we incurred to execute our margin improvement plan negatively impacted performance. we estimate these two factors resulted in approximately $200 million impact to our cash flow. as mike noted, this is a timing issue.
the cash generative nature of our business remains intact. importantly, we have produced an industry-leading cash flow for a number of years, including $2.7 billion of free cash flow between fiscal 2015 and 2018, or approximately $675 million per year. and we expect to deliver cash flow within our $600 million to $800 million guidance this year. with the stock trading at a price below what we believe is the long-term value, we continue to prioritize repurchases.
we will synchronize our repurchases with cash flow as we move through the year. please turn to slide 11. with strong first-quarter results that exceeded our expectations, a record backlog and momentum in the business, we remain upbeat. as a result, we have reaffirmed our guidance, include our expectation for revenue growth, 12% adjusted ebitda growth at the midpoint of our guidance range and $600 million to $800 million of free cash flow.
for the second quarter, we expect adjusted ebitda to approximate 23% to 24% of the midpoint of our full-year guidance. our guidance balances strong trends in our largest markets with ongoing uncertainty around the potential future u.s. government shutdowns and continued uncertainty in the u.k. market.with that, i will turn the call over for q&a.

alan fleming from citi is on the line with a question.
alan fleming -- citi -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
good morning, alan.
alan fleming -- citi -- analyst
mike, it seems like the aecom strategy, at least in dcs, for a long time was to kind of be everywhere around the world and essentially establish outposts either organically or inorganically regardless of cost and then grow through those outposts. today's announcement almost seems like a reversal of that strategy, so why shouldn't the 140 million of cost savings just be the starting point for dcs profitability improvement and maybe why couldn't it happen faster than the fy20 or '21 timeframe that you're talking about?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, first of all, that strategy is evident in this, that change of strategy is evident in the strategic announcement we made where we will retrench from about 30 countries where we had less than one percent of our revenue, but we had break-even or slightly negative results, but what's more important is that we're taking the energies and management time away from those 30 countries and focusing it on markets that present greater opportunity, so the return on investment, both in the capital we had deployed and the return on investment of the management's time will be much greater by retrenching form those 30 markets. the impact, i think the second part of your question was the impact on the dcs margins, and maybe, troy, do you want to expand on that?
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yeah. again, in the first year, we expect to drive between $80 and 90 million savings, so of the run rate, $140 million savings that we expect to drive. the bulk of that is coming in the first year, and more importantly, that's been driven by actions that were taken in the first half of the year. we expect to be 80% complete with those actions at the end of the first quarter and 90% at the end of q2. really, what we meant was, when we said we have most of that behind it, we really will at the end of the first quarter have the bulk of that behind us and be generating those savings throughout the year and exiting the year at 110 million, and then, in the first have of '20, there are some actions to take there, as well, so we'll be exiting at that run rate, really, halfway through 2020.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, and i think, alan, it's important to point out what that means for the margins where we've had dcs margins at six percent. with this restructuring and streamlined cost structure, we will have seven percent margins in the dcs business, and so, what that means is that the growth that we've had in the dcs business, you heard us mention the double-digit organic growth in the second half of the year in dcs, the $54 billion of backlog overall. what it means is that we will be able to extract more profit from that $54 billion of backlog because of the restructuring and the higher margins that we now expect. i think we should point out that that seven percent margin puts us in the upper quartile of our peers in this sector.
alan fleming -- citi -- analyst
okay, i appreciate that, mike. maybe as a follow-up, i can ask about the organic growth in dcs. is there any way to quantify how much the uk and maybe the middle east were a drag on organic growth in the quarter? maybe talk about the puts and takes as you're thinking about fy19 from a growth perspective. i would assume you're forecasting a continued strength or strong growth in americas offset by a decline in the uk and the middle east, and do you think that this slowdown in the uk is a temporary cooling off or is this -- are you prepared for a more prolonged slowdown in that part of the world.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'll let troy talk about those organic growth trends in those three regions.
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
i'll first cover the past year and then i'll talk about what we see in the future. this past year, again, we had very strong growth in the americas business, in the second half of the year, 17%. there was a significant amount of that growth driven by what i'm gonna call our storm recovery work that we provided for clients. our asia pacific business grew mid-single digits during the year, and then our emea business declined. in particular, in the fourth quarter, our middle east business shrunk year-over-year by about five percent.
moving forward, we see strong growth in our americas business, although, coming off significant growth in this year, i think we're being conservative, and we are viewing this as modest growth in the americas in the coming year, so mid-single digits. when we look at the asia pacific, we see the growth opportunities being consistent with this past year in the asia pacific business, and in the middle east and our europe business, we actually see that business being flat and possibly modest growth, but more importantly, the actions that we took in the course of this year and some of the restructuring we're taking in this next year to exit some of those smaller countries has put us in a position where even if that business doesn't grow, we believe we have healthy operating margins and a healthy operating business.
in summary, i think we're forecasting modest growth across the dcs business in this coming year and most of that growth is coming in our largest, and particularly americas business.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think to add a little color to one part of your question there on, what do we portent for europe and middle east business, we've obviously got the brexit decision coming up in march. i think getting that uncertainty behind us gives us more upside than not, and the other part across the middle east, with the expectation of higher oil prices, there'll be more money for public expenditure across that region. i think our sense is that the outlook in europe, uk, and the middle east looks better in the future than it did for the past 12 months.
alan fleming -- citi -- analyst
i appreciate the perspective. thanks, guys.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
the next question is from jamie cook with credit suisse.
jamie cook -- crã©dit suisse ag -- analyst
hi, good morning. i guess a couple of questions. one, i found the restructuring interesting and understanding that the dcs margins can go considerably higher, but if we just -- dcs has been the one business that, for the most part, has been achieving their targeted margin forecast, whereas, if we look at construction services and management services, you haven't been achieving your targeted margins, so why aren't the restructuring actions focused more toward those two businesses, i guess, relative to dcs?
my second question is, mike, when you think about the construction services business and the low profitability or execution issues you're having, why is that a good business still to be in longer-term. then my third question is for you, troy. understanding there's always seasonality in your cash flow and the cash flow is generally seasonally better in the back half of the year, you did point that out in your prepared comments and in the press release. is there anything, in particular, we should be reading about, thinking about for cash flow in 2019 in the back half? is it more back-end loaded than usual? thank you.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
okay, there's a lot of questions in there. troy, do you wanna take the margin piece?
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yeah. just focusing, first of all, on the cs business, a couple of points there. number one is we are taking some actions in the cs business, in particular around our power business. with respect to this past year, well, we made that decision in the second quarter to exit combined cycle power plant construction. we were delivering some projects in that business. we have the one alliant project, which we're finishing, which is, i'm happy to say, 80% complete, on time, and on schedule, but what that means to that power business is we reposition it, that we're burning off some backlog in that business, and so we're going to see that business come down year-over-year. when we look at the restructuring in that business and we look at cs overall, we expect margins in that business to be consistent with the current year.
the other thing i'll say about our building construction business in terms of margins is that we do talk about it as being a two percent margin business, but it really is a lot more like a construction management business, and if you look at the self-perform work, that business actually has margins that are in the 10% range where we deliver that work with almost no working capital, so it has almost an infinite return on our invested capital in that business. i think it's distinguished that from the rest of our construction services business.
in our dcs business, as you pointed out, the most significant impact we have in that business is driving those margins through improvement, partially through growth, but really through our own action, self-help to get margins that are going to be exceeding seven percent this next year.
in management services, we have been very successful winning a significant amount of work over the course of this last year, and a lot of it's been with the department of defense. that department of defense business has lower margins than we typically see in our doe business, and also because when you work as a prime instead of a member of a joint venture, we also see the margins in that business being economically the same, but in terms of the overall margin, because we have no more revenue coming through our pnl, margins look like they're down.
i'm gonna let randy talk a little bit more about the ms business and the margins, as well, as we move forward.
randall wotring -- chief operating officer
yeah, jamie, and we're very bullish about the ms business going forward. as troy indicated, because of the bidding activity we had over the last couple years, most were on very large dod contracts that were cost-reimbursable, so by their very nature, they were lower in margin than you would see in normal fixed price contracting in the government business. however, looking forward, because of the large nature of the doe, the department of energy contracts, they're lumpier in the bidding activity, we see $30 billion of opportunities over the next three to four years. looking forward, we still see great opportunities to not only grow our backlog but grow in the higher margin doe business.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
jamie, let me just come back to the strategic question you asked about cs, and i think troy covered most of it, but just to underscore that business, there's a wide variety of businesses within our construction services segment. first of all, over the past eight months or so, we have very carefully analyzed that business and have been de-risking that portfolio by extracting ourselves from the fixed price combined cycle epc market in power. that's created a $50 million headwind for fy19, but we believe it was a good de-risking of that portfolio. we have also been de-risking the portfolio by selling off one piece of our oil and gas business and we're currently in the due diligence phase to close another segment of it, and also, to point to the building construction market, when we talk about margins, people like to focus on the two percent margins, but because of the passthrough cost in building construction, it's more appropriate to look at that on a net service revenue basis.
on a net service revenue basis, the margins are 18% in the building construction management business, requiring negative net working capital, so our returns on invested capital are infinite. i think when you look at the growth in that business, we've had $10 billion of wins in the building construction segment in the last four months alone, so when i look at the growth in that business, i look at the infinite return on invested capital, and the 18% net service revenue margins, we like that business.
now, we continue to evaluate our portfolio as we have for the past eight months to identify where we really wanna place our bets going forward and what markets might present asymmetrical risk that we don't like anymore, so we're not prepared to go into a lot more detail on that today, but we have had a lot of feedback from our shareholders on different aspects of construction services that they like and don't like, and we'll continue to evaluate that.
jamie cook -- crã©dit suisse ag -- analyst
okay, thank you, and then just on the cash flow?
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yeah, just from expected cash flow, as we move forward, i don't see anything different in terms of timing cash flow. typically, we've been 20% of our free cash flow in the first half of the year, 80% in the second half of the year. that's not going to change even with the cash restructuring cost that we're incurring in the first half of this year, and i'll make the point at even beyond '18, when i look forward to '19, i actually see the profile of the business is similar with the exception that we won't be incurring similar cash restructuring charges. i actually see some upside in terms of cash flow range in fiscal 20, so beyond '19.
jamie cook -- crã©dit suisse ag -- analyst
okay, thanks. i'll let someone ask a question
operator
our next question comes from andrew wittmann from baird.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird co. -- analyst
oh, great, thanks. let's just keep going with the cash flow a little bit here, guys. where do i wanna start? i guess the can you talk, troy, about the sources of the free cash flow which was obviously very good here in this quarter. was it tables that were extended here, was there any factoring in the quarter, maybe just give us some of the characteristics that maybe drove the cash flow.
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
sure. we actually, during the course of this year converted our cash from -- the cash comes from earnings, so really when you look at the p&l you're going to see that the earnings were converted to cash. if you remember, we do have depreciation, being an excess of capex, we had a tax tail win during the course of the year and then we do have some equity provide to employees. all of that puts us into a position where we're able to convert our earnings to cash and generate free cash flow consistent the way we did this past year.
there was no factoring or the impact in the quarter was zero from factoring and, in terms of our working capital management, we actually had our dsos declined two days quarter over quarter and a lot of the growth that we took on in our design business and particularly our construction business, in those businesses where we don't use working capital. so, you will see that, while ar in those businesses increases with growth, so does ap based on the nature of the underlying work that we perform. so, really nothing unusual year-over-year. we just have converted -- we've converted our earnings to cash as we have in the past.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird co. -- analyst
okay, so then with the guidance, we look at fiscal '19 here, i'm trying to reconcile this when it -- with earnings and cash being tied to each other here, it looks like your net income is implied at $442 million, you're gonna have somewhere in the $65 million of cash restructuring cost, yet, you're still forecasting free cash flow in an excess of $600 million. how do you reconcile the high level of cash with the relatively lower level of earnings in '19?
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
well, again, yeah, think about this. there's a couple of different items in that particular bridge. again, depreciation being greater than capex is planned for the year. we will also have stock-based compensation that we provide to employees, again, this year, which is part of that bridge. then, our nci is consistent year-over-year as it has been in the past and then we still have our cash taxes being lower than our p&l taxes that we're forecasting for the year, and there's a couple of other smaller items that go into that, but all of that gets you into the -- near the midpoint of the range in terms of free cash flow for the year.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird co. -- analyst
okay, helpful on that, and then just mike, i guess as they're looking across the, what i'd say, engineering and government services space, there's been plenty of companies who have deemphasized construction in the last couple of years, scantech most recently, petrotech before that, ch2m was doing it before they got bought out by jacobs, but jacobs is de-risking the portfolio, doing less construction type stuff with the announcement that they've exited that business. you guys still have talked about your dbfo strategy as kind of who you are and who you're going to be. you talk about de-risking the portfolio kind of broadly through the restructuring actions that you're taking here. as you look forward, is dbfo still the right thing to do, recognizing that others have gotten burned doing a lot of that construction or more risky type of work?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, i mean, i think as we've been talking about for a while, we have been very carefully focused on de-risking the portfolio. we've taken a number of actions in the past eight months. we are still deeply analyzing, and in the process of continuing to de-risk the portfolio, and you will not see us play in certain parts of the market where we think there's asymmetrical risk and so i fully understand the decisions that some of our competitors have taken, and i applaud them for that, and we're analyzing the exact same issue. that's about what we're prepared to say today is, it's a continuing process, we've taken a number of actions and there's more to come.
andrew wittmann -- robert w. baird co. -- analyst
okay, i'll leave it there. thank you.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer

our next question comes from steven fisher from ubs.
steven fisher -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
thanks, good morning.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
morning steven.
steven fisher -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
i wanted to -- morning. wonder if you could just help us a little bit more on the segment assumptions for profitability growth, profit growth in 2019. it seems like the majority of the growth could be coming from the dcs segment. i'm just trying to do the math on the margins and make assumptions of revenue growth with ncs and ms. i mean it sounds like there could be a decline in construction services, maybe you could quantify that for us and then, how do we think about the puts and takes? is the profit in management services basically gonna be flat with the growth in revenues, but the decline in the margin?
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yeah, steve, let me just walk through the business. as you pointed out in dcs, we are expecting, as the margins -- as the business grows and the margins move from 5.9 to over 7, we expect significant growth in the operating margin or operating income in that business. in construction services, we do see improved performance from the oil and gas business, our o&m business and we do see our billing construction business being, say flat year-over-year.
i think as we've already mentioned, billing construction has had a phenomenal year, second half of the year and first quarter in terms of winning work in our core market but the way that work is delivered, you typically only see 5% of the operating income coming through in the first year in that business, as you're doing the pre-construction work and you see that coming in later in the project. the work that we've wanted in the second half of this year and the first quarter of this year will have a modest impact on '19, but it really means that it ramps up in '20 and '21. then, the decision we made around the power business, that strategic decision will cause a decline in our power business year-over-year as we reposition it.
all of that leading to the cs business will have a modest decline year-over-year in terms of operating income and management services, we do see that business growing year-over-year in terms of it's operating profit. if you recall, this past year, in the third quarter we had a claim that we picked up in the third quarter for about $15 million. so, while that business looks like it's flat year-over-year, we see it actually improving its profitability by about $15 million. that's sort of the walk through the businesses.
steven fisher -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
yeah, that's helpful troy, thanks. and then just continuing this discussion on some of the strategic action, things you're considering, when i think about aecom and really in the last four years since the urs deal, the business has become very broad and complex, and maybe even difficult to manage. i guess some of the last few questions have really been about de-risking. but, i guess i'm just thinking about simplifying, the potential to simplify the business to make it easier to manage. i just wanna make sure i understood clearly what you're commenting to jamie and andy there about -- it sounds like you're looking to get out of some further businesses in the construction segment is that what you're suggesting, and then once you do that and with these 30 countries that you're exiting, does that get you to a simpler business that you think will be easier to manage going forward?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, that's exactly what we've been in the process of doing through this restructuring. we've been working on this since the spring of this year. we've been working with bain to deeply analyze the entire organization. those 30 countries allow up to hone our focus on the markets where we realize in markets where we have incredible focus and deploy our best resources, we're having the greatest growth.
troy mentioned the significant growth in the second half of the year at dcs americas, but even for the full year we had double-digit growth, 11% growth in dcs americas over the past year and so allowing us to hone our focus, get out of countries where we just don't think the opportunities are going to give us the right returns. taking certain pieces of our business throughout this year, whether it be oil and gas or power or others that we're exploring, again, to refocus on the markets, to present the best opportunities for growth, that present the best opportunities for margin, and that have a lower risk profile is what we've been focusing on and the execution that has taken place so far has helped us down that path.
the strategic restructuring they mentioned today will allow us to further refine that focus and we'll continue to look at opportunities of that sort. all while at the same time our backlog is growing significantly up double digits, again this year in the first month of the fiscal year here in october you've seen another $7 billion of wins come in just the month of october alone. all of this gives us a lot of confidence in both '19 and beyond and i think one of the things that -- when troy touched on the growth and building construction, as you know, in this business a lot of these wins, you don't have a lot of profitability in your first year of the win, because you're in the preconstruction phase, but then growth starts to accelerate after that, and so while we feel pretty good about a 12%growth in ebitda at the midpoint of the range for fy19, we feel even better about what that means for 2020.
steven fisher -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
great, and just a quick clarification. the 6% margin in ms, is that a temporary floor here, because it's not like randy said, they got more doe work picking back up, so is this sort of a temporary 6% and it goes back up or should we just be sort of setting the expectation of 6% going forward, or maybe even lower depending on what the mix is?
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yeah, looking forward, we see a lot of opportunities in the department if energy market, better just from a timing standpoint, 30 billion of opportunities to be bid over the next three to four years and they give us great opportunities for margin expansion. in addition, we see -- always have some performance incentives, and we continue to perform very well in the doe markets. our performance is good, and so there's always an opportunity to overachieve on performance milestones.
steven fisher -- ubs investment bank -- analyst
okay, thank you.

our next question comes from tahira afzal from keybanc.
tahira afzal -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
thanks, hey mike. if you look in the past, i remember when you realigned your business in australia, and obviously, we've been following what happened in oil and gas, things have taken a little longer then you thought, any learning curve that you've incorporated in the timeline that you just presented to us?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, tahira. like i said earlier, currently, speed matters in this effort. we have been under way with this project for several months now, and what's important, i think troy mentioned it earlier, that 80% of the decisions on cost takeouts will happen in q1, with 90% of them being done by the end of q2. clearly -- and when i say 80% done in q1 most of those actions have already taken place in the first month of this fiscal year with respect to cost restructuring. we're moving, i believe at the pace that this requires to ensure that we achieve the 110 million run rate by the end of fy19. but of course, also, 85 million of those savings being in the ebitda for fy19.
tahira afzal -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
got it, ok mike. obviously, we'll find out the details of the countries where you're streamlining your operations as time goes by, but perhaps you can give us sort of a higher overarching viewpoint of the dsos of the remaining operation for looking at, was that one of the factors being taken into consideration. i believe that some countries where a lot of uncs operate where the dsos are stretched out to twice as high and other areas, and really some of the labor laws in the country, they're remaining on because it seems like, by the time you're done, we might be headed into a trickier economic climate.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
these countries that we're talking about, tahira, are less than 1% of our revenue. the dsos are not an enormous factor. the most important factor is a return on the investment that we have in those countries and a return on the investment of management's time. we have resources, of course, are limited as always and making sure that we have those right resources focused on the real growth markets and not being distracted by an additional 30 countries where we don't see the growth prospects in the out years. it's more of a return on management time, as well as some capital deploy, but it's not a big dso number.
tahira afzal -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
got it, ok. in terms of labor laws, are you -- i guess it's not big enough again, to really move the needle as you look forward.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, it's not big enough to move the needle. we factored in the labor laws in the countries that we have identified and it's all baked into the estimates of the restructuring cost and the timing of it.

i just wanted to spend some time on capital allocation. just as you go into 2019, how are you thinking about balancing between buybacks and debt reduction and how are you thinking about your leverage targets when making those decisions? and then, secondly, over to your restructuring and simplification, just trying to understand what milestones as investors, we should be looking at, and then also, forgive me if i'm wrong on this, but if dcs is mainly a cost reimbursable business, how do you plan to retain those savings rather than giving them back, just given that there's a margin on top of your work?
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
all right. chad, it's troy. first, just on the repurchase plan. again, in this past quarter, we did the $150 million asr, and we were able to repurchase a little more than 4.5 million shares. as we move into this next year, we -- consistent with what we said in the past, we expect to be in the market to buy our shares. it's our intention to continue to buy shares and return capital to shareholders as we've said, but, of course, we're going to do that in a way that's consistent with the cash flow phasing of the business. the other point about leverage ratio is, we did finish the year with a net leverage ratio of 2.8 times and had we not done the $150 million asr or been a little more aggressive we would have ended the year at 2.6 times. over the course of this next year, just through earnings growth, we are going to get to that 2.5 times net leverage ratio target, giving us the ability to continue to buy back shares. but again, we'll manage that over the course of the year based on price in cash flow.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
troy, one thing we just ought to point out, just to emphasize what troy said on us being in the market on capital allocation. we expect to be in the market starting tomorrow at certain prices for our stock. we like the price of our stock at this price. we plan to be aggressive in purchasing throughout this year and you'll see the results of that shortly.
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
and chad, with respect to your second question, absolutely, in our dcs business there's a certain component of cost plus work we do for clients, and that is already factored into the numbers that we gave you. the $85 million will fall to the bottom line after we have netted out, effectively, the impact of cost plus work we do for clients and same with $110 million run rate. those are net numbers.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank. -- analyst
okay, great thanks.
randall a. wotring -- chief operating officer
and, with regard to milestones, just understand that a restructuring plan is in place. there's no more planning, it's execution mode at this point and we're well ahead of our execution plans at this point in time.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank. -- analyst
that's helpful and just to follow up on your comment about $30 billion of ms opportunities over the next couple of years, maybe we can zoom in and understand what's coming ahead over the next 12 months and what's the mix between recompete versus new work bid, and any other details you can provide there.
randall a. wotring -- chief operating officer
yeah, most of these opportunities are for doe environmental management programs. there are five opportunities that will be bid in fy20 and one in fy21 and they're all around the environment management program. in all those cases there will be expanded work. there is one recompete, but the others will be new work for us outside of the -- savannah river is still ongoing and then one other recompete. the others will be all new work or expanded.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think it's important to recognize the win rates we've had in that -- i think, as you know, our backlog has grown by 120% since the start of fy17, but importantly our win rate has been around 50% of the bids we've pursued and have had 18 billion of wins over that last two years. the track record on these bids is pretty darn good.
randall a. wotring -- chief operating officer
on the dod bids, it gives us great visibility on revenue moving forward, for a number of years and it's extremely low-risk work. they're all cost reimbursable contracts with good clients and good programs that will help leverage into other bidding activities.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank. -- analyst
thanks, i'll hop back in the queue.
operator
our next question comes from michael dudas with vertical research.
michael stephen dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
good morning. you mentioned in the prepared marks about changes at cs and randy, maybe you put more emphasis there. what are some of the things -- are there any business model changes throughout the organization that's encompassed with this restructuring, with either targeting end markets or maybe reporting wise how you run the business in conjunction with this?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we did replace the leader of our construction services business this year because of a few -- a small handful of execution issues that we had. we have changed the markets in which we are pursuing projects and so we will pursue projects in core markets where we have strength and we'll not be pursuing projects in random markets where we don't have the years of experience and resources on the ground. that's part of our de-risking and i previously mentioned all of the other de-risking work that we had done on combined cycle, epc work, oil and gas work, and other than that there are no other changes in the business model that we're prepared to talk about today.
michael stephen dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
i appreciate that, and mike, when you're thinking about -- you've had tremendous book to bill and great backlog growth across the board, but looking forward given with restructuring and reemphasizing profitability and such and being a little bit more selective, is there ability maybe to pull back a little bit, maybe because of higher biding expenses, or just, you've got a lot on your plate and just trying to be more selective in what's coming through the business because you have such a tremendous backlog, but still working through the levels of generating that profitability through -- to generate from that backlog.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
a couple things. first of all, when we started by looking at the size of the backlog growth, we wanted to ensure that we were going to extract the maximum value from that backlog, which is what got us focused on this project 6 months ago with bain consulting to help ensure that we had the right cost structure to maximize that. that's what drove our margins in dcs for instance, from 6% to 7%. it's not -- we are not in any way scaling back on our business development cost, our selling cost, but we also realized that in certain markets, like the 30 countries that i mentioned earlier, it is much more expensive to pursue a business in markets where you don't have significant scale and your return on business development dollars in core markets where you have strength is much greater. we do not see any of the restructuring efforts impacting the backlog growth, the revenue growth that we've had over the past couple of years.
michael stephen dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
and just my final thought for you mike, it's been admittedly a terrible week in california with all the tragedies with the fire, couple things, any early indication or read on how that could impact business flows and opportunities through california, and then, to follow up with that, with some of the ballot initiatives, do you see any real visibility on some of the ones that past in california that can add to your business win opportunities here in '19 and end of '20?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
we don't see any real impact from the fires in california, on our business of course. we have some employees that were affected including -- troy's evacuated from his house, but his house is somewhat safe. but, other than that, we don't see us having an impact on our business, either to the negative or to the upside in rebuilding, there will be some p&d type work that has to be done, but not a lot of it affects our business, as we see from the disaster recovery in the southeastern us.
to the second part of your question, we actually feel pretty good about everything we've seen recently. voters in california rejected prop 6 which would have repealed the gas tax. that is a $50 billion transportation specific funding over the next decade, having another $50 billion in transportation which is the strongest market in our home state is really good. that's coming on the heels of measure m that we have in the city of los angeles that creates a $120 billion fund. nationwide, on november 6th voters in 31 states showed their support for transportation infrastructure investments and so everything is heading in the right direction to provide more revenue for our clients in this space, and then on top of that we see renewed excitement in washington, after the midterm elections that both sides, right now, again are talking about broad bipartisan support for an infrastructure bill. the supply side is looking pretty good for us.
michael stephen dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
appreciate your thoughts. thanks, michael.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
our next question comes from anna kaminskaya from bank of america.
anna kaminskaya -- bank of america -- analyst
good afternoon guys. maybe let's start with aecom capital a. if you can provide more color in what happened to the project that slipped into the -- i guess the first half of 2019 and remind us of what's kind of remaining in your existing income capital and you also announced the jv with kenyan partners. is it a change to your strategy, how you redeploy capital in aecom capital is just a different way of, i guess reporting the same equity co-investment? if you can just provide broad details on what that means.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, sure. as we mentioned, a third of our miss to guidance in q4 was due to that aecom capital project being moved out. the simple explanation to that is that we have an asset that we built, completed, leased up, had for sale. we expected it to complete, we had a firm offer and out partner had a right to top that offer. they did top the offer, but it also meant that it extended out the closing period past the end of the year. it's still an incredibly valuable asset with a nice gain that we will realize in fy19. with respect to our change in strategy, a couple things there. we had always intended to go out and raise third-party capital and our partnership with our kenyan partners to raise third-party capital is under way. we had our first closing on that fund, so we have now outside capital to invest. that is a -- i don't want to call it a change in strategy because it's been our strategy all along, but it means we will not have to deploy money off of our own balance sheet to support the growth of aecom capital.
what's also important to know is that, now that we have outside capital, we will be receiving fees that will help support that business so that it will not be in a negative operating position and we will only have the upside from potential gains on those projects going forward, both the revenue on the construction side, but any gains through the carried interest in that fund going forward, this has been a process that we had planned all along to build up our expertise, build up the credibility, realize gains and then raise outside money to invest capital in projects that are not coming off our balance sheet.
anna kaminskaya -- bank of america -- analyst
and as you look at your existing book in aecom capital is there a risk to pricing on some of the projects? again, i'm just thinking large exposure to new york, some to multifamily homes, any risk on some of the existing assets that you've already built?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, we feel good about the built-in gains and the assets that we have remaining that are in the process of completion. we have had an incredible track record of higher double-digit returns on every one of the assets that we've developed so far, and nothing has changed on any of those, so we feel like we have a good number of built-in gains assets that will be realized into the future.
anna kaminskaya -- bank of america -- analyst
great, and then my final question on the dcs backlog, i think if i look at just book backlogs for the business, the new work has been trending down, and by my calculation, book-to-bill is sub one time. any more color on how i reconcile your positive comments on your end market growth relative to backlog that's been sequentially trending down?
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yeah. anna, it's troy. our book to bill across dcs was 1.1 or 1.1 times this past year and more importantly, in our americas business, it was 1.3 times. we're actually seeing the book-to-bill be better than one and we're actually seeing it in our highest growth opportunities are in our americas business where we would, of course, have the highest margins, especially post-restructuring.
anna kaminskaya -- bank of america -- analyst
and is that both selected in the books or just selected backlog? i'm just looking at backlog last quarter was 9.3 and this quarter it's 9.1, so are we talking -- making sure we...
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yeah, so you're looking at our contract at the backlog. again, during the course of a quarter, there are changes between awards, and that's the timing of putting some of the contracts in place.
anna kaminskaya -- bank of america -- analyst
great, thank you very much.
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
the other thing i will point out too is that there has been an fx impact year-over-year on our non-us or non-americas backlog.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
but anna, it's important to point out that to see backlog growing while you had double-digit organic growth during the year is pretty incredible i just don't want to lose sight of the fact that we got 11% growth on the revenue line in americas and we still grew the backlog in total.
anna kaminskaya -- bank of america -- analyst
yeah. all right, i appreciate the comments. thank you.
operator
we have no further questions at this time. i will now turn the call back over to mike burke for closing comments.
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, operator. before we conclude the call today, i want to just underscore a few points. first of all, we exited fiscal 2018 with a great foundation for growth. we delivered record revenue, wins and backlog and also generated the highest ever quarterly free cash flow, and second we're taking rea proactive steps here to maximize our profitability for the enterprise, our g&a reductions and our plans to hone our focus in the highest growth markets put us on a path for substantial margin enhancement.
as you can see from our guidance for fy19, we're guiding to an ebitda growth of 12% growth at the midterm, and then finally through our long-term earnings growth and our industry-leading track record of generating cash we'll continue to create substantial value for our shareholders through prudent capital allocation that i mentioned earlier. in fiscal 2018 we reduced our debt, we executed on the $150 million accelerated chair repurchase and with our stock price remaining at attractive levels as i said, you can expect us to remain in the market buying our stock. i look forward to seeing you at our annual investor day in december and thank you for spending the last hour with us.

beginning today's presentation is mike burke, aecom's chairman and chief executive officer. mike?
michael s. burke -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, will. welcome, everyone. joining me today are troy rudd, our chief financial officer, and randy wotring, our chief operating officer. i will begin with an overview of aecom's results and discuss the trends across our business. then, troy will review our financial performance and outlook in greater detail before turning the call over for a question and answer session. please turn to slide 3.
we delivered record revenue, wins, and backlog in fiscal 2018, which positioned us well for continued growth in 2019 and beyond. organic growth accelerated in the second half of the year led by 17% and 12% growth respectively in our higher margin americas design and ms businesses. as a result, we set a new high for annual revenue at over $20 billion and we expect to deliver another year of growth in 2019.
full-year wins of more than $28 billion represent a 23% increase over the prior year resulting in a record $54 billion backlog. fourth quarter wins increased by 25% to $6.1 billion. our momentum continued into the first quarter with more than $7 billion of large cs and ms project wins in october. we also delivered a quarterly record $511 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, which contributed to a fourth straight year of greater than $600 million of free cash flow.
as a result, we continued to pay down debt and we executed $150 million accelerated chair repurchase under our $1 billion authorization, which reduced our shares outstanding by approximately three percent. however, ebitda was below our expectations due to three factors including execution challenges on a handful of projects in the cs segment, a timing-related shortfall in aecom capital, and volume-related underperformance in the uk.
these items masked the underlying strength of our performance across most other areas of the business. specifically, the americas design business exceeded our growth and profit expectations for the year and the ms segment delivered another solid performance.
importantly, to maximize the profitability of our record $54 billion backlog, we are executing three strategic actions. first, following a review of our cost structure, we are implementing a plan to reduce our annual g&a by $225 million with most of the actions taking place in the first half of the fiscal year. the g&a savings will primarily benefit the dcs segment where we expect the adjusted operating margin to exceed seven percent in fiscal 2019 with further improvements in 2020 and beyond. importantly, all of our segments will benefit from a more efficient cost structure as we compete for work and deliver our backlog.
second, we have changed the leadership in our cs segment. though the vast majority of our projects have met or exceeded our expectations, and more broadly, our execution track record remains stellar, the issues that impacted fiscal 2018 were avoidable and unacceptable. in addition to the leadership change, we have conducted a thorough portfolio review and identified the root causes of the challenges we encountered to ensure we execute with greater certainty in the future.
finally, we are currently evaluating a plan to exit more than 30 countries. this is part of an ongoing review of our geographic exposure with a focus on prioritizing our investments and attention toward our largest and highest growth markets where our competitive advantages are greatest. all of these actions hone our focus on our most profitable end markets, reduce our risk profile, and enhance the consistency of our financial performance, including our industry-leading cash flow. please turn to slide 4 for a discussion of our business trends.
beginning in the dcs segment, we had significant accomplishments in our design business in 2018. we delivered our highest growth rate in several years in the americas, our largest geography, including 17% growth in both the third and fourth quarters. our leadership position in transportation and water markets resulted in double-digit growth in these markets. strong economic growth, funding from the more than $200 billion of ballot measures that passed in 2016, and the visibility created by the fast act contributed to this growth.
in addition, last week, voters in california, our largest state by revenue, reaffirmed their overwhelming support for infrastructure by voting to maintain a $0.12 gas tax, which will provide over $50 billion of transportation-specific funding over the next decade. voters in 30 other states also demonstrated support with over $30 billion of transportation infrastructure investments approved and hopes for a federal infrastructure bill in dc were buoyed by the leadership of both parties in expressing the need for a comprehensive infrastructure bill. as a result, we expect very favorable market conditions to persist over the next several years.
during the year, we also mobilized quickly to provide critical services to aid in the storm recovery efforts in the us virgin islands, puerto rico, and texas. our success in the storm recovery effort reflects the advantages of our scale and the agility of our leadership team to quickly capitalize on emerging opportunities. we are making further investments in our capabilities to ensure we remain a leader in this effort.
in international markets, trends remain mixed. in the asia pacific region, we delivered seven percent growth for the year, which was led by a continued strength in the australian transportation market. in the fourth quarter, we won a substantial contract as part of melbourne's metro tunnel project, which adds to our visibility. the greater china market also remains robust. in hong kong, infrastructure demand is strong and funding from ongoing budget surpluses support our positive long-term outlook. we are also benefiting from the breadth and depth of the capabilities we have developed in hong kong, which is driving strong growth in mainland china.
turning to the emea region, volumes in our largest market, the uk, were below our expectations. uncertainty around the mid and long-range impacts of brexit continue to impact the market ahead of the key march 29th separation date from the european union. we have taken decisive actions to prepare for this slowdown. as a result, we have a better cost structure today and we have maintained the key capabilities to respond as market conditions improve.
turning to the management services segment, we delivered 14% growth in the fourth quarter, which contributed to double-digit growth for the full year. this performance is a testament to our leading position across our key dod and doe markets and reflects a high return on our growth investments and continued high win rates. as a result, ms backlog has increased by nearly 120% since the start of fiscal 2017 and we exited the year at a near record level. this growth has included a substantial expansion of our classified work. today, more than 50% of our ms backlog is classified programs. we have a large base of employees with security clearance, which provides us with a competitive advantage.
the budget for the us dod remains at historic highs and we continue to pursue substantial opportunities for further growth. in addition, we have a strong doe pipeline of remediation opportunities and are actively expanding our capabilities in this market. in fact, in the first quarter, we were selected for a $500 million defense contract. as we look across our $30 billion pipeline, which includes nearly $15 billion of bids under client evaluation, we are confident that this momentum will continue.
pivoting to construction services, i am pleased to report that we continue to make strong progress on the alliant gas power plant. we are approximately 80% complete and remain on schedule and on budget. our confidence in a successful outcome remains high. however, execution challenges across cs impacted our results, including right down to the fourth quarter on a handful of projects. we have changed the leadership of the business and conducted a thorough review of our portfolio of projects. importantly, with new leadership in place, we are optimistic about the future.
in building construction, we achieved our ambitious target for a fourth consecutive year of double-digit organic revenue growth led by our core new york and los angeles metro markets. total wins for the year double from fiscal 2017 and backlog increased by 12%. after the quarter ended, an aecom and walsh joint venture was selected for the $7 billion redevelopments of terminal 1 at jfk airport in new york city, which will increase our building construction backlog to a new record. with none of our top ten projects set to end in 2019 and a strong pipeline of pursuits, we continue to have substantial visibility.
the civil construction business performed to our expectations and has been a sild contributor over the past year. demand in our core west coast markets is driving better-as-sold margins and more favorable terms and conditions. as a result, we are being highly selective on the work we are pursuing.
finishing with aecom capital, we achieved a tremendous milestone this quarter with the first financial close on our new third-party real estate investment joint venture with canyon partners. when we started aecom capital in 2013, our goal was to prove out the concept and to manage third-party capital given the size of the opportunity and investment limits of our balance sheet. the new fund will provide us with management fees that will support cost, allowing us to fully benefit from the upside of our gains.
across our business, we are positioned for continued success. we are winning work at a record rate and market trends continue to support several years of growth. with more efficient and focused operations, we are confident in our ability to drive strong performance over the next several years.
i will now turn the call over to troy, who will discuss the quarter in more detail.
w troy rudd -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. please turn to slide 6.
we delivered strong results on a number of key metrics. importantly, we delivered strong cash flow including a record in the fourth quarter, which enabled continued debt reduction and the repurchase of approximately 4.6 million shares of our stock. as mike emphasized, we had several accomplishments in the year, which sets a solid foundation for the future. to fully capitalize on this foundation, we have implemented margin enhancements initiatives primarily through a more efficient operating model and g&a reductions.
we have made substantial progress in our targeting g&a reductions already and expect to realize approximately $85 million of savings in fiscal 2019. generating the planned g&a savings and delivering on our record backlog, are key components of the 12% ebita growth we expect in fiscal 2019. as a result, we are confident in our ability to drive sustained long-term earnings growth and to create value for our shareholders. let's turn to slide 7.
revenue in the dcs segment increased by 11% in the fourth quarter and eight percent in the full year. the americas grew by 17% in the second half of the year and 11% for the full year. this growth was driven by strong performance in our core transportation and water markets, as well as improved results in our environment business. in addition, we are executing a growing portfolio of storm recovery work where we are pursuing a multibillion-dollar pipeline of opportunities. as a result, we expect growth to continue in fiscal 2019.
the adjusted operating margin was 6.1% for the quarter, which is a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year and reflects the positive momentum in the business. while we delivered strong performance in our americas and asia pacific regions, lower levels of activity in the uk and ongoing cost to align that business with market conditions offset these strengths. importantly, we are on a path to deliver substantial margin improvement with our planned g&a reductions. as a result, we expect the adjusted operating margin to increase by at least 110 basis points to more than seven percent in fiscal 2019 with a further improvement expected in fiscal 2020 as we realize the full annual benefit of our g&a actions. please turn to slide 8.
revenue in the ms segment increased by 14% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. this was ahead of our expectations. revenue is accelerating as a result of the approximately 120% backlog growth since the start of fiscal 2017. the full year adjusted operating margin was 6.5%, which was most consistent with expectations.
as we pivot to fiscal 2019, we expect our adjusted operating margin to approximately six percent. with an increasing percentage of our revenue coming from projects where we are in the prime position, an increase in share revenue on these projects will run through our books and dilute the margin percentage. with our robust backlog and pipeline, including strong wins already in the first quarter, we are confident in the positive trajectory of the business. please turn to slide 9.
revenue in the cs segment increased by five percent in the fourth quarter and seven percent in the full year. we achieved our ambitious goal of delivering a fourth consecutive year of double-digit organic growth in our building construction business, and with the substantial wins in the first quarter that mike spoke to, we are well-positioned for continued growth.
our full-year operating margin was 1.9%, which was slightly below our expectations. while performance was strong across most of the portfolio, as mike mentioned, poor performance on a handful of projects negatively impacted results. importantly, we've conducted a thorough review of our portfolio and changed the leadership to improve accountability. we expect our margins will approximate two percent in fiscal 2019. please turn to slide 10.
fiscal 2018 underscores our industry-leading track record of strong cash generation. operating cash flow in the year was $775 million and free cash flow was $688 million, both of which were 11% improvements over the prior year. we've now generated $2.7 billion of free cash flow over the past four years. our ability to consistently convert earnings to cash flow has enabled our shareholder-focused capital allocation actions.
during the year, we allocated capital to the highest and best use, including continued debt reduction and a $150 million accelerated share repurchase. going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged under our commitment to return substantially all free cash flow to shareholders, including the $850 million remaining on our $1 billion repurchase authorization.
with our stock continuing to trade a price below what we believe is the long-term value, we intend to be in the market buying shares. we will, of course, balance the repurchase volumes with cash flows, which are typically second-half weighted in our business. please turn to slide 11.
we've initiated guidance for fiscal 2019 that calls for adjusted ebitda of between $920 million and $960 million and adjusted eps of between $2.60 and $2.90. our eps growth in 2019 is 24% at the midpoint after adjusting for our better-than-expected 2018 tax performance. at the midpoint of our ebitda range, we are expecting 12% growth, which includes $85 million of realized benefits from our g&a reduction plan and underlying growth in the business.
as i noted, for the majority of the savings benefit realized in the dcs segment, we expect dcs margins to exceed seven percent. in addition, we expect fiscal 2020 ebitda will improve further, driven by the annual benefit of our g&a reductions and firm revenue growth. importantly, with the outsize growth we expect in 2019 and our record backlog, we are reiterating our expectation for a seven percent ebitda cagr from fiscal 2018 to 2022.
with respect to the impacts of the g&a reduction plan, we expect to incur approximately $80-90 million of restructuring costs. the majority of these costs will be incurred in the first half of the year with the benefits phasing in as the year progresses. [00:19:07] [audio cuts out] for the restricting are expected to be between $60 million and $70 million.
we anticipate first quarter ebitda will account for approximately 21% of our full-year guidance. of note, however, is the timing of the aecom capital realizations. today, we expect to realize most of the anticipated $13 million included at the midpoint of our guidance during the first half of the year. we expect to deliver cash flow between $600 million and $800 million for the full year and remain committed to our plan to deliver at least $3.5 billion of free cash flow from 2018 through 2022.
with that, i will turn the call over for q&a. operator, we're now ready for questions.

michael, as you think about business development for 2018, where do you from a border or from executive management level see the best opportunities [inaudible] to kind of achieve and continued growth in 2018 but maybe even looking forward to 2019 and 2020, maybe start with design business than more so on the management services side where i think this could be continued visibility.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
sure. let me start off and talk about the dcs and cs and randy will talk about ms. so, first of all, based on what we saw in q4 of 9% organic growth, the highest growth that we've seen in many, many years as well as the 1.2 book to burn ratio gives us a lot of confidence that the momentum is increasing. so, as we start to see momentum increasing, of course we're seeing that because we have invested for the past year in business development activity and we're going to continue to invest in business development activity but when we say we're are at some of the hot markets, you heard us mention some of the recent ballot measures and some of the hot markets that we've seen like los angeles, seattle, san francisco and atlanta, if i look at just those four markets alone, we are expecting about 20 billion dollars in bids to be put out to the market in the next 12 months alone, just in those four markets.
so, we are seeing some incredible strength in some of these markets. the us infrastructure market really gives us some real confidence. so, we're starting to see while we've had great growth in construction services three years in a row, double-digit organic growth, now we're starting to see the growth come back to the dcs and the ms segments, our two highest margin segments. and so, it's not only growth but its growth in the right segments and we feel pretty good about the us infrastructure market, the construction markets, we have long been benefiting from the uptick in the vertical construction markets in new york city but we've diversified outside of that market into many other our regions.
you've heard us mention the win in london for the second tallest building in london. you've heard us mention the five other markets outside of new york and in the us where we have over a billion dollars of construction revenue. so, overall, we feel good about the construction markets growing outside of new york and we feel good about the infrastructure markets. we'll let randy comment about management services.
randy wotring -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. we entered the year with about 50 billion dollars in the pipeline and 20 billion dollars of decisions expected in the year and we delivered substantial growth. we had a strong success in converting the pipeline to wins and ms backlog actually increased by nearly 50%. of the 20 billion in decisions we anticipated, we won about 8 billion dollars or 40% of the pursuits and importantly, as mike indicated, beyond this success we still have a qualified bid pipeline of over 30 billion which reflects our investment to backfill the pipeline with new opportunities.
and beyond that, i think if you look at defense spending trends, the outlook across defense and intelligence markets remains robust. the president's 2018 budget calls for a 10% increase over fy 2017 budget levels. and so, we're talking budgets well over half a trillion dollars. it's a very large market and growing and aecom is able to address an increasing amount of the programs that are put out for bid.
and there's also a growing pipeline internationally and governments all over the world are signaling increased defense budgets. and recently we saw the saudi arabia, the oil agreement with the us that adds to our confidence that higher global defense spending is going to be in place. so, we feel bullish about the pipeline opportunities in the ms marketplace.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
thank you, mike. and my quick follow-up would be when you're talking about your 25-million-dollar restructuring that you expect to hit in q1, is that just for those underperforming businesses you highlighted, mike, in the quarters or something more general to those numbers and where you're starting to target maybe some tightening of the belt.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, i'll let randy answer that, ok?
randy wotring -- chief financial officer
yes. following several years of integration and a pivot to the external growth focus, we see a few areas that could see some fine-tuning and pruning to drive efficiency in how we operate and deliver work. we're always looking for ways to improve the efficiency with which we operate and deliver work. we're focused on positioning the company best for 2018 and beyond and very much focused on delivering growth and having a highly efficient cost structure.
so, look, i think included in this guidance this year is approximately 20 to 25 million of expense. this will primarily accrue to the dcs business with a little bit in cs where we have reorganized a few businesses to reflect the overall lower business volumes. and you may recall, for instance, as mike mentioned in prepared remarks, we went from having a few large industrial jobs to none following the election last year and nafta concerns. so, you may recall we've talked about pressures on our us government environmental business due to weak oil prices or realigning the cost structure there and if not for that environmental market pressure in americas dcs, we would have had positive organic growth for the year.
michael dudas -- vertical research -- analyst
excellent. thanks, gentlemen. appreciate it.
operator
our next question comes from andrew kaplowitz from citi. please go ahead.
unidentified analyst -- citigroup -- analyst
hi. good morning. this is [inaudible] for andy this morning. mike, i want to come back to the ms backlog because 50% growth there is a great result but i think you had talked about doubling ms backlog this year and it does look like you lost one significant recompete in the quarter.
so, how much of it, if at all, does this impact your ability to generate 5% organic growth in 2018 and beyond? and can you talk about any protest that you filed on the recompete that you lost and maybe your confidence in being successful there?
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
yeah i'll let randy respond to that but this could be the first time in history were a 50% increase in backlog is not enough to satisfy but i'll let randy jump into that one.
randy wotring -- chief financial officer
yeah let me talk about, i think, you're referring to the savannah river job at the department of energy and we're extremely disappointed by that initial decision. our team has performed very well there, very high performance for us for years and our record is unmatched in the industry relative to our ability to safely treat and dispose of radioactive waste. we're very selective in what we protest and we only move forward with the protest when we believe that an agency is not followed its evaluation criteria or applicable procurement negotiations regulations. we do not believe that the doe award decision was consistent with the rfp evaluation criteria or applicable procurement regulations.
now, although protests turn on their individual facts and circumstances, we have a strong record of successfully utilizing the protest process when necessary. so, thus we have filed our bid protest as well as others with the government accountability office. now, look, we still are very bullish on growth. we still have a full pipeline and from time to time we will lose contracts we should win or win contracts we should lose but we're very bullish that we are continuing to win above industry average and we have visibility on the pipeline that will provide growth well into the future.
unidentified analyst -- citigroup -- analyst
i appreciate that, randy. maybe sticking with ms, i think you guided, i think you said 7% margin there for 2018 but you've done quite a bit better than that the last several years. so, is this just some conservatism on your part kind of given the variability of the performance enhancement fees there and can you do better than that in 2018 if you continue to execute well?
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
this is troy. i'll take that question. so, our guide this year and our guide for next year has been a 7% margin for the ms business and i think we said this in the prepared comments that that excludes any award fees or any significant performance fees that we would earn in the year. so, as we move forward into 2008, our guidance is built around that 7% operating margin and we do see upside in the business as we move forward into 2018 and beyond that.
unidentified analyst -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. thank you, guys.
operator
our next question comes from steven fisher from ubs. please go ahead.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
thanks. good morning. mike, over the last few years there have been some false starts on the americas design business. in one quarter it starts to look good and then it starts to fade.
how are the dynamics that you're seeing this time different? and i would guess you're going to say it has to do with some of [inaudible] funding initiatives. and if that's the case, how do you kind of think about the federal side of things.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
so, listen, we have been participating in a difficult environment in the us construction market for quite some time and if you look at the revenue growth, the backlog growth, anything else relative to our peer group, we have considerably outperformed that peer group. our backlog is up 12% and our book-to-burn rate is up in the key markets of water and transportation, all up double-digit numbers. we're feeling pretty good about that momentum, we're feeling good about our execution, we're feeling good about the investments in business development we've made in target markets and we're feeling good about that 20 billion dollars i mentioned coming to market in the next 12 months in just those four markets of seattle, san francisco, la and atlanta, all markets we have a very strong presence. and so, i don't know if you'd call it false starts or if you'd just call it participating in a shrinking market for a number of years.
we have taken market share in that period of time and our backlog now portends quite well for fy 2018 and forward.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and i don't know if i missed it but can you give us an idea of what you're assuming for overall organic revenue growth in 2018 and then how the individual segments, kind of some color around how they would relate to above or below that overall target?
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
we have not given guidance specifically for fy 2018 on revenue but we have given long-term guidance of 5% organic growth in revenue over the next five years in kager. we've given guidance of 10% growth in earnings over that five-year period of time and we will be updating that guidance in our december investor day and i think everything we're seeing is a positive to those expectations. the momentum feels better than it did a year ago. so, you can read into that what you'd like but we haven't given specific revenue guidance in fy 2018.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
okay. [inaudible] just ask you about cash flow then. what do you think your cash taxes are going to be in 2018 and what are the big [inaudible] to free cash flow year over year in 2018 versus 2017.
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
this is troy. i'll take that question. so, in terms of cash taxes, we would see a profile similar to the current year which means that we would expect to have a tailwind from our cash taxes. at the moment i don't have a specific guide to give you on it.
that's my expectation that it would be similar to the prior year. we also don't have any legal settlements that we anticipate to pay out on in the current year. if you recall in this past year we had an unplanned payout of about 60 million dollars. we also don't have any legal settlements or expected payouts in the coming year but putting that all aside, the underlying business hasn't dramatically changed.
we still have a diversified portfolio of projects, we still have an incentive system that rewards people for cash performance and if you look back at the last three years, we've been pretty consistent. we've generated 2 billion dollars of free cash flow in the last three years and it's all been consistent from year to year. so, i just see the underlying performance of the business delivering cash flow similar to as it has in the past.
steven fisher -- ubs -- analyst
terrific. thanks very much.
operator
our next question comes from andy wittmann from baird. please go ahead.
andy wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. thanks for taking my questions and good morning. i guess i wanted to specifically ask about the burn rate to start out with particularly in the dcs and ms segments. i guess over the last few years it slowed down a little bit but there's a little bit more visibility.
could you talk about how you expect the burn rate to trend in those two segments in particular?
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yeah. andy, it's troy again. so, just at a high level, our backlog year over year is up 11%. and so, just given the nature of some of the projects in the management services business, we see that extending for management services, the burn rate, as you described.
i'm assuming you're talking about the conversion from backlog to revenue. so, we do see that lengthening but we do see growth in that particular business year over year. our construction services profile really is the same. so, we're expecting, again, that business to grow.
we haven't given guidance yet. we [inaudible] specifically around that business. we do see that growth. in our design business, i don't see a discernible change in the profile of that business.
so, we have seen the backlog grow in our dcs business a little more than 10% and we would expect that to translate into revenue in 2018 at the same rate that it's translated to in the past.
andy wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great, thanks. i guess my next question i wanted to dig in a little bit more about, kind of the overall industry utilization rates and the impact that it might be having on your pricing or terms and conditions. unemployment is [inaudible] low broadly speaking but i don't know if it's low for your employee base. is there enough of a scarcity factor here that you're able to get better pricing or terms and conditions or do you expect that 2018 will be similar to 2017?
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
we're expecting 2018 to be similar to 2017 in terms of margins. we've given our margin guidance and we're not expecting labor pools or labor issues impact that except for the fact that we get operating leverage and the more we grow our revenue, the more of a positive impact it has on our margin. so, we are not concerned about labor scarcity in the type work we're doing or in the locations that we are doing it in any way that would negatively impact margins.
andy wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
great. and then i guess my last question is probably for randy and that just has to do with the federal environment. and, randy, if you could just remind us which of your recompetes are up in 2018 for the federal?
randy wotring -- chief financial officer
i think it's los alamos and hanford but maybe i'm wrong in that, maybe if there are any others that we should be monitoring, it would be helpful to know. thank you.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, i think there's nothing unusual about what we have next year. i think in fact it's no major recompetes that are up other than those that we've started in the fiscal year 2017. so, i know of no major recompetes. we have a smaller contract, i guess, with doe at the national energy technology laboratory where we've been for a large number of years but nothing major.
andy wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
okay. thank you.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
i will say that we still consider the savannah river site competition to be open and not closed. so, from that standpoint, it's a major recompete that's out there.
andy wittmann -- robert w. baird -- analyst
fair enough. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from chad dillard from deutsche bank. please go ahead.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, guys.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
hello, chad.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
just wanted to touch on the 20 and 25 million dollars in restructuring. just wanted to understand how big of a benefit that will be and then how should we think about the timing to win [inaudible] run rate? and then also just related to your 2018 guidance, how much of that [inaudible] benefits included and how much, if at all, you are including non-recurring tax benefits for 2018.
randy wotring -- chief financial officer
chad, i'm sorry i missed the very last part of your question. if you could repeat that, please.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
just how much, if at all, [inaudible] including [inaudible] non-recurring tax benefits for 2018.
randy wotring -- chief financial officer
okay. so, i'm going to answer that one first that in our 21% rate that we're guiding to we do expect a benefit of a restructuring in q1. other than that, we don't anticipate anything in the subsequent quarters but it's baked into our 21% rate. in terms of the overall restructuring, first of all, it is included in our $2.70 guidance and we expect that to go through our results in the q1.
and restructuring will take place in q1 and some of it in the beginning of the q2. and in 2018, in terms of the impact, we see a very modest impact in the full-year result but once we get through that, we see a more permanent and lasting impact in fiscal 2019 and beyond.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. and then switching over to management services, you mentioned that you have about 16 billion dollars in your pipeline over the next 12 months. i mean, i understand that this business can be pretty lumpy but it in terms of what you're seeing in terms of visibility, you expect that 16 billion dollars to be more first halfway versus second halfway [inaudible]. and also maybe you can speak to the level of visibility that you're seeing in the international portion of management services.
i think one of your peers today mentioned they're seeing slowdown [inaudible] defense and i just wanted to get some [inaudible] are you seeing this as a problem and if there is, is how big of an impact would that be into your business.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
i have to tell you to predict the timeframe when the government's going to make awards is very difficult. so, i would tell you that most of the pipeline that exists where we expect awards in 2018 will be spread over the year. we've seen delays. there was a question earlier about we haven't won as much as we thought we would.
it's because some of those awards were delayed and kicked over into the fiscal year 2018. so, the timing on awards is hard to predict. i'll just tell you that we expect that those will spread over the year. with regard to international activities, we are seeing the tick-up in opportunities in india and we do see some nuclear-related opportunities in the uk.
although we've seen some of the same slowdown in the uk defense department but we're not necessarily impacted by that in the fiscal year 2018.
chad dillard -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thank you, guys.
operator
our next question comes from jamie cook from credit suisse. please go ahead.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning or good afternoon depending on what time. i guess, a couple of questions. one, back to the management services business, mike.
you have been very successful, you talk about your backlog is up 50% year over year but i'm just trying to think through. i mean, you said revenues would be up and that you'd assume a 7% margin or so for ms services. at what point do you expect on a profit dollar basis that your management services business can grow over a year? is that more of a 2019 scenario or could we see that in 2017. my second question is with regard to 20 to 25 million in restructuring.
do we see this as sort of the last year sort of restructuring or should we think about that as sort of an ongoing improvement that [inaudible] continue to streamline the business? and then my third question is on the longer-term financial targets, based on what you're saying and i know we want to wait until the analyst day but should we now assume that your 10% eps growth target, we could potentially do better than that with now your share repurchase in place because i didn't think before [inaudible] share repurchase when you talked about your 10% eps growth target.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
okay. i think i got all three of those down. let me start with what our expectations are for us in the ms segment to see growth in 2018.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
profit dollar growth.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
yes, yes.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
profit. we expect profits to increase in the ms operating segment in 2018 and of course in 2019 and forward. secondly, on the restructuring, when you is this something we'll be done with it or is it something where there's more to come, i think any business of our size with 18 billion of revenue, we ought to be looking every year what things we can prune so that we can grow. and we don't see any other restructuring charges planned for 2018 certainly after this but i wouldn't rule out us in the future looking to prune businesses based on market conditions.
we saw a downturn in the oil and gas environmental engineering business that's caused us to restructure around that and a few other small areas. so, i think that's just normal and healthy. with regard to your third question, our long-term financial targets when we put them out last year did not include share repurchases. and so, i think you know how to interpret that comment and we will have more to say about that in the december analyst day but we still feel very confident in our five-year growth and our cash flow projections.
with cash flow, troy mentioned, we had 2 billion of free cash flow over the last three years and you could you could straight line that right to our five-year cash flow projections that we had given. so, we think there is upside to that. and the recent organic growth rates give us confidence. we set out a 5% organic growth target.
we hit 4% in fy 2017 with 9% q$0. so, we like the trajectory of that. we like the trajectory of our win rates. all of that gives us some real confidence in the direction of that business.
jamie cook -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thank you. i'll get back in the queue.
operator
our next question comes from bobby burlson from canaccord genuity. please go ahead.
bobby burleson -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
yeah, good morning. just a couple of quick ones. just wondering about this china-us energy agreement that's kind of a verbal agreement right now, talking about 83 billion in shale gas and chemical investment in the west virginia area. wondering how your midstream engineering business is positioned there, whether or not you think there's some meaningful potential uptick in projects coming and what the time frame might be.
i know it's early.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
it's simply too early to tell on that but it's obviously an area that we have an interest in some capacity but too early to tell this point.
bobby burleson -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
okay. and then nuclear decommissioning. just wondering if some of the rulemaking changes that fed are in the process could actually speed up the pace of additional projects coming your way or whether or not you think that that's not really a core issue. i understand there's some trying to lower cost during the decommissioning phase by lowering personnel requirements.
is that something you see as a significant move that might be happening soon?
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, the nuclear decommissioning opportunity is a big opportunity. you've heard us mention before. we think that's a 200-billion-dollar market. clearly, the san onofre win was the first big one that we were able to compete very well on given our new combined capabilities.
it was a real test case for us to bring together our extensive power construction expertise, our environmental engineering expertise and most importantly our federal government nuclear-decommissioning expertise and put all that together. and i think it was a real testament to the value of our integrated delivery model that allowed us to win that project. and i think it positions us incredibly well for nuclear decommissioning not just here in the united states and all the regulatory loosening around that but canada has an enormous nuclear decommissioning opportunity. we've been spending time in japan where they're going to take down 35 reactors.
we've been spending time in taiwan where they're going to take down a large reactor. so, i think we're as positioned as well as anybody to benefit from that 200-billion-dollar market.
bobby burleson -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thanks.
operator
our next question comes from tahira afzal from keybanc. please go ahead.
tahira afzal -- keybanc -- analyst
hi folks. congrats on a good job, given the storm.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
thank you.
tahira afzal -- keybanc -- analyst
i guess my first question, you've talked a bit about or hinted at all the [inaudible] as you look out into your 2018 guidance. i would love to get a little more color in terms of what you've assumed around the interest expense, in terms of debt reduction.
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
yeah, tahira, it's troy. so, again, what we've assumed is that we're going to apply substantially all of our cash to pay down debt during fiscal 2018. now, the profile of the business is typically that debt pay-down in this [inaudible] comes in the second half of the year. so, we have interest expense coming down during the course of the year but as you can see in the interest guide, it comes down when you just look at the rate that we've applied, it comes down in the second half of the year.
and so, it's down a few pennies during the course of the year in our guidance. and i will also remind you that as a result of the bond offering we did successfully in february, we now have more than 90% of our debt being fixed. so, even if we see a rise in interest rates over the course of this year, we're relatively immune to the impact of that.
tahira afzal -- keybanc -- analyst
perfect. thanks. and, i guess i have a follow-up, mike. you talked a bit about the niamh city proposed, seems more like the whole state [inaudible] but i guess would love to get your thoughts.
you've seen the king abdullah initiatives sort of yield mixed results in the past. how real do you think this is based on what you've learned so far and then the timeline and if you roughly break it out, it means there are around 35 to 40 billion dollars in spending every year going on for a decade. what would be [inaudible] as an opportunity within that?
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
yeah, tahira, i had the good fortune of being in riyadh just two weeks ago and participating in many meetings about neat the niamh project, about the new red sea tourism projects as well as the infrastructure growth of the region and i'll tell you i really felt like it was history in the making without being overly dramatic. i've never felt more hope for the country of saudi arabia than i did on that trip with the moderation of the cultural issues in the country that are causing many foreigners to invest into saudi, it's causing them to bring technology and innovation and talent. and tourism to the country and i think as they make their shift away from their dependency on oil, there's a lot of opportunities for companies like us to help them develop industry, tourism, and infrastructure for many, many years to come. so, we feel really good about that.
we feel really good about our position there. we have 700 or so employees on the ground now and i think you're going to see a lot of great things coming from that country.
tahira afzal -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. thanks a lot, mike.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
sure.
operator
this concludes the question and answer session. i'll now turn the call back over to mike burke for closing remarks.
mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
thank you, operator. hopefully what you take away from this call is that we're really excited about what 2018 holds in store for us. we delivered on growth in fy 2017, we finished with 9% organic growth in q4 and we expect to continue that growth in 2018 but more importantly, we're seeing growth coming back to the higher-margin segments and we're starting to see an overall mix shift to higher-margin work and we're also seeing that our design, build, finance and operate strategy is truly creating a competitive differentiation, describing success on many very large pursuits. and so, that coupled with another robust cash flow year in fy 2017 and you heard us mentioned a couple times that we've delivered on 2 billion dollars of free cash flow since 2015 and all of that gives us incredible confidence in our five-year growth in cash flow projections and we're hoping to continue this dialogue at our investor day on december 12th in new york and we'll be talking more about our strategy and a more detailed look at our capital allocation plan.
so, thank you for your continued interest and hopefully, we'll see you in december. bye now.

mike burke -- chief executive officer and chairman
thank you, will. welcome, everyone. joining me today are troy rudd, our chief financial officer and randy wotring, our chief operating officer. i will begin with an overview of aecom's results and discuss the trends across our business.
then, troy will review our financial performance and outlook in greater detail before turning the call over for the question and answer session. please turn to slide three.
we began the year with substantial momentum and delivered on numerous key financial and strategic objectives. first, we delivered 9% revenue growth in q4 which marked our highest quarterly growth in several years and contributed to the full-year growth of 4%. all three segments grew in q4 including double-digit growth in building construction and power and growth in our americas design business. second, we delivered record wins of 23 billion dollars and our backlog increased by 11% to a new all-time high of nearly 48 billion dollars.
this performance was led by our higher margin and dcs segments and included double-digit growth in our americas design business where we are capitalizing on improving market trends. third, we had another year of exceptional free cash flow which was consistent with our expectations. we have now paid down approximately 1.5 billion dollars of debt over the past three years, continued to invest in growth and expanded our aecom capital portfolio. fourth, we announced a new capital allocation policy in september built on the confidence we have in our five-year financial forecast including 3.5 billion dollars of cumulative free cash flow.
this policy which includes achieving net leverage of 2.5 times and a new 1-billion-dollar stock repurchase authorization underscores our commitment to creating substantial shareholder value. finally, our design, build, finance and operate capabilities are creating meaningful competitive advantages that is no more apparent than in our selection to deliver the more one-billion-dollar decommissioning of the san onofre nuclear plant in southern california which we were awarded in first. in addition, in q4 we won a sizable multiyear global design-build contract for a leading multinational pharmaceutical company. both of these wins draw on more than one aecom discipline.
overall, we are pleased with these accomplishments. however, a few unexpected market challenges impacted our results. following the us election last fall, nearly 1 billion dollars of projects that we expected would contribute in 2017 were canceled due to nafta concerns. in addition, the devastating storms in q4 impacted some of our larger us markets and low energy prices persisted which weighed on our middle east markets and pressured our oil and gas environment business in the americas.
in response to some of these dynamics, we are taking measured actions to streamline a few of our operations to better align our overhead and to deliver work more efficiently. importantly, we executed through these challenges and ended the year with a record backlog and confidence in the trajectory of our business which is underscored in our financial outlook that troy will detail shortly.
please turn to slide four for a discussion of our business and market trends. beginning with the dcs segment in the americas, the improved funding environment and strong support for infrastructure investment are creating one of the most favorable growth backdrops in recent history. we exited the year with a record backlog. we delivered substantial growth in our transportation and water markets which account for more than half of the business.
this backlog is already translating into improved results as evidenced by our q4 revenue performance. several of our key markets are benefiting from improved overall levels of funding, specifically los angeles, seattle, san francisco and atlanta. across these markets, our clients are beginning to release major projects for bid and we expect 15 billion dollars of projects to be bid over the next 18 months. importantly, many of these projects are part of our growing 15-billion-dollar pipeline of integrated civil infrastructure pursuits where the acquisition of shimmick construction complements our leading design capabilities and expand our addressable market.
we are also encouraged by trends in canada. our revenue growth accelerated through the year and backlog increased by 20%. prime minister trudeau's 180-billion-dollar infrastructure development plan is providing significant long-term visibility. some of our markets were impacted by the devastating hurricanes that struck the southeast and puerto rico during q4.
i'm pleased to report that all of our people are safe and have been accounted for. we are mobilized to support the recovery and are working with federal, state and local teams on emergency response efforts. we're also well positioned for and actively pursuing opportunities for the estimated 200-billion-dollar disaster recovery and resilience initiatives to help return these communities to normalcy.
let's pivot to our international design markets beginning in the [inaudible] region. in the uk, our largest international market, transformational infrastructure initiatives such as high speed 2 and crossrail are progressing and we delivered another year of growth. in india, prime minister modi's nearly 60-billion-dollar infrastructure modernization plan and the country's overall economic growth are creating substantial opportunities and are contributed great optimism for modern infrastructure development. importantly, across [inaudible] we delivered growth despite continued middle east market pressure from persistently low oil and gas prices.
encouragingly, the middle east market is stabilizing and we are seeing signs of improved demand. for instance, saudi arabia's recently announced 500-billion-dollar niamh development plan highlights the substantial growth potential in the region as greenfield development advances.
turning to the asia pacific region. we delivered our strongest revenue growth in several years in q4 which included solid performance in hong kong where we maintain leading market share and substantial growth in southeast asia where work on several large transportation projects is progressing. importantly, across the region, we are increasingly leveraging our leading capabilities and expertise from hong kong and australia into new markets which is a competitive differentiator.
turning to our management services segment. following nearly three years of intensified business development investments, our backlog increased by nearly 50%. our wins included a 3.6-billion-dollar contract with the us air force which greatly expanded our portfolio of classified work and provided substantial long-term visibility in our highest margin segment. of note, our backlog does not yet include an approximately 500-million-dollar win that is currently under protest.
these successes reinforce our positive outlook. our qualified pipeline of pursuits is over 30 billion dollars including 16 billion dollars of expected decisions over the next several quarters. both the house and senate approved increased defense spending as part of the national defense authorization act and we are confident that our pipeline of backlog will continue to grow in fiscal 2018.
let's pivot to construction services segment. the benefits of our diverse industry-leading capabilities resulted in another solid year. in building construction, we delivered a third consecutive year of double-digit organic growth. we broke ground on the iconic one vanderbilt project in new york, bolstering our resume that includes nearly 60% all towers taller than a thousand feet built in that market in the past decade.
in addition, we continued to expand beyond new york including over 5 billion dollars of projects across california, florida, new england and texas and our selection as construction partner for spire london, the tallest residential building in western europe. we also delivered to new professional sports arenas in detroit and atlanta and broke ground on a new nfl stadium in los angeles, bolstering our leadership position in this market.
in power, our work on alliant's combined cycle gas plant in wisconsin has cleared its early milestone. foundation work is nearly complete and underground piping work is progressing as planned. concluding with aecom capital, we completed the first sale by aecom capital property in 2017 for an approximately 30% irr in addition to fees earned by our construction services segment. we have a premier portfolio of properties at different stages of maturity and we expect to realize substantial gains in the future.
with aecom capital, approximately 2.5 billion dollars of construction value will be executed by our construction services segment and we are building a reputation as a development partner of choice. across aecom, our performance in fiscal 2017 underscores the strength of our diverse portfolio of capabilities and end markets. momentum is building across a number of key markets and we are confident in our long-term growth potential.
i will now turn the call over to troy who will discuss the quarter in more detail.
troy rudd -- chief financial officer
thanks, mike. please turn to slide six. our results highlighted a number of accomplishments including solid performance across the business, accelerated revenue growth in the second half of the year and positive growth in all three segments in q4. adjusted eps in q4 was 74 cents and our eps for the year was within our guidance range.
during the quarter we drove strong outperformance on tax which offset some of the market challenges mike spoke to. importantly, we generated 618 million dollars of free cash flow which was within our annual guidance range for the third consecutive year and include very strong performance in q4, our consistently strong cash performance as a result of our diverse business model and culture focused on driving cash flow. importantly, our backlog and revenue momentum solidify our confidence in our 2018 outlook.
let's turn to slide seven. revenue in the dcs segment increased by 4% in the quarter including growth in the americas design business despite the us hurricanes. this strength was led by our transportation and water businesses where both revenue and backlog increased by double digits. we also had growth in our international markets with large transportation projects ramping up across both asia pacific and [inaudible] regions.
the full-year adjusted operating margin of 5.9% was consistent with our expectations. the underlying execution was strong and we increased business development investments to capitalize on substantial market opportunities. these investments contributed to our record backlog in the americas and underpin our confidence in continued growth in 2018. we expect margins to exceed our 6% target especially as volumes accelerate during the year.
let's turn the slide eight. revenue in the construction services segment increased by 21% for the quarter and 11% for the full year. the full-year adjusted operating margin was 201% which is a 60-basis-point increase over the prior year. we're benefiting from a favorable mix shift to higher margin power work and solid execution.
as anticipated, the shimmick acquisition was modestly accretive to our results and we expect additional accretion in fiscal 2018. in addition, we expect our strong backlog of large commercial, stadia and power projects to drive another year of revenue growth and margins consistent with our 2% target.
let's turn to slide nine. revenue in the management services segment was unchanged for the year. the full-year operating margin was 8.8%, reflecting strong underlying performance across our vast portfolio of projects. importantly, our significant investments in business development and leading capabilities contributed to nearly 50% backlog growth which provides substantial long-term visibility in our highest margin segment.
with a large 3.6-billion-dollar air force win and carried a longer than typical duration, we expect revenue growth in 2018 and margins to approximate or 7% target which does not include the potential project incentives and award fees.
let's turn to slide ten. full-year operating cash flow was 697 million dollars and free cash flow was 618 million dollars. we've now generated 2 billion dollars of free cash flow and reduced our debt by approximately 1.5 billion dollars since closing the urs acquisition in october 2014. in addition, we closed on the shimmick acquisition in q4 which greatly expands our integrated infrastructure offering in attractive western us markets.
our consistent cash performance is a key differentiator that enables significant opportunities for stockholder value creation. accordingly, we formalized the long-term capital allocation policy to provide visibility into our intended use of capital. this policy includes a commitment to allocate substantially all free cash flow, to continue debt reduction, to achieve our 2.5 times net debt ebitda target. we anticipate achieving this goal by the end of fiscal 2018 and immediately thereafter allocating substantially all free cash flow to stock repurchases under our new 1-billion-dollar board repurchase authorization.
acquisitions are expected to be limited to strategic niche targets where we have an established successive history such as tishman, hunt, and shimmick. we're confident in our ability to drive substantial value for our investors.
let's turn a slide eleven. our accomplishments provide us tremendous confidence. as a result, we have initiated adjusted eps guidance between $2.5 and $2.90. in addition, we have also initiated adjusted ebitda guidance of 910 million dollars.
after adjusting for favorable legal resolutions that we recognized in 2017 and normalizing for tax, our adjusted eps and ebitda guidance reflect 10% and 7% growth respectively. we anticipate aecom capital to contribute 8 cents at the midpoint of our eps guidance which compares to 18 cents in 2017. the variation is due primarily to the timing of project realizations which benefited from a large gain we recognized during 2017. we have not yet included any benefit from potential stock repurchases under our new 1-billion-dollar repurchase program.
in addition, while we are hopeful the tax reform proposals translate into action, our expectations do not yet include any anticipated benefits. our guidance also assumes a 21% tax rate, 210 million dollars of interest expense and a 162 million shares outstanding. i should note that our guidance includes between 20 and 25 million dollars of expected restructuring charges to reduce overhead and drive efficiencies across businesses which mike spoke to earlier. these costs are expected to be incurred during the q1 but will largely be offset by the anticipated recognition of discrete tax benefits.
as a result, we expect our q1 adjusted eps guidance to approximate 20% of our full-year guidance. this is consistent with historical phasing. we're forecasting free cash flow between 600 million and 800 million dollars. the near-term priority remains debt reduction to achieve our 2.5 times net leverage target.
with that, i'll turn the call over for q&a. operator, we're ready for questions.
