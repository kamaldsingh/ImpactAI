yes, sir. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of bob labick with cjs securities.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
good morning. first i just wanted to start with a quick congratulations to bill and john. bill, you've done a tremendous job, obviously, growing the company over the last 13 years and it's been great working with you. i look forward to seeing you again before you move on to the chairman role. and john, obviously, we know each other and i look forward to working with you more closely.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, bob.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, bob.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
excited for you guys. so jumping to the quarter. direct contribution from acmi. we knew it would be tough this quarter. we talked about it on the last call. but it's been kind of flat, just the dollars, not talking margins, just dollars, for the last four quarters or so. and it took an incremental hit down. and it's hard to get a sense of the magnitude. you've talked about labor disruptions. can you give us maybe an example of the magnitude of that? or what's going to change to grow -- the ultimate question here. what's going to change to grow acmi direct contribution dollars going forward? because it's been tough for the last five, six quarters.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. thanks, bob, it's spencer. so within the acmi segment, we had a higher contributions from additional flying this quarter, but that was more than offset by higher costs related to the southern air pilots, as we've talked about, start-up costs and then the labor-related service disruptions, as you noted. but one of the biggest items is the higher heavy maintenance expense, and so that was really up in the quarter.
and to answer your question, how will it get better, for the second half of 2019 we'll enjoy peak with flying for all integrators, and we expect heavy maintenance expense to be around $15 [phonetic] million below the second half of 2018. so you should really see acmi profitability improving as well as acmi margins improving, especially in the fourth quarter.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it, great. and then just on my follow-up there. on amc, you noted a recovery, i guess, so to speak, in the cargo. and then passenger was a little lower than expected. can you just talk about expectations there going forward? and we talked a little about q1, the change in order patterns in cargo. is that completely behind us now? is it slightly recovered? or what's the outlook in amc?
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
yeah, i'll answer that. bob, this is bill. so for second half cargo, we expect cargo relatively flat to last year, but second half cargo amc volumes to be somewhat higher than first half 2019 cargo volumes, and cargo relatively flat to last year. in passenger, we expect second half to be substantially higher than the first half of 2019, as well as substantially higher than the second half of 2018. we've added a couple of aircraft to our passenger fleet, a 767 and 747, and we also had a 767 last year in the second half that was in maintenance due to some damage it had incurred. and so now we've got all of the aircraft in service flying for the military, so we expect an -- for those several reasons, we expect an uptick in the second half.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and bob, it's spencer. i'll just add that our entitlement in that area remained fairly steady, around 54% for both cargo and passenger flying.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
super. thank you. i'll jump back in queue and congratulations again to bill and john.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, bob.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer

operator
your next question comes from the line of helane becker with cowen.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks, operator. hi everybody. thanks for the time. the one question i was wondering if you could answer is what percent of the difference was labor versus the actual business decline?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, helane. hi, it's spencer. so we're not going to quantify that, but we'll tell you that the largest impact was really due to tariffs and trade tensions followed by higher heavy maintenance, lower military cargo and passenger flying, the increase in the southern crew costs as well as start-up cost and then also labor disruptions. and the other thing is that looking at the second quarter alone, the prior year obviously had a benefit, as you i'm sure know, from a refund of rent paid in prior years. so that's kind of the magnitude of the various items that made up the shortfall in the second quarter.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. i mean, i noticed that in june specifically, technology products was up 4%, just a little under 4%, and pharmaceuticals was up just a little over 5%. so i would think that you might have seen some benefit from the tech products you tend to carry in june. but it sounds like that did not occur.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
so this is bill, helane. just a couple things. volumes certainly have been impacted by the tariffs. when we were -- there have been three announced series of tariffs, and back in september there was that third tranche of tariffs on $200 billion worth of items at a rate of 10%, and those tariffs were somewhat held in advance from then really through march into april as the discussions between the us and china continued. and most of us were hoping for that -- somewhat of a resolution as we came to the end of april. but that didn't happen, all right. it went the other way. and then that tranche of those items under that $200 billion third tranche of tariffs were implemented. the tariffs were implemented, and then they went from 10% to 25%. and that was on may 19. what we saw then was a fairly dramatic impact where volumes certainly came down. i think some volumes were buoying up a bit in first quarter as people were perhaps building some inventories against these tariffs. and then as volumes dropped, the yields dropped pretty quickly because capacity didn't really come out.
and i think what we're describing here and what we've observed here is, i think, very consistent with what several of the integrators have talked about in their recent earnings calls, and certainly several of the large cargo airlines, european and asian cargo airlines, have said about their cargo results. and i think one or two of the us large passenger carriers have talked about what's happened to some of their volumes recently in their recent earnings calls as well. and i heard what you said about pharma and tech.
we certainly have seen some tech already shifting to taiwan, some tech shifting into vietnam, and we're carrying that on charters, but it's not offsetting the volume decline and the concurrent yield declines that we've seen in the market place. and that's what we've reflected -- that's the kind of context we're reflecting into the guidance framework that we provided.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
okay. thank you. i just have one other question unrelated. i think you were supposed to replace two 747-400s is for qantas with two 747-8 freighters. is that on hold now, or is that transaction still going forward?
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
no, that transaction's going forward. there's some regulatory sign-offs. those are essentially lined up, and we expect to fly those aircraft for qantas this quarter.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
thanks, helane.
operator
your next question comes from the line of seldon clarke with deutschebank.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, thanks for the question. so you -- for the full year ebitda, you lowered your guidance by 13%, but you only lowered revenue and block hour guidance by just 3%. can you talk about the moving pieces there and whether you think you can make up for that ebitda shortfall in 2020?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, seldon, it's spencer. i don't think we're ready to talk about 2020 at this point. we still need to see how fourth quarter peak shapes up and what yields are going to be like. we're starting to hear some positives that could help the remainder of the year. so we really have to see how this plays out. the decline happened so quickly in the second half of may, and then into june and july. but we're now starting to hear some positives, so we will see.
with regard to your other question, there are reimbursed expenses that play into some of that and for certain customers. and then there's maintenance expense. and so maintenance expense, as i mentioned before, we expect to lower in the second half of the year, and so that should really benefit ebitda.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
so i guess that really hasn't changed from your initial guidance is more my question. so like the 330,000 block hours, $2.9 billion in revenue imply somewhere around the same revenue per block hour as your previous guidance. but you lowered ebitda by 13%. you've lowered your forecast for maintenance expense as well. so i'm just curious what the disconnect is there.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay, sure. so if you take a look at the full year, our previous guidance versus our current guidance, the greatest variances are due to the international market softness, which includes yields and volume impacts of the tariffs and trade tensions. we also lowered guidance because of declines in military passenger volumes, and then impacts from labor disruptions. those are by far the biggest items, and we assume that the current conditions over the past few months will continue over the summer into the fall, and then will impact peak yields. we think volumes will be there during peak. the question is what will the yields be like. and then as bill said before, any positive developments with tariffs or trade negotiations could really improve our outlook.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. and then, some of these, not asking customer-specific, but some of these new business wins that you bring on. i think you have more start-up costs than normal, especially with the 737s. but are they generally profitable in the first year, or is that something that starts to inflect in year two or year three? or how exactly does that work?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so it varies. every customer arrangement is a little different, and it depends. the 737s was a bit of a new fleet type. we didn't have scale in that fleet. we needed to bring in pilots and get them trained very quickly, and so there were start-up costs there that were a little more unusual than we've had with other start-ups. but normally, yes, there's a really quick payback period and turnaround so that new customer agreements are accretive fairly quickly.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, and just the last one from me on that. would you bring on new longer-term contracts in your acmi segment? how does cyclicality affect those negotiations?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, if we're seeing a --
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
so in a softer market like now, are you signing up new business at a lower rate than maybe you would have signed it up last year? or is it a little stickier than that?
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
it's stickier than that because a couple -- this is bill flynn, seldon. it's stickier than that. clearly, 2008-2009 was a market condition that affected every industry, and none of us had ever seen anything like that again. what we're talking about here are trade tensions and tariffs, and that's unusual, right. even the fed chairman, powell, commented on that yesterday as well. but what we're not seeing is a collapse in the market. we're not seeing what we saw back then 10 years ago.
so our ability to place a acmi contract with a customer, or a cmi contract. we've got to be able to describe the value that we're going to provide, the service levels that we'll perform at, and we're looking at over an extended period of time. and we're not deeply discounting or discounting temporarily just to get something placed. that's not the situation that we're in.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, that's all. i appreciate it. thanks.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, seldon.

your next question comes from the line of kevin sterling with seaport global securities.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, kevin.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
good morning, kevin.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
bill, congratulations on your pending retirement. and john, congratulations on your new role.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, kevin.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, kevin.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
bill, i want to step back and ask a big picture question, if you don't mind, because for the longest time you guys -- and you've talked about how you've been transitioning your model to be, i guess, more reliant on e-commerce and less heavy international air freight, and how your exposure to e-commerce would help offset some of your exposure to the traditional international heavy air freight market. but then when i look at this quarter and your outlook, it sounds like none of that played out. so can you help just reconcile kind of what's going on? because obviously you're not -- i don't think you're quite as exposed to the international market as you once were say five, six years ago. but it does seem like it reared its ugly head this quarter.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, kevin. well, i think that what you initially described is accurate. we have been transitioning our model over a period of time now with a focus on express and e-commerce, and i think that shows in these results. but we've always had a play in the charter market, and i think we've consistently seen about 25% of our volumes in charter, commercial and military. and when we look at quarterly contribution, while there was pressure in several segments, we really saw it in commercial charter. and it happened really quickly, right.
it happened from mid-may on. but in terms of our acmi-cmi operations, yes, there were some items there, and spencer discussed them, but pretty stable core part of the business, and certainly less exposed to the kind of volatility that we saw in this quarter in the commercial charter market. so i think the thesis in the business model holds. that's consistent, but charter is still a large part of the business when it's at 25%.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. can i switch to heavy maintenance? and spencer, you talked about that, the higher heavy maintenance expense in the quarter. and we kind of, i think, knew that. but without getting too specific, as we look at, say, the next couple years, heavy maintenance tends to be more scheduled. can we expect another year in 2020, maybe next year, of really high heavy maintenance, or have you guys worked through a lot of that, do you think, some of the that potential heavy maintenance expense this year?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
kevin, heavy maintenance, it's kind of due when it's due. and so it really depends on, from an engine standpoint, it really depends on cycles, how many takeoffs and landings. from an airframe check, it really depends on time. and when those things are due, they're due. and it really just depends on when we've taken on aircraft and when they're due for these various heavy maintenance events.
as far as the cost of event, we have seen an increase in the cost per event recently, and our teams are very focused on that and trying to achieve some operational efficiencies there. some of the heavy maintenance did require more work, and so we saw greater work scopes and more work being performed than we had previously estimated. so john's operational teams are quite focused on that in trying to bring those costs down.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
yes. and if i could, kevin, to build on what spencer just said. there's a tremendous focus on working toward getting as much predictability on a per event basis, which looking to big data and following some of the trends, you never know, really, what you're going to find, for example, when you open up an engine. and when you have additional findings that increases costs from time to time. but we're very focused on bringing more stability to that so that we can have more predictability when those events occur.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. i mean, has there been anything unusual? i mean, you talked about the higher -- i guess the higher costs this quarter. has there been anything unusual? it seems in terms of the aircraft you've gotten in, that may have led it to spike this year. could we see it maybe ""normalize"" next year? i mean, or should it just continue to be a high-level run rate maybe because it costs more now to service these planes?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
kevin, maintenance expense is actually down. heavy maintenance expense is actually down on a year-over-year basis. so yes, we're not really seeing that. we're managing it very, very closely. but you have to strip out line maintenance, of course, which is a variable cost, and that's based on hours. so as hours increase, line maintenance costs increase. but if you just look at heavy maintenance expense, we expect that in 2019 it'll actually be lower than 2018.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
if i could add just an additional point, we have had a number of aircraft come into our operation, including engines, that are now going through the system and through the cycle, and some for the first time, engine overhauls, for example. and once we put them through our program, we're also expecting some stability there because you get more familiar with the aircraft, airframes, and engines themselves.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay. got it, john. that makes sense. gentlemen, thank you so much for your time today and your clarification.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of scott group with wolfe research.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, guys. i echo congrats to bill and john.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
thanks, scott.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
thanks, scott.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
i want to ask. the implied fourth quarter guidance has us starting to grow earnings again pretty nicely despite a tough comp, because fourth quarter last year was really good with the tariff pull forward. so what are we assuming that changes so dramatically to go from this earnings decline in 2q and 3q back to earnings growth in fourth quarter? and then i also wanted to ask on the maintenance side, the reduction in the maintenance expense guidance. is that a less flying so there's less maintenance, or are we deferring some heavy maintenance from '19 into the out years?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, scott. it's spencer. i'll take the second part of that first, which is lower flying. you got it right. lower flying leads to lower maintenance costs, and so cause and effect, that's what happened there. and then with regard to your question about the fourth quarter, there were several things there.
in looking at fourth quarter expected results this year versus the prior year, of course we're expecting lower yields during the peak season ex-asia due to the tariffs and trade issues. that has a really dramatic effect. offsetting that are more flying for the military, passenger flying for the military; more flying for the nfl, which is starting really soon; lower heavy maintenance costs, we have seven fewer cf-680 overhauls, and we have one fewer 747-400 c-check. so those are some of the biggest items that are impacting the fourth quarter.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay, so you're not assuming a sort of return to the -- of market conditions getting better. it's more just timing things around maintenance costs and things like that.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we think that volumes will be there during peak, scott. but right now, we are expecting that yields will be much lower than we've seen over the past few years. that may change, but that's what we're anticipating at this point.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
yeah, and if i could, scott. it's john dietrich. i think in the peak season, you generally see a number of areas where we're able to get higher rates during the peak season rush, so that will be a contributor to fourth quarter as well. yeah, that's the flying that we're going to be doing.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that we do every year.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
the flying we do for the integrators is an example and other --
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
charter customers.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
-- reliable -- charter customers, exactly.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay, thanks. and just secondly, spencer, to your point about no planes on order and free cash flow. what are your plans with the free cash? is it debt? is it buying back stock?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. our capital allocation plans are the same. they're not changed. we have been disciplined and balanced. we continue to focus on maintaining the strong balance sheet, investing in the right assets. we have a low weighted average cost of debt, our weighted average coupon rate of 3.3%. so our priorities continue to be the same three things. we want to maintain a strong balance sheet, we want to invest in assets, although we have no remaining commitments this year, but invest in assets the customers want, and then potentially share or purchase. but really, where our focus has been is lowering our overall debt balance and hopefully leading to a lower net leverage ratio to attract more investors.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay, thank you for the time, guys.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, scott.

david campbell -- thompson, davis & company -- analyst
yes. thanks for taking my question. bill, congratulations on the great job you've done over the years.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you.
david campbell -- thompson, davis & company -- analyst
i want to ask you about the southeast asia situation. there is some industry data indicating that there is cargo growth in southeast asia partially offsetting the decrease in north asia. and i was wondering how much flexibility you have in your fleet to move aircraft into markets such as singapore, and indonesia, and malaysia and so forth, and vietnam to take advantage of the movement of manufacturing. it seems to be increasing demand for cargo in that region as opposed to north asia, where the demand is terrible. do you have any thoughts about that?
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
yeah. david, first of all, thank you for your comments and thank you for the question. i think it's a very good and right question. so we are seeing volumes move and new volume flows coming out of two places, really. vietnam has been a beneficiary of some certainly relocated, whether it's permanent or not, i don't know, but relocated manufacturing. several of the korean consumer product companies already have large manufacturing operations, particularly around hanoi. they've got, it seems, the ability to quickly lever that existing capacity and move more production there. we're seeing that. and our charter flights into vietnam have certainly increased. we're seeing some more growth as well down in ho chi minh.
the other -- when you say north asia, there's one distinction, the other location that has benefited from relocation of manufacturing is taiwan. a lot of the consumer product manufacturers in prc are, in fact, taiwanese companies, and they've pulled some production in near-term taiwan as well. so how well this resolves itself and where it all -- where products ultimately are made remains to be seen, but we certainly have the fleet and the flexible, the operations, and network know-how and capability to serve the freight where the freight is.
and importantly, in terms of the regulatory consideration of having root rise and operating authority, those are well in place. we've been flying in and out of vietnam for a long time. everywhere else in southeast asia, you mentioned singapore, malaysia, for example, we're well established in those locations, and similarly in taiwan. so we certainly have the fleet, we have the capabilities, and we can serve the freight wherever the freight originates.
david, i think one other point. what we haven't seen is a one for one volume offset. certainly, there's more product moving out of vietnam and taiwan, but it's not one for one equivalent to what we're not seeing out of china yet. that'll take some time. if that were to be permanent, it would take some time to build up those production capabilities in those locations.
david campbell -- thompson, davis & company -- analyst
yes.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
but, david, i think two things -- one other point. it's not -- what we haven't seen is a one for one volume offset. certainly, there's more product moving out of vietnam and taiwan, but it's not one for one equivalent to what we're not seeing out of china yet. that'll take some time. if that were to be permanent, it would take some time to build up those production capabilities in those locations.
david campbell -- thompson, davis & company -- analyst
but also could be a big benefit to your results next year. is that possible?
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
yes, it is, absolutely.
david campbell -- thompson, davis & company -- analyst
okay, well, thank you very much. that we'll have to watch that closely for some help. expected at this point, but certainly looks like it's happening. thank you.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of jack atkins with stephens, inc.
jack atkins -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thanks for the time. and let me just echo everyone's congratulations to you bill, to both you and john.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, jack.
jack atkins -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
enjoyed working with you, bill, and john, looking forward to working with you in the future. so i guess if i could go back to kevin's question earlier, i thought it was a good point. just around sort of the cyclicality of the business today, bill, and i certainly understand and appreciate all the changes that you've driven with this company over the last decade.
but i'm just going back and looking. 2q eps, this was the lowest 2q eps since '08. as you think about how the business is constructed today versus a decade ago, how do you think about the cyclicality of the business today? was this result just a function of a number of things sort of hitting you all at one time, or do you think the cyclicality has sort of lessened today versus a decade ago? i just would be curious to get your thoughts on that.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you, jack. well, i think we are a very different company than we were a decade ago, and i get your point about the comparison. but when we go back a decade ago, we were just beginning our first flights in express operations for dhl. we had a much smaller fleet. we were moving out of the last two 747-200s we had and we essentially had a fleet of 747-400s, and an order for 747-8s that hadn't arrived and took a couple of extra years to get here. so when we think about the company today, we've grown substantially with dhl. we have growth start-up operations for amazon. those are large numbers of aircraft placed into dedicated networks with network-type operations, not ad hoc, and certainly with different kinds of scheduled standards than we saw even in our acmi operations.
the acquisition of southern with the 777 fleet and the 777 operations allow us to basically offer all in any of our customers the right aircraft for the network and the array of services they want to buy from us and that they need for their business. so clearly, this was a disappointing quarter, and indeed it is. but the impact here, the volatility in this quarter, while spencer talked through the several contributing factors, starts with the market and the real precipitous decline that we saw in volumes, particularly in our charter market, which is an important part of our business. and then beyond volumes, yields took a fairly significant hit.
and it's certainly tranched back, but not just. there's been quite a bit of commentary out of germany recently about the impact it's had on german trade flows between asia and elsewhere. i think -- and scott might have mentioned there was potentially some impact of, in anticipation of tariffs, a lot of volume moved earlier on. and that may be a part of it. at least it is probably for some individual companies.
but i absolutely believe the model's transformed. we have the right book of customers, we have the diversification and the array of services that we provide them. the cmi business didn't exist in 2008, although it does now, and that's a nice asset-light growth, as spencer talked about. that gives us the ability to build scale and scope, and just get overall more productivity. and so our guidance reflects what we see now, but it also reflects what we've talked about with several of the other fellows out here on the call.
we anticipate there will be a peak, a more typical peak in terms of volume flows. and so the question is where do the yields actually fall out. and we'll learn more about that as we go through the year. as john dietrich pointed out just a moment ago, a big part of our fourth quarter cargo, or peak cargo, is the dedicated aircraft we put into the large integrators and fly for them. and those are prenegotiated operations that we provide them, and we have been for many, many years. and that really does help contribute and ease some of the volatility that we might experience in an open cargo market.
jack atkins -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. okay, thank you for that, bill. and then i guess just a couple of other questions elsewhere in the business. with regard to the labor issues in the quarter, my understanding was that you guys had an injunction against your union. so i guess i'm confused why these disruptions are still ongoing. can you talk with what's happening there, and if it's different than the disruptive actions that you've seen in the past and sort of what you can do there?
then secondly, bill, just on the labor front. your comments around working toward a fair and competitive deal for your pilots, that seemed to be a little bit more optimistic, i guess just in tone around the potential to maybe get a deal done sooner rather than later. so if you could just sort of touch on how you're thinking now about timing with regard to getting your new pilot contract in place.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
well, let me since you addressed it, i'll take a -- and then john and i can, i think, address different parts. so we do have a preliminary injunction in place. we went to court in 2017 and we were able to demonstrate to the judge, to the court, that there was concerted behavior going on directed by union leadership that was causing disruption in the business, and we obtained an injunction against those disruptive behaviors.
that injunction was challenged and appealed by the union. it went to the court of appeals in d.c., and that court ruled back in -- just a few weeks ago that indeed the injunction was proper and upheld the injunction and the decision of the district court judge. that behavior has improved, but we're still seeing an -- we're seeing an increase in some disruptive behavior now, and we have notified the union informally about that disruptive behavior.
and i know there's some questions about, well, how should we think about that, and what's the impact of that? and the impact really is a cost impact, is we fly and serve our customers. but when we have disruptive behavior, it costs us more. it costs us more because we need to move crew around. we may have a late departure. any disruption, whether it's a weather disruption, could be a maintenance disruption, in this case a labor disruption, any disruption from schedule adds additional cost into the operation. and that's kind of how we're thinking about the impact of these disruptions. it affects service and it affects cost. john, you might talk about where we are in our discussions with pilots and how you see us moving forward into 2020.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
sure. and as bill has mentioned, we remain committed and focused to getting our next labor agreement as soon as reasonably possible. as many of you have seen, there have been some procedural disputes along the way in terms of what is the ultimate path forward, whether we're filing the merger provisions of our collective bargaining agreements or not. and that's been really the focus of some of the procedural disputes.
we are waiting on one last decision among those disputes. we've prevailed as a company in each of those up to this point. we expect to prevail in the last outstanding one. but nonetheless, we've continued to negotiate and be at the table. in fact, the team is together as we speak negotiating and making progress toward our next collective bargaining agreement.
in any bargaining, there's a reason they call it bargaining. it takes two to get to an agreement. so we are committed to moving quickly as possible. the union will have a say in that as well, and we have a number of things we're working on with them, continuing the dialogue and the communication. and we'll continue to have sessions, and we're hopeful and cautiously optimistic that to the extent we have any unresolved issues, they can be resolved through this merger process under the collective bargaining agreements, which is an important piece that we're looking to conclude, all the while focused on quality of life improvements for our crew members and a competitive total package for them so they can, as i said, build their careers here at atlas as we go into the future.
i mean, we have a tremendous value proposition for our pilots, given the strong and diverse fleet we have, the operation that we have that's truly global, a great customer base. and we think that's a very attractive proposition for them. we just need to get to our next agreement in working together with the union.
jack atkins -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay, that's helpful color. and then last one from me. really just goes to the amc pax flying. you talked about improved flying in the second half of the year, both year-over-year and sequentially. but could you maybe speak to what caught you by surprise in the second quarter specifically? was it sort of just an unexpected reduction in military flying more broadly, or did you have a plane out of service? i'm just trying to understand sort of what was happening there.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
i'll comment on that, jack. this is john dietrich. it was mostly just a softening in the demand for that period of time. we expect that it'll resume to the levels that bill talked about, which will be an increase, both over first half and certainly over the first half of last year. and we have more capability, as bill mentioned. there was a couple more airplanes, one that was out of service last year, but an additional one that we've added this year.
jack atkins -- stephens, inc. -- analyst
okay. thank you so much for the time, guys. appreciate it.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, jack.
operator
your next question comes from the line of david ross with stifel.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
yes. good morning, gentlemen.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
good morning, david.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
i just want to go to the charter segment to ask a little bit more about how the breakdown occurred, if you will, when you drew a line in the sand around the may 19 tariff issue, precipitating a lot of the decline. the utilization in the cargo charter was down 22%, 23% year-over-year. how did that trend through the quarter in terms of april, may, june? was it down 5% or 10% and then it ended at about 30%?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think -- david, it's spencer. it really started to impact more as the quarter progressed, and so if you look at the beginning of the year, i know you're asking about the quarter, but if you go back to the beginning of the year, the first couple of months were very strong. things started to change a little bit, but then yields started to really get impacted, as bill said, second half of may, and then certainly june and into july.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
yeah. and then, i guess, any comment on the trend you've seen through july? if the yields, say, were flattest to start off the second quarter and then they ended up down 10% to 15%, is that still the trend you're seeing in the air cargo side of things?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, the yields, as i said, in the beginning of the year yields were much stronger. but then, really beginning in april and then much stronger in may, yields have been much lower than the prior year. we do expect a pickup in yield, but not like we saw in the previous years. and when you think about --
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
and --
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. go ahead.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
david, i'm just going to make the point that we've made a couple times already. when we think about fourth quarter yields, in commercial, certainly a big part of that is the confirmed placements we have with the integrators, rates that we negotiate with them that are independent of the market, which we've done every year.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
that makes sense. on the labor side, you talked, bill, about the cost impact of those issues and mentioned there's a service impact. how severe has the service impact been? and is that something that's, i guess, stunted growth in any way or prevented any new contracts?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
so it's john, david. the impact, by virtue of the fact that we're talking about it, tells you it rises to the level that it has caused customer impact. and in terms of what we're doing about it, we're continuing to work with our customers. we're flying the hours, as you can see. we're maintaining the hours, but they have been disruptive hours. and as bill mentioned, when you have disruption, it creates additional disruption, and it has kind of a ripple effect. we're continuing to work closely with them to adjust, and we look forward to continuing improvement as we go into the future here.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
thanks. and spencer, just real quick. what's the current average age of your fleet? and i know it varies by plane type, etc. and how do you expect that to trend going into next year?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. we're in a pretty fortunate position there, dave. our fleet is relatively young from a -- if you look at it compared to others. on average, our fleet is about 18, 19 years old. and for freighters, that is pretty young. we flew our 747-200s, they were well into their 30s. so we have no imminent refleeting needs or anything like that. of course, our -8s are only six or seven years old. they're really young. we have 777s that are about the same, six or seven years old. and overall, our fleet is about 18, 19 years old, which is great from a -- for freighters.
yeah, i was just going to add, the 767 fleet that we've built up, we're purposely -- we're acquiring them at 15, 16, 17 years, and then running them through conversion from pax to freighter. and while the manufacturing year still is 15 or 16, all the work that's done on those aircraft in conversion, they really have many, many years of flying left.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of howard rosencrans from virginia.
howard rosencrans -- value advisory services -- analyst
hi, guys. thank you for taking the call. i just wanted to do a quick recap to understand the factors, and you mentioned them earlier, the various severity in the quarter, and in which areas you see improving. i guess, it's more so weighted to the fourth quarter, but that's going to be because of the integrator mix. but i guess i just wanted a slight recap on exactly where you saw the negativity that so dramatically impacted the quarter. thank you.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. howard, it's spencer. i think -- so your question was -- in the beginning of your question, it seemed like you were asking about the fourth quarter, but then it seemed like you ended with a question about the second quarter. so with regard to the second quarter, you were asking about what are the biggest things that drove the quarter and the results being below our previous expectations. so the largest impact was due to the tariffs and trade tensions, which had a big impact on yields. and that revenue then goes right to the bottom line, followed by higher heavy maintenance costs during the quarter.
and then we had lower military cargo and passenger flying. we had an increase in crew costs for our southern pilots following the interim letter of agreement that we put in place with them last september. there were some start-up costs related to new customer flying, the labor disruptions that we've talked about. and then the prior year -- the second quarter of last year, had a big benefit from a refund that we received, a rent that was paid in previous years. so those are the issues surrounding the second quarter.
and then i think part of your question was also asking about the fourth quarter. and we expect heavy maintenance to be much lower in the second half of the year, and so that will really help especially in the fourth quarter. we expect that the flying that we do for integrators, and then the charter flying that we do in the fourth quarter usually has the highest yields in the commercial segment. and so we expect to benefit from that as well.
and then, of course, if there's any positive -- if there are any positive developments with regard to the us and china trade tensions, that would really -- and if the positive developments there had then a nice positive impact on goods moving, that would have a tremendous benefit for our company.
howard rosencrans -- value advisory services -- analyst
okay. i really just was trying to get the order of severity, and you had -- because you had given that in part before. so in terms of order of severity, it was tariffs, trade tensions, followed which a higher heavy maintenance. and the higher heavy maintenance is really just transitory, as in the second half that will improve pretty dramatically. the military cargo -- the third thing that was the negative in the quarter was the military cargo and passenger, and i just want to get a little more clarity on that. that sounds like just a lumpy quarter thing on both the cargo and the passenger. i want to get clarity. so that's the third biggest point, so i just want to get clarity on that. thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
thank you. howard, it's john dietrich. i think your characterization is fair with regard to the military.
howard rosencrans -- value advisory services -- analyst
okay. and then the crew is sort of the fourth, and then the fifth item, which is start-up for new customer, so we're not talking about incremental amazon in there? because they're not a new customer. there's no incremental amazon in there? i just want to be clear on that.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
so the start-up costs are related to new flying. so the 747s for amazon, that is new flying. and as i mentioned earlier, it was the 737-800s is a new aircraft type for atlas. we don't have scale in that aircraft type. and so we had to bring in pilots, we had to train those pilots. we had some unusual costs related to that training and to try to get that done in the timeframe that amazon wanted. so those start-up costs were a bit higher than normal. we also had some start-up costs related to the 777 flying for dhl.
and then the other item, i just want to make sure, it was somewhat large on a quarter-over-quarter basis, is the rent refund that we received in the second quarter of last year. since you were asking about magnitude, that was about $8.6 million, or about just under $7 million on a net income basis.
howard rosencrans -- value advisory services -- analyst
okay. i was a little confused about the start-up for new customer. it's the same customer, it's just -- well, in that it's largely amazon. it's just the new equipment. okay, that cleared it up. that was very helpful. and then the last factor, and i was trying to get them in terms of severity, the least significant factor in the mix was the labor disruption. am i correct in understanding that, up to six items you referenced?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. the labor impacts several other areas, and so it impacts penalties that we might have to pay, it impacts not receiving bonuses that we otherwise might have received, it impacts hours that we may or may not have flown as a result of cancellations or delays. so it has impacts in different areas. and so that's why we've listed that one at the end.
howard rosencrans -- value advisory services -- analyst
yes. but in terms of magnitude is really my question. the other factors, tariffs, trade tensions, heavy maintenance, lower military cargo and passenger, increase in crew costs for southern with their new contract, start-up for new customer. i just want to get it in terms of the magnitude of severity. so the labor disruption was the least in the mix. is that fair to say?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i think the labor disruption is all part of it, and we want to be careful. we're in the midst, as john said. there are people at the bargaining table right now. certainly don't want to get into our labor issues too much during this call, but the labor disruptions were certainly one of the top handful of factors this quarter.
howard rosencrans -- value advisory services -- analyst
okay, great. thank you so much for the color.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, howard.

at this point, i'd like to draw your attention to slide 3 and turn the call over to bill flynn.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, ed, and good morning, everyone. i'm pleased to welcome john dietrich, our president and chief operating officer, to this call. and as we announced in early july, john will succeed me as chief executive officer of atlas air worldwide on january 1. at that time, i will become chairman of the board and retire from my day-to-day role at the company. bob agnew, our current chairman of the board, will become our board's lead independent director.
one of the board's greatest responsibilities is to implement a thoughtful succession plan to ensure our company continues to grow and thrive, and john is the next person to serve as the next ceo of atlas. he has been our chief operating officer for many years, and we work closely together. most of you know john already through business interactions, our investor analyst days or non-deal road shows. for others getting to know him, john has over 30 years of experience in the aviation and air cargo industries, including 13 years with united airlines, and more than 20 years with our company, the last 13 as chief operating officer.
he has an unparalleled commitment to our company, our customers and our employees. he's played a key role in driving our success. and john has the visionary leadership and solid expertise to usher in a new era of growth. i'd like to invite john to say a few words now.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, bill, and hello, everyone. i'm honored to have been selected as bill's successor. it has been great working for and with bill and the entire atlas team over these many years, and i look forward to continuing to build on the strong foundation we have built for our great company.
we have an amazing team of professionals, including our crew, ground staff and management team that has accomplished so much together. we also have a powerful portfolio of assets and service offerings that are second to none in the industry and among our competition. i look forward to continuing to work with the team to leverage our market position and drive future growth opportunities to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders.
equally important, i'm excited to be working with our employees to provide a rewarding work environment filled with opportunities to help them grow their careers here at atlas. i also look forward to spending more time with our investors and analysts as we progress into the future. i'm really grateful and excited for this opportunity.
and with that, bill, i'll turn it back over to you.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, john. i value his partnership in driving our company forward, and i have great confidence in his leadership. it's been my honor to lead this company as ceo for the past 13 years, and i'm excited to continue to work with john, my fellow board members and our outstanding senior leadership team and employees as we execute our strategic growth agenda to create long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders.
turning to slide 4 and our results. second quarter cargo volumes and yields took a dramatic turn due to the widely reported impact of tariffs and trade tensions across the global aviation industry. in addition to these factors, our results during the period were impacted by labor-related service disruptions. we're managing through these near-term headwinds and are maintaining our focus on longer-term growth strategies and growth drivers. our actions include ongoing continuous improvement initiatives to increase productivity, enhance efficiency and grow our business.
additionally, we remain committed to negotiating a competitive collective bargaining agreement for our pilots. our recent bargaining sessions have made progress, and we look forward to the scheduled upcoming sessions to continue progress toward an agreement that all parties want.
despite the current trade tensions and resulting impacts on global air freight, we have the right building blocks for the future, which include our world-class team of employees; our modern, efficient aircraft and diversified services that customers want; our focus on express e-commerce in fast growing markets; the scale and scope of our enterprise; and our leadership position in global aviation outsourcing.
we've driven growth in our earnings over time, which has consistently driven higher book value. while the combination of tariffs, trade tension and labor disruption has affected our results and current outlook, this is not the first time we've encountered an adverse environment and a market discount to our book value. when this has happened in the past, we have always managed through it while the market has adjusted and we consistently added value.
moving to slide 5. we added six customer provided cargo aircraft to our asset-light cmi operations during the second quarter. these included three 737s for amazon, two 777s for dhl and an additional 747 for nippon cargo airlines. we look forward to the contributions that operating these aircraft will add.
turning to our financial results. our second quarter adjusted earnings reflected a softening and anticipated commercial cargo block hours and yields in our charter segment as manufacturers and shippers took a wait-and-see approach regarding tariffs and trade issues during the quarter.
in military charter, cargo hours were in line with our expectations for the quarter and were up from the first quarter, as we anticipated they would be. but military passenger demand was less than expected.
slide 6 highlights our current framework for 2019. tariffs and related trade disputes are uncommon occurrences, but our guidance reflects the magnitude of the current situation. we also recognize that the trade issues between china and the united states in particular could be addressed in part or whole at any time. and if that happens, we could see a meaningful improvement in air freight dynamics within a relatively short period of time and in our outlook as well.
based on current conditions and expectations, we expect to fly approximately 330,000 block hours in 2019, with about 75% of the hours in acmi and the balance in charter. we also anticipate revenue of approximately $2.9 billion, adjusted ebitda of approximately $520 million and adjusted net income of about 80% of our 2018 adjusted net income. in addition, maintenance expense for the year is expected to total approximately $395 million with appreciation and amortization of about $260 million, and court capital expenditures of about $140 million, which is mainly for parts and components for our fleet.
looking at the third quarter, we anticipate that our adjusted net income will represent a mid to upper teen percentage of our full year results. we expect to fly approximately 85,000 block hours in the quarter, with revenue of more than $700 million and adjusted ebitda of about $125 million.
this is a good point for spencer to provide some additional detail about our second quarter results. after spencer's remarks, i'll add a few additional comments, and then john, spencer and i will be happy to take your questions. spencer?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, bill, and hello, everyone.
our second quarter earnings are summarized on slide 7. on an adjusted basis, ebitda totaled $86.4 million, and income from continuing operations net of taxes was $4.5 million. on a reported basis, net income was $86.9 million, which included $59.8 million of tax benefits related to the favorable completion of an irs examination of our 2015 tax return as well as a non-cash unrealized gain of $42.3 million on outstanding warrants. due mainly to the favorable completion of the irs exam, both our adjusted and reported earnings in the second quarter included an income tax benefit. as a result, we expect our adjusted income tax rate for the full year of 2019 to be approximately 16%.
looking at slide 8, higher acmi segment revenue in the second quarter was mainly due to an increase in 767 and 737 flying, the start-up of 747-400 flying for new customers and incremental 777 flying, partially offset by a decrease in average rate per block hour mostly related to the growth in smaller-gauge 767 and 737 cmi flying.
lower charter segment revenue during the period was primarily driven by lower flying and a decrease in the average rate per block hour, as bill noted, and higher dry leasing segment revenue primarily related to the placement of additional aircraft partially offset by the scheduled return of a 777 aircraft in march that is awaiting placement with a customer, which we expect in the fourth quarter.
moving to slide 9. segment contribution totaled $65.8 million in the second quarter. acmi earnings primarily reflected increases in 767 and 777 cmi flying. these were offset by higher crew costs, including enhanced wages and work rules resulting from the interim agreement with our southern air pilots, additional heavy maintenance expense and increased amortization of deferred maintenance costs. in addition, acmi segment contribution was impacted by start-up costs for customer growth initiatives as well as the labor-related service disruptions that bill noted.
lower charter segment contribution during the period was driven by the decrease in commercial cargo yields and volumes related to the impact of tariffs and global trade tensions, a decrease in military cargo and passenger flying and additional heavy maintenance expense. charter results were also affected by labor-related service disruptions. in dry leasing, lower segment contribution during the quarter was primarily due to the scheduled return of the 777 freighter in march, partially offset by the placement of additional aircraft.
turning to slide 10, we have grown our fleet to take advantage of great opportunities. we do not have any firm aircraft purchase commitments for the remainder of the year, and we expect our operating fleet growth to be in our asset-light cmi business. as a result, for the first time since 2015, we expect our full year free cash flow in 2019 to exceed our flight equipment expenditures.
we remain committed to paying down debt and reducing our net leverage ratio. even as we lowered our overall debt outstanding, our net leverage ratio ticked upward in the second quarter as a result of softer-than-expected earnings and its impact on trailing 12 months ebitda. we expect to see gradual improvement going forward as we benefit from increased ebitda levels and as we continue to lower debt levels by maintaining debt repayments of approximately $70 million per quarter.
now i'd like to turn it back to bill.
william j. flynn -- chief executive officer
moving to slide 11, results in the second quarter were affected by the widely reported impact of tariffs and trade tensions on current cargo volumes across the global aviation industry. we also saw an impact from labor-related service disruptions. despite trade tensions and the resulting impacts on global air freight, we have the right building blocks for the future. additionally, we're committed to negotiating a competitive labor contract for our pilots. we're well positioned to manage through current headwinds, and we're maintaining our focus on our longer-term strategies and growth drivers.
catherine, may we have the first question, please?
",2019-Q2,AAWW
-0.9493,0.9986,,1.0,":
operator
of course. your first question comes from bob labick of cjs securities.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question.
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi bob.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
morning.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
hi. i wanted to start -- wanted to try to ask this is a hypothetical question versus the company's specific and hopefully we can talk about it in this regard. when a plane is reassigned mid-contract what has to happen for that to occur and we saw some news articles stating that has happened in the past quarter. so whatever did happen has it stopped? or can you just talk around what generally happens for that event to occur?
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
well bob are you talking about the process of actually transferring an aircraft if --
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
i'm talking about. yes. if you had a cmi contract with a certain customer and it was assigned -- and it was reassigned to another carrier.
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, there is a -- the aircraft -- an aircraft has to come off of carrier a's operating's specifications and go onto carrier b's operating specification. so there is a transfer of records and information there's also what's called a conformance check where a certain maintenance activities need to be performed on the air before the aircraft transfers to the other carrier's operation and conforms to the maintenance program at that other operating certificate.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. i'm just trying to get at what would cause it to go off of carrier a? what would have happened for that to change in the middle of a contract? what could happen?
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, that's a customer decision. and customers look at a variety of factors when they consider to make a decision to move an asset from one operator to another. and so it really depends on a number of factors but certainly on the customer's assessment of what's going to best suit their network and meet their customer needs. so being more specific over the years we've had aircraft come to us from other operators and we would operate on cmi. that's not unusual. we've done that several times that i can think of. in the specific incident that i think you're referring to it's important to point out that the dry lease -- long term dry lease contracts that we have in place on the assets that have moved off of our off-spec remain in place for the term.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it ok. thank you. and then one kind of i guess longer term question. obviously, you've talked about the acmi. direct contribution margins have been impacted by trade and tariff and then labor disruptions. historically they have been in the mid to low 20% range. we've talked about on prior calls there has been some changes over the last few years with incremental pass-through expenses which modestly impact margins. so my question is once we get past the labor and the trade and tariff once all that normalizes what's the appropriate range for direct contribution for acmi margins on an annual basis?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
bob, it's spencer. you have that right. the increase in the smaller gauge 737 and 767 flying, as well as the increase in reimbursed cost to customers, has really had quite an impact. the increase in cmi block hours that's had a big impact. if you back out the smaller gauge aircraft and the reimbursed expenses the margin -- the acmi margin for the third quarter would have been obviously much higher and then the difference between the prior year and the current year would really be due to the impact of the tariffs and global trade tension impact as well as the labor-related service disruptions. so to answer your question if you assume all else being equal then you can look at a prior period as a good representative but we hope to continue to add cmi aircrafts. so it depends whether those aircraft are smaller gauge or larger gauge. and then based on that it could have an impact obviously on the margins. we generally make more flying a bigger plane across a big body of water than we do flying a smaller gauge domestically in the u.s.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. okay, that's very helpful. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from helane becker of cowen.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
thanks, operator. hi everybody. thanks for the time. i don't know if spencer if you can answer this but of the $80 million reduction in ebitda from the start of the year can you say how much is the pilot disruption?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
helane we really -- we're reluctant to negotiate with the union through an earnings call. and so i know that's not what you're asking us to do but we really don't want to do that too much during an earnings call. but the impact from both the labor disruptions as well as the impact from the global trade tensions and tariffs are by far the 2 biggest issues that have impacted us. if you look at the third quarter and i know you're asking about the full year. but if you look at the third quarter on its own versus our previous guidance it's more than -- the variance is more than made up by the labor disruptions and then the impact from the tariffs and trade tensions. those two things together make up more than the variance versus what we had expected for the quarter.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
okay. so if you had been able to reach an agreement with your pilots a year ago this time is there any way you can say how much with the difference between what you actually earned and what you would have earned is? i mean what i'm trying to figure out is how much of the decline is really trade-related because as you know and i know this came up on the last call you guys always said that you weren't as impacted by out of freight data and that's an e-commerce focused company. you shouldn't be as impacted by iata data going forward but yet you are by the china-u.s. trade dispute. i'm just trying to figure out how much is macro and how much is company-specific i guess. i don't know. is there any way to help with that?
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
so i think -- helane bill speaking. that's certainly the position that we described and we discussed. i think what's going on right now with iata trade data however or said another way with the market is something exceptional that we haven't seen in 10 years. i think iata commented something to the effect that revenues may be down 10% for the international air freight industry on a year-over-year basis. a third of that due to volume and two-thirds of that due to yield. so the impact here i think of a higher order of magnitude than we have typically seen and in markets where you have a couple of percentage points one versus the other. and just overall we're seeing that impact in air freight. so i get your point. we're really not going to provide a line between labor and market. spencer, i think described them accurately. those are the 2 big areas. that's really probably as much more as i could say without getting into a level of detail. we're not going to do.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
okay, that's fair. i'll let you off the hook on that one. can you say now -- just my follow-up question is now that we're here in late october beginning of november can you just say how the peak is shaping up? how are you thinking about the next 5 or 6 weeks in terms of the peak? i know you're doing a lot of flying for fedex and others. maybe you could just talk about that a little bit and then those are my questions. thank you.
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks. that's a great question. so you know the peak -- what we're generally -- we're all reading and hearing is that there is a peak certainly a peak for 2019 but it's not what the industry experienced in 2018 and 2017. we're seeing volumes and demands begin to exhibit those peak characteristics. in discussions with our marketing organization and charter teams, we're starting to see yields come up as we move into the peak. and you made an important point about express operations. so as we think about atlas's peak going forward there are a couple of components that are important to underscore. so we'll be fly a greater number of freighters dedicated to the u.s. express operators during this peak. those are at negotiated rates that reflect the kind of the value of providing supplemental lift for a short period of time during the peak.
and we've been doing this for many years and so we feel very good about that and glad that we're able to put several more units into that operation. i commented that the military passenger hours are going to be up on a year-over-year basis. that's an important component of our fourth quarter guide or framework shall i say. military cargo hours are in there as well. overall acmi flying will be up. and so our view of that remaining commercial charter market is what's reflected in the guidance framework -- the updated framework that we've provided here in the call a little while ago. so there are several components to our outlook on peak.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
great, thank you.

your next question comes from jack atkins of stephens.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
hey guys good morning. i appreciate you taking my questions. so i guess first bill congratulations on your retirement and john congratulations on your new role. but i guess stepping back for a second when we think about the company as it is today and i know there are definitely some puts and takes going on this year. bill your comment earlier that this is -- the airfreight is a growth industry. when i look at your results in 2019 the midpoint of your guidance range that would imply something from a net income level similar to what we saw in 2015 and we still have a reset to come on the labor front. so i'm trying to understand revenue is up significantly over the last 4 or 5 years. pre-tax income is flat and there is definitely some concern about potential risk going forward. what can you guys do to improve the cost structure of this business because it really seems like it's been under quite a bit of pressure and there perhaps is more to go?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
so, jack, it's john and thank you for your comments and congratulations. we're looking at every aspect of the business aggressively particularly in this environment. clearly where we're under some pressure. we're looking at every line item minimizing discretionary spending certainly controlling headcount. there is a lot of headway we can get tightening our relationships with our vendors that we rely on quite a bit for our high-cost items like heavy checks and engine overhauls. working with our customers for network efficiencies so that we ensure optimal scheduling so we get the best yield out of our resources both aircraft and crew. further leveraging technology wherever we can on things like crew scheduling just to make us more efficient. flight planning what are the routes we can fly that are the most efficient with the least amount of fuel burn spend. inventories which just really jack looking at the whole gamut of our cost structure. as well as if there are some routes that are not profitable or not as profitable potentially shedding some of those routes and redeploying those assets as elsewhere to more profitable flying. so we're looking at every aspect of it as we go forward here.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
okay got you, john. thank you for that color. i guess on the fourth quarter guidance when i think about sort of what your full year implies there is really not a big change to your fourth quarter outlook relative to 3 months ago. are you assuming that some of these trade issues abate and some of these labor issues abate because it seems like those would carry forward and be a headwind to the fourth quarter more so than what you're guiding to?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
right. that's the right question, jack. thank you. it's spencer. so in the fourth quarter, there are a number of positives that's offset by one big negative. so the positives are that we expect to receive a return of excess rent that we paid in previous years. we have much lower heavy maintenance expense in the fourth quarter of this year versus the fourth quarter of last year. we have higher military passenger volumes and we have higher nfl flying because we added an additional team this year. so those are all the positives for the fourth quarter. and then the big offset to your point is that charter yields we expect to be much lower than the prior year. and so when you offset the decline based on the charter yields with the positives that i mentioned they offset each other. and so our outlook for the fourth quarter is very similar to the fourth quarter of last year after all those puts and takes.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
okay, thank you, spencer. last question for bill or for john. but i guess as you are looking out at the global airfreight market are you seeing anything in terms of leading indicators that will lead you to believe that maybe things are stabilizing or you starting to see some green shoots out there? i know it's been a tough year but just curious if you're seeing anything that would give you some more confidence as we head into 2020?
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
so there is as you point out jack there is a fair amount of uncertainty out there. when we look just across different markets south america as you know is important to us. and in spite of the disruption that we saw in chile recently and some of the similar activity in ecuador that markets holding fairly strong for us. we reference military a couple of times here today. it's 12.5% of our business. we expect very stable military volumes in this fiscal year and trailing into the next fiscal year trailing or leading into the next fiscal year as leadership -- military leadership has told us and the other carriers that operate for them. what we do is essential to many of our customers and we're integrated into their core operating networks. airfreight itself is essential. yet another big question is what does -- do we get a phase 1 agreement with china and when do we get that and what does that lead to? we're looking for some uptick really at this point absent any other a better information kind of continuing situation as we move into 2020 with some improvements as we get into the second half of the year but we've really all of us here and all of you on the call we really need to sharpen our focus on what the second half of next year looks like.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
okay, thank you again for the time.
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer

your next question comes from scott group of wolfe research.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning guys. so, spencer, can you tell us how much is this refund -- customer refund in the fourth quarter? and then just directionally do you think maintenance cost is higher or lower in 2020 versus 2019?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so with regard to the quantification for the fourth quarter, i tried to give that in the response to jack's question. we have a number of significant positives in the fourth quarter that are offset by a significant negative. so we're not going to quantify each particular item. although heavy maintenance we do provide the detail on that. so you have that -- our estimate of what that would be is in our slide deck and you can certainly compare that to the prior year. so you have that and then the other items are offset or an offset to charter yields. and then -- sorry scott your question about maintenance was 2018 versus 2019 or was it 2019 versus 2020?
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
i had to think about it for 2020.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so for 2020 as john said we will certainly talk about that during our next earnings call. we are in the process now of trying to determine what exactly that will be. and as john talked about we are going through a really appropriate process of trying to ensure that we have the cost that we need and we eliminate those costs that we do not need.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. i think the military business sort of resets each year in fourth quarter so can you just give us an update on the share. and then i've heard a lot about passenger today but should we think about -- how should we think about cargo military going forward? growing? shrinking? any help there?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
sure. scott, it's john. in terms of entitlement, our share of the business is somewhere in the neighborhood of about 53% to 54%. it's right in between there. we'll continue to enjoy that through 2020. in terms of the demand, i think bill said it well. we expect it to be steady and stable both on passenger and cargo and that's consistent with what we're hearing from the military as well.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then just last question if i can. so tough airfreight environment we know where are customer -- this is an acmi question. where are customers flying relative to block hour minimums? and as you look out to next year do you think it's more likely that we grow our acmi fleet or shrink our acmi fleet? and then maybe with that just is next year normal heavy or light year from our contract placement standpoint?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. three parts to that one. so the first part is flying above or below minimum guarantees. our acmi customers during the third quarter flew just a little over 10% above their minimums. so on one hand that's good. on the other hand, they flew about 18% above in the third quarter of last year. so for the first 3 quarters of this year customers have been flying below -- well sorry not in the first quarter. the first quarter of this year was stronger than the first quarter of last year from that perspective. the second quarter was pretty similar. the third quarter of this year was much much below. so for the full year customers typically fly somewhere 5% to 7% above. this year we expect it will be above that but below 2018 levels. and then another part of your question was next year do we expect to have more or fewer aircraft operating in acmi? today we have 75 aircraft in acmi. you asked -- another part of your question was how many contracts are up for renewal? we always have a handful or so that are up for renewal at any given time. we try to kind of space them out so we don't have too many coming due at any one time. and so that is fairly normal. with regard to next year, we have to see how it all plays out. we are as john pointed out looking to make some changes and ensure that we're earning the highest returns that we can but we also continue to focus on growing our cmi business which we have been doing.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay, thank you guys.

next question comes from kevin sterling of seaport global securities.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning gentlemen. hey john, you talked to kind of follow up on scott's question a little bit about the military. obviously, the passenger flying was better than expected this quarter. if i'm not mistaken when at last quarter it lagged a little bit to what we saw this quarter. is that some carryover from last quarter or is it just strong and like you said it's going to be strong heading into 2020?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
so you're right it is stronger than last quarter. a little bit of it maybe carry over but mostly what we're seeing is stabilizing the demand and we expect that in the weeks and months to come.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay, thanks. my last question here. instead of looking back on the labor disruptions and things if we can maybe look forward if you don't mind. the last time peak season was just compressed like we're going to see in 2019 was 2013. as you know thanksgiving is late this year. essentially got a three-week period between thanksgiving and christmas whereas compressed. so service levels and domestic airfreight is going to be relied upon. in 2013 we had weather and obviously, ups and fedex got overwhelmed and that's when -- after that amazon decided to develop their own air network. and so they need you guys this time around. amazon has broken up with fedex. ups is obviously filled with their own e-commerce growth.
so looking forward to the peak season this year what are some of the things you're doing on the labor front to ensure that labor disruptions are mitigated because it seems like the past couple of quarters we've had those? and your pilots they work hard they're very very good people and they're lifeblood of your organization and kind of lockstep. what are some of the things that you're doing to ensure i think a smooth peak season given that it's going to be challenging because it is so compressed? does that question make sense kind of maybe looking forward to some of the positives and things that can be done to mitigate any disruptions?
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, that's a great question kevin and there's 2 parts to it. so let me just talk about the market and then john will talk about what we're doing with our -- what we're doing within the organization and to ensure we meet our customers' expectations. thanksgiving is late. there is no doubt about it but that doesn't mean that the flying that supports the express operations in e-commerce for christmas waits until the 28th of november or whenever it is this year. and so what we've seen on a year-over-year basis is more capacity moving into express holiday season flying earlier and in what we've seen on a year-over-year basis is more capacity moving into express holiday season flying earlier and in advance of thanksgiving and then because of the nature of e-commerce flying that continues after christmas eve and even into january because of returns and exchanges. just from the overall market the nature of that market is changing as well. and it's not so compressed into the black friday to christmas eve that that we would have observed even 10 years ago. so it's a broader window. and as i mentioned earlier we have more assets this year flying for those express operators. john?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
sure. and you're absolutely right our crew members are the lifeblood of the organization. they're a great group of professionals and we look forward to continuing to provide them with a career environment where they can continue to grow their careers here at atlas. a number of things we're doing as i mentioned in my comments we are meeting regularly with the union as you may have seen from our queue the atlas pilot group has created a new local so that they now have their own local. we've been in direct contact with the new local leadership. i believe there is a genuine interest on the new local's part to continue to make progress. we've continued to meet at the table with the spirit of progress there are some things we do need, however. there is a comprehensive economic proposal that we've been waiting for from the union which is important for us to assess the cost of the total deal.
so that will be an important piece. we've also have behind us now a lot of i won't say it's completely done but most of the dispute resolution processes to determine whether or not the merger provisions of our collective bargaining agreement apply and is as you're aware we were successful in both of those for both the atlas and southern groups where the arbitrators concluded that the merger provisions which provide for an orderly process to get to our next deal that those provisions apply. so we stayed true to that approach to follow the contract while concurrently meeting and trying to make further progress. operationally there is also a number of things that we're doing in terms of having more crew availability out in the network to protect our peak season.
by design, we try and have our crew members take as much vacation time as they can in the first half of the year do as much training as we can in the first half of the year so that they're available to our customers during the important peak season. there are some qualified training instructors as well that we release into the field to provide some added buffer. and then importantly it's a shared responsibility and not only do we rely on our crew members. but here back at headquarters for our control center making sure that we do the basic blocking and tackling that there is transportation ready for the crew members. the hotels are reservations are there to make sure the schedules are in line with not being fatiguing for example. we work closely with the union on our bid schedules. so all those things go into being best positioned to deliver the best quality for our customers in the peak.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
okay, john. thank you, bill. thank you. best of luck to you and i appreciate your time this morning.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer

your next question comes from seldon clarke of deutsche bank.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, thanks for the question. it looks like you removed the slide in your quarterly presentation about the relationship between atlas's book value and market cap and just given everything that's happened this year with the labor situation general weakness in airfreight military lumpiness and the cmi business moving away or the acmi moving away. do you see any risk that you might have to take impairment on any of your aircraft at some point?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, seldon, it's spencer. that's something that we look at with regard to the accounting rules and when there are triggers that happen and then we take a look at the expected cash flows from particular aircraft types and we compare that with our book value. so that's something we look at all the time and this quarter we impaired two 737-400 training aircrafts so that happened during the third quarter. and then if there is other impairment that may or may not happen we would look at that in the future. thus far when we compare our cash flows and you do that on an undiscounted basis first as the first step from the accounting standpoint. when we look at our cash flows compared to book value that has not been an issue. if however, those cash flows are then under book value then you perform calculation using the discounted cash flows and then record any necessary impairment. so we will continue to look at that as we always do and if there is then we would record that in the future. but thus far we have not needed to do that.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. is there a sense of where you are in terms of breakeven with those cash flows? i mean is there a precedent for how long if we see another year of weakness like this how much buffer do you have right now?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's a calculation that we look at all the time and it depends on every particular aircraft type. in the past, it has not been issue we look at it and we will see.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. i appreciate it. and then just on free cash flow. where do you guys expect that to shakeout this year? given what's happened with the stock price recently have you considered any changes to your capital allocation strategy?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. by the way, we took that slide out because we just felt that we made the point last quarter but at the same situation is still applies. we didn't take it out for any other reason. with regard to free cash flows. we expect free cash flows in the fourth quarter to be stronger than they were in the fourth quarter of last year. again for the reasons that i talked about before we have some positives that are offset by lower yields. but all in all, we have very similar earnings in the fourth quarter of this year versus the fourth quarter of last year and cash flows we think will be a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter. with regard to capital allocation. nothing has really changed there. it's something the board looks at on a regular basis and considers. our capital allocation strategy remains pretty disciplined and balanced. we're focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet investing in aircraft when it's appropriate and we have customer demand and we're focused on trying to lower our net leverage ratio and continue to be focused in that regard. we bought back over 10% of the company a few years ago. we have not done that since because we were really ramping up for amazon and we have the southern acquisition and so we did not do that. it's something that the board considers. and i'm sure they will continue to consider that. but right now that's what our focus has been on.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay got it. and then just last one from me. was that refund of aircraft rent in your guidance previously or is this a new development?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
no, it has been in there. it's not new. so it's been in there and we always expected that it would be in the fourth quarter. and we had in the past too we had about $12.4 million if memory serves last year 2018.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. i appreciate it thanks.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

your next question comes from david ross of stifel.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
yes, good morning gentlemen. first question is just on labor timing. i assume you got the merged seniority rosters recently and i know you're still waiting on the comprehensive economic proposal but what are the provisions for the orderly process? and is the clock started once you've got the seniority rosters and when does a clock end?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
sure. so, david, i'll say that we do not yet have the integrated seniority list. that is another item that we're waiting on and that receipt of the seniority list is what starts to clock ticking on a period of nine months of bargaining after which any unresolved issues would go to prompt arbitration binding arbitration. so that's what the contract provides. frankly, the union failed to meet the deadlines that the arbitrators laid out. in tendering the seniority list in lieu of that they had filed a motion to vacate the respective arbitration awards and where we in-turn filed motions to dismiss those which we have a degree of confidence we're going to be successful on. but it's one of the things we filed a recent action on last week frankly as to compel production of the seniority list now that the arbitrators in both cases have ordered that that be done. so once we have that seniority list then the contract requires that nine months. i'll just add one additional bit of color because as we've reported we've made a lot of progress already. and many of the sections of the joint collective bargaining agreement are agreed what they call tas-tentative agreements. one of the things that we've agreed with the union on is that once those tas are reached we will not revisit those and those are done whether we go to arbitration on the back end of this or not those are done. what that says is there is opportunity for the parties to not necessarily need that full nine months if we can accelerate the process. we are willing to consider that but right now we are still in dispute on the tendering the seniority list and that's our next order of business.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
and is the comprehensive economic proposal separate from the seniority lists or is that part of the same submission?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
it is separate and it's a part of bargaining as i mentioned a lot of what we've achieved up to this point i will describe as non-economic more administrative matters in the cba. we're at the point now where the remaining open sections each of them have economic consequences. we've been urging the union to tender us a proposal because as we sit here today we have not received a comprehensive economic proposal. you can't really get to the total deal because without that it's difficult to agree to sections that have economic implications if you don't know what the total ask is so we have repeatedly asked for that and continue to wait for it.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
and then spencer on the core capex you said it's going to be about $140 million this year. any reason for that to change next year?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, dave. we have invested a lot in parts inventory for the 744 that were leased in 2018 as well as the amazon 767 737s and just general fleet requirements. since we have no remaining aircraft purchase commitments core capex should go down in 2020 due to all the parts that we've added in recent years.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
and then just a follow up on one of the last questions regarding a share buyback. is there a current buyback authorization in place or would you have to go to the board to get approval for one?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we still have remaining about i think it's $25 million and then anything above that would need to go to the board.

william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you. transitioning david.
david campbell -- davis & co -- analyst
well, the disruptions that you mentioned a lot of that today labor disruptions any impact on results in the third quarter? did those disruptions caused revenue losses or they made primarily an expense costs increased expenses? or it was a combination of both or just one of them?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, david, it's spencer. it's really a combination. we've had penalties that we had to pay to customers when normally we enjoy bonuses and that obviously had an impact. we had certain canceled missions few but certain cancel admissions we had certain passenger displacement costs and then we had higher crew costs for various things. but generally higher crew travel and higher crew costs and higher crew training and things like that. so yes they all had an impact on the bottom line.
david campbell -- davis & co -- analyst
well in terms of lost revenue was it actually some business that you lost?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the payments that we make to customers for -- if we fall below certain service level agreement on time reliability metrics if we fall below those we make a payment back to the customer that is a sort of contract revenue. so yes that does reduce revenue and there were a few canceled missions canceled flights or flights that weren't awarded that were going to be. and so those impacted revenue as well.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
david, it's john. i think it's fair to say as spencer said in both categories there was some opportunity cost there as well.
david campbell -- davis & co -- analyst
well do you expect is not built into your fourth quarter estimates will you have any of this in the fourth quarter?
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
our fourth quarter estimates the framework that we provided today reflect the business as we see it today. the market that we've talked quite a bit about the several components of that revenue which is commercial charter the acmi the military charter pax and cargo that we've operated and then the operating costs or the level of operating costs that we're experiencing today which would include those disruption cost. or some of those disruption costs.
david campbell -- davis & co -- analyst
hopefully, the contracts get signed and delivered you won't have that disruption next year that's a headwind you won't have next year. right?
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
so what john said earlier in his comments is that we are focused on resolving the dispute and getting to a new joint collective bargaining agreement with our pilots an agreement that recognizes the essential contribution they make to the company and they make to our customers. and that's clearly what we're focused on and we look forward to making progress.
david campbell -- davis & co -- analyst
right well, it's certainly nothing you needed to have on top of everything else because the assumptions you gave us for the fourth quarter are less than you had previously saw but reasonable given the downturn and yields. yields are the big problem cargo yields that's the biggest single problem. is that correct?
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, that's right.
yes. and iata put some analysis out on that as well. just generally about airfreight again is why when you think about our quarter yes we're certainly exposed to commercial charter yield in the fourth quarter. that's the strongest quarter but that is offset with the certainty we have around the express operations and the military.
david campbell -- davis & co -- analyst
right. okay, thank you very much.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
thank you david.

barry haimes -- sage asset management -- analyst
yes, thanks very much. two quick follow-ups. one is on the labor disruption issue has there been any improvement since you won the arbitration regarding that? and then my second question is you talked a little bit about capex for next year versus the 140 maybe coming down but the d&a 260 for this year as we go into next year would that number be similar or would there be much change in that number? thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
barry, it's john. i'll start on the labor piece and as i mentioned we've been focused on a number of areas for which to continue to improve the working environment for our pilots. i mentioned some of them that we can help control and the basic blocking and tackling for operational efficiency. and when we have had behaviors that we call into question we've informed the union of that it's important to remember that we do have a preliminary injunction in place for an illegal work slowdown that was entered back in 2017 and that remains in place. we take that court order very seriously and want to be sure the union does as well. so based on all those factors in direct communication with the union we have seen some improvement and we expect that to continue. all the while we are focused on making progress as i said it's important for our crew members and their families to know that we're moving forward here. so those are some of the things that we expect to continue to improve. we're focused on it and i believe the union is as well.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and then our comment, barry, on the depreciation amortization. so depreciation expense should be fairly steady amortization should increase as we have some deferred maintenance amortization. so those are the two big movers there.

howard rosencrans -- va -- analyst
yes hi, guys. thank you for taking the question. following on a couple of the prior questions regarding the book value and i guess really just taking a longer-term perspective as investors were first and foremost focused on making money on the stock. i don't mean to overstate the obvious i've been doing this for 30-35 years but that hasn't been a successful venture. is it because of a continuity in the conversations with labor that you are reticent about bringing on outsiders i mean were the promotions that you're making are of the people who have been in place in a non-successful investment? for this is not transitory this is something that has subsisted now for 12-15 years your entire tenure bill.
so you're now moving to chairman of the board what is the reticence with making moves to really assess what's going on and to give the analytical community and investors, in general, a better understanding of how things will develop in the future and whether or not there are prospects for a meaningful improvement? i could say profitability but again at the end of the day its share price. the only resonating factor to us the shareholders is the -- that will take away that sort of amplifies our hurt is the compensation to management which runs significantly north of -- into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
so let me take that howard a just a couple of points. so i too am a fairly substantial shareholder of the company and i absolutely understand what when shares don't perform and price doesn't appreciate what that means. in terms of our management team and choices, we're making now relative to succession if you allow me to look at some of the recent senior management team choices and decisions we've made we certainly have brought people in from outside the organization as well as promoted people within and we look for that balance. and when we do that each time i won't talk about each individual choice here or selection here but this is a technical industry. we are an operating company.
we fly complex aircraft operating time-definite networks on a global scale with everything else that goes along with that operation. from flight ops, tech ops network ops regulatory compliance focused on safety and security operating at over 100 countries performing key core services for our customers. and so when we build out that management team it's a balance of promoting folks with the expertise that know how to do it and how to run the business and comply with bringing in new talent and perspective. and so we brought in senior executives including retail from ge from pepsi and other companies rather than naming each person. so i think we have a very good mix of talent new talent and promoted talent within and that's the balance that we seek.
howard rosencrans -- va -- analyst
so is there an issue with -- so is this management team imperative to resolving the labor issues? is the continuity of the management team imperative to resolving the labor of the senior management who is all staying in place and/or being promoted?
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
i believe that the continuity of the senior management is imperative for the company of which solving and resolving the labor -- the new labor contract is just a part of that.
howard rosencrans -- va -- analyst
okay. with all due respect, i'll have to agree to disagree. i'm certainly not belittling the challenges of running the aircraft and the company and the complexities thereof. but we will have to agree to disagree on the execution and success thereof you seem to be very confident that this team has done very well in that regard and i would say that the barometer is i would say that the evidence the barometer that is important to shareholders and/or the barometer that is important to labor because you're certainly not the only company that faces labor challenges i mean even somebody as complex in a much worse industry as gm has been able to successfully resolve labor issues more expeditiously. so i just beg to differ with your view and i hope there will be changes for the positive. thank you for your time and i appreciate your courtesy.
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. well, howard thank you. and i'm pretty sure i understand your point of view we will disagree. i think just a couple of things on labor we are in the process of working to realize a new collective bargaining agreement following the terms of the contract. unfortunately, we had to go to court to obtain a preliminary injunction to address illegal behavior that's something we simply had to do. we continue to grow and diversify the company diversify the customer relationships and the array of service that we offer to our customers. it's clear the shares haven't responded but if you're asking fundamentally if the question is do we have a platform ultimately for success platform to move through both the headwinds in the market because they exist and the challenges of getting to a new labor agreement? i believe we do.
howard rosencrans -- va -- analyst
i would say at a bare minimum a reset of expectations is duly in order. but i guess we'll see with time as you introduce 2020 where that -- assuming you can -- the labor thing has been going on for many many many years. so this is not new one the horizon. i believe it should have been dealt with. we shouldn't have allowed it to coincide with the difficult macro environment we should have been ahead of the curve in my opinion but anyway. thank you for the time and looking forward to a reset.
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
yeah well -- i understand that howard. i -- just as part of what the whole rla framework is for a number of reasons these agreements take time to ultimately arrive at the next agreement. i'm not defending it by any means i would argue that in our specific instance had the union leadership simply filed the contract it would have had a deal two years ago but they chose not to for whatever reason and i'm not going to say more about that. that's just a fact. in the industry perhaps there's a new regulatory framework at some point that's beyond this conversation but it's taken years over at several of very large passenger airlines to get through to their new agreements. it's not misery loving company i'm simply saying that's just a feature of the industrial labor structure that exists under rla and aviation. and so john has talked about he will be providing full year results and the 2020 framework when we have our next earnings call. thank you.
howard rosencrans -- va -- analyst

your final question comes from chris stathoulopoulos at susquehanna financial services.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna financial services -- analyst
thanks for getting me in here. so two-part question but sort of the same question or idea here at heart. this is for john or bill. as we look toward 2020 and beyond curious what's the next chapter here for atlas? a few years ago it was about pivoting to e-commerce which you did but the stock today is below where it was the first deal at amazon. so should we think about atlas as a cost story now and are there additional opportunities in e-commerce beyond amazon and dhl? in other vertical sales and mro? and then as we look forward again 2020 you have no aircraft commitments weak macro backdrop and the potential for a labor deal given that and the cost and the productivity focus would you talk about is it reasonable to say that the business can do around 10% ebitda growth? thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
so, chris, it's john. from my perspective, we absolutely are focused on 2020 and beyond. if you look at some of the fastest growing markets and segments we're a key player in each of them. e-commerce express and some of the other growing markets. we've got the right assets and we've got the right team together to execute on that and i think we've demonstrated that over the last 10 years of growth and diversification and we've been able to adapt to the changing market and capitalize on these opportunities and we expect to continue to do so.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna financial services -- analyst
okay.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
chris, it's spencer. i would just add that this has obviously been a challenging year for the company. and if you were to back out the impact of the tariffs and trade tensions and back out the impact from the labor-related service disruptions that we've had you would have seen nice ebitda growth. and so when those things are behind with the other initiatives that john is talking about that's where our focus is.
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
and just more broadly bill just to round it out. we believe that air freight whether it's heavy e-commerce or express is ultimately growth industry. the diversification in the fleet types that we have the operational capabilities on the different types of networks that we operate long haul intercontinental domestic more time-definite e-commerce and express our skills and capabilities that position the company for growth. and so we believe in that growth opportunity and that we'll execute on it.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna financial services -- analyst
so if i understand if you're saying if we take out the impact of the tariffs and the labor that this business as a whole between the dry lease and the other subsidiaries that this is a business that later cycle can do around 8% to 10% adjusted ebitda growth?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we're not quantifying the future. i was simply pointing out that this year has been a challenging year. if you back those items out it would have been a very very different year. even with those items, we're still delivering ebitda of approximately $500 million. so just pointing out that without those things and with the initiatives that john talked about and the growth that we see in airfreight overall and our place in it should lead to a good opportunity for the company in the future.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna financial services -- analyst
okay, thanks for the time.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, chris.
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer

ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the third quarter 2019 earnings call for atlas air worldwide. [operator instruction] after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to the host of today's call, atlas air. please go ahead.
ed mcgarvey -- senior vice president and treasurer
thank you, shelby, and good morning everyone. i'm ed mcgarvey treasurer for atlas air worldwide. welcome to our third quarter 2019 results conference call. on our call today are bill flynn our chairman and chief executive officer; john dietrich our president and chief operating officer and spencer schwartz our chief financial officer. today's call is complemented by a slide presentation that can be viewed at atlasairworldwide.com under presentations in the investor information section. as indicated on slide two we'd like to remind you that our discussion about the company's [technical issues] includes some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements relate to future events and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties.

at this point, i'd like to draw your attention to slide three and turn the call over to bill flynn.
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, ed, and good morning everyone. our third quarter performance was affected by the uncertain global macro environment driven by ongoing tariff and trade tensions in addition to lower yields and volumes that we anticipated labor-related service disruptions had a significant impact on our performance during the quarter. we have recently received favorable arbitration rulings that confirm the contractual process for a new agreement to our pilots. we value the contributions of our pilots and we look forward to reaching a competitive contract that recognizes their efforts supporting our customers and our company. airfreight is a long-term growth industry. over the last 10 years, we have built and diversified our company. we know what we have to do to confront current headwinds and to continue to grow our business. despite macroeconomic issues, the global middle class continues to expand and supply chains continue to grow and develop to meet demand. and as consumption increases and supply chains evolved airfreight is vital and transporting the good to materials required safely reliably and efficiently.
with this the scale and scope of our operations and our focus on express e commerce and fastest growing markets. we are positioned well to serve the demand for air freight today and in the future. moving the slide for we began flying one additional 737 32 for amazon on a cmi basis during the quarter, increasing the current number two full and we expect to add our fifth 77 frames on before year end, in line with the schedule we outlined in march of this year. we also added a fourth 747 cmi freighter for ncaa during the quarter and expect to bring on a fifth 7474 ncaa in 2020. in charter, we began flying an additional passenger 747 aircraft during the quarter in response to demand from the military and the nfl. as noted our third quarter financial results reflect a continued softness in commercial airfreight yields and volumes as well as labor-related service disruptions. in addition in military charter passenger hours were significantly higher than in the third quarter of 2018 while military cargo flying was relatively in line with the prior year. slide five highlights our updated framework for 2019. we expect to benefit from peak season volumes and yields including the seasonal flying we do for express and e-commerce customers. in addition, our outlook anticipates increased passenger flying for the military and lower levels of maintenance expense compared with the fourth quarter of 2018.
as well as a refund of aircraft rent paid in previous years. based on global economic conditions in our current expectations we expect to fly approximately 325000 block hours this year with about 75% of the hours in acmi and the balance in charter. we also anticipate revenue of about $2.75 billion adjusted ebitda of approximately $500 million and adjusted net income to be about 60% to 65% of our 2018 adjusted net income. in addition, maintenance expense for the year is expected to total approximately $380 million. with depreciation and amortization of about $260 million and core capital expenditures of about $140 million which is mainly for parts and components for our fleet. this is a good point to ask john to provide some perspectives about our business and the actions we are taking to drive our performance.
after john spencer will provide further detail about our third quarter results i'll provide a few additional comments and then we'll be happy to take your questions. john?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief operating officer
thank you, bill, and hello everyone. turning to slide number six. as bill noted we are well positioned to serve our customers and the demand for airfreight. we have the right platform in place for the future. and it begins with our talented team of employees and our strong portfolio of assets and service offerings. as we announced yesterday i am pleased to confirm that jim forbes will become the new chief operating officer of atlas air worldwide effective on january 1 when i transitioned into the ceo role. jim is currently senior vice president and chief operating officer at southern air. he has over 30 years of aviation operating experience and has been with atlas since 1997 in various management roles. jim has been a trusted colleague for the last 20 years. he is an outstanding leader and has a proven track record of success. he has played a key role in our polar air cargo joint venture with dhl our largest customer. and he has also played a lead role in the integration between southern air and atlas air as well as overseeing the day-to-day operations at southern. i look forward to welcoming jim to the senior leadership team.
in addition to our employees and our assets and services, we also have a strong core of long-term customers and we play a key role in their operating networks. with that as our foundation, we are also taking steps to navigate through the current headwinds. we continually assess the market to best balance our capacity with the demand for our aircraft and services. and as bill stated we know what we have to do and we are adjusting our business to adapt to the changing market environment with a focus on growth customers and those opportunities that generate the highest returns. we are very focused on aggressively managing those issues that are within our control particularly during a softer market environment. this includes a relentless focus on reducing costs enhancing productivity-improving profitability and generating cash. i will also be particularly focused on completing our new joint collective bargaining agreement. i've been in regular contact with union leaders toward that goal. we also continue to make progress and our negotiating teams have been meeting regularly. looking ahead we expect to provide our 2020 earnings outlook which will include the expected and collective impact of our actions during our next earnings call which will be my first as ceo. not only will these actions benefit atlas in the near term they will also contribute to the long-term success of our company.
i'd now like to turn it over to spencer for our financial review.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, john, and hello everyone. our third quarter earnings are summarized on slide seven. on an adjusted basis ebitda totaled $95.6 million and income from continuing operations net of taxes totaled $9.5 million. on a reported basis net income was $60 million which included a non-cash unrealized gain of $83.2 million on outstanding warrants. our adjusted earnings in the third quarter included an effective income tax rate of 5.7%. and as a result of proactive tax planning to maximize income tax benefits, we now expect our adjusted income tax rate for the full year of 2019 to be approximately 12%. slide eight provides an overview of our third quarter segment revenues. since many of the factors driving segment revenues and contribution during the third quarter are similar i'll focus my comments on segment contribution. moving to slide nine. segment contribution totaled $81.8 million in the third quarter. acmi earnings primarily reflected an increase in cmi flying that was offset by a decrease in acmi flying related to the impact of tariffs and global trade tensions and labor-related service disruptions. in addition, acmi segment contribution was impacted by additional heavy maintenance start-up costs for customer growth initiatives and the short-term redeployment of two 747-8 to the charter segment prior to their subsequent placement within acmi customer after that customer obtain necessary regulatory approvals.
lower charter segment contribution during the period was driven by a decrease in commercial cargo yields and volumes related to tariffs and global trade tensions as well as labor-related service disruptions. these were partially offset by earnings from the redeployment of 747-8 aircraft from acmi increased passenger demand from the military and lower heavy maintenance expenses. in dry leasing, lower segment contribution during the quarter was primarily due to the scheduled return of a 777 freighter earlier this year partially offset by the placement of additional aircraft. turning to, slide 10. our net leverage ratio increased modestly in the third quarter as a result of softer than expected earnings and its impact on trailing 12 months ebitda. we do not have any firm aircraft purchase commitments and we remain committed to a strong balance sheet and to reduce our net leverage ratio. we look for a gradual improvement as we benefit from increased ebitda levels and as we continue to lower debt levels by maintaining debt repayments of approximately $70 million per quarter.
now i'd like to turn it back to bill.
william j. flynn -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, spencer. moving to slide 11. airfreight is a long-term growth industry we have the right platform to serve our customers and future airfreight demand. we have a strong core of long-term customers and we play a key role in their operating networks. we continually assess the market to best balance our capacity with the demand for our aircraft and services. we are adjusting our business to the changing market environment. we know what we have to do. and these actions will not only benefit atlas in the near term they will contribute to the long-term success of our company.
shelby may we have the first question, please.

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of bob labick of cjs securities.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking the questions.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, bob.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, bob.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
hi. so while i just start, could you talk a little bit about your acmi customers and how they're utilizing the aircraft if it's differently now versus a normal first half, if they're benefiting from the tight market and then how does that translate to direct contribution from acmi for atlas, if it does?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
so i'll start, bob on the first part of your question. for our acmi customers, for the most part, it's more normalized operations. many of them, including our larger customers, serve some of the markets where there are some surge out of china, particularly. as we mentioned in our remarks, there was a fairly dramatic decline during that initial period on the tail end of lunar new year, but now it's return to more normalized levels. there have been a couple of our acmi customers who have redeployed into the china market that weren't previously serving it to take advantage and help in the effort of the covid- 19 demand surge. but for the most part, they maintained their networks because they do depend on their network flying as part of their underlying business. so from a contribution standpoint spencer, i don't know if you want to add anything to that.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. and bob, i'll just add, the way that acmi works. as you know, it's a long-term contract with an agreed-upon rate structure and at the beginning of the quarter, when things were a little slower, manufacturing wasn't as strong in china, the acmi customer has a guaranteed minimum and now the things are so much stronger. the acmi customer has a huge benefit because they've locked in that rate over a long period of time. and so our acmi customers have the benefit of that long-term contract with us if they were going out into the marketplace looking for capacity now, they would be paying so much more. so acmi customers really benefit overall from that relationship. and as i said during the first couple of months, there were cancellations and then in march and certainly in april and what we're seeing now volumes have really, really picked up.
from a from a direct contribution standpoint overall acmi saw an increase from the cmi flying that john talked about five additional aircraft for amazon, two triple-sevens for dhl, two for nca. so we really benefited from that. the segment benefited from having lower cost of aircraft rent and depreciation and overall, the segment performed well even given the softness at the beginning of the period.
ed mcgarvey -- senior vice president and treasurer
yeah. and i think if i could, spencer. the other thing i'd add, for our customers, they really enjoyed the low fuel price as well. i mean, it's been a substantial benefit for them. so with our modern efficient aircraft coupled with the low fuel price in the high demand during the most recent period, i would expect they enjoyed really good returns.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
okay, super. and then just for my follow up, i guess kind of thinking ahead 2021 or beyond. we've obviously been seeing a lot of, on a press reports about potential capacity coming out of commercial airlines in the future. how does that influence the value of freighters going forward and your potential operations next year and beyond.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so yeah, certainly the significant decline in passenger capacity in the marketplace has had an impact on freight and the one of the big questions is, when will that passenger capacity come back into market and reasonable minds can differ on that, but we do know it's going to be a while before that happens and we also expect it will be more gradual. we're watching that closely. and from a capacity standpoint it also ties in with where that capacity is going to be redeployed once it starts coming into the market. will it focus on europe first or asia. most of the production is coming out of asia. and i think it's going to be a while before that capacity has a significant impact on the cargo demand which ties into your question on the value of freighters that speaks to the freighters having significant value and high-demand as spencer mentioned that certain certainly the case now and time will tell how long that continues on into the future, but we expect for the foreseeable future. people aren't talking about days and weeks, they are talking about months and years before the passenger capacity materially rebounds.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and bob, it's spencer. i'll just add a couple of small point to that. as you know about 50% of air freight has moved in the belly space of passenger planes and so that has really had an impact. and as john said, we're looking at months to years for when that's going to come back. so it's really going to benefit, it seems airfreight for quite some time. and so, the value of freighters should improve from sort of scarcity value standpoint for sure. the other benefit we have is that we also have a dry leasing business and our dry leasing business because the passenger aircraft values have dropped and most likely will continue to drop due to the large fleet reductions and parked aircraft. so our dry leasing business should see some great investment opportunities and there should be attractive aircraft that can be freighter conversions like 767300 and 737800 possibly a33300 or a321200. so, some good opportunities out there overall, bob.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
so, i will get back in queue as you asked. thank you very much.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

operator
your next question comes from the line of scott group of wolfe research.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning guys.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, scott.
ed mcgarvey -- senior vice president and treasurer
good morning.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
i wanted to start on the charter side. so, charter rates were down for the quarter. but maybe can you talk about that trend that you saw throughout the quarter and what you're seeing right now and then. i understand not giving full year guidance. but maybe can you share what were in the initial guidance. what were you assuming for charter rates and what are you actually seeing right now?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, scott. it's spencer. so overall charter rates rate per block hour was down on a first quarter this year versus first quarter last year, which is not what you would expect. and so, it's made of a few different pieces. so, i'll try to explain that. the overall yields were down a few hundred dollars a block hour, the biggest piece of that, well, let me start with the increase. so just from overall market rates driven by what we're seeing in the market yields were up significantly. so that's what you would have expected to see. but then, there were a couple of offsets. one is of course fuel and so fuel is a component that's in charter and in our acmi business fuel is not a factor. in our charter business, it's part of the overall rate and so since fuel with so much lower that had a pretty significant impact on the rate per block hour.
and then the second piece that had a pretty big impact is something we call purchase capacity. we've talked about this a little bit in the past, from time to time, we will buy back space from our acmi customers on those planes and then we will sell that in the charter market and so the charter revenue shows up in the charter segment because it was sold in the charter market, but the actual flying took place on an acmi aircraft. so, the block hours are in acmi. so that was the situation we had last year. so last year, the rate per block hour had a very big benefit from that. this year that was not the case. and so, on a comparison year-over-year basis, you would see that, and so we were able to operate those hours directly in charter and not through not using acmi. so, had it not been for fuel, had it not been for this reduction in purchased capacity, what you would have seen was a sharp increase in commercial market yields. overall, to the second part of your question, yields were certainly higher in march and continue to be higher than we had anticipated sharply higher than what we had anticipated. now in january and february things were very different. but in march and certainly april yields are much, much higher than we had anticipated in our plan at the beginning of the year.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
and just so i understand that this purchased capacity, is this a sort of a headwind to reported charter yields all year. is this a first-quarter phenomenon. and then what are you doing if anything to sort of are you doing anything to lock in these charter rates for longer than normal? how are you approaching the market, right now?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, i can talk about both of those so it's a, it's an issue and the purchase capacity that will be an issue on a comparison basis probably just the first couple of quarters of the year. and then the question you're asking about longer-term charters. so we are, i said this on a previous call, the difference between acmi and charter is starting to get a lot more blurry than it used to be used to be acmi was acmi and charter was charter they're starting to blend a lot more together as charters are getting longer term and the nature of the charter relationship is starting to look more and more like acmi. so what we're seeing on the, in the charter space is that charter customers want to enter into much longer agreements so they used to be very short term occasionally we had certainly program charters. but now, what we're seeing is request for more long-term charter relationships at higher yields and so we are now entering into those. and so we expect the charter demand to be strong for quite some time.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and if i could add to that, spencer. scott from my perspective, we're focused on both, of course, we want to take advantage of the near-term surge in the yields. but we're also focused on the long term as well. and there are customers who see the value in the freighters going forward. they see the dynamics that we've talked about with the significant reduction in capacity in the market. a coupled with what they see as their needs. so that has opened the door for us to engage in the discussion and get some longer-term charter contracts at very favourable rates.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
one more quickly, if i can. can you just give us a cares act update? did you guys participate in the in the dollars for cargo companies? was there anything in that in first quarter, second quarter guidance?
ed mcgarvey -- senior vice president and treasurer
so, there is not in the guidance and as many of you know the cares act sets aside specific funds for cargo airlines. we have been in discussions with treasury to evaluate whether atlas will participate in the program. but no decisions have been made on that and we'll let you know how that develops.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. i'll get back in queue. thank you, guys.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, scott.
operator
your next question comes from the line of helane becker of cowen.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
thanks very much, operator. i appreciate the time gentlemen. so, here is my one question, well, two questions. one is, i know for a while there were issues flying into china for your pilots because the government wanted to quarantine them and that's just ridiculous. so, i'm kind of wondering if that worked out and how that worked out and then how i should think about the contract pay rates. so is the 10% like a down payment on a potential increase later on that might be as much as 30% or does the 10% have [indecipherable] limit to it. and then you would renegotiate this away and negotiated new contracts?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay, thanks helane. i'll take those. in terms of flying into china, you're right, there have been a number of regulatory and operational hurdles, we've had to overcome. it was frustrated by inconsistent rules and regulations in different cities within china.
so, and so there has been a tremendous effort to have more centralized rules that accommodated the need for a central freight to keep moving and there was also different testing requirements and as you say, different quarantine requirements for the most part, we were able to transition our crews and go through china without lay over, without too much problem there were some testing that would take place, some of it was more invasive than others, and that was concerning for a while, if not disruptive for a while, but working together with the industry and with the government, we were able to get more reasonable and rational ways in which to operate in and out of china, including migrating to a point where we can actually do more efficient and less risky layovers within china in places like shanghai. so we're in a much better place now than we were several weeks ago. on that so it's working as well as can be expected and there were some pretty harsh approaches earlier on for example if someone were to be tested positive that they would somehow be stuck in china, when i think it was in everyone's interest for u.s. based pilots and citizens to get them out of china and back home again and we've worked through those issues as well.
so you're right, it was a serious concern and continues to be a concern, but it's mitigated over time due to some great work in the government's dealing with each other's in the industry, dealing with the governments. so that's that part of it. with regard to the pilot contract, there is no limit on it. this is a 10% increase that will remain in effect until we reach our next contract. i think it's fair to say that our contract is long since amendable, so the rates have been somewhat below market for an extended period of time. quite frankly no one expected, i certainly didn't expect the merger negotiations for the joint collective bargaining agreement to take this long. unfortunately, we had a number of procedural disputes to enforce the contract in the merger provisions within the contract. fortunately, we were successful in many, many court decisions in arbitrations to define what procedures apply. but given where we are in that cycle and given frankly had we follow those merger procedures, the new joint collective barting agreement would already be in place by now and we just thought it was a prudent time to recognize our pilots and give them this interim pay bumped, it will not have an expiration date. i view it as kind of a bridge to the next contract. so that's where we're at with regard to the 10%.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
that's great, thank you very much. and just one last follow-up question, as the passenger airlines since you due do some passenger flying can you apply for psp funds. i know i think scott asked about the cargo. but you could also ask for passenger funds too, no?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, that's not the case and the government did contemplate there were carriers who did a little bit of both. and they set some definitions, if you were predominantly a cargo carrier and did some passenger you fell under the cargo bucket, if you were predominantly a passenger and did some cargo you fell under the passenger bucket. so, we would, to the extent that we proceeded, we would be in the cargo in the cargo bucket.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
got you. thanks, have a nice day.
ed mcgarvey -- senior vice president and treasurer

your next question comes from the line of david ross of stifel.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
hey, good morning gentlemen.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
hi, dave.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
as follow up on one of the earlier questioning lines when you talked about the charter segment having more longer-term charters say multi-month agreement rather than multi-week agreements. what percentage of your charter planes are now flying under those longer-term contracts versus really running free in the spot market.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
david spencer, i don't really have a percentage, but one of the things in the premise of your question was months versus days. we now have charter contracts that are several years in length. and that's why i was saying they start to look more and more like an acmi contract. they have some different elements, but they're starting to look similar, so we have now charter contracts that will go into the years. on a percentage basis, i don't think we know that it's not really the way we operate, but not really sure, i don't want to speculate. not really sure, on a percentage basis. we still have some that are very much in the in the spot market. and then we have others that are tied to longer-term arrangements.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
may be if you got 14-15 planes in charter or half of them tied up under long-term deals.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
i would not say half, is something less than half. but beyond that, would just speculating.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
and then how do you think about fuel working into longer-term charter rates because typically fuels a part of that all in charter rate, as you mentioned with the revenue per block hour headwind with fuel dropping. but as you extended out, the fuel get separated out from that to spread the risk or is fuel in there and then you're taking some element of fuel risk where you could benefit if fuel falls or you could get hurt a fuel rises?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we have some adjusters in the agreements that call for the extremes in either direction, right? so, as we talked about on a long-term basis. no one can predict what's going to happen with fuel, although we don't expect any dramatic changes in the near term, but there are protections for both for both parties in this longer-term charter to make adjustments for fuel in either direction.
ed mcgarvey -- senior vice president and treasurer
david spencer. i'll just add to that, we always talk about one of the great benefits of our business is that we really don't have much fuel exposure, a little bit, but not really much. in acmi, we really don't have fuel exposure with the military we really don't have fuel exposure, in charter is the only area where there's a little bit and where we're entering into a short-term charter arrangement for something that's going to happen over the next several days. we have a pretty good idea of what the rates are, if we're entering into a longer-term arrangement. the fuel is typically pegged to some sort of a fuel index. and so, there is just a very small amount of risk there as fuel is moving up or down if it's volatile, but otherwise it's tied to an index. and really the customer will mostly enjoy the benefit of lowered fuel or suffer the consequence of rising fuel, but at the moment, certainly the benefit of lower fuel.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
okay, thank you very much.
ed mcgarvey -- senior vice president and treasurer
thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of chris stathoulopoulos of sig.
chris stathoulopoulos -- sig -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking my question. so spencer, starting with the balance sheet. could you just tell us exiting the quarter with respect to unencumbered assets, whether it's aircraft slots or any other substance of economic value, and then also with the military weakness view of the stop order movement but offset here with what's going on in the charter market for main deck freighters, how should we think about your debt into the end of the quarter and assuming the stop order movement remains in place and we have a similar level of demand in charter what that might look like at the end of the year. thanks.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. hi chris, it's spencer. so with regard to other forms of collateral or unencumbered assets, we certainly have some under-levered assets on our balance sheet such as our 747-8. in addition, we certainly have assets that could potentially be disposed if we were to do that in addition to the ones that we already have. but we have no plans to do that on any large-scale basis. let's see. the other part of your question was about the military and there's a short term stop movement order for non-essential movements.
the military is still moving. they're moving essential movements, but they're not moving nonessential movements. and we expect that will be lifted probably june or july. and we expect that business will come back just fine. i'm not sure i completely understood your question. you were suggesting that perhaps if the military wasn't flying would have some impact on our balance sheet and i didn't quite follow that. if we're not flying for the military, the charter market is so strong right now that we would be able to utilize those aircraft in the charter market.
chris stathoulopoulos -- sig -- analyst
and if i could add to that [multiple speakers].
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
i'm sorry, chris, go ahead.
chris stathoulopoulos -- sig -- analyst
what i was looking for is really given where we are with the military and the charter. if there's a leverage target that we should think about exiting 2-q or perhaps into the second half, assuming things remain where they are now.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
oh, sure. sure. sorry, i didn't realize that's what you were asking, chris. from a net leverage ratio standpoint, we really expect that it's going to reduce fairly significantly throughout the rest of the year. and again, we didn't provide we're not applying the full year guidance, but our goal has been for our net leverage ratio to somewhere between three and four times. and we expect that it will be there over the remainder of this year.
chris stathoulopoulos -- sig -- analyst
okay. and then also with what's going on in terms of spot rates struggling looking at the tech index. should we interpret this as this is perhaps an opportunity for acmi rates to reset higher when those leases are rolled over?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think that's a fair, fair conclusion. as we talked about earlier, these are very valuable assets and particularly for the foreseeable future and that's taken into account as we renegotiate our acmi rates.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. and as i said earlier to someone else, chris, that's the great benefit that an acmi customer gets is that they have this kind of locked in fixed pricing over a longer period of time. and so in times like this where the spot market is so high the acmi customer gets that benefit.
chris stathoulopoulos -- sig -- analyst
okay. last question. okay, if you answered this before i was on another call, but i believe exiting 4q, you had, i think it was four aircraft in storage and just where that is today. and then also the costs that are involved putting aircraft in storage and taking those out. thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes, chris. thank you. yes, there was four that we've parked. we brought three of them back into service already and it was really nominal cost. they are put into temporary. there are different forms of storage, temporary storage and long-term storage. and the cost associated with that very higher cost with the longer term you're storing them for.
and then there are some costs that are involved in getting them back up and running on the line. so the three that we brought back the trip 747 were brought back quite efficiently and quickly and in a cost-efficient way. now the longer you keep them in service, there will be other costs like engine maintenance and heavy checks that you'll incur. but just bringing them back online was not difficult. it didn't take a lot of time and it was not costly.
chris stathoulopoulos -- sig -- analyst
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of david campbell of thompson davis & company.
david campbell -- thompson davis &amp; company -- analyst
yes. thank you for taking my question. since march, there've been a lot of passenger airlines converting their aircraft to fly cargo. so the capacity to carry cargo is up in april compared to what it was in march. but you don't seem to be concerned at all about it. is that because you the demand is also up or some other reason?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes, david. thank you. not overly concerned. it does have an impact of course. any additional capacity has an impact. and i want to be careful with the use of the term converting. they're utilizing their aircraft and maybe doing some taking out of seats and using aisles and things like that, but not in the form of full-blown cargo conversions, but sure it has an impact. but over time as rates settle which they will, there's a price point below which that will no longer be feasible as well. and we're not too concerned. and there's also an efficiency factor.
one of the things that we've observed is that the market is accustomed to using freighters and certainly belly. but when you get into loading and unloading main deck passenger aircraft, it becomes quite inefficient and costly and causing more and more downtime. so there are a number of reasons why that's not optimal. it does tell you how high the rates are that it could still be economically feasible for passenger carriers to do that. it shows you where the market is right now. and look, there are other factors as well. the passenger carriers have an interest in keeping their pilots current and flying. because if they're not flying they lose currency, which adds additional cost and time if and when they ramp back up again. so there are a number of factors in play and sure it does have some capacity impact, but we're not overly concerned about it at this time as a long-term impact.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and david, it's spencer. i'll just add to that, that about 90% of the passenger aircraft have been parked or not operating and that's about 21,000 aircraft. so 90% of them. and normally 50% of the world's air freight flies in a in a passenger aircraft. so the fact that some passenger aircraft are starting to carry freight is having a very small very little impact. a dedicated freighter is just so much different, right? a passenger aircraft does not have a cargo door. it can handle pallets above the wing. it can't handle palletized cargo. so you can put a box on a seat or take a seat out and stack boxes. but it's not the same as being able to move palletized containers and so forth. and so we're really not seeing that much of an impact on our business.
david campbell -- thompson davis &amp; company -- analyst
and my second question is, you've mentioned and we see the growth recovery in china and in cargo demand, particularly in march and april. but in europe, have you seen any comparable increases in cargo demand in europe or are they still flat?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
not appreciable other than china, europe, i think is still has similar dynamics to the u.s. in needing a lot of the ppe. and i think that'll be a big question we're watching closely. commercial general freight is coming back, but ppe is still a big part of it in both markets. so that's something we're watching closely and we expect i expect they will be the ones ppe softens. there's going to be a strong demand for manufacturing to get back in full business. so we'll be watching that very closely.
and spencer, i'll just add that as the quarter progressed or now that first four months of this year have progressed. originally things were really slow. manufacturing was not taking place in asia as we talked about. and then what started to move was really sort of intra-asia, goods to be used within the manufacturing process. like raw materials we're really moving to help get the factories ready. and so that's what was moving first. and then the factory started to produce. and so now the types of things that we're moving include high tech, automotive, retail, components, machinery, parts used in manufacturing. so all of that has started to move in a very strong way. and as john said at some point the ppe movement will slow. and then there's really going to be a big push to get all of these goods back to retail.
david campbell -- thompson davis &amp; company -- analyst
all right. thanks for your answers. thank you very much.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you. david.
operator
your next question is a follow-up from scott group of wolf research.
scott group -- wolf research -- analyst
hey, thanks, for the follow-up. so is there any way you could share from the initial guidance that you gave us a few months ago, what the, what the 2-q originally was supposed to be in your mind. and then is there any way to quantify the military headwind on the passenger side?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
let's see. so with regard to the second quarter, certainly charter is much, much stronger. we now, as john said, we're bringing several aircraft back that we're operating and we've now operate operationalize the triple seven. so those aircraft were not expected to be in our numbers. and so now that's four large aircraft that are in charter earning very high yields. so huge benefit to our second quarter earnings. from those, we've also because of what's going on we've been significantly reducing our costs and working very, very hard at doing that.
and your second part of your question was about the military. so the military has canceled or not ordered a significant amount of passenger flying. so we haven't really quantified that for you, scott. but it was a significant reduction in the first quarter. we expect it will be significant reduction in the second quarter. fortunately it is much more than offset with the strength of the overall charter market.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and if i could add to that, spencer. there is an offsetting factor as well. the fact that the military demand was down as much as it was, allowed us to redeploy some of our crews to bring back the three 477s as quickly as we did. because crewing is an important feature. it doesn't make up for the full gap of that, but without if there wasn't that softness, if the military was at these higher levels, we may not have been able to capitalize as much on the charter 747. so it also allowed us to get some pilots through training that gives us a better opportunity to be positioned when the military ramps up to full strength, which i expect will be by the end of june. so overall, not the worst-case scenario, frankly, and a good opportunity for us to position to further leverage our scale when it ramps up again.
scott group -- wolf research -- analyst
okay. and then my last question. so i understand your view of why this is good for acmi. maybe can you just offer some perspective on why you think one of the planes was returned to you and if you see risk of any other planes getting returned?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i assume, scott, you're talking about the 777 that was returned a year ago.
scott group -- wolf research -- analyst
oh, that was a year ago. okay. so that was not.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
that was in 2000 early 2019.
scott group -- wolf research -- analyst
okay.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes, yes. and that's when we put back in service.
scott group -- wolf research -- analyst
okay. so i guess, ok, then that question does not apply. okay. thank you guys.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of chris stathoulopoulos of sig.
chris stathoulopoulos -- sig -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my follow-up. so just an add on to scott's question on the military side. and again, apologies if you address this in your prepared remarks. but if with respect to utilization, if zero being none of the planes are moving, they're on the ground and five on all cylinders, could you just sort of are we at a three there and is there an opportunity to repurpose those planes for other missions? and then the second question, i realize you have the 10% interim pay rate here and a few other moving pieces here on the p&l. but we're right now in a pretty favorable environment for freighter demand.
and i think that will probably persist as belly capacity is going to come on slower and on an absolute basis, i think a lot smaller as the passenger airlines are now saddled with higher debt here. so why isn't there an opportunity here to work toward how do we get toward this perhaps 3 times with respect to leverage or even lower here. assuming that you have enough aircraft in the fleet to meet demand and if you don't want to acquire aircraft. perhaps go out and rent some. i'm guessing right now with there's probably opportunities in the wide or even medium wide bodies with respect to favorable rates as given all the pressure on the ecosystem right now aviation. thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so i'll start on the first part with regard to the military demand. even though there's a stop movement order there, that does not mean they're not moving anything. they're just being very cautious and limiting the amount of military movements. so in your question on a zero to five, it's not zero and it's not five. i would put it something in the 2.25 range of on your scale. and so it's not at a complete halt. with regard to incremental capacity going into the year, our planning was to have those four aircraft parked. so there was a little bit of a silver lining in some of that slower military businesses i just talked about. because we were to redeploy the crews we expected in the military to ramp up on the very lucrative charter flying and backfill with additional crew hiring and training.
so yes, but as we look forward we are always interested in growth opportunities and we'll continue to be. we want to be very careful. we've ramped up quite quickly the four aircraft, which has talked about the three 777, excuse me, 374s and the 777 over a short period of time. we're also keeping an eye on the market so as to not over get too much capacity. as we're watching closely what happens on the, on the back end of this. we're very optimistic but cautiously so given the market conditions. we think manufacturing i think manufacturing is going to continue to surge on the back end of this. but you also have the fact that significant unemployment in the u.s. and what's the consumer market going to be? those are the things we're looking at as well as concurrently looking at available aircraft on the market.
chris stathoulopoulos -- sig -- analyst
so if charter remains where it is now and the military [indecipherable] movement is lifted in june or july here and acmi rates reset higher. and again, i know you have the 10% pay raise and that hit to ebitda. but is there a reason why we shouldn't think now if demand and we have let's say a seasonally in line or perhaps out-performance with respect to peak season. why we can't see leverage go below four by the end of the year or even perhaps get to 3.5?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i think earlier spenser talk about i think he did say we we're expecting it to go below four, but spencer?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, that's exactly right. our target has been to get between three and four. so certainly to get below four somewhere around the mid threes and we expect that we'll be in that area by the end of the year. we expect our net leverage ratio will decrease continue to decrease as the year progresses.
chris stathoulopoulos -- sig -- analyst
okay. thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thanks chris.
operator
your final question comes from the line of david ross at stifel.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
and thanks for squeezing me back in. spenser talked in the release about the core capex number for 2020. what additional capex might there be on top of that for the year? what would you think of as the total capex number?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so in addition to core capex which is primarily parts used for our aircraft. in addition to that would really be some engines and we typically don't provide an estimate on that, but they it's in the i don't know, dozens of millions because we will need to capitalize overhaul so that counts as core capital expenditures. so we'll capitalize some overhauls. and we are also upgrading our genx which is the genx tubing, which is the engine on the dash eight. we continue to put those in for overhauls and upgrades and those are also capitalized. so again, so we'll have some genx to be engines, some 680, which is the engines for the 747s. probably somewhat similar previous years.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
okay. so 90 million of core capex, maybe it's somewhere from 120 to 140 total?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
a bit more than that. a bit more than that.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
okay.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
because we have capitalized overhauls. so it's normal maintenance, but they're capitalized for the genx engines.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
okay. and then you talked earlier on the dry lease side about the value of passenger planes coming down and maybe an opportunity for increased freighter conversions. in addition to dry lease, how do you think about an opportunity to potentially trade up on the existing fleet, whether it's in charter or acmi? you guys have a fairly young fleet as it is, but maybe there's a couple of planes that are a little bit older that you could replace it, a lower rate over the next year. how are you thinking about that?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes, well i think that's david, we'll, we'll be looking at that. and for example, there's potential with the 767s that were flying in our military business. might be right for conversion and then to replace with some more modern and recent 767 passenger aircraft. those are the kinds of things we're evaluating all the time and we got our eye on that.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you dave.
operator

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the first quarter 2020 earnings call for atlas air worldwide. [operator instructions] thank you.
i will now turn the call over to atlas air to begin.
ed mcgarvey -- senior vice president and treasurer
thank you, laura, and good morning everyone. i'm ed mcgarvey, treasurer for atlas air worldwide. welcome to our first quarter 2020 results conference call. today's call will be hosted by john dietrich, our chief executive officer and spencer schwartz, our chief financial officer. today's call is complemented by a slide presentation that can be viewed at atlasairworldwide.com under presentations in the investor information section.
as indicated on slide two, we'd like to remind you that our discussion about the company's performance today includes some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements relate to future events and expectations and they involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results or actions may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. for information about risk factors related to our business, please refer to our 2019 form 10-k as amended or supplemented by our subsequently filed sec reports. any references to non-gaap measures are meant to provide meaningful insights and are reconciled with gaap in today's press release and in the appendix that is attached to today's slide s.
during our question and answer period today, we'd like to ask participants to limit themselves to one principal question and one follow-up question, so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible. after we've gone through the queue, we'll be happy to answer any additional questions as time permits.
at this point, i'd like to call turn the call over to john dietrich.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ed, and hello everyone and thank you for joining. before i discuss our first quarter performance, i want to take a moment to acknowledge the extraordinary times we've all been living through. i want to extend our best wishes to all who have been so adversely affected by this pandemic. i would also like to thank all of our employees and the frontline responders around the world for their tremendous efforts to combat this crisis. their life saving efforts are truly appreciated. turning to our presentation at slide three, as always, safety is our top priority and we're focused on supporting our pilots, ground staff and our customers through this challenging time. this includes taking extensive precautions to safeguard all of our employees and support workers and working in close partnership with our pilots and their union leadership to ensure that our operations continue to run safely so that we can continue to carry the goods that the world needs. we're deep cleaning our aircraft in our facilities on a frequent basis, providing safety kits for our ground staff and crew members and implementing other safety procedures to protect our team, our customers and our service providers.
we're also adjusting routes and schedules to limit exposure to regions that have been more significantly impacted by the pandemic and we have put in place significant social distancing and other precautionary measures in our offices, including having all employees who can work remotely from home do so. over the years, we've made significant investments in our technology and business resiliency capabilities to ensure that our employees have the tools they need to do their jobs effectively even if they are away from their primary place of business. i'm pleased to say that those investments are paying off and that our transition to working remotely during this crisis has been seamless and i'm confident that we have the right controls in place to continue managing our business remotely until it is safe for all employees to return to our facilities.
with respect to the business, atlas plays a vital role in supporting the global economy and our customers by keeping goods moving. airfreight offers unrivaled delivery speed which is particularly important in times of need; from parts and components used in manufacturing processes to finished goods, food, pharmaceuticals and other cargo, businesses and individuals count on atlas to deliver every day. and we're grateful to be able to provide relief to businesses and communities in the fight against covid-19. in addition to our commercial operations, we have donated services to transport critical personal protective equipment and other necessary relief supplies to affected areas. we've also made several charitable contributions to organizations that help those in need and we're in close contact with our customers and governments around the world to ensure that airfreight continues to move to support relief efforts globally.
now turning to our first quarter results on slide four. after a slow start and despite the continual and varying operational challenges and uncertainties related to covid-19, we ended the quarter with results that exceeded our expectations. traditionally, the first quarter is the slowest part of the year for airfreight and this year started out that way with the usual drop off in global manufacturing associated with the lunar new year holiday in china. but this year covid-19 extended the lunar new year holiday which delayed the resumption of manufacturing and that drove significant flight cancellations in january and february as our customers adjusted their schedules, due to the impact of the pandemic on their businesses. as we moved into march however, cargo demand and yields improve significantly reflecting the demand for goods and needed supplies, coupled with the reduction of belly capacity of the commercial passenger airlines and the disruption of global supply chains, due to the covid-19 pandemic. in addition to the increased demand and higher airfreight yields in march, our first quarter results also benefited from flying the cmi aircraft, added to our fleet in 2019, including five incremental 737s for amazon, two incremental 777s for dhl and two incremental 747-400s for nippon cargo airlines. the results also benefited from lower to lower aircraft rent and depreciation.
our overall strong acmi and commercial charter cargo performance was partially offset by lower military passenger demand due to the department of defense's precautionary limit on military travel, lower 747 dreamlifter flying reflecting boeing's temporary suspension of its 787 dreamliner production and higher cost related to the pandemic including premium pay for our crews and the protection and cleaning measures, i noted earlier, as well as other operational workarounds. strong demand for airfreight, though, has carried into the second quarter. to meet that demand, we've reactivated three of our 747-400 converted freighters that had been previously part. and we began operating a 777 freighter that was previously in our dry leasing business. at the same time, we're mindful of the evolving and uncertain environment and the importance of prudent financial management. we're taking actions to reduce cost and enhance liquidity, including significantly reducing discretionary spending, limiting our hiring for certain positions and selling non-essential assets. that being said, we continue to hire pilots to support demand and further growth. and we're seeing strong interest from pilots who are excited to join our company.
as mentioned in our press release earlier today, i'm pleased to report that working together with our pilots and their union leadership, we've taken a very important step during this critical time and increased our pilots pay rates by 10%, effective may 1. we're happy to be able to acknowledge and recognize the outstanding efforts that our crews provide every day and especially in this challenging operating environment. we're providing this pay increase as an interim step, as we continue to negotiate a new joint collective bargaining agreement in connection with our merger between atlas air and southern air. with an exceptionally talented team of employees, a strong balance sheet and a diversified portfolio of assets and services, atlas is well positioned to continue to adjust to market conditions, to navigate through the current pandemic and leverage the scale of our global operations to further capitalize on business opportunities. turning to slide five, we expect the positive trends that we're currently experiencing to continue throughout the remainder of the year and we expect the majority of our earnings to occur in the second half of the year. however, the evolving an uncertain environment related to covid-19 makes it difficult to accurately predict the future impact on our results. as such, we're providing an outlook for the second quarter of 2020, but our full-year 2020 earnings guidance provided on february 28 of this year no longer applies and we'll provide updates as the year progresses.
for the second quarter of 2020, we expect to fly approximately 80,000 block hours with revenue of approximately $770 million and adjusted ebitda of about $165 million. excluding the second quarter refund of excess aircraft rent paid in previous years of approximately $25 million after tax, we anticipate second quarter adjusted net income to grow approximately 40% to 50% compared with adjusted net income of $29.9 million in the first quarter of 2020. including the benefit from the refund of excess aircraft rent paid in previous years, we anticipate second quarter adjusted net income to more than double compared with the first quarter of 2020. in addition to the excess rent refund, earnings in the second quarter are expected to benefit from continued charter demand including several long-term charter programs at higher yields flying the incremental cmi aircraft added to our fleet during 2019 and improved operating efficiencies and cost savings. we expect these benefits to be partially offset by higher heavy maintenance expense, lower military demand driven by the military stop moving order related to covid-19, additional cost driven by covid-19 including premium pay for our pilots, cost for continuing to provide a safe working environment for all our employees as well as higher costs from our recent interim pay agreement with our pilots.
in addition, the availability of hotels and restaurants evolving pandemic related travel restrictions and health screenings, cancellations of passenger flights by other airlines or airport closures could further impact our ability to position pilots to operate our aircraft. our second quarter outlook also reflects the reactivation of three of our 747-400 converted freighters that had been part in our operation of a 777 that was previously in our dry leasing business driven by continued strong demand for airfreight. while we're not providing an outlook for the full year of 2020 at this time, we expect the majority of our earnings to occur in the second half of the year. aircraft maintenance expense in 2020 is expected to total approximately $390 million with depreciation and amortization totaling about $250 million. in addition, core capital expenditures which exclude aircraft and engine purchases are projected to total approximately $85 million to $95 million mainly for parts and components for our fleet. we also expect our full-year 2020 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 22%.
this is a good time for me to ask spencer to provide some more details on our first quarter 2020 results, and after spencer's remarks, i'll provide a few additional comments and then we'll be happy to take your questions. spencer?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, john and hello everyone. our first quarter results are highlighted on slide six. on an adjusted basis, ebitda totaled $121.2 million with adjusted net income of $29.9 million. on a reported basis, net income was $23.4 million. our adjusted earnings in the first quarter included an effective income tax rate of 24.2%. looking at slide seven, operating revenue totaled $643.5 million in the first quarter of 2020. acmi segment revenue was lower in the first quarter, primarily from a decrease in flying driven by the redeployment of 747-400 aircraft to charter as well as the customer flight cancellations that john noted earlier, partially offset by an increase in 777, 737 and 747-400 cmi flying. charter segment revenue during the period was higher, primarily driven by increased flying, partially offset by a decrease in the average rate per block hour. block hour volume growth primarily reflected strong demand for commercial cargo driven by the reduction of available capacity in the market, the disruption of global supply chains and the redeployment of 747-400 aircraft from acmi. this was partially offset by lower amc passenger flying as the military took precautionary measures to limit the movement of personnel. the lower average rate per block hour was primarily related to a reduction in charter capacity purchase from acmi customers that had no associated charter block hours as well as lower fuel prices. this was partially offset by an increase in commercial cargo yields excluding fuel.
a lower dry leasing segment revenue primarily reflected $22.3 million dollars of revenue in 2019 for maintenance payments related to the scheduled return of a 777 freighter. and that's the why we're operating now in charter. moving to slide eight. segment contribution totaled $113.8 million in the first quarter. acmi earnings primarily reflected increases in cmi flying and a reduction in aircraft rent and depreciation, partially offset by the redeployment of 747 aircraft to charter. acmi segment contribution was also impacted by flight cancellations and increased operating costs including premium pay for crews operating in certain areas, significantly impacted by the virus. higher charter segment contribution during the period was driven by an increase in commercial cargo yields excluding fuel, which reflected the reduction of available capacity in the market and the disruption of global supply chains. charter contribution also benefited from lower aircraft rent and depreciation and the redeployment of 747 aircraft from acmi. this was partially offset by lower military demand and the increased operating cost that we discussed earlier. in dry leasing, lower segment contribution during the quarter was primarily due to the 2019 maintenance revenue payment.
turning to slide nine, our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.4 times which is consistent with yearend 2019. we expect a nice improvement as the year progresses as we benefit from increased ebitda levels, further improve our cash balance and continue to make debt payments of approximately $70 million per quarter. we ended the first quarter of 2020 with cash including cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaling $235.6 million compared with $114.3 million at the end of 2019. our improved cash position reflected cash provided by operating, investing and financing activities. net cash provided by investing activities during the quarter, primarily related to proceeds from the disposal of nonessential assets, partially offset by core capital expenditures, spare engines and upgrade kits. net cash provided by financing activities, primarily reflected proceeds from debt refinancing and from our revolving credit facility, partially offset by payments on debt obligations. in march, as a precautionary measure due to the uncertainty from the pandemic, we drew $75 million under the revolving credit facility and had $19.8 million of unused availability as of march 31.
as a reminder, our debt has a low weighted average coupon rate, which is now 3.2% and the vast majority is secured by our aircraft assets which have a value in excess of the related debt. to mitigate the impact of any continuation or worsening of the pandemic, we have significantly reduced nonessential employee travel, limited ground staff hiring and the use of contractors, implemented a number of other cost-reduction initiatives across the company and taken other actions, such as the sale of the nonessential assets. we don't have any firm aircraft purchase commitments and we remain committed to a strong balance sheet.
now i'd like to turn it back to john.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, spencer and moving to slide 10 and as i said earlier, safety is our top priority. we're focused on continuing to support our pilots, our ground staff and customers through this challenging time and we're taking extensive precautions to safeguard all our employees. our first quarter results exceeded our expectations which was the result of our team's executing tirelessly in a challenging operating environment and i'm humbled by their dedication. we're seeing strong demand for airfreight into the second quarter, but we also remain mindful of the evolving and uncertain environment and the importance of financial management. atlas plays a vital role in supporting the global economy and our customers by keeping goods moving and we're very grateful to do our part to continue to provide relief to communities and businesses in the fight against covid-19. with our exceptionally talented team of employees and sound financial structure along with the diversified portfolio, atlas continues to be well positioned to take advantage of market conditions, navigate through this pandemic and leverage the scale of our global operations to further capitalize on business opportunities.
with that, we're happy to take your questions. and operator, may we have the first question please.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from bob labick of cjs securities.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
good morning. congratulations on another strong quarter.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, bob.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
i wanted to start -- maybe we've talked about it a little bit in the past on kind of new long-term charter agreements. maybe we can dig in a little further. can you give us a sense, are you locking up more capacity for the long term? are you simply shifting kind of acmi into charter? because they're kind of blending? how does this position atlas for the next few years in terms of your capacity under longer term agreements, your ability to move planes around, your total utilization, how does it impact your future earnings power by going into these long-term charter agreements?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
so, i'll start, bob, and thank you. what we're trying to do is strike the right balance. the long-term charter agreements do provide us long term benefit, as we said, at attractive rates. and acmi is at the core of our business model. but we also want to ensure that we preserve enough capacity to take advantage of the market and the extraordinary market that we're seeing right now. so, it's striking that delicate balance with secure, attractive long-term customers, and we're seeing a blend, prior aircraft that have been in acmi are being used for the long-term charters, and we're also drawing from the charter pool as well. again, looking at the market and longer term, while we'll always be attracted to the acmi part of the business, it's an exceptional charter market right now as well. so, we're going to be very judicious about with whom we lock in with over what period of time and what rates to be able to enjoy the strength of both, and that's really where we're at.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and bob, it's spencer. i'll just add that as we talked about in the release, and earlier, we added several more of these long-term commercial charter agreements. we added them throughout the second and third quarters. they're now up to three years in length, and they go through the end of 2023. and there are a lot of similarities between these long-term charters and our acmi segment. there are differences in that -- it's priced differently. so, it's priced on a per charter basis rather than per hour or on a monthly basis like acmi would be. and atlas pays for fuel and then fuel is included in the charter price. so, there are fairly minor differences between the 2. but -- so, they're similar and as john said, these provide predictable, reliable revenue and earnings streams. so we're really pleased with them.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
okay. that sounds great. and then for my last question. i just wanted to ask about cmi growth. obviously, nice to hear three more planes with amazon under cmi contracts. can you talk about the availability of planes or freighters out there right now and of pilots and your ability to grow cmi going forward given the market dynamics?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
sure. with regard to the availability of pilots, we're in a very good position there. the available pool of pilots is actually quite strong. unfortunately, on the passenger side of the business, certain carriers have closed their doors and others, as you've seen, have gone through significant reductions and furloughs. and so, we're quite well positioned to bring on pilots. with regard to planes, we'll continue to monitor the market. as you've seen, we've brought capacity back in for ourselves. and to the extent, there are opportunities elsewhere in the market, which we expect there will be. you have, again, some of the passenger carriers putting their aircraft down. are there conversion candidates out there, the 767 is a great airplane, the 737-800 is a great airplane. so, between availability of aircraft for ourselves and for our customers, we expect there to be cmi opportunities as we go forward.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and atlas has -- i'll just add briefly to that. atlas has advantages. we have route rights, traffic rights, overfly, landing, parking. we have various abilities that perhaps other carriers do not. we have those abilities for all types of aircraft. and we have know-how, and we have scale advantage that perhaps other operators don't. and so, those are all benefits of the cmi service that we offer.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, bob.

our next question comes from david ross from stifel. your line is open.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
yes. good morning, gentlemen.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, david.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
i have a question, wanted to talk about the military line. typically, that's, say, 50% of charter, what is it now? and what's your best guess for 2021? what's the military telling you on the demand coming back?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
so, thanks, david. yes, the military flying, particularly on the passenger side, has been lighter than we anticipated coming into 2020 and covid, certainly with the sop movement order, the government had -- the dod had put in place had considerably impacted the passenger business. that is starting to come back. and frankly, as you may recall, we mentioned in a prior call that while the passenger military business had slowed, it was actually an opportunity for us to take those crews that we would otherwise serve with the military and deploy them to our cargo operations, which was seeing a significant increase in demand. so, we're able to take advantage of that and get higher utilization while hiring up in the meantime to prepare for the return of the military business, which we're now starting to see. it's not back to where we expected and where the prior levels were, but we expect by next year. and certainly, a vaccine will have an impact on that, but it's gradually coming back.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
so, would you say military move down from 50% of the business to 1/3 of the business in charter?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
roughly. that's a fair estimate.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
and then quickly on the titan jv, how does that -- i guess, how do you see that progressing over the next several years. how does it impact the earnings of atlas? and does it change the business model at all, whereby maybe the jv owns the plane and rather than atlas? or is that not how it's structured?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think it's -- the way i'm looking at it is very complementary to our business. in terms of changing the business model, i'm not sure it will result in significant change. it will allow us to grow in the dry leasing space, and we also have the operating leverage that atlas actually could be a customer of the jv. and that's an opportunity to continue to grow. so, we'll be getting revenue streams, not only from the dry leasing, but also from managing the fleet of the jv. that's one of the areas of expertise that atlas and titan bring to the table. certainly, bain will enjoy the benefits of the dry leasing business, and we feel good about the timing of entering the market, and our ability to take advantage of freighter centric opportunities as they go for. so,i think there's multiple benefits to us. the management fees, the participation on the equity side of the aircraft ownership and leasing as well as the leverage to operate certain assets for the venture. so we're excited about it.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
our next question comes from scott group of wolfe research. your line is open.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks. good morning, guys.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
hi, scott.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
so, when i look at the fourth quarter guidance, i think it's -- sorry, if there's background noise, i don't know if that's me. when i look at the fourth quarter guidance, i think it's the smallest sequential increase in earnings we've seen in like 10 years. and maybe just talk through some of the assumptions there. it feels like airfreight pricing is really picking up. what are you assuming on rates? and then can i just lump into that on the maintenance side, you raised the maintenance expense guidance again, how should we think about maintenance next year?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, scott, this is spencer. so, let's look at the fourth quarter first, and then we'll talk about maintenance. so, for the fourth quarter of this year compared to the fourth quarter of last year, certainly, commercial charter yields and volumes are -- we expect will be higher, but they are partially offset by higher heavy maintenance costs. we expect heavy maintenance costs to be about $27 million higher. and then last year, in the fourth quarter, we had a really large refund of excess rent payments, it was $27.6 million. so, two pretty big items there. and then in addition to that, this year, we have premiums that we're paying our crew for flying into certain areas heavily impacted by covid-19, and then there's the pay increase, the 10% crew pay increase that we provided. and as john just talked about, lower military cargo volumes. and certainly, passenger volumes are down this year versus the prior year. so all that being said, still it's growth over the prior year, but there are clearly some big offsets.
now, i'll talk about yields, and then i'll answer your maintenance question. we expect the fourth quarter charter yields to remain above sort of normal historical fourth quarter level, reflecting the strength of the market. as well as continued capacity constraints and just overall demand for atlas as services. we don't expect rates to reach where they were, the levels we saw in the second quarter. especially, april and early may. but it's important to note that we talked about the long-term charters. much of our fourth quarter capacity has been committed to those long-term charter contracts. we still have capacity available to serve the ad hoc spot market, and we could take advantage of yield increases, so if there are yield increases that aren't contemplated in our forecast, then we'll talk about those next quarter. as far as heavy maintenance goes, with regard to heavy maintenance, i think looking forward, i just wanted to point out that we expect next year, 2021 heavy maintenance cost to be at least probably a little bit more than $60 million lower than this year.
and we previously expected 2021 was going to be a very heavy year in terms of, especially engine overhauls, but also some airframe check requirements. and we have the opportunity to accelerate some of the engine inductions into this year. and we got -- we've talked about the availability of maintenance slots. because the passenger carriers are not operating as much. and then we received pricing discounts from our vendors as a result. so, should bring 2021 heavy maintenance closer to a sort of normal run rate, although it still may be a little higher than 2018 or 2019 average. so hopefully, that answered both your questions, scott.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
yes, all very helpful. i was asking about the third quarter to fourth quarter progression. any thoughts there? that's -- it's typically up more third to fourth. that was more of my question. i understand some of the year ago headwinds for fourth.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes. scott, it's john. thanks. and i'll let spencer provide any further color. but i think it's important to note that this third quarter was an extraordinary third quarter given where we are in the pandemic, and we have been experiencing what i'll describe as peak level, levels of utilization as well as rates, which contributed to a very strong, if not record, third quarter. so, that the incremental leap into a typical fourth quarter may not be as great because of that factor alone. it speaks to just the overall market. and as spencer pointed out, there will be some upside on rates for sure. but we've been operating at pretty high levels throughout the third quarter, which makes that comparison a little bit narrower.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i'll -- so talking sequentially, third quarter this year versus fourth quarter this year. so, we'll have higher commercial charter earnings. we will have lower heavy maintenance costs. those will be partially offset by non heavy maintenance. we have one more landing gear event, and we have some higher apus, auxiliary power unit maintenance events. so, a little bit higher there. and then military earnings, both cargo impact should be lower. cargo and passenger should be lower in the fourth quarter, as john noted. but then we expect that to be better next year.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's all fair about the higher starting point. all right. thank you, guys.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, scott.
operator
our next question comes from chris stathoulopoulos of susquehana. your line is open.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my question.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, christopher.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
john or spencer, just, if you could, what is the weighted average duration of your contract business? and then what percent of your charter does it move on contract now? or is closer to the spot market?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so, our typical acmi contract is somewhere between two and five years. but then obviously, we have much longer duration contracts with dhl and with amazon, for example. so they vary. and the long-term charter contracts, i mentioned the duration there, they go up to three years in length. and so, we're starting to use a lot of our capacity with these longer-term arrangements, which is great from a predictable, reliable nature of our revenue and our earnings streams, and they're really good contracts. so, there's some left. i don't know the exact percentage because it's not quite that simple because it's not always an aircraft. it can be a portion of an aircraft or one flight a week or that kind of thing. so, it's a smaller portion that is currently available in the ad hoc sort of spot charter market. but there's still some available.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
okay. and that smaller portion as a percent of charter or your overall book of business, is that low single digits?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. we'll have to get back to you on that. i don't have the exact percentage, but it's definitely a smaller portion with these longer-term charter contracts that we've entered into. again, it's not simple. might think it's just this aircraft divided by total number of aircraft, but it really doesn't work that way. it may be a rotation or maybe a portion of rotation. so it's calculation is a bit more complex.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and if i could, chris, so it's a bit fluid as well. to the extent in this current environment, we have acmi agreements that are rolling off. we mentioned some of the long-term charters. but there are a number of acmi opportunities that we may want to time to a later date because the charter market is so robust right now. and so, that ties in with my comment on the balancing act that we're doing. our focus is on the opportunities we have in front of us right now, near and long term. so, may be a situation where there's an acmi customer that typically we would sign for on a longer-term basis, but maybe we'll forgo for a period of time due to the very robust market, and we're going to -- we're watching all those dynamics closely but right now, it's very favorable market conditions for the charter business, both near and on these long-term charters.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and chris, just to provide just a sort of a ballpark. it's really, as john said, quite fluid and not an exact science, but it's approximately 5% of total atlas capacity.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
okay. so, second question, and i realize you probably want to wait until january to talk about 2021 guidance. but given where we are with covid, this is obviously a very unique opportunity here for freighter operators. you have around half of the capacity that you typically compete with effectively on the sideline. the rollout of the vaccine looks like a multiyear event. ample feedstock and e-commerce demand, that looks like it's been pulled forward a few years. so if we look at what you guided for an ebitda for 4q and that would put up your implied 2020 in the double digits. is it reasonable to assume that you could realize positive ebitda growth next year. assuming we have a vaccine in the first half and the dod lifts its travel restriction orders?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so, it's the right question, a good question. we'll provide our next year guidance, early next year, in february. but i'll point out some things and you did as well. certainly, we do not expect that yields will be like they were in the second quarter of this year. we wouldn't expect to see that again next year. of course, that could change, but we wouldn't expect something like that. of course, with covid, things are changing constantly. so it's all subject to change. but the key things, i think, or some of the key things, i think, to keep in mind, and some of them, you mentioned, of course, we should expect to have lower maintenance expense, as i talked about, over $60 million lower. the vaccine distribution certainly seems like it's going to go on, as you said, chris, for quite some time. and that's going to have quite an impact in airfreight.
there are continued capacity constraints, and we really don't see those changing for quite some time. the utilization that we get on our aircraft has been increasing, and we expect that to continue to be the case. we have a very modern, efficient fleet. we don't have like the fleeting needs, things like that. these long-term charter contracts with really attractive yields are terrific. all of our customers are looking to add capacity right now. and airfreight has -- it's always vital to the global economy. but especially now. and then i would just say that, again, there's really not much production coming out from the major manufacturers. and so, we expect the supply demand imbalance to still have stronger demand than supply. and the growth of express and e-commerce, i mean, that is not going away anytime soon. the diversity of our business and our fleet that john talked about, and just the capabilities and relationships that we have developed and continue to service. those things will serve us well next year and beyond.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
okay. good color. if i could get one more in. with respect to capital allocation, i believe you can't do buybacks here under the terms of the psp and correct me if i'm wrong, i don't think you took anything under the lp under cares, but should we think that you're throwing off a lot of cash here. should we expect that you're going to start to grow the fleet or continue to deliver?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, chris. yes, it's all of the above. we're looking at everything. we're in a position where if there's aircraft available that fit with our needs and our growth needs. we'll be in a position to look at that. of course, in terms of continuing to pay down debt, that's going to be hugely important, as we -- spencer talked about, ensuring we maintain our balance sheet. we need to be cautious to a degree. i mean, with what lies beyond, while we're very confident and optimistic on 2021. i can't stress enough the tremendous effort all our employees are putting forward and managing through this covid environment. i mean we look in europe, for example, i mentioned border restrictions. and almost overnight, we're seeing changes and the ability to adapt and what's going to happen with the overall economy. we feel really good of it for -- based on all the comments that we talked about as we look forward to 2021. but we're also going to be mindful of what lies beyond and be assured that we can weather anything that may come our way.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
okay. thanks for the time.

our next question comes from helane becker of cowen. your line is now open.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
sorry, i mute. hi, everybody. thanks for your time. i just have a couple of questions. so the first question was, did you respond to representative of clyburn's letter asking you to return the cares act funds that you did take? i think the response was to see by monday.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes. yes, we did, helane.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
and how are you thinking about that?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
so, look, we put a lot of thought into even applying for the cares act funds. i'll start by saying we were fully qualified and are in full compliance with the cares act in receiving the funds. it was with a lot of deliberation because there's no question our circumstances are somewhat different than the passenger side, obviously, with what we're talking about. but what we evaluated was kind of the totality of our circumstances, including some of the challenges that presented itself immediately when covid hit. there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty. china effectively shut down not only during lunar new year, but for weeks thereafter, for which we experienced a significant impact on our business.
i also talked -- just now i'm talking with chris about what lies beyond, so all those factors went into our contemplation to apply for and ensure that we're using the funds for the purposes in which they're intended, and that was for payroll support. and then we're in full compliance. and we shared that with the chairman in response to our letters. so, based on the totality, not only do we apply for when we're eligible for -- in this program, which i should add is not a needs-based program. it was not something that we had to demonstrate our need to be able to pay on payroll. but for all those reasons, we not only applied for received, but we are not intending to return the funds, and we responded accordingly and have been in full compliance, not only with the committee's request, but sharing the documents and so forth that they've asked for, and we'll continue to fully cooperate.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you for that detailed answer. i really appreciate it. and then the other question i had is, why do you think amazon exercised the warrants, aside from the fact that they were in the money. so i guess, it made sense for them to do that. but i mean, have they talked to you about, i don't know, increasing their position about -- i think their board seat is an observer, not an official board seat. have they talked to you about getting more active in the company. i mean what do you think is behind that?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
so, i have a bias because i think it's just a great investment and a great company. but i don't speak for amazon. i can't speak for them. they -- we have not talked to them about the reasons, and i'm not going to speculate as to that. so we just think it's a great -- i just think it's a great investment.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
okay. that's very helpful. thank you very much.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, helane.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst

our next question comes from barry haimes of sage asset management. your line is open.
barry haimes -- sage asset management -- analyst
thank you so much for taking my question. you mentioned that you were looking at possibly adding to the fleet and that there could be conversion opportunities. could you give us a feel for sort of minimum hurdle rates, roic, however you choose to look at it, that would make sense for you to go forward with situations like that? thanks.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, barry. it's spencer. we take a really disciplined approach to deploying our capital. and we set really aggressive return targets. so, as john talked about, balance sheet strength and leverage reduction remain our top priority. but we are looking at a number of potential investments and the expected returns. so, we target low to mid-teens after tax irrs for our dry leasing portfolio. for other projects, including operating aircraft, which is i think what you're asking about, return targets are really set based on the individual sort of risk profile depending upon the particular situation. but in all cases, we target double-digit percentage returns. our 747-8, for those who remember when we brought those in. they generated an irr north of 20%. when we got into starting to fly passengers. our passenger fleet investment generated pretty similar returns north of 20%. those types of returns are not always achievable, but our targets remain really aggressive. and we make sure we achieve those.
barry haimes -- sage asset management -- analyst
great. i appreciate your colors. thank you.

our next question comes from david campbell of thompson davison company. your line is open.
david campbell -- thompson davison company -- analyst
hello, thanks for taking my question. you've talked a lot about this, but i just wanted to clarify it a little bit. there's new contract charter agreements, long-term agreements. and apparently, it looks like based on the third quarter results, have resulted in no increase in your cargo charter yields per block hour, which were flat in the third quarter, and i guess, will be even lower than that in the fourth quarter, as you have more of these agreements in effect. so i don't see how a flat or down yield picture in terms of the revenue per block hour, how that's helpful? i realize in the long term, you got -- you guys source of stable revenue. but how does it get you to increase earnings?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, david, it's spencer. let me just -- the issue, i think you're looking at on a revenue per block hour. and the issue is fuel is included in that and fuel dropped 40% on a year-over-year basis. fuel in the third quarter of last year was $2.27 a gallon. this year, $1.35. so that's really, i think, clouding the picture that you're looking at. if you were to exclude fuel, what you'd see is our revenue per block hour would have been up to $2,000 to $3,000 a block hour. and these new long-term charter agreements, if you take a look at the segment contribution, the profitability of our charter segment improved over 1,200% on a year-over-year basis. so, i think fuel, decrease in fuel, i think, is quietly what you're looking at.
david campbell -- thompson davison company -- analyst
yes. i see fuel has something to do with that. i wasn't sure how much so, you obviously clarified that. the second question i had was do you -- obviously, it doesn't sound like you see any slowdown in demand relative to the third quarter, but i've heard that there's been some slowdown in demand. and i just wondered whether you've seen any change in your overall picture for demand for cargo space?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes, david, thanks. we do not see any slowdown in demand and particularly for the fourth quarter, we see an increase in demand and what we're looking at -- what we talked about for 2021, we expect these favorable market conditions to continue into the future based on some of the dynamics that are in play, and which we don't expect to change for some time.
david campbell -- thompson davison company -- analyst
thank you very much. i appreciate it.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question comes from scott group with wolfe research. your line is open.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys thanks for the follow ups. how should we think about the tightening and long-term impact on capex? does this lower the long-term capex that we should expect atlas to spend?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, scott, we'll be sharing in that. so, atlas' responsibility is 10%. bain's responsibility is 90%, and that is of the equity portion, that part that's not going to be covered by debt. so, i guess, if you look at it that way, yes, bain is now very important, very large joint venture partner with atlas to grow the dry lease part of our freighter leasing business.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and i think, if i could, spencer in that, this venture is not the only entity through which we may invest. there may be assets that don't fit the profile of the purpose of the joint venture that we may be interested in. so, i think part of the answer is we'll see. we're going to be very judicious on where we spend our capital, but it's not the only vehicle.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
right. but i'm looking at this right, right? you've gone from, i don't know, less than 10 planes to 30 planes in charter in the last five years. so that's been a big part of your capex.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
some of those planes moved from acmi, and they're, again, very similar to acmi. they have slight differences, which moved them into the charter segment. but they're very similar. so some of those just moved over from one segment to the other based on the nature of how the customer is charged and who pays for fuel and things like that.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then just lastly, do you think that you'll directly participate in vaccine distribution? and can you give us the new share on the military business that just reset in the fourth quarter?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
i'm sorry, you broke up a little bit on the first part of that question.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
second part was entitlement. i'll take that. and i think the first part...
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
do you think you'll directly participate in the vaccine?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i'll answer that. yes, we do. in one form or another. i mean, there's been a lot of discussion as to whether or not some of that will be done by the government. some of it will be done by the manufacturers. you have the administration saying the military is going to be responsible. but we believe whatever form it takes, that our capacity is going to be a part of that, and we'll continue to work with our customers, both government and commercial, in being available and prioritizing our assets to help as soon as we can.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and then, scott, the second part of your question, i think, was share or what the military calls entitlement. we continue to be the largest outsourced provider to the u.s. military with regard to large wide-body aircraft. our entitlement on both the passenger as well as cargo side is between 53% and 54%.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from chris stathoulopoulos of susquehanna. your line is open.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
so, just continuing with scott's question on capex and bain here, maybe looking at it from a different angle. but if you could, given what we're seeing on the passenger side of things, all the asset dislocation, retirements, the move toward fleet simplification. could you comment on what you're seeing on asset prices on the medium to wide-body 767, 747s or the 777s. and then on the chain maybe would you be willing to look outside of boeing and perhaps into some of the airbus? thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
so, i'll start with the last question and say that, sure, on the airbus product, what our position has been is, for the most part, we're fleet agnostic. if the demand is there, we have the operating capabilities to operate them. we've got a depth of experience of people who have both on the maintenance and flight op side who have flown and maintained airbus product. it's a great company, great airplanes. generally speaking, though, boeing has had the market on freighters. but i think that you're seeing some of that change. with the a330, for example, that's now in the market on a converted basis, some express carriers are flying those and the a320s that may be coming into the market. so, sure. if the demand is there, we would certainly entertain that.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
and then on the asset prices, have you seen rates come down for 18 or 20-year-old vintage 767, 747 i know delta is retiring a 767 fleet. there just seems to be a lot of opportunity on the passenger side, i guess, depending on where their fleet needs are and certainly where their balance sheet is.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. really -- chris, it really depends on an asset-by-asset basis. it really depends how good the engines are, how much life is left in the engines before its next overhaul. the particular aircraft, the vintage of the aircraft and so forth. it really depends if it's a passenger to be converted, then it's really the engines often that are being sought after, of course, as well as the airframe. if it's an aircraft that's on lease, what are the terms of the lease that's attached to it and so forth. so, it really is on a case-by-case basis. we've seen a lot of inconsistencies, let's just say that.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
and if i could add to that, i think there's also the factor of what the market will be going forward. i think the cares act has provided some cushion and some of the other financings that the passenger carriers have done has provided some cushion for them before they have to take too drastic of measures on the fleet. i think all carriers, the industry is looking to how quickly they can bring back assets. and i think there's more to come on that, given how long the pandemic lasts. there may be some more pricing pressure if this lasts much further into the future.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
okay. and then spencer balance sheet cash flow, two questions here. working capital outside of high credit customers, amazon and dhl. any color on credit quality as we move down the spectrum of customers? or is anyone asking for deferrals? and then also, what's left on your revolver and what maturities do you have due in 2021 and 2022?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. thank you. let's see, three questions there. so, the first, with regard to our receivables, we have outstanding, outstanding customers. on the acmi front, they're all pretty much household names. very, very strong credits, and we have no issues there. in the charter space, these long-term charters are obviously, all household names, but some of the spot -- ad hoc spot charters, they generally pay in advance. so, we really haven't had collectibility issues. so, we're very, very fortunate that way, we do a great job. our team does a great job managing those risks. your second question...
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
revolver.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
revolver. that's right. sorry. we have $200 million available under our revolver. and then with regard to maturities, maturities of acmi contracts. so, we have had some maturities with our acmi contracts. we typically have a handful of year generally, those that are being renewed are typically being renewed at higher rates in this environment.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
i was asking on the maturities on the debt side. if there's anything that is coming due?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. okay. thank you. sorry. we have a convertible note that comes due in june of 2022, a $224.5 million. nothing out of the ordinary just normal principal interest payments between now and then.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
okay, thank you.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the third quarter 2020 earnings call for atlas air worldwide. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the call over to atlas air. please go ahead.
ed mcgarvey -- senior vice president and treasurer

[operator instructions]
at this point, i'd like to draw your attention to slide three and turn the call over to john dietrich.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ed, and hello, everyone. welcome to our third quarter earnings call. thanks for joining us. i'd like to start by thanking all our employees and frontline workers around the world for their unwavering efforts during this covid-19 battle in what continues to be a complex, challenging and evolving environment. on behalf of everyone at atlas, i want to express my sincere hope that you, your families and friends continue to stay safe during this pandemic. i'm very proud of the important role atlas is playing in responding to covid-19 globally. air cargo has always been a vital component in the global supply chain as it provides speed, security and reliability that is unmatched by other modes of transportation. we at atlas, remain committed to moving the goods the world needs most, including medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, e-commerce and other manufacturing and consumer products. over the last several years, we've strengthened and diversified our business and our fleet with a focus on serving express, e-commerce and the fastest-growing global markets. this pandemic is driving acceleration in e-commerce as people increasingly turn to online shopping to support their everyday needs. the size and diversity of our fleet, positions us well to continue to serve our customers both regionally and internationally.
our 747 and 777 freighters are in great demand for long-haul international flying, and our 767 and 737 freighters are actively serving regional and domestic markets. we're also preparing for our expected role in the timely distribution of vaccines, once they become available. the steps we've taken enable us to maximize the opportunities we're seeing today as well as those in the years ahead. as spencer and i will share further with you today, the structural change in airfreight capacity caused by covid-19 has presented meaningful opportunities for our company. but those opportunities also have come with significant operational hurdles as well as additional costs. the performance we're delivering this year doesn't just happen on its own. it's been made possible by our team coming together and tirelessly managing through a complex environment to provide safe operations for our employees and high-quality service for our customers. safety always comes first at atlas, and we're continuing to take wide-ranging precautions to ensure our employees remain safe while delivering goods the world needs during this difficult time. and with that mindset, we're navigating through an evolving operating and regulatory environment that includes ever-changing travel restrictions, border restrictions, increased testing and quarantine mandates, remote working and additional surges in covid-19 cases globally. now turning to our third quarter results on slide four.
and as our results reflect, the positive momentum of our business continued in the third quarter. we're seeing substantial demand for our long-haul wide-body services, both near and long-term at attractive yields. and we're leveraging the agility of our business model and the scale of our fleet and global operations to serve this increased demand. we've also continued to broaden our customer base and grow with existing customers to maximize market opportunities. we further increased our roster of long-term charter customers, including the recent addition of china, the logistics arm of alibaba as well as expanding with hp and several large global freight forwarders. it's important to highlight that these long-term charter agreements provide secure and attractive revenue streams. we've also expanded operations for amazon, where we began flying three additional 737 freighter since september. we're now operating 8, 737s for amazon, complementing the large fleet of 767s that we have with them. these expanded businesses, deepen our strategic position in the fast growing e-commerce sector, as well as in important global markets like china and south america. and as mentioned in our press release today, we're also excited about a significant development in our joint venture between our titan dry-leasing subsidiary and bain capital credit.
the joint venture has arranged $500 million in financing facilities. this important step will enable it to serve the strong market demand for freighters. in addition, our third quarter results benefited from strong demand and higher yields, the significant and ongoing reduction of passenger belly capacity in the market, lower aircraft rent and depreciation and lower fuel prices. these benefits were partially offset by higher maintenance expense related to additional engine overhauls, we performed to take advantage of attractive vendor pricing and slot availability. as well as higher pilot costs related to the premium pay, we've been providing our pilots for operating into certain areas outside the u.s. that have been significantly impacted by covid-19, and as well as the 10% pay increase, we provided to our pilots in may, pending the completion of our joint collective bargaining agreement. as i've mentioned, we're operating in a very favorable airfreight market, but we also recognize the uncertainty in front of us. and because of that, we're taking steps today that will position our company for continued success as we move forward. this begins with aggressively managing our costs in every aspect of our business and being prudent stewards of our balance sheet. and we remain focused on ensuring that our assets and resources are allocated to opportunities that generate the best returns. now moving on to slide five and our outlook.
looking to the fourth quarter, and subject to any material covid-19 developments, we anticipate solid volumes and yields driven by continued e-commerce growth and year-end freight -- airfreight demand, coupled with the ongoing reduction of passenger belly capacity in the market. to meet customer demand, we're reactivating our fourth 747 freighter that had been previously part. this will add to the 3, 747 freighters and the 777 we placed back into service during the second quarter. as a result, we anticipate fourth quarter adjusted net income to grow approximately 25% compared with adjusted net income of $82.7 million in the third quarter of this year. we're also expecting to fly approximately 95,000 block hours in the fourth quarter with about 65% of those in acmi and the remainder in charter. we anticipate fourth quarter revenue of about $850 million and adjusted ebitda of approximately $215 million. maintenance expense for the fourth quarter is expected to total approximately $116 million, with depreciation and amortization totaling about $65 million. and core capital expenditures, which exclude aircraft and engine purchases, are projected to be approximately $25 million to $35 million, mainly for parts and components for our fleet. on a full year basis, we now expect revenue of approximately $3.1 billion and adjusted ebitda of about $780 million. we also expect our full year 2020 adjusted effective income tax rate to be approximately 23%. this is a good time for me to ask spencer to provide our third quarter results.
and after spencer makes his remarks, i look forward to providing a few additional comments, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. spencer?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, john, and hello, everyone. our third quarter results are highlighted on slide 6. on an adjusted basis, ebitda totaled $196.3 million with adjusted net income of $82.7 million. on a reported basis, net income was $74.1 million. our adjusted effective income tax rate was 22.8%. moving to the top of slide 7. operating revenue totaled $809.9 million in the quarter. acmi revenue primarily reflected an increase in the average revenue per block hour and increased flying. block hour volume grew due to increased aircraft utilization, which was driven by strong demand for freighter aircraft. reflecting the reduction of available cargo capacity and the disruption of global supply chains due to covid-19. that was partially offset by the redeployment of 747-400 aircraft to charter. higher charter revenue during the period was primarily driven by increased flying, partially offset by a lower average rate per block hour due to lower fuel costs. block hour volume growth primarily reflected strong demand for freighter aircraft, driven by the reduction of available cargo capacity in the market, the disruption of global supply chains, the redeployment of 747-400 aircraft from cmi and a 777 aircraft from dry leasing and our ability to increase aircraft utilization. and dry leasing rate primarily related to changes in leases and the disposition of certain nonessential aircraft during the first quarter of this year. looking now at the bottom of the slide. segment contribution totaled $189.1 million in the third quarter. acmi earnings primarily reflected increased utilization and a reduction in aircraft rent and depreciation.
these benefits were partially offset by higher pilot costs, including premium pay for operating in certain areas and the 10% pay increase resulting from our recent interim agreement. higher heavy maintenance expense, including additional engine overhauls to take advantage of availability and pricing discounts and the redeployment of 747-400 aircraft to charter that i just noted. higher charter contribution during the period was driven by an increase in commercial cargo yields, excluding fuel, strong demand for freighters and our ability to increase aircraft utilization. charter contribution also benefited from lower aircraft rent depreciation and the redeployment of aircraft from acmi and dry leasing. these benefits were partially offset by higher heavy maintenance expense and higher pilot costs. in dry leasing, lower segment contribution during the quarter was primarily due to changes in leases and the disposition of certain nonessential aircraft during the first quarter. before we move to the next slide, i'd like to comment on another recent development that we shared in our press release this morning. on october 9, amazon elected a cashless exercise with respect to approximately 3.6 million shares vested under our warrant issued in 2016. as a result, amazon acquired approximately 1.3 million shares, which represented approximately 4.99% of our outstanding common stock after the exercise. now turning to slide 8. as the slide shows, our net debt and net leverage ratio continued to improve during the third quarter.
our net leverage ratio decreased another 0.5 turn from 3.0 times at the end of the second quarter to 2.5 times at the end of the third quarter, and we expect further improvement at year-end as we benefit from increased ebitda levels, a strong cash balance and maintaining debt payments of approximately $70 million per quarter. we ended the third quarter of 2020 with cash, including cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments, totaling $729.3 million compared with $114.3 million at the end of 2019. our improved cash balance at september 30, primarily reflected cash provided by operating activities and also included the funds we received through the cares act. net cash used for financing activities primarily related to payments on debt obligations, including our revolving credit facility, partially offset by debt issuances. net cash used for investing activities primarily related to core capital expenditures, spare engines and upgrade kits, partially offset by proceeds from the disposition of certain nonessential aircraft and engines. as a reminder, our debt has a low weighted average coupon rate of 3%, and the vast majority is secured by our aircraft assets, which have a value in excess of the related debt. we remain committed to a strong balance sheet, and we are taking actions to mitigate the impact of any continuation or worsening of the pandemic by reducing costs, enhancing liquidity and strategically allocating our resources.
now i'd like to turn it back to john.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, spencer. and moving to slide 9. 2020 certainly has been an unprecedented year, and the third quarter was no different. our team continues to step up and execute in a complex and challenging operating environment. we expect volumes and yields in the fourth quarter to be driven by continued e-commerce growth and year-end airfreight demand, coupled with the ongoing reduction of passenger belly capacity in the market. we'll continue to take every precaution to protect our employees and operations to ensure we're ready to respond to customer demand and deliver the goods the world needs most. with our talented team world-class fleet, strong balance sheet and agile business model, we'll continue to deliver high-quality service for our customers and solid results for our investors in these uncertain times and beyond.
so with that, operator, i'd like to take the first question, please.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of bob labick with cjs securities. your line is now open. good morning, congratulations on, just terrific execution and a fantastic year.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thanks bob.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, bob.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
i wanted to start the discussion with talking about the 747-8s. it's a pretty exciting opportunity for you to get four more of them. can you talk a little about the demand environment out there? have you talked to customers, are there inquiries? when would you expect to tell us about customers i guess and will these be going into acmi charter or have you decided on that yet.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, look bob, i think we're excited about the acquisition as you know, we like the aircraft very much, it's performed exceptionally well for us. and we expect there will be continued demand for that aircraft. what we find in good times and in tougher times, the best, most efficient aircraft are the ones that remain flying, and the 747-8 will certainly be that. and in terms of where we're going to place them, we're going to continue to evaluate that. we have ongoing discussions in every segment and we're going to do what makes best for the -- for the organization once that time comes on delivery, but we're excited about the opportunities.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
okay, super. and then just kind of following up on that, you mentioned the $265 million of aircraft parts and purchase commitments, including the pdps for the 747-8s. but you also just mentioned the -- i don't if it is the right word but we have seen the amount of cash, the $850 million plus on the balance sheet. so what are the other uses of cash given that just this fantastic cash generation this year and what we expect next year going forward.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thank you, bob. so we have a capital allocation strategy. it remains disciplined and balanced. our focus continues to be on growing the business while generating returns above our cost of capital and maintaining a strong balance sheet. there are a number of things that we continue to look at when we look at each opportunity kind of on its own. we evaluate each opportunity when it comes to deploying capital. we set pretty aggressive return targets. and as john said, balance sheet strength and continuing to maintain low levels of leverage remain our top priority. but beyond that, we will continue to evaluate investments like we did for the 747-8s.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
okay, super. thanks very much. i'll get back in queue.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thanks bob.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of chris stathoulopoulos with susquehana. your line is now open.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
good morning, everyone.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
hi chris.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
john, spencer, i appreciate -- yeah, i understand you not wanting to give guidance around covid due to uncertainty. but i think it's important here you know for investors at least to -- to help us frame about getting through this year against what is clearly a tough comp on ebitda, and a really unique operating environment. so on the international side or the long haul widebody side, you know you have your competitive capacity effectively sidelined, let's say for two to three more years. i would expect amc and commercial charter flying to improve as the vaccine is more distributed. and you also have opportunity, i don't know if you want to speak to this, but the 11 new amazon planes that that they purchased in january, whether you are looking to bid on those.
so just putting those together and even if we assume that we have a labor deal sometime in the back half of this year, thoughts around getting through this environment and then maybe a part b and sort of related to that, john, you've been in this seat now here for a year. i'm curious if there is anything you've learned about kind of running this airline you know with an operating playbook that that really doesn't exist because of covid and whether there's any new opportunities here that you realized in terms of cost savings or that on a per-block hour basis or network productivity. thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, chris. and i'll start with that last question, in terms of what i've learned of -- it's been a great exciting 14 months almost. and the one thing i've learned is that we've got the best team of employees in the business and we have been able to execute in a remarkably complex and challenging environment on every front. that's just about every regulatory challenge, operational challenge, or throw in some weather challenges along the way as well, spikes in demand and this team has stepped up and executed on all cylinders in every front, and that's the strength of our team and our resilient business model that we've talked often about.
and chris, you've been you've been following us a long time. we have often said that we are well positioned both in general more challenging times, but as we're seeing now well positioned to capitalize on opportunities. and working together we've delivered and executed. in terms of kind of new opportunities or other things that we're looking at and -- or have learned or developed, the new customer base. we talked about some of our long-term charter customers, we've really developed a new customer base for our aircraft in our services and that's really exciting.
spencer has talked about often, this is -- these are acmi like agreements and i think will serve the market well, serve our customers well, expanding the customer profile beyond just the historical and typical acmi customers we served in the past. that's really exciting. so you know more immediately, we have a lot of work ahead of us on the immediate horizon, as i said, we look forward to keeping you informed when we're in a better position to give more tangible guidance, but we are -- we're following the market, we're following the activities, what's happening with covid and we just look forward to continuing to deliver and we'll keep you posted when we can.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
okay. the follow-up, charter utilization was really strong here, 12.6 hours. i'm curious what point there is a limit there in terms of having to pull additional aircraft from acmi or potentially lease another aircraft. thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
so we're reviewing our fleet and our allocation of resources every day and between our acmi customers and our charter customers, and from a network standpoint, linking customers together at times to provide full utilization of the aircraft. so, it runs the whole gamut. in terms of, we've got our core acmi customers, we've got our charter customers, but there are oftentimes opportunities where a customer may say you know what i'm interested in capacity but i may not need it full-time for the full operation. can you join us with somebody else?
so our marketing team does a great job of bringing customers together to ensure we are maximizing utilization of the aircraft and also maximizing the trade lanes. so it's a combination of all those things that go into building, our total network, which is comprised of a number of sub-networks.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
okay.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'll just, just briefly add -- it's spencer, just briefly add. as you pointed out, 747-400 utilization in charter was up 51% quarter-over-quarter. this is primarily driven by really strong demand, but i'd just point out as john noted earlier, this is in the midst of the most challenging operating environment i think that we've ever seen. so it hasn't come easy, but our organization has just continued to step up to make sure that everyone is safe and that we continue operating as much as we have.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
okay, thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of scott group with wolfe research. your line is now open.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning guys.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
hey scott.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi scott.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
so i want to ask, last quarter you guys talked about $60 million of lower maintenance cost this year. is that still the right way to think about it? and then just separately of the 33 aircraft in charter, how many of those are now in long-term charter?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. let's say the first part of it was with regard to maintenance. so we did say previously during the last call that about $60 million of heavy maintenance expense was incurred in 2020. that was related or would have been incurred in 2021. so that statement is still out there. but as far as maintenance expense overall for '21, we're still evaluating that, we'll update that as the year progresses. we gave first quarter outlook for heavy maintenance expense because we want to make sure that everyone had that and it's pretty close in. but as far as the rest of the year, we'll update you as the year progresses.
and then with regard to the long-term charter question. we now have so many of these, the thing about these is it's not necessarily utilization of an entire aircraft. it may be one flight per week or something like that. sometimes it's a couple of rotation, sometimes it's -- it is the full utilization of the full aircraft. so it's slightly different, but we have now entered into so many of these contracts, they are amazing. there are just a few of them that currently terminate at the end of this year, but most go into 2022 or '23 and now some have even extended into 2024.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
and, scott, if i could. that ties in with the comments i was just making about our marketing team linking customers together. so those one-off charges and maybe one a week, ok, what's that aircraft during the rest of the week and that ties in with selling same tails to multiple customers on a long-term basis as well, in addition to the fully dedicated -- fully dedicated aircraft deals.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it's a very significant portion of our business.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
so i suppose with more of this longer-term charter, you've got more visibility and this situation with semis is clearly going to help this freight environment stay stronger. i mean, i know you're not giving guidance, but directionally, do you think there is an opportunity to grow earnings this year. [speech overlap]
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
so, like we said -- like i said, we're giving guidance at this point other than what we've shared and we look forward to getting back to you as soon as possible. we've got a lot of important work ahead of us, including following what the market is doing and continuing to allocate our resources. so, we'll look forward to giving you an update on that.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
one thing i'd just add to that, scott, as you know, yields were incredibly high in the second quarter of last year. so that's a very important thing to keep in mind. yields have continued to be above historical yield levels, but we have not seen levels like april and may of last year. we have not seen that yet.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. thank you, guys. appreciate it.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of helane becker with cowen. your line is now open.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
thank you very much, operator. hi everybody, and thanks for the time here. so i wanted to ask you a question about the leverage because spencer, you pointed out that it's down quite a bit, right? 2.1. where -- where do you think the business runs that? but what level should -- are you aiming for or how should we think about growth beyond the 747s that are coming and balance that against the balance sheet.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, so you know that we made a commitment to reduce our leverage. and as you've seen, as you said, our net leverage and our net leverage ratio have really declined and then we're going to take on some debt next year with the 747-8s before enjoying the earnings from the 747-8s. so that will presumably increase our net leverage ratio a little bit. ideally, we would like, we've always kind of targeted somewhere between 3% and 4% really much closer to the 3%, part of that range.
so, ideally, we think the business is right somewhere around there. we're happy that it's down at these levels, but it's probably right somewhere around 3% and again when we take on the 747-8s we will take on debt before enjoying the earnings. so it will take a little bit of time to catch that back up, just the way our calculation works.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
right, exactly. so are you thinking of -- how are you thinking financing those actually maybe it's the right question.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. we have a number of opportunities to finance those and we're looking at all of them. we think that the -- the bank markets are open and available to us. we think there are some potential other opportunities with -- whether it'd be ecas or public debt facilities. we think we have a bunch of options and we will pursue all of those.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
okay, that's very helpful. and i just had a maintenance related question. just to kind of bring the $117 million you're forecasting for the first quarter, is that, should we say, i mean you said '21 less than '20 and i think scott pointed out $60 million less just because you pulled out maintenance forward. is this the high watermark then, i mean normally you would do on your heavy maintenance in the first quarter anyway. so should we think about this is being like the high watermark for the year?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, we're not going to provide maintenance outlook beyond the first quarter today, but we did say that we expect it will be lower this year. and so, yes, the first quarter is -- the first quarter of this year is higher than the first quarter of last year. we have an incremental c check, we have an incremental d check, which is driving that. but we're not really going to comment beyond that, but yes if the first quarter is higher and the full year is lower, obviously there will be some catch-up. we think there will be catch-up between the first quarter and the end of the year.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
okay, thanks very much. have a nice day.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of david ross with stifel. your line is now open.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
thank you and good morning, gentlemen.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi dave.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
just a real quick clarification question on the pilot talks, you said binding arbitration starts mid-march. is that a 90-day process, and by that, do you expect the resolution by the end of 2q?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
so it is not a 90-day process. the scheduled hearings are to start in mid-march and go through the end of march. and then there are some procedural things that take place. typically what happens is the arbitrator seeks what's called post-hearing briefs. and it's kind of a summation of both sides' arguments and their case and then he takes those matters under advisement. i think the duration, how long it takes, we have under the agreements, under the collective bargaining agreements.
there is an expedited request to the arbitrator to have the decision made as soon as possible. but there is no defined timeline that's binding on the arbitrator. i think a lot of it depends on how many open issues remain to be resolved. the more issues open, the longer it may take for the arbitrator to render a decision. that all said, nothing prevents the company and the union from continuing to have discussions to try and narrow the scope of issues both before during and after arbitration and pending the ultimate outcome.
so a lot of variables go into that just like any kind of court proceedings. and there is no defined timeline per se, but i know both sides are committed to move forward. we certainly are and we're looking to get it done as soon as reasonably possible.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
excellent. and then, spencer, there's been a big change in the unallocated expense line, can you talk a little bit about that and where we should i think about that for a run rate this year?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so what's included the biggest change that's included in unallocated is the cares act grant income. so we received that money and then as we pay qualifying non-executive us salaries, wages and benefits, then we record the grant income in unallocated. so when you're looking on a period-over-period basis, that's the item that will stand out.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
so is the $20 million of a good run rate to use for the next several quarters or when does that expire, how do you think about that?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
there is about $41 million of cares act grant income to the -- cares act that will be recognized as grant income in the first quarter of this year. so we expect that that will then be fully utilized after the first quarter. so it won't be an issue as we head into the second quarter, and then you'll see sort of more normalized unallocated expenses.
david ross -- stifel -- analyst
okay, excellent. well, thank you very much guys.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of david campbell with thompson davis. your line is now open.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
david, you there?
operator
mr. campbell, if your line is on mute, please unmute your phone.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
we heard some background noise, operator. so maybe it's not quite working. maybe we move onto the next one and come back to david.
operator
certainly. our next question comes from the line of barry haimes with sage asset management. your line is now open.
barry haimes -- sage asset management -- analyst
thanks very much for taking the question. i had two really, one relative to the new planes you're buying, i'm wondering, if you looked at conversion opportunities, i would think there is a lot potentially available with finding down so much commercially. and i'm just curious how that's up and have you thought about that. and then second question, could you just remind us, i believe under the government cares act situation, you're precluded from buying your stock back for the moment. could you tell us when that restriction eases up. thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'll take the first one with regard to the new planes and the conversion opportunities. absolutely, we look -- we're looking at all opportunities. on the 747 platform, however, really the conversion market no longer exists. the freighters that are in the marketplace will be phased out over time, because they are older and the economic viability of doing 747 conversions at this time while i guess possible highly unlikely at this point.
and, but other gauges, we're looking at every opportunity, as you see from our history, we're very active in the 767 conversion market for our growth with amazon. we went out and acquired and converted those airplanes. we're also operating the 737-800 conversions that amazon took on lease on their own. and for us we view both of those aircraft types is still very attractive. we're also being very active and interested in the marketplace and how covid has impacted the passenger side of the business, to see what opportunities are out there. our titan organization, along with our titan jv is looking closely at all opportunities in the marketplace.
so whether conversion or otherwise, so we look forward to continuing to advance the titan opportunities as we go forward both from a leasing, dry leasing standpoint, but an operating standpoint as well. the 777 was recently announced as a conversion candidate. we're still looking at that one as well, nothing imminent on the horizon, but i just wanted to share that we're constantly looking at fleet opportunities. and on the cares act, spencer maybe you can give some guidance on the expiration of that commitment on share repurchases.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. and barry, before i talk about the cares act, just to add to john's comments. there hasn't been a 747-400 passenger to freighter conversion in about a decade, and as john said, we just don't expect that that's going to happen. as far as the 777-300 passenger to freighter program it will deliver its first aircraft in 2024. so it's still a number of years away.
with regard to the cares act, the share repurchase restriction ends in october of this year. i think that was your question there.
barry haimes -- sage asset management -- analyst
great, thank you.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we do have a follow-up question from the line of chris stathoulopoulos with susquehanna. your line is now open.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my follow-up. spencer, what was free cash flow ex any rent from refunds and psp1 funds?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
are you talking about during the quarter or the full-year?
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
both, if you have those handy.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
okay. so let's see, as far as the fourth quarter of the year free cash flow, which we calculate as operating cash flow less core capital expenditures was just -- short of $189 million, for the full year it was about $926 million, and amazingly for the full year, we had a new threshold operating cash flow greater than $1 billion. so we're very excited about that.
and then you were asking about the refund of excess rent. and so for the fourth quarter, that was about $6.6 million and for the full year, that was about $37 million, $38 million, $39 million, sorry.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
okay. has any of the airline sub supply for psp2?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
we have not, no.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
okay and then just going back to this, the topic of cash deployment here, which i mean this is a very unique place for atlas to be all things considered, even if i don't know, we put on 400 tail for these 747s you're taking next year and assuming you finance half of those and very modest assumptions around ebitda for next year, this year and next year. i mean there is still here a lot of cash exiting or going through kind of early innings of the recovery. so should we think about that the priorities are going to be more on the aircraft side, i know twin aisles are expected to be weaker than single aisles given what's happening on the long haul international travel side. could we see something along perhaps an acquisition, be a smaller airline, you haven't done anything i think since 2016 or perhaps something you know downstream in logistics or sort of complementary side of things. and any color there, helpful. thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
so, chris, from my perspective, from an operating standpoint, my focus is more on the larger widebody aircraft. while we value all our fleets, our strength in our kind of core business starts with the -- with the larger widebody aircraft. from a leasing standpoint, all opportunities are on the table but again, i think our titan platform is more freighter centric or aircraft that can become freighters on the conversion from a feedstock standpoint. that's one of the core philosophies of titan. but there are other opportunities in the marketplace that have attractive returns, everything's on the table.
in terms of beyond that, m&a and all the other things, for which we could deploy our capital. i just would say this, everything's on the table from our standpoint, and we want to be sure that we are judicious during this volatile period of time through covid. you know i have a couple of times now stressed the operating environment and some of the challenges that have been presented to the team. these results and i'm not saying this in a boastful way, but these results don't just happen, there were extraordinary workarounds on the international scale to continue to operate into foreign locations that had some varying and very restrictive quarantine testing requirements, access to hotels, restaurants, the basics of food and shelter.
and i'm not overstating that. so we want to be sure that as we get through this period, i think better times are ahead with the vaccine. but if you follow the media, everything has been slower than people thought. so it's important for us to be responsible and prudent with our cash in the near term, but it's a long-winded way of saying, everything's on the table in the longer term.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
okay, thank you. and john, to your point there, maybe if you could help us frame here, you know you addressed it in your prepared remarks and certainly the press release, a bounce about some repositioning expense or headwinds due to covid. so just maybe if you could give us departures for fourth quarter not block hours but departures absolute year-on-year or maybe sequentially. and then also where are we with the amc movement restrictions and what are we seeing there with utilization on the related aircraft. thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so i'll talk on the amc piece. spencer, i don't know if you have information on departures or whether that's anything we're in a position to provide at this point. but on the amc, you're right and particularly in the early part of 2020 when covid hit, the military put a stop movement order in place which affected certainly the passenger demand significantly and also had ripple effects on cargo demand. and that remained in place until mid to later part of 2020. that stop movement order has since been lifted.
but the demand on the passenger side has not yet fully recovered. but we expect that to get to more normalized levels as we move through the year and especially as the vaccine starts to roll out and get more traction.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
okay. and anything on the departures?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the only thing i would say on departure is that they've really been growing year over year over year, our departures continue to grow. we typically well from an operational standpoint, we look at all of it but i typically focus a bit more on the hours that we operate or the charter flights that we operate. that's how we can bill our customers.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
okay. if i could just get one last one here. the 11 planes that amazon purchased in january, i don't think i've seen anyone pick up the cmi leases. are you bidding on those? thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
we're going to -- we're going to be competing for every aircraft that our customers have to offer. so you're right. i -- there has nothing been reported. but we're going to do everything we can to secure as much business as we can, from amazon and all our customers.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehana -- analyst
thanks for the time today.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, chris.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks chris.
operator
thank you. we do have a follow-up question from the line of scott group with wolfe research. your line is now open.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for the follow-up. just quickly, how should we think about excess rent refunds this year?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, scott. there is just a tiny amount left, small amount left. we won last tranche of it in may of this year and it should be about $4.5 million. and then that program should be completed.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay, very helpful. and then when you guys first started buying the 747-8s almost a decade ago, you guys talked about pretty significant initial earnings accretion per plane per month with the maintenance holidays. is there any reason to think the math would be any different for the next fours that you guys are taking?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, we provided that that information back then because the planes were late. and so we have included the earnings from those planes in our guidance and then when the planes relate from boeing, we let everyone know that just that amount of earnings would not be -- will not be happening in that period of time, but it was never meant to really be a sort of forecast going forward for those earnings. but clearly in the early days of the aircraft, the early years of the aircraft, they don't need maintenance. there are warranties and things like that are available on the aircraft, if there are any sort of maintenance issues.
so they are absolutely more profitable in the early years, and we'll see what the overall market is like this is -- this is a strong market. as john said, we hope to place them with a great customer at a great rate and we'll just have to see how the profitability as we have pretty good expectations.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. the other thing i'd add to that just from an operational standpoint. and this is true of aircraft that are in production for a while. the longer the aircraft are in production, generally speaking, the better the aircraft perform, meaning that the likes of boeing and ge, you get the kinks out over time. these aircraft are likely to be somewhat lighter than some of the other 747-8s and the engines performing at their peak performance compared to the earlier deliveries. so we're excited about that and think that's a great value proposition to our customers as well as they review the opportunity.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
that makes sense. thank you, guys again. appreciate it.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our last question comes from the line of david campbell with thompson davis. your line is now open.
david campbell -- thompson davison company -- analyst
yeah, thanks for taking my question. i had to step off the phone, may have missed -- i may have missed something that i'm asking about the -- in the, as you know, january and february every year are distorted by the changes in the chinese new year. and this year we have also the problem of the port congestion on the west coast, on the west coast there into your business in january and february i guess. but what about march, march is a seasonal peak as you know and i was wondering if you'd seen or had any discussions with your customers about demand in the -- in the month of march or this year.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i think that's reflected in our first quarter guidance. you know, a lot of the variables that we talked about which favored air freight in 2020 continued into 2021 q1. lunar new year for example because of covid and the desire the chinese government to limit travel, we saw a unique environment where factories, many of them stayed open during lunar new year, which was unprecedented.
you also see the demand for international passenger air travel continuing to be down, which is a favorable environment that's not going to last forever. the passenger carriers i expect will have a tremendous appetite to get their aircraft back up in the air as quickly as possible. but then, then what, will people be willing to travel? so that remains to be seen, but i think march is a reflection of what we saw in january, february, adding to a couple of comments i just made.
david campbell -- thompson davison company -- analyst
thanks, and my second question is related to amazon. amazon is adding aircraft all the time, it seems. correct me if i'm wrong. is there primarily aircraft designed for domestic use in the united states. i think, and if not, if they're not using international cargo, is that because they need the operating rights and they don't have operating rights bilateral or rights into these countries.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, david, i can't speak for amazon. they're going to do what they're going to do with those airplanes. generally speaking, the type of aircraft they're acquiring are more regional not long haul, wide body international but that's their call where they're going to deploy them and i don't think they're public with that yet.
david campbell -- thompson davison company -- analyst
but they don't have any restrictions internationally by not having --
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
i can't speak to amazon. i mean they don't operate -- they don't operate their own air operating certificate this time. so that i do know. they would deploy those aircraft to carriers i suspect that would be able to operate them wherever they want to operate them. but they themselves as amazon to-date, do not have their own air operating certificate, which by definition means they don't have air route rights.
david campbell -- thompson davison company -- analyst
all right. all right. okay, thank you very much.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, david.

thanks, ed, and hello everyone. welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call.
i'd like to start by thanking all the front line responders as well as all the essential workers around the world, including our more than 4,000 atlas team members for their unwavering efforts throughout this pandemic. on behalf of all of us at atlas, i want to express our sincere hope that you, your families and friends continue to stay safe as we work toward better days ahead. we at atlas take great pride in the role we're playing in keeping global supply chains and our customers operating networks moving and in supporting covid-19 relief efforts. from critical healthcare supplies like vaccines and other pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and ppe, as well as e-commerce educational supplies, food and other everyday consumer products. our team has worked tirelessly to keep our aircraft flying safely, so we can continue transporting the goods that matter most during this challenging time.
operating a global airline during a pandemic hasn't been easy. our performance is a result of the team banding together to navigate through a very complex regulatory and operating environment to first and foremost, keep our employees safe but also to provide high-quality service for our customers. the safety of our team is our top priority and will continue to take extensive precautions to ensure we are able to safely carry essential items around the world. and as we've said over the years, our resilient business model allows us to sustain during challenging market conditions, as well as capitalize on opportunities during more favorable market conditions.
we're continuing to leverage our unrivaled portfolio of assets in the scale of our global network. we are also diversifying our customer base and have entered into numerous long-term charter agreements that provide reliable and attractive revenue streams for the years ahead. our long-term charter business provides exciting opportunities with strategic customers such as cainiao, flexport and hp that have come to atlas to secure our high quality services for dedicated capacity of their own. these are savvy buyers of air freight and their commitment to atlas' telling about their vision of the future and their interest for locking in capacity on a longer-term basis.
in addition to the significant reductions in passenger belly cargo capacity on long-haul trade lanes, covid-19 is also causing congestion and delays at ocean ports worldwide. as a result, shippers are increasingly using air freight to avoid bottlenecks in their supply chains and that's driving even further near-term demand. from a fleet standpoint, providing our customers with modern fuel-efficient aircraft has been a long-standing priority at atlas and we're excited to have recently announced that we ordered four new 747-8 freighters from boeing. not only does this investment underscore our commitment to provide our customers with the best available aircraft, but it also furthers our commitment to the environment by investing in the latest technologies to reduce aircraft noise emissions and fuel consumption.
the 747-8 is a great airplane. it provides 20% higher payload capacity and 16% lower fuel consumption than the very capable 747-400 freighter and has 25% higher capacity than the 777 freighter. in addition, the advanced engines on the 747-8 reduce noise by approximately 30% compared to the previous generation of aircraft. as the world's largest 747 freighter operator the 747-8 is core to our business and complements our diversified fleet of 747-400s, 777s, 767s and 737s. we're expecting delivery of these new aircraft beginning in may and continuing through october of 2022. and they will play a key role in advancing atlas' strategic growth plans for decades to come.
now turning to the fourth quarter results on slide 4. we finished this unprecedented year on a strong note with financial and operating results that exceeded our expectations. everyone at atlas stepped up to deliver an extraordinary peak season and for that matter, the full year for our business and our customers. in the face of unrelenting operational challenges and complexities, driven by the covid-19 pandemic, we added wide-body capacity and increased aircraft utilization to grow block hours and carry historic volumes.
our fourth quarter results benefited from strong demand for our assets and services, higher commercial charter yields, the significant reduction of international wide-body passenger belly cargo capacity and lower aircraft rent and depreciation. in addition, we reactivated four 747 converted freighter more quickly than we expected, further allowing us to capitalize on attractive opportunities. these benefits were partially offset by higher heavy maintenance expense related to additional engine overhauls that we had performed to take advantage of attractive vendor pricing and slot availability, as well as higher pilot costs related to the premium pay we've been providing our pilots for operating into certain areas that have been significantly impacted by covid-19, as well as the 10% pay increase we provided to our pilots in may 2020 pending the completion of our joint collective bargaining agreement.
we at atlas are dedicated to keeping our business on a successful trajectory. this includes executing on our strategic plan, continuing to diversify our business as well as aggressively manage our costs and balance sheet. we'll also continue to focus on ensuring that our assets and resources are allocated to those opportunities that generate the best returns. as spencer will share with you in more detail during his remarks, these actions coupled with our team executing on market opportunities drove significant improvement in our balance sheet this year.
we improved our cash position, enhanced liquidity and reduced our net leverage ratio. as a capital-intensive business, building and maintaining a strong cash position is vital for our long-term success and provides us with the financial flexibility to both endure more challenging market conditions, as well as thrive in more favorable conditions. with respect to our pilot labor negotiations, our work continues to complete a new joint collective bargaining agreement in connection with the merger between atlas air and southern air.
scheduled negotiations with our pilots union have recently concluded as provided in our respective collective bargaining agreements, and we're now moving on to binding interest arbitration to resolve all remaining open issues. this arbitration is scheduled to begin in mid-march.
now, moving to slide 5. the strong demand for our aircraft and services has continued in the first quarter. as a result, we expect to fly approximately 85,000 block hours in the first quarter with revenue of approximately $820 million and adjusted ebitda of about $150 million. in addition, we expect first quarter adjusted net income to grow approximately 60% to 65% compared with adjusted net income of $29.9 million in the first quarter of 2020.
our outlook also anticipates additional expenses, driven by the pandemic including premium pay for our pilots, costs for continuing to provide a safe working environment for all our employees, as well as higher costs from the pay increase we provided to our pilots in may 2020. for the full year, we expect aircraft maintenance expense to be lower than 2020, with depreciation and amortization totaling about $270 million. in addition, core capital expenditures, which exclude aircraft and engine purchases are projected to total approximately $110 million to $120 million mainly for parts and components for our fleet.
we also expect committed expenditures relating to acquiring aircraft and spare engines to be approximately $265 million in 2021. these expenditures include pre-delivery payments related to our 747-8 aircraft order, acquisition of spare engines and the purchase of several used 747-400 passenger aircraft that we will use to both replace certain of our older passenger aircraft that are in service, as well as others to part out for spare engines and components. due to the ongoing uncertainty related to the pandemic and the associated market dynamics, including ever changing border restrictions, new variance of covid-19, the pace of vaccine distribution and surges in cases globally, we are not providing a full-year 2020 earnings outlook at this time. but we'll provide updates to you as the year progresses.
this is a good point for me to ask spencer to provide more details on our fourth quarter results. and after spencer's remarks i look forward to providing a few additional comments and then we'll be happy to take your questions. spencer?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, john, and hello everyone. our strong fourth quarter results are highlighted on slide 6.
on an adjusted basis, ebitda increased to $279.7 million with adjusted net income growing to $143.2 million. on a reported basis, net income totaled $184 million. our fourth quarter adjusted earnings included an effective income tax rate of 23.9%. for the full year, we had an adjusted effective tax rate of 22.9%.
moving to the top of slide 7, operating revenue totaled $932.5 million in the quarter. acmi revenue primarily reflected lower levels of flying driven by the redeployment of 747-400 aircraft and charter. this was partially offset by our ability to increase aircraft utilization and higher levels of cmi flying. higher charter revenue was primarily driven by increased flying partially offset by a slightly lower average rate per block hour due to lower fuel costs. block hour volume growth primarily reflected strong demand for our services, driven by the reduction of available cargo capacity in the market, the disruption of global supply chains, the redeployment of 747-400 aircraft from acmi and a 777 from dry leasing, as well as our ability to increase aircraft utilization, and dry leasing revenue primarily related to changes in leases and the disposition of certain non-essential aircraft during the first quarter of 2020.
looking now at the bottom of the slide. segment contribution totaled $267.6 million in the fourth quarter. acmi earnings included higher pilot costs including premium pay for operating in certain areas, and a 10% pay increase that we provided to our pilots in may 2020. higher heavy maintenance expense, which includes additional engine overhauls to take advantage of availability and attractive pricing discounts and the redeployment of 747 aircraft to charter. these items were partially offset by increased utilization and an increase in cmi flying.
higher charter contribution was primarily driven by an increase in yields excluding fuel, strong demand for our services and our ability to increase aircraft utilization. charter contribution also benefited from lower aircraft rent and depreciation and the redeployment of aircraft from acmi and dry leasing. these benefits were partially offset by higher heavy maintenance expense and higher pilot costs, as well as fewer charters for sports teams and fans as leagues canceled games. in dry leasing, lower segment contribution was primarily due to changes in leases and the disposition of certain non-essential aircraft during the first quarter of 2020.
also during the quarter, as we previously reported, on october 9, amazon elected a cashless exercise with respect to approximately 3.6 million shares vested under our warrant issued in 2016. as a result, amazon acquired approximately 1.4 million shares of atlas common stock. and then in addition, on january 27 of this year, amazon elected a cashless exercise with respect to approximately 4.2 million shares also invested under warrants issued in 2016. as a result, amazon acquired approximately 1.3 million shares.
now turning to slide 8. as anticipated, our net debt and our net leverage ratio continued to improve during the fourth quarter. our net leverage ratio declined another 0.4 turn finishing the year at 2.1 times, down significantly from 4.4 times where we began the year. we ended the year with cash including cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaling $856.3 million compared with $114.3 million at the end of 2019. our improved cash balance primarily reflected cash provided by operating activities and the funds we received through the cares act.
net cash used for financing activities, primarily related to payments on debt obligations, including our revolving credit facility partially offset by debt issuances. net cash used for investing activities primarily related to core capital expenditures, spare engines and then engine upgrade kits, partially offset by proceeds from the disposition of certain non-essential aircraft and engines. as a reminder, our debt has a low weighted average coupon interest rate, which now stands at 2.98%. and the vast majority are secured by our aircraft assets which have a value in excess of the related debt.
as john said, we are taking actions to mitigate the impact of any continuation or worsening of the pandemic and remain committed to a strong balance sheet. we're reducing costs, enhancing liquidity and strategically allocating resources. now i'd like to turn it back to john.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, spencer. moving on to slide 9, 2020 certainly was an unprecedented year and we finished it on a strong note. the higher demand for our aircraft and services has carried into the first quarter and our team continues to step up and execute amid the ongoing operational challenges from the pandemic.
we will continue to take every precaution to protect our world-class team of employees and our operations to ensure that we can continue to transport the goods the world needs the most.
at this point, operator, may we have the first question please.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of bob labick from cjs securities. your line is open.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
good morning, and congratulations on the performance and a very attractive guide for q2 as well.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
ed mcgarvey -- senior vice president and treasurer
thank you, bob.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
i wanted to start with -- just trying to get a sense how much of the strong first half performance relates to spot or ad-hoc flying versus contracted acmi and long-term charter take-or-pay contracts. i'm trying to get a sense of the kind of sustainability and recurring nature of the contribution in the first half.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, bob. so about 60% to 65% of our flying now is in what was traditional acmi. about 20% is now in long-term charters. about 10% is with the us military. about 5% is flying around south america. and only about 5% or 6% now is what was traditionally kind of ad-hoc spot market. so it really has become a very small percent of our overall business. and so, approximately 94% of all the flying is on dedicated aircraft.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. great. and then just looking to the second half and 2022 then with that in mind, other than the pilot labor information that you'd get by the end of this year, pilot costs, what are the biggest variables you're thinking about for the second half and for 2022 since much of your flying is kind of already locked up?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, really, of course, we're in the middle of a pandemic. so there are a lot of uncertainties related to that and what that might mean overall. based on everything we're seeing, we feel pretty good about the space that we play in and the continued strength of the air freight environment, but there are plenty of uncertainties out there as you know. other than that, it's really supply demand impact on yields, operational challenges, the amazing work that our team does to overcome those operational challenges. those are really the big items.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. and bob, if i could add to that, we've talked a lot through 2020 about covid related and pandemic related movements, which are still continuing, but we're also keeping a close watch on overall economic conditions. and as i said in my comments, what lies beyond the pandemic. i ought to came out with some statistics pretty recently to show that the economy and economies are recovering, we're going to be watching that closely. inventory levels are down. we expect manufacturing to want to get back to full strength, which it's not right now. so those are beyond the pandemic some of the things i'm looking to, and important variable to keep an eye on.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
super. thank you very much.

your next question comes from the line of helane becker from cowen. your line is open.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
hi, and thanks very much, operator. hi everybody and thank you very much for the time.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
just a couple of questions on as you think about the aircraft over the next bunch of years, you're taking these four last dash 8s. and i guess you'll fly them like 30 or 40 year. so maybe this isn't a question you have to think about too soon. but then how are you thinking about aircraft replacement for some of the older 747-400s, maybe?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i'll start with that. and it's important to remember that the 747-400 is still a great airplane, and still well within its useful life. and the models that we have are on average 2020, 2022 builds. and if you look at the lifeline, you just described for the 747-8, that still applies to 747-400. so we expect that the 400 will continue to be a workhorse in the years to come. and i would say similar to our comments on the 747-8, over time, we also think there is -- as some of the older ones start to retire. and what i mean by that is, the less productive ones which are likely to be converted passenger to freighter. 747s, those will likely retire earliest. i would say the pure freighters are going to have scarcity value over time with its payload range capabilities as well as its nose loading capability. so we feel really good about the 747 into the future, both with 400 and the dash 8.
now that said, there are also some great airplanes out there. the 777 is a great airplane. the existing freighter fleet and looking forward to the converted 777 as well as other aircraft types, airbus is talking about the a350. we're going to be looking as we always do at all fleet types, but with the -- 747 is kind of the backbone of our operation.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
gotcha. okay, that's very helpful. thank you for that. and then the other question i have is, you gave your pilots a pay increase in may of last year?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
and now you're -- it's so good to see that you're making progress on this contract. glad that it's hopefully coming to an end, or maybe a beginning depending on how you want to think about it. would -- as may 1st came and went this year, would -- is not giving them another raise this year just holding off because you think you're close to getting an agreement before year-end that would encompass pay that would cover this year?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
well, helane, there is a lot in that question. and i agree with you, we're pleased to see this negotiation coming to an end, that i can't say it is coming to an end. the arbitration is now complete and we have specific dates where the post-hearing briefs are due. the arbitration completed on april 1st, two weeks of hearings. and it is coming to an end. and the arbitrator has committed to us to get to a outcome as soon as reasonably possible. we're hoping it's within a 60-day time period. there is a large record that was submitted, but it is coming to an end and we're pleased about that. so there is nothing to prevent us from continuing dialog with the union. our representatives have been in touch with each other through the process. but the arbitration procedure that we've been pushing for for so long in terms of bringing this to a conclusion, it's happening. and we expect the result -- i can't give you a specific date, but we expect it in the second half of the year.
helane becker -- cowen -- analyst
all right. all right. i heard you say that on the call. okay. well, thank you. thank you very much. and well, that was quite a quarter, congratulations.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, helane.

your next question comes from the line of stephanie benjamin from truist. your line is open.
stephanie benjamin -- truist -- analyst
hi, good afternoon.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, stephanie.
stephanie benjamin -- truist -- analyst
i wanted to touch in on the long-term charter business. you had really strong success last year locking in some of these incremental longer term charter contracts. would just love to hear an update on really the demand you're seeing for these types of contracts this year as well as maybe the types of customers, and as the momentum from 2020 has continued through 2021. thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. thanks, stephanie. we're seeing strong interest from these customers. and early in when some of these contracts were being entered into, as i described in a prior call, this is a new customer base, and some lessons learned from the pandemic and perhaps over-dependence on passenger belly capacity both -- what many of our customers are seeing and learning is that main deck freighters is very attractive and to be able to secure that capacity is important, both within this pandemic environment, but also beyond. so we've seen strong interest and are excited about that. it's a whole new customer base. and as spencer pointed out, they are more acmi like contracts because they have term associated with them, and all -- or many of the attributes of acm. and as i mentioned in my remarks we're not only seeing new agreements entered into but extensions of existing agreements. so that's all kind of responsive to your question about the interest.
i also think there is going to be some post-pandemic lessons learned about the attractiveness of main deck freighters on a dedicated capacity. some of our customers already recognize the benefits, a real-time inventories and moving product around rather than carrying large inventory that may or may not sell. and i think airfreight will be a key component of that in the post-pandemic economy.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and stephanie, it's spencer. i'll just add very briefly to john's comments there that we now have dozens of these long-term contracts. during the first quarter, we had four contracts that were extended. we had two that either added aircraft or added rotations. and we had one new customer after two years. and the vast majority of these contracts go into 2022 and '23, some go into 2024. and the majority are on the sort of fastest growing trade lanes and they probably will not be operated by returning passenger aircraft.
stephanie benjamin -- truist -- analyst
great. well, thank you so much for all the color.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of chris stathoulopoulos from susquehanna international group. your line is open.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
good morning, thanks for taking my question.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, chris.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
so spencer, john, so with the change in reporting here, can we interpret this year that, you know, the the changes here in acmi are more structural or permanent in nature, meaning are you no longer prioritizing or pursuing short-term charter business. and then, if so, how should we think about whether it's however you want to quantify ebitda margins or ebitda dollars or free cash flow through the cycle now, given the change in the duration of the contracts there. thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, chris. i'll start in terms of your prioritization question. the acmi model is very attractive. it provides secure assured revenue streams. and some of what we're seeing as we talked about the long-term charter [indecipherable] are more acmi like. another element of the long-term charters is sometime -- spencer mentioned dozens of these agreements, is our ability to pair customers and get full utilization of the aircraft by combining customer demand versus a typical traditional acmi which is fully dedicated full-time use of the aircraft. and i think there is demand and desire for both, and it allows us to offer partial aircraft for the remainder for another customer. so that's worked quite well for us in our network planning on a global basis. so from a prioritization standpoint, those two, the acmi and the long-term charters, are certainly the kind of deals we like and will secure on a long-term basis, but we also are able to flex our capabilities to take advantage of -- on amount of fleet that we keep aside for ad-hoc charter. there is no doubt, and that's allowed us to deliver a lot of these results, and that's really always been the case for us because we know there is a consistent level of interest both in good times and in challenging times for the spot charter market.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
so should we think about this as generally accretive or positive for free cash flow? an that -- if so, that you would look to direct that capital toward the order book or when the psp restrictions expire on returning capital or pursuing other activities?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, chris, with regard to sort of two parts of that question i think, there was a capital allocation question, and then there was kind of a free cash flow question. our free cash flows, you can see, have really been strong and continue to stay that way. as far as capital allocation, you've seen that our net leverage ratio is down at the low twos. we're continuing to use our cash to strengthen our balance sheet, pay down debt, and to pay for the 747-8 pre-delivery payments. we take a really disciplined approach to deploying our capital and we set aggressive return targets. our focus continues to be on growing the business while generating returns that are above our cost of capital, and at the same time maintaining a strong balance sheet. right now, we have cares act limitations that don't allow us to either put in play share repurchases or to put in place a dividend program. it's something that the board is always considering, and when those restrictions are gone, that's something that the board will have to determine at that time. but at the moment, it's not really a consideration at this point, we just can't.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
okay, thank you. and then this follow-up question, just wondering if you could give some color on what you're seeing with respect to supply on some of your key routes. it looks like we're starting to see some indications of long haul commercial widebody flights being added back and areas like latin america, it looks like we could be heading back toward pre-pandemic levels in the next few months. so curious i realize your network is pretty complex, but if your maybe top three or five lanes, what does that dynamic look like currently. and then how are you thinking about that for the second half? thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, chris, we're really not seeing that at all. in fact, as i mentioned in my remarks, it's slow to recover. borders still remain closed. now, i also believe there will be a significant appetite for the passenger carriers to get their aircraft back up and running, but there are a number of dynamics there that still favor air freight, including some of the aircraft that are -- passenger aircrafts that are being used that's what's called preighters. once passenger traffic returns, a lot of that capacity is going to come out of the market, and they're also likely going to come out of the major cargo trade lanes and back to passenger service trade lanes. but it's been slow and we expect it's going to continue to be slow. so we're not necessarily seeing what you're describing. i think there is a lot of -- there is going to be a lot of attention given to the passenger carriers to get back up and running and to have some of the improvements, but right now what we're seeing on the demand side is not within the time frame you're talking about. and reasonable minds can differ on when it will return to pre-pandemic levels, but i'm not one who believes it's going to be in the next few months at all.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
okay. but the routes i was referring to was on latin america, and overall, the number of flights coming back are still small. i was just curious if there's been any route that's -- where you've seen a -- perhaps a marked difference versus a few months ago.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
no, not really.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
okay, thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
sure.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of scott group from wolfe research. your line is open.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning guys. so i want to go back to the segment reporting, because when i look charter margins have never been higher, acmi margins have never been lower. and i mean charter rates are, what, three times as high as acmi. so from a financial standpoint, they still look and feel very different. so i'm just struggling with what should the longer-term margins of this segment look like?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. thanks, scott. we don't think they are that different anymore. as we talked about the businesses have been becoming more and more similar over time, and we as a company, we view and manage them as one segment. it's not something that just transpired during the pandemic, the two segments have been converging for a while now as we talked about in our sort of opening comments. they both have long-term and short-term nature to them, even acmi has pretty significant short-term arrangements in it as well. both provide similar services, we exchange aircraft between them, both fly similar routes, carry similar goods, and same staff support all of them. there was also a challenge from a cost allocation standpoint keeping the two separate, because we record our maintenance for the most part on a as incurred basis. so in a quarter where we incurred maintenance, that maintenance may have been allocated to either acmi or to charter, but then the flying for the full year may have been -- the quarter where the maintenance was allocated may have been disproportionate to how the whole year's worth of flying may have performed. and so for example, you're talking about historically acmi margins being lower, and there were times when acmi would get allocated a disproportionate amount of maintenance, for example, even though that's not the way the year would have necessarily played out. it's just the way that we allocate and we consistently have allocated that way. so it presented problems that way and it harmed one segment or the other segment. it's just better to look at the two of them together at this point, we think. so you were about a long-term... yup, sorry, go ahead.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. i understand why you're consolidating. i'm just saying i'm struggling with how to think about what this combined segment should look like over time there?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah. so we've entered into these long-term charter contracts now. so they're starting to look a lot more similar in that regard. these contracts as i said, go into 2022 and 2023, and some go into 2024. so they're starting to act a lot more like traditional acmi. so over the next number of years, i think you'll see those margins kind of normalize for both. and as john talked about, those long-term charter contract customers, they're really getting the taste of what it is to have dedicated aircraft capacity and to be able to operate their networks, having that committed capacity. and we hope and expect that this is here to stay and those customers are going to want to stay in those arrangements and extend them even longer.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. and then i don't know if you can help with this, but maybe you can. so, the 6% of the business that's ad-hoc, is there any way to say sort of what percentage of the earnings that's representing now? and then the 94% that you think about is more longer-term now, are the rates on that 94% all fixed or do those still move based on market conditions? i just want to understand the business there.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so as far as do the rates move, so for the us military for example, that's a cost plus contract. so, if costs change, then that could certainly change, the flying we do around south america, we fly a loop around south america. so those rates do change over time. the 6%, obviously those rates change. the long-term charters and the acmi typically those rates only change when those contracts come up for renewal.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. all right, thank you guys.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, scott.

we have a follow-up question coming from the line of chris stathoulopoulos from susquehanna international group. your line is open.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
hey, thanks for taking my follow-up. so just getting back to my first question and then perhaps getting it [indecipherable] from a different angle here. should we think that perhaps if you want to look at it on an ebitda margin that you're still -- is this overall at a corporate level, a high-teens kind of 20% business through the cycle here with these changes, and the fact that you're moving a fewer missions on spot?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yeah, absolutely. you can see the growth in our segment margins. and if you just look at the past year, you can just add the two acmi charter together or you can look at them separately whichever. but when you look at 2020 versus 2019 and now you see 2021 versus 2020, you can see the growth of those margins with these long-term charter contracts. and we look at, as john talked about before, we look at each and every arrangement, each and every schedule and network and we're trying to piece them altogether. and if we can successfully do that as we have done, then we'll see -- we'll continue to see really strong margins. and you can see that our utilization, when you look at our utilization, it is up tremendously. and our group has really been focused on increasing that utilization. our 747-8's utilization has increased, 747-400's. and both of those in traditional acmi utilizations increased. our acmi customers flew 16% above their minimum guarantees during the quarter. commercial charter utilization was up. the only utilization that was down was the us military, which is understandable given the circumstances, and that's on the passenger side, that is. so utilization has been really strong, which is driving those strong margins.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international group -- analyst
okay. and the follow-up, any color on or update on the amazon business what the active fleet count is, routes served, or if you could perhaps frame how it's been growing, what's left on the order book and where we are with the next tranche of warrants? thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
so the operating fleet, we are at seventeen 767s, and eight 737-800s so that's 25 total airplanes operating for amazon. those are all up and running. we brought on, i think the last three toward the tail end of last year. working closely with amazon. i'll let spencer comment on the warrants, but it's a great relationship, it's a great customer. they're continuing to grow and diversify their providers and we're going to be in there competing as best we can for the business. and we appreciate the business that they give us. so we're up to 25 airplanes right now.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and i'll just briefly comment on the warrants. so amazon exercised warrants in october and january of this year -- october of last year and january of this year. and so we issued about 2.6 million shares. but in doing so because they exercise on a cashless basis, they actually sort of surrendered or canceled about 4.9 million shares. so from a -- an existing shareholder equity dilution standpoint, there's is a lot less potential dilution there. as far as warrants outstanding, there are about 338,000 shares worth of warrants that are vested, warrant b that is, and no warrants c shares have vested. any remaining vestings are tied to revenue paid to the company. so amazon vest based on revenue that they paid to the company.
scott group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. then spencer, any plans to apply for psp3? thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
i'll answer that one. we have no plans to apply for psp3.

john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ed, and hello everyone. welcome to our first quarter earnings call. on behalf of all of us at atlas, i hope that you, your families and friends continue to stay safe as we progress toward brighter days ahead. i want to again thank all the frontline responders and essential workers around the world for their efforts. we're encouraged by the distribution of vaccines, yet at the same time we're disheartened that the path to recovery continues to be prolonged in many regions of the world, particularly in india. we operate frequently in that region and are actively engaged with multiple customers and organizations to support relief efforts. we're also pleased to see so many others, both within and outside the industry stepping up to provide critical support. i'd also like to thank our more than 4,000 employees for their incredible dedication and contributions. we're continuing to take wide-ranging precautions to protect our employees and our operations to ensure we're able to safely transport the goods the world needs. our team continues to work tirelessly doing our part to keep the global supply chain moving. this pandemic has certainly highlighted the important role that air flight -- air freight plays in the global supply chain and how it brings essential goods to market with unmatched speed and reliability. at atlas, the services we provide have always been essential, and they are now even more critical than ever. we're leveraging our unmatched global operating capabilities and flexible business model to capitalize on current market conditions. this includes transporting vaccines, ppe and medical supplies, express and e-commerce, perishables, manufacturing components, and other daily necessities around the world. and we're seeing general air freight tonnage grow from pre-pandemic levels.
throughout the pandemic, we've demonstrated to our customers that they can count on atlas to provide the services and innovative solutions they need to keep their operating networks moving even in difficult times. these capabilities weren't born out of this pandemic. they've been developed at atlas through many years of growth and diversification which allows us to capitalize on market opportunities on a global scale, and you can see that from the excellent results we've been reporting. advancing our initiatives and positioning us well for the future, we continue to enter into and extend numerous long-term charter agreements with strategic customers that have chosen atlas because of our high-quality services and operating expertise. we recognize the important role we play in their supply chains, and we're committed to delivering for them in these unprecedented times and beyond.
before we move to the next slide and review our results, i'd like to take a moment to briefly discuss the segment reporting change we announced in our press release this morning. i'll also ask spencer to share more details during his remarks. beginning with the first quarter of 2021, we've changed our operating and reportable segments to reflect the evolution of our business. many of you are likely familiar with the three segments we had previously, namely acmi, charter, and dry leasing. but as the acmi and charter businesses have become more similar, we review and manage them as one segment. we'll now have two operating and reportable segments, airline operations, and dry leasing. this change to our segment reporting now reflects how we analyze both current operations and new business opportunities to ensure that our resources are put to the most profitable use.
now turning to our first quarter results on slide 4. our performance was driven by the strength and flexibility of our global business model as well as our team continuing to capitalize on the current air freight environment with demand and yields that are well above typical seasonal levels i want to again thank all of our employees at atlas for delivering safe high-quality service for our customers in this very challenging operating environment. we continue to leverage our global network and increase aircraft utilization to match significant airfreight demand. our first quarter results continue to reflect strong demand for our aircraft and services, our expanded and extended customer agreements, high commercial charter yields, and the significant reduction of international widebody belly cargo capacity. our results also benefited from the four 747 freighters and one 777 freighter that we reintroduced to our fleet throughout 2020 to serve customer demand. these benefits were partially offset by higher costs related to premium pay for pilots operating into certain areas that have been significantly impacted by covid 19, the 10% pay increase we provided our pilots in may 2020, and higher heavy maintenance expense.
turning to our pilot labor negotiations. we remain committed to reaching a joint collective bargaining agreement with our pilots in connection with the merger between atlas air and southern air. we're pleased to report that we've now moved closer to completing the new jcba. the scheduled arbitration proceeded on time and recently concluded on april 1st, and the union has now provided the company with the integrated seniority list. this is a critical item for implementing a new agreement. the next step is for both parties to submit post-hearing briefs on an agreed schedule after which the arbitrator will consider all the information presented and render a binding decision, which we expect sometime in the second half of this year.
now, moving to slide 5, we're off to a very good start in 2021, and are seeing continued business momentum in the second quarter. we're closely monitoring the market and leveraging the diversity of our business model. this includes being prepared to capitalize on global market conditions, as well as being able to successfully adjust any changes. long haul international passenger flying on widebody aircraft has been slow to recover and will likely be last to return as countries continue to struggle with covid 19 and many borders remain closed. although there has been a lot of attention about recent levels of improved us passenger air traffic, it's important to note that these recent increases have largely been driven by pent-up demand for domestic and regional leisure travel with smaller gauge aircraft, which is less impactful to international air freight. it will also be important to monitor what the new normal will be beyond the pandemic, including any impact on international business travel. with the strong global demand for airfreight outpacing air cargo supply, we anticipate air freight demand and yields to remain strong with capacity on long-haul trade lanes remaining tight.
looking to the second quarter, we expect to fly approximately 90,000 block hours, with revenue of approximately $950 million and adjusted ebitda of about $210 million. in addition, we expect adjusted net income to grow by approximately 30% compared with adjusted net income of $72.2 million in the first quarter of this year. our outlook anticipates commercial cargo charter yields to remain above typical seasonal levels, but below the historically high yields experienced during the second quarter of 2020. we also expect additional expenses driven by the pandemic including premium pay for our pilots, costs for continuing to provide covid safety measures in the workplace, higher costs from the pay increase we provided to our pilots in may 2020, and maintenance expense in the second quarter of approximately $130 million. for the full year, we continue to expect aircraft maintenance expense to be lower than 2020, with depreciation and amortization totaling about $270 million. in addition, core capital expenditures which exclude aircraft and engine purchases are projected to total approximately $110 million to $120 million mainly for parts and components for our fleet.
given the ongoing economic and market related uncertainties including covid 19, new variants of the virus surges in cases globally travel restrictions and other factors, we are providing a second quarter outlook but not providing a full-year 2021 outlook at this time, and we look forward to providing updates as the year progresses. this is a good point for me to ask spencer to provide more details on our first quarter results and our segment reporting, and after spencer's remarks i look forward to providing a few additional comments and then we'll be happy to take your questions. spencer.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, john, and hello everyone. i'd like to start by discussing the change to our segment operations and reporting, and then we'll move to the next slide and i'll discuss our great first quarter results. on prior earnings calls, we've talked about the blurring of lines between acmi and charter, and how these agreements have become more similar over the past few years. as our long-term charter business grew significantly during 2020, the similarities became even more pronounced with both our acmi and charter businesses now including contracts of a long-term nature. and as we've expanded the amount of flying that's performed under long-term contracts, we've reduced the percentage of our business that serves ad-hoc demand. both acmi and the majority of charter services provide outsourced aircraft operating capabilities for customers on a fixed take or pay basis, providing us with more predictable revenue streams. as we look to capitalize on customer demand and maximize returns, we regularly exchange aircraft between acmi and charter service. this operating flexibility allows us to fly to the destinations and transport the cargo that customers want regardless of whether they pay by block hour with acmi or by flight with charter. and from a sales, operations, and support staff perspective, we have the same team of outstanding employees assisting both acmi and charter activities. for both acmi and charter, we operate on similar routes, fly to similar airports, carry similar goods, provide similar services, and customers are primarily responsible for fuel.
now moving to our strong first quarter results which are highlighted on slide 6. on an adjusted basis, ebitda increased to $181.3 million with adjusted net income growing to $72.2 million. on a reported basis, net income totaled $89.9 million. our adjusted earnings in the first quarter included an effective income tax rate of 21.9%.
moving to the top of slide 7, operating revenue totaled $861.3 million in the quarter. higher airline operations revenue was primarily driven by a significant increase in flying, and the average rate per block hour. block-hour volume growth primarily reflected strong demand for our commercial charter and cmi services, driven by higher air freight volumes, the reduction of available cargo capacity in the market, the disruption of global supply chains, and our ability to increase aircraft utilization. in addition, the segment revenue benefited from the operation of five freighters that we activated throughout 2020 including four 747s and one 777. these items were partially offset by lower amc passenger flying as the us military is taking precautionary measures to limit the movement of military personnel. revenue in our dry leasing segment was relatively unchanged.
looking now at the bottom of the slide, segment contribution totaled $179.7 million in the first quarter. higher airline operations contribution during the period was primarily driven by the positive factors benefiting segment revenue i just noted. these benefits were partially offset by higher pilot costs, and higher heavy maintenance. similar to revenue, dry leasing segment contribution was also relatively unchanged.
now turning to slide 8, our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 2.1 times, which is consistent with year-end 2020. we ended the first quarter of 2021 with cash including cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $714 million. our cash position at march 31 reflected cash used for investing and financing activities, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities. net cash used for investing activities during the first quarter was primarily for core capital expenditures, payments for flight equipment and modifications including pre-delivery payments for our 747-8 order, as well as spare engines, engine overhauls, and upgrade kits. net cash used for financing activities during the period primarily reflected payments on debt obligations, partially offset by proceeds from debt issuance. we continue to apply a disciplined approach to financing. as we've noted before, this has resulted in a low weighted average coupon interest rate, which now stands at 2.96%, and the majority is secured by our aircraft assets which have a value in excess of the related debt. we remain committed to a strong balance sheet, and we're taking actions to mitigate the impact of any continuation or worsening of the pandemic by reducing costs, enhancing liquidity, and strategically allocating resources. now i'd like to turn it back to john.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, spencer. moving to slide 9, and as i mentioned, we're off to a very good start in 2021, and are seeing continued business momentum in the second quarter. our team continues to capitalize on the current air freight environment while delivering safe high-quality service for our customers. we look forward to finalizing the new joint collective bargaining agreement with our pilots, and we'll continue to take every precaution to protect our world-class team of employees and our operations to ensure that we can continue to transport essential goods around the world. at this point, operator, may we have the first question please.

thank you. [operator instructions.] our first question coming from the line of stephanie moore with truist. your line is open.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
hi. good morning. thank you for the question and congrats on a nice quarter.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, stephanie.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
i wanted to touch a bit on some of the locked-in charter agreements that have been put in place really over the last year and would love to get a sense of maybe what you're hearing from some of those customers that switched to a more dedicated offering? i think you called out hp, for example, in the past, maybe just some -- i guess, just really what you're hearing is their feedback. i mean, is this something where they're really understanding the benefits of working with the dedicated carrier? have you been able to kind of sign on more of these longer-term charter agreements? would love to just get an update on that. thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, stephanie. and i'll start. the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. i think customers appreciate the ability to take advantage of this committed capacity. they have assurances that their goods are going to get to where they need to be. in fact, if you reflect on some of our comments, not only are we entering into new agreements, but we're also extending existing agreements, which is indicative of their pleasure with the agreements and the fact that they're looking to renew.
and so we feel really good about it. it's also important to note, we're creating a new customer base here, too, with the likes of hp and others, where they typically had not committed to dedicated freighters. and we see that as a trend that's renewing and hopefully expanding over time.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and maybe, stephanie, it's spencer. i'll just add a couple of things there. as john said, customers are enjoying the dedicated capacity that they now have. the vast majority of these agreements go into 2022 and 2023, several now go into 2024. and many of them are on some of the fastest-growing trailings that likely will not be operated by returning passenger aircraft. so it really gives the customer this dedicated capacity that they can count on.
and then i'll just lastly on this topic, during the second quarter, we extended two agreements with two of the big forwarders. one, we extended one year into 2023. and one, we extended three years into 2024 now. we also, during the quarter, entered into two new arrangements with two big forwarders there as well. one goes to the end of this year and one is for a couple of years going into 2023, all at very good rates.
stephanie moore -- truist -- analyst
great. i will leave it at that and thank you for the color.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question coming from the line of bob labick with cjs securities. your line is open.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
good morning and congratulations again on just excellent execution and a great quarter.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, bob.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
sure. so with q2 and then guidance for q3, ebitda in excess of several prior peaks, probably all but last year, how is the business seasonality changed with your new contracts? how should we think about seasonality going forward? and how should we think about kind of the earnings power of the business going forward?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. you could see, it's a great question. you can see that the seasonality is not as varied as it once was. of course, there's still some seasonality. in the fourth quarter, you would expect is always going to be the highest quarter given the holiday period. but you can see that the seasonality this year, looking at the second quarter of this year versus the third quarter, the outlook that we've provided, you can look and see there's not nearly as much variability. these long-term contracts are much more reliable and predictable.
of course, we still have about 5% of our business in the ad hoc charter spot market. and so that is somewhat dependent on what yields are doing. but the vast majority of the business now is much more locked in and there's less seasonality, less variability.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. okay. that's great. and then i guess as my follow-up, just wanted to ask also about the -- what's the p&l impact of acquiring the planes that are coming off lease? it's pretty exciting, and it seems like it could be a pretty good use of capital for you, particularly given the strong cash flow that you have.
so maybe just kind of help us give us a sense of the p&l impact and how many more after the eight, do you have this opportunity to buy after lease ends in your current fleet?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, bob. it's spencer. so i guess i'll start by saying acquiring these aircraft, really, it underscores our confidence in the global air freight market. we'll ensure that we have these committed aircraft to be able to serve customer needs. and it delivers very strong returns for atlas in the years ahead.
so what i can say there is that looking at the eight aircraft, the irr's there are very strong for many years ahead. the payback period on these aircraft is only about two to three years. and we avoided having to incur some maintenance return conditions that we otherwise would have paid when returning the aircraft that would have been due to the lessors.
so it is a, again, very good irr, it will be very good for our p&l going forward. and your other question was how many aircraft we still have remaining on lease, i think, right?
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
yes, with the opportunity to potentially -- yes, the opportunity to potentially buy them and, as well, like you just did with these.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
there are still about approximately, i think it's 11 aircraft that remain on lease, and those will be through 2025. so we still have opportunities there to either release, not release, acquire those aircraft. so we still have those opportunities coming up.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
superb. alright. thanks so much.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, bob.
operator
our next question coming from the line of chris stathoulopoulos with susquehanna. your line is open.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
hey. good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. so john or spencer, could you give some more detail on what you're seeing with respect to the freighter supply demand balance as a whole. and then perhaps if there are any lanes that stick out, just looking at some of the wide-body passenger schedules this morning for flights originating in north america. it looks like for the second half, they're down around 12% versus the comparable period for 2019. so curious if you've seen any meaningful change in that dynamic versus when we last spoke in may?
and then perhaps, curious if you have any thoughts on biden's plans to require vaccinations for all inbound international passenger travelers, which could probably help that greater dynamic for the second half as well. thanks.
[technical issues] sorry, john. you are on mute.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
my apologies. occupational hazard these days. sorry about that. so i'll start, and then spencer can provide some additional color. well, we expect, and as i've been saying all along, the passenger carriers are going to have a tremendous appetite to bring as much capacity back into the market as soon as possible. and i'll applaud them on that. but what we're seeing here is it's much more gradual and even at the end of the period where we return back to pre-covid levels of volume, we're anticipating in some of the studies we see are anticipating that in terms of capacity, even when the volumes come back, the capacity will likely be 20% less than what it is today. so that's a factor to keep in mind and plays into airfreight.
in terms of available new capacity coming into the market, i'll say it's somewhat gradual and slower. there are really no available production slots for wide-body freighters until late fourth quarter 2023, other than those that are already on the books. and many of those are going to some of the express operators that are more customers than competitors of ours. some of the other available aircraft through conversions are longer lead times.
so over the next couple of years, at least, we see the supply not keeping past with this significant demand. i talked about some of the factors where the demand is coming back. and once covid subsides, which we all hope is sooner than later, there's just, in my view, going to be tremendous appetite for manufacturing movement of goods, raw materials, and finished product to get moving again. businesses are really interested in getting going again.
and we think that all favors air freight, particularly when you look at some of the other supply chain challenges of ocean that we mentioned. so that dynamic is in play. capacity is going to be tight, and we expect continued growth in air cargo, putting aside covid demand, just general economic return of airfreight to be 3% to 4% annually. fueled by a strong global economy once things get rolling again.
with regard to your question on biden's plans to require inbound immunization? yes, i think that's another burden for the international passenger carriers, it is going to further subdue demand because i know there are strong feelings on people getting the vaccination or not or needing to cross those hurdles. and in fact, what we're seeing, if you follow the news and some of the reports, countries are reversing course and getting more restrictive now. points in china, i read this morning, some pressure in germany. it's almost taking two steps forward, one step back, or describe it how you will.
so yes, we think that will contribute to international passenger travel being a bit slower than people forecasted, say, this time last year, for example.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
okay. and my follow-up. so it looks like yesterday, the u.s. dod reinstated some travel restrictions, but still, around 89% of their installations have had their restrictions lifted. so if you could just give us an update on the utilization trends for the u.s. dod into third quarter?
and then as a part b, i'm curious, i realize you're not a passenger airline, but you do have some commercial airlift. i'm curious if you're seeing any slowdown in bookings related to the covid cases and the delta variant? thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
so i'll start with the dod and say that as we said in our remarks, we're seeing the u.s. military passenger movements to return to kind of pre-covid and higher we're still evaluating while the demand is still strong on the cargo side. the withdrawal of afghanistan, we expect there to be continued movement in returning to pre-covid levels but just different kinds of flying. but cargo has not yet returned to the pre-covid levels, but we expect it will moderate.
i can't really comment on the passenger side. our business, as you point out, is so different on the passenger side. that -- much of what we do is for the military, which i said is increasing, which leaves somewhat less capacity for other passenger travel other than pre-booked things like sports teams that we move are proud to move five of the nfl teams to their away games and things that are already under contract. so i can't really comment on kind of the impact of this delta variant and its impact.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
i was just curious if there was something about garth brooks potentially canceling some concerts in the second half. and i do -- in the past, i think you have moved some kind of music and entertainment like.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
so curious if anyone has sort of -- has locked in charter space and is now perhaps looking to move that into 2022?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
nothing of consequence, chris.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
okay. great. thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
[operator instructions.] our next question coming from the line of scott group with wolfe research. your line is open.
jake -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi. this is jake [phonetic] on for scott. thanks for taking my question.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
hi, jake.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, jake.
jake -- wolfe research -- analyst
so one more on guidance. it looks like it includes a $33 million sequential decline in maintenance expense from 2q to 3q. but earnings implied are pretty flat sequentially. so i understand there isn't as much seasonality as a tailwind right now, given the long-term charter contracts. but what are the offsets to the lower maintenance expense?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
your question is with regard to maintenance expense. yes. maintenance expense, we expect to be lower certainly than the second quarter. so you see that sequential benefit there. what are the offsets you are asking? i think charter yields may be a slight offset there as charter yields were a bit higher on a sequential basis, but we'll see how that plays out. so that's a potential offset there. and then we do have...
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
is fuel, spencer, fuel in that equation?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
very little exposure on a net basis, i think, to fuel there. i think it's probably more of a yield story, jake. and we're being conservative. hopefully, we're being conservative there. i think it's more of a yield story. and on the small portion of our business that has the ad hoc charter flying.
jake -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. yes. that makes sense. and then we all saw the release from the pilot union today. can you give some thoughts around availability broadly? and directionally, how should we be thinking about labor costs in 4q following the arbitration?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
i'll -- jake, i'll start. i'll be honest. we've been preparing for this earnings call. so i hadn't seen the labor press release. but as we said in our remarks, we're -- we're excited to get to the point where we're going to get our next jcba. and as we said, there will be a pilot increase, what we've described as a material pilot increase coming sooner than later. we're in the home stretch here. it's all up to the arbitrator and timing, which is right around the corner.
and we believe we have just a tremendous value proposition for any pilot to come work for us. you see the diversity of our fleet, the type of flying we do, where we do it. pilots can choose among different aircraft types and different networks; both domestically and international. and an increase in the current agreement is going to enhance our ability to recruit and retain.
now having said all that, there's no question that pilot of availability is an industry issue. it's not an atlas issue. it's an industry issue. and when you had some of the majors and legacy carriers and integrators putting programs in place like early retirements when they were under significant financial pressure to cut costs and avoid furloughs, you had a lot of pilots come out of the market because of that, coupled with now the return of starting with the domestic passenger travel, and the expansion -- significant expansion of what our colleagues in the industry, fedex and ups are growing and they're hiring. all that places pressure on pilot availability, particularly near-term when pilots elect to make a change to go from an atlas to another carrier or from another carrier to atlas. all those dynamics are in play.
what i've said before, it's not uncommon when larger airlines that have bigger contracts than ours are hiring that we lose pilots, that's just a fact of life. but when it's happening in an environment with big numbers, sure, that has an impact on us. but we believe we have a tremendous value proposition, and we will be a carrier of choice, especially with our new contract. and we're looking forward to doing that and having our pilots have this as a career destination. so to the extent the press release you're referencing said otherwise, i don't agree with it. but to the extent it's consistent, i agree with it, and i look forward to reading it.

our next question coming from the line of frank galanti with stifel. your line is open.
frank galanti -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you so much for taking my questions. i wanted to ask a high-level question about capital allocation. between growth, returning capital to shareholders, paying down debt. what are the priorities for the cash flows coming in? and particularly interested in walking through the thought process on that decision.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
sure. as we've said all along, we have a variety of priorities. and spencer mentioned, paying down debt is certainly one of them. and i think we've done a really solid job of doing that. it went down a full tick as was reported. we're going to continue to do that to strengthen our balance sheet, make sure that we're able to endure any potential downturn. i'm not anticipating that's going to happen. but as we've been talking about, we're not through this pandemic yet. and we need to be sure we have the wherewithal to weather through the entire pandemic and then be positioned to grow the business.
and for now, with regard to any kind of share buyback or anything like that, we're currently still under the restrictions of the cares act. but that's certainly on the list of options available to us when we get to that point that we're able to have that as a serious consideration.
so we're focused on, honestly, making as much money as we can during this unprecedented period, keeping our head down and doing that, strengthening the balance sheet, continuing to manage through this pandemic, support our employees and invest in the business and seek to maximize our shareholder value in the multiple forms that, that may take.
frank galanti -- stifel -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and i guess following up on the balance sheet, given that we aren't through this pandemic, and there's a number of kind of already pre-committed capex decisions with the four new-build planes and then these eight plants that was announced this quarter, kind of on a, i guess, a larger picture, what is a normalized debt level look like for atlas, either from a debt-to-ebitda or debt to total cap kind of positioning?
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
spencer, i'll turn it over to you. i'm just going to give a high level, and that's a tough -- that's one what's normalized. i think it depends on the time and place and where we are. there may be times where we're prepared for the right opportunity to take on some more debt. this has been a period of paying that debt down. it wasn't all that long ago that we were up well north of four, pushing five. and we did that for the right reasons. we took on debt when we bought the amazon aircraft, for example. and now we're in an environment where we could do a little bit of both, invest in the business as well as bring down our debt.
so at a high level, i don't know that we can provide anything that's normalized. but in terms of the ratio, spencer, maybe you want to comment on that further, what's a comfortable place?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. frank, our target generally has been somewhere between three and four times. we're obviously well below that. and that's a good place to be for a capital-intensive business. as john said, it is pretty situational. we had an opportunity to acquire the last four -8's that boeing is producing. they are tremendous, tremendous aircraft. and we had an opportunity to acquire these 400's coming off lease. the 400's are generally, on average, about mid-life. so they have still a good long kind of runway ahead of them. so we had some good opportunities, and we've taken those opportunities.
so overall, we're below kind of where our target is. but again, as a capital-intensive business, we feel good about it. we think it's the right place for us to be. we used to hear from investors sometimes that our leverage ratio was a little too high. and so we've really been focusing on bringing that down, and we're pretty proud of where we've gotten to.
frank galanti -- stifel -- analyst
yes. so i guess, apologies for kind of following up again, but the -- with that context, if historically normalized was kind of three to four times, investors didn't like that debt level. i guess the real question is how much of that is pre-committed?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
it was higher than that when they were not happy with the leverage level, it was higher than that. and so i think they'd be more comfortable in that sort of range or below it where we are now.
frank galanti -- stifel -- analyst
okay. yes, but -- sorry, the point i was really trying to get to was how much of that has already been spoken for, right? if you look at what capex needs to go out and the debt that's associated with that, and how much more can you -- how much capex do you have to work with outside of that, already accounted for?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, there are two parts to the net leverage ratio. earnings is a part of it as well, and so we need to deliver good, strong earnings to keep that level where we'd like it to be. so that's a really important part of it. and then your question about how much sort of capex is already spoken for and how much we have available. not highly sure how to answer that. but we feel comfortable with our leverage, and we feel comfortable where it is and where it's going to be.
we haven't provided an outlook beyond that at this point. so to comment on our capex spending beyond our outlook period, i don't think would be appropriate today.
frank galanti -- stifel -- analyst
okay. that is helpful...
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, i'll just add, we're in a really fortunate position. we were able to pay, so the four 747-8's that we're taking delivery of next year, they have a pretty significant pre-delivery payment schedule. and so we have to make those payments this year, and we've been in a position where we did not need to finance those, we've been able to pay those in cash. so we've been doing that. we've been acquiring the aircraft that we talked about today, and we're in a great position to be able to do that and our balance sheet is quite strong, which allows us to do that.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
and if i could -- if i could add to that, as i said in my remarks, we strive to be very disciplined in our investments, particularly on aircraft. so what spencer has been talking about are the aircraft for our operation. but we also have our titan business that is continuing to focus on the market for opportunities for further investment. we did announce the two sale-leaseback aircraft 767's that will ultimately be converted.
so as the evolution of the passenger business kind of continues to shake out, and there are opportunities in the marketplace for investments for converted candidates, for example, we're going to be watching that closely as well.
frank galanti -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and we have a follow-up question from chris stathoulopoulos with susquehanna. your line is open.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my follow-up. so spencer, just remind us when the restrictions around psp1 laps and did -- part b, did you take any fund on psp2 or three? and also, so your order book here, you have the eight aircraft that you're going to buy out at the end of the lease, you have the four factory orders. should we think about capex returning to a high teens, low 20% level of revenue for 2022 and 2023? thanks.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, chris. as far as the cares act restrictions, so the restrictions with regard to not being able to pay dividends or repurchasing shares, those expire at the end of september. we still have restrictions on executive compensation to go into 2022. and then we still have a loan portion related to -- there was a grant portion and the loan portion. and so the loan portion is long-term. and so we still have that outstanding, and we'll need to consider that as we move forward. we did not take any funds after the initial allocation for cargo air carriers.
let's see, with regard to capital allocation, yes, we've been -- we're fortunate enough to acquire the four aircraft, 747-8's next year, and we're acquiring these eight. but we're really not going to talk about our outlook beyond those at this point. we have no commitments beyond those at this point that is why we've told you the commitments that we have.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
and then just curious, how many aircraft can you realistically grow your fleet or our order book over the next few years? is 8% to 10% sort of the limit? and then how should we think about maintenance expense as you bring that aircraft on. are there any... [technical issues]
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
[technical issues] when we bring aircraft in, is there any maintenance required? i think that's what you're asking, chris, at the end.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
just curious, realistically, how many planes [technical issues] curious if eight to ten is the limit. and then also -- prep these aircraft, i realized the four from the factory, but whether there's any upfront maintenance costs that are -- that we should expect as you get ready to place those aircraft in service? thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i, again, kind of goes to time and place. as you may recall, as you identified -- we brought up 24 airplanes in a matter of 24 months when we brought on the amazon aircraft, and that included acquiring them as well as converting them and then bringing them online. so a lot more work involved in that.
there definitely are lead times. when you're growing, you want to be able to crew it, which is also another reason why we're looking forward to getting into our next collective bargaining agreement to make us even that much more attractive candidate. they're generally -- with used airplanes, there's, generally speaking, a maintenance requirement, the aircraft go through what's called a c check, generally speaking, to bridge on to from where it was operating before to your certificate. and those c checks can range from 21 to 31 days, roughly speaking, depending on the age of the aircraft and the type of c check that's required.
so when you're talking about used aircraft, there's that lead time. for new aircraft like the [indecipherable], there would not be. it'd come right online.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. and i'll just add to that, that for the eight aircraft that we're acquiring, they're already in our existing fleet. so there's no maintenance requirement there. in fact, it's the opposite, as i mentioned before, there would be if we were continuing -- if the lease was ending, we would have a maintenance condition kind of payment that will be due to the lessors at the end of the lease period. and because we are acquiring the aircraft, those will not be. so it's a cost avoidance, which is terrific.
on the four new 747-8's, those are brand-new aircraft and just the opposite, again, those aircraft come with kind of a sort of a maintenance honeymoon as we referred to it as because they will not need maintenance for quite some time. and most things that could possibly go wrong with the aircraft are under warranty for a good period of time.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
thanks. if i could just squeeze in one more. and i think this is important for investors to hear. just how -- could you remind us how payload-sensitive atlas today overall is relative to last year? and i know you moved a lot of the charter business to multi-month or multi-year contracts. but what's the sort of the mix of consolidated block hours that move on sort of spot versus that are on contract? thanks.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure, chris. so when you look at our overall flying, about 60% to 65% of that flying is in our traditional kind of acmi business. about 20% of that is now in these long-term charter arrangements. 8% to 10% is with the u.s. military, about 5% is flying that we do around south america. and that leaves right around 5%, 6% in the ad hoc sort of spot charter market.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna -- analyst
thank you.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the atlas air worldwide holdings second quarter 2021 results conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. after the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions.]
i would now like to hand the conference over to the atlas air management team. please go ahead.
ed mcgarvey -- senior vice president and treasurer
thank you, olivia, and good morning, everyone. i'm ed mcgarvey, treasurer for atlas air worldwide. welcome to our second quarter 2021 results conference call. today's call will be hosted by john dietrich, our chief executive officer and spencer schwartz, our chief financial officer. today's call is complemented by a slide presentation that can be viewed at atlasairworldwide.com under presentations in the investor information section.
as indicated on slide two, i'd like to remind you that our discussion about the company's performance today includes some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements relate to future events and expectations, and they involve risks and uncertainties. our actual results or actions may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.

during our question-and-answer period today, we'd like to ask participants to limit themselves to one principal question and one follow-up question so that we can accommodate as many participants as possible. after we've gone through the queue, we'd be happy to answer any additional questions as time permits.
at this point, i'd like to draw your attention to slide three and turn the call over to john dietrich.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, ed, and hello, everyone. welcome to our second-quarter earnings call. i'd like to start by thanking all our employees and all the frontline responders for their continuing and tremendous efforts throughout this pandemic. at atlas, safety is a core value and is always a top priority. with that commitment in mind, we continue to take extensive precautions to safeguard our employees and our operations to support our customers and safely transport the goods the world needs.
this pandemic has really underscored the important role that atlas plays in the global supply chain and in our customers' networks. it also highlights the significance of global airfreight, which brings goods to market with unmatched speed and reliability. we've seen an acceleration of express and e-commerce growth. and in today's global economy, manufacturers and merchants are needing to quickly replenish inventories to meet growing consumer demand. that said, covid-19 continues to cause disruptions to manufacturing. we're also seeing congestion and delays at many ocean ports worldwide. this congestion and the related delays are leading to ocean freight rates that are extremely elevated and shippers are, therefore, increasingly choosing air freight to mitigate bottlenecks in their supply chains, and that's driving even more airfreight demand. this all bodes well for global airfreight volumes, which are now exceeding pre-pandemic levels.
atlas' fleet and our global operating capabilities are unmatched in the industry. we're continuing to leverage the strength and flexibility of our business model to capitalize on current market conditions. and importantly, we're positioning the company well for the future. we're actively managing our fleet to profitably serve our customers with modern efficient aircraft. and we take a very disciplined approach when making aircraft investment decisions.
as announced in our press release today, between may and august, we acquired three of our existing 747-400 freighters that were previously on lease to us. in addition, we reached agreements with our lessors to purchase five of our other existing 747-400 freighters at the end of their lease terms in 2022.
acquiring these eight freighters underscores our confidence in these assets as well as in the global air freight market. by keeping these aircraft in our fleet, we're ensuring these capable freighters will be available to provide committed capacity to our customers with strong returns for atlas in the years ahead. as the world's largest 747 freighter operator, the 747-400 is core to our business, and it complements our diverse fleet of 747-8's, 777's, 767's, and 737's, each of which plays a unique role in our customers' networks.
now turning to our second-quarter results on slide four. we entered the second quarter with very high expectations, all of which were exceeded. on an adjusted basis, our earnings were among the best in our company's history. these positive results could only have been achieved by our entire team coming together to execute on our strategy. our diverse and experienced team is second to none, and they pulled together to increase utilization on our aircraft and to deliver safe, high-quality service for our customers despite a very challenging operating environment due to covid.
our performance continued to benefit from operating the four 747 freighters and the 777 freighter we reintroduced to our fleet in 2020. this capacity, along with a tremendous team effort contributed to our ability to enter into and extend long-term agreements with strategic customers as well as capitalize on lucrative short-term opportunities in this strong global air freight market.
as i mentioned earlier, our second-quarter results reflected global airfreight volumes that now exceed pre-pandemic levels and ongoing disruption of global supply chains due to the pandemic. in addition, the second quarter reflected improved passenger charter flying for the u.s. military and the continued reduction of international passenger belly cargo capacity. partially offsetting these benefits were lower yields net of fuel compared with the exceptionally high yields we saw in april and may of 2020 during the early months of the pandemic.
equally important to the results we delivered is how we've delivered them. one of our core values at atlas is corporate responsibility. and in june, we issued our second environmental, social, and governance, or esg report. this report is themed caring for the world we carry, and it captures our commitments to our people, communities, and the planet. and it also outlines our esg strategy and goals. we invite you to read more about our esg program and our progress in the report, which is available in the corporate responsibilities section of our website.
turning for a moment to our pilot labor negotiations. we're pleased to report we've moved even closer to completing the new joint collective bargaining agreement with our pilots at atlas air and southern air. the union has now provided the company with their integrated seniority list. the scheduled arbitration on the open issues concluded in april and both parties submitted their post-earning briefs in early june. the arbitrator is now considering all the information presented, and we expect to receive his final and binding decision late in the third quarter.
now moving on to slide five. as i've been discussing, economic and supply chain conditions remain favorable for air cargo and for our dedicated freighters. inventory levels remain low. the purchasing managers index or pmi readings have been positive and congestion long lead times and elevated pricing continued to impact ocean freight, helping to further favor airfreight. demand also continues to exceed available supply, particularly on the international routes as international travel stays subdued and related belly capacity remains out of the market.
despite some of the well-publicized improvement in domestic passenger traffic, the recovery of international passenger travel continues to be hampered by border closures and other travel restrictions due to continued covid-19 challenges, especially with the rapidly spreading delta variant. while the operating environment remains challenging due to the pandemic, the market dynamics we're seeing in the third quarter remain strong. as a result, we expect revenue of nearly $1 billion and adjusted ebitda of approximately $250 million from flying more than 90,000 block hours in the third quarter. in addition, we expect adjusted net income to grow by approximately 50%, with adjusted net income of $82.7 million in the third quarter of last year. our third-quarter outlook reflects the contribution of our long-term customer agreements that have favorable rates and guaranteed levels of flying, continued high levels of aircraft utilization, driven by strong demand, and commercial charter yields that we expect to remain above typical seasonal levels. we also expect ongoing expenses driven by the pandemic, including premium pay for our pilots as well as costs for continuing to provide a safe working environment for all our employees and maintenance expense in the third quarter of approximately $100 million.
for the full year, we expect aircraft maintenance expense to be lower than 2020, and we expect depreciation and amortization to be about $275 million. core capital expenditures, which exclude aircraft and engine purchases, are projected to total approximately $105 million to $115 million, mainly for parts and components for our fleet. given the ongoing economic and market-related uncertainties including covid-19 and the unfortunate spread of the delta variant as well as various travel restrictions, low international passenger travel, and other factors, we are providing a third-quarter outlook, but not providing a further outlook at this time. we will, however, look forward to keeping you updated as the year progresses.
this is a good point for spencer to provide more details on our second-quarter results. and after spencer's remarks, i'll have some additional comments, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. spencer?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, john, and hello, everyone. our strong second-quarter results are highlighted on slidesix6. on an adjusted basis, ebitda totaled $243.7 million, with adjusted net income totaling $121.8 million. on a reported basis, net income totaled $107.1 million. our adjusted earnings included an effective income tax rate of 22.4%.
moving to the top of slide seven, revenue totaled $990.4 million in the quarter. higher airline operations segment revenue was primarily driven by an increase in flying and the average rate per block hour. block hour volume growth primarily reflected our ability to increase aircraft utilization to serve strong customer demand, the strength of the international air freight markets, the ongoing reduction of available cargo capacity, and the disruption of global supply chains due to the pandemic.
in addition, segment revenue benefited from the operation of the five freighters we reactivated throughout 2020, the four 747's and one 777 as well as improved charter flying for the u.s. military. revenue in our dry leasing segment was relatively unchanged.
looking now at the bottom of the slide. segment contribution totaled $242.6 million in the second quarter. airline operations segment performance improved significantly compared with the prior year that included exceptionally high commercial charter yields in april and may last year. higher airline operations contribution during the period was primarily driven by the positive factors benefiting segment revenue i just noted as well as lower heavy maintenance expense. in dry leasing, higher segment contribution was primarily due to lower interest expense related to the scheduled repayment of debt.
now turning to slide eight. our net leverage ratio declined another tick, finishing the quarter at 2.0 times, down a full turn from 3.0 times at the end of the second quarter of 2020. we ended the second quarter with cash, including cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $760.5 million. our cash position at june 30 reflected cash used for investing and financing activities, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities. net cash used for investing activities in the first half of 2021 was primarily for core capital expenditures, payments for flight equipment, and modifications, including pre-delivery payments for 747-8 aircraft that will take next year as well as spare engines, engine overhauls, and upgrade kits.
net cash used for financing activities during the six-month period primarily reflected debt payments, partially offset by proceeds from debt issuance. we continue to apply a disciplined approach to financing. as we've indicated before, this has resulted in the low weighted average coupon interest rate, which now stands at 2.95%, and the majority is secured by our aircraft assets, which have a value in excess of the related debt. we remain committed to a strong balance sheet, and we're taking actions to mitigate the impact of any continuation or worsening of the pandemic as well as to position our company for continued success by managing costs, enhancing liquidity, and strategically allocating resources.
now i'd like to turn it back to john.
john w. dietrich -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, spencer. and moving to slide nine. we have great business momentum, delivered a very strong second quarter, and we feel very good about the third quarter. our team continues to execute on our strategy and capitalize on the current air freight environment, while also positioning us well for the future. we're closer to completing a new joint collective bargain agreement with our pilots, and we'll continue to take every precaution to protect our world-class team of employees and our operations to ensure that we can continue to serve our customers and transport essential goods around the world.
at this point, operator, may we have the first question, please?
",2021-Q2,AAWW
-0.8035,1.0,,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from stephanie moore with truist. your line is open. ms. moore, your line is open.
stephanie lynn moore -- truist securities -- analyst
oh, can you hear me?
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
yes, we can.
stephanie lynn moore -- truist securities -- analyst
okay, got it. thank you. for my first question, i wanted to touch a bit on capital allocation, another step-down in just your net leverage ratio this quarter. obviously, a really strong performance here and cash flow generation for the year. so maybe just where you stand in terms of share repurchases or acquisitions and just your overall view? thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
so, thank you stephanie. and i'll start with that. similar to what spencer referred to on our financing activities, it relates to our capital allocation strategy. we take a very disciplined and balanced approach and frankly look at all of our highest priorities for using our cash. as i said in our prepared remarks, we've invested heavily in new technology as well as acquiring the 747-400 aircraft in terms of funding our fleet. we focus on modern efficient aircraft. and we're always looking for opportunity for growth whether that's organic growth or m&a. and in the meantime a considerable time spent focusing on bringing our debt down as well.
we're very pleased with where we are. we also have to remember we're still in this pandemic environment. and as spencer mentioned in his comments, there still remains a lot of uncertainty out there in the marketplace. while we feel strongly that the current conditions will continue, we want to be sure we're best positioned to weather any potential downturns. i'm not saying that that's going to happen but we're in a good position to weather that. so really all options are on the table. i think we've said that before. so spencer, i'll turn it over to you to see if you want to add anything to that.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, john. yes, stephanie. our focus is on growing the business while generating returns above our cost of capital and maintaining a strong balance sheet. as john said, given the strength of the market we see opportunities for us to invest in organic growth. we're especially focused on investing in modern efficient aircraft that customers want like the four -8s that we have coming.
but we're also evaluating m&a opportunities both in our immediate space as well as potential adjacent spaces. but we're taking a disciplined approach, given the current valuation so we're being careful and thoughtful. we think that organic growth and m&a would generate the best returns for our shareholders so we continue to evaluate these investment opportunities. and while we're doing that we continue to make normal sort of regular debt paydowns and our leverage is reducing and we have a really really strong balance sheet that helps us prepare for any unexpected events that may happen while we are focusing in on flexibility and opportunistic capital deployment.
stephanie lynn moore -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. so i mean, i guess just to push that a little bit further in terms of, your share repurchase appetite, can you remind us when the lockup period expires in terms of being able to reengage in share repurchases?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. the cares act restrictions ended at the end of september and so they are technically no longer there. there's still of course, significant amount of scrutiny, with regard to, those companies that received cares act grants but they did end on september 30. as far as share repurchases go, it's something that our board certainly considers. we've been as we've talked about we've been paying down debt ensuring that we have a strong balance sheet. we want to finance our fleet and have modern efficient assets. and our board in the regular course, considers share repurchases and obviously, we'll let everyone know if that changes.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
i'd like to add to that too because spencer, you raised a good point. while as spencer noted, the technical legal time has passed i'd like to remind that we are still in the pandemic environment. and one of the fundamental reasons, we participated in the cares act was due to the uncertainty created by the pandemic. and so that's part of our thought process. we're not quite out of that yet. another factor in our focus on the uses of cash toward growing the business organically and paying down debt and exploring m&a opportunities. not that share repurchases aren't a tool available to us but given that we're still in the pandemic we would raise cares act considerations as a practical matter.
stephanie lynn moore -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. well, i really appreciate all the color. i'll pass it on. thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director

obviously, you have extraordinarily strong demand. i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about labor availability as it relates to pilots if you need to hire any more from the new jcba or obviously potentially from the -8s and whatnot. but also kind of across the board for the rest of your employees as well how is labor availability impacting you right now? sure. thanks bob. yes, labor availability is certainly an industry if not a national global consideration. you see in the headlines kind of the great resignation culture that we're in. we feel good about our labor availability across the board. that's not to say that we don't experience some of the challenges that others do. we do. pilot availability is certainly an industry issue. you see it in the headlines every day. the majors are hiring. the integrators and express carriers are hiring pilots and other personnel. it certainly has an impact on everyone in the industry and atlas is no exception. that said, we're delighted as i said to have entered into this collective bargaining agreement with regard to our pilots. we feel good about the outcome of the jcba to long-term agreement that provides very competitive rates within our comparators in the industry that we serve. and the pilots got a very good pay raise and we believe -- i believe that we have a great culture here at atlas and a place where pilots can grow their careers. i believe that's true with the rest of the organization as well. i mean if you just look across our management team starting from the top down many of us have worked together for well over 10 years, if not longer, and that resonates and is a theme throughout our organization. people come to atlas and they generally stay for all the right reasons. that said, it's a war for talent as they say. so, we're out there every day looking to recruit and importantly retain and we'll be focused on that. so, in summary, i'd say it's an issue, but it's something we're continuing to manage and we'll need to manage as everyone else is going forward. okay, great. and then you touched on this, but maybe an update on the -8 deliveries as it relates to customer interest remaining payments for the pdps. and then also as it relates to future contracts that you're going to sign, obviously, having the collective bargaining agreement signed helps, but any other benefits from having this agreement done for future contracts?
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
yes. thanks bob. well, look we feel really good about the dash 8s coming. frankly they can't come soon enough. it's a great airplane and one we're really excited about coming to us. so in terms of placement, we're in a really strong environment. we're not worried about placing the aircraft. we're focused on where is the best placement of the aircraft.
and there's as we talked about there's tremendous customer interest. it's the best freighter in the market really for what it does. that's not to disparage other aircraft and 777 is a great airplane too but the dash 8 is really a great airplane. so we feel good about that of course. our ability to staff it and crew it is important to our customers and as i just talked about we're going to continue to manage that. but the dash 8 will be put to work for sure and we're excited about bringing them online.
robert james labick -- cjs securities -- analyst

operator
thank you. and our next question comes from chris stathoulopoulos with susquehanna international.
christopher nicholas -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my question and john, spencer and team congrats on finally tying up this labor deal.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
thanks, chris.
christopher nicholas -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
if i could here not to rain on anyone's parade, but curious so it looks like in your prepared remarks you said september the deal was reflected in september. so as we think about the exit rate for the fourth quarter here for swb and any other adjustments that you need to make that relate to that new contract what gives you the confidence that you can offset some of these the higher wages into 2022 particularly when it looks like for at least the summer and the back half of next year a lot of widebody capacity is coming back online.
and then part b of that last spring when you moved to more acmi-like contracts and charter some of those deals i remember you saying were three months to six months or one to two years in duration. and how much of those at this point have already come up for renewal? and how much are about to come up or about to expire? thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
sure. i'll start spencer and then turn it over to you for some further thoughts. but first of all chris, we're not going to let you rain on our parade. you're right the rates went into effect september 1. and you're also right capacity is starting to come back online. but certainly not at a rate that causes me any immediate concerns. i think what you're going to see first of all is as borders start to open up we expect a transatlantic and already seeing some of that. that belly capacity will come back.
but you also need to remember that the demand for airfreight is beyond pre-pandemic levels. and we're not expecting the capacity to come back first of all to the levels that it was at pre-pandemic. and also not at the pace that capacity is coming back into the market. in other words demand is exceeding that pace at least for the foreseeable future.
there's a number of considerations that go into that question as well as where is that capacity coming back? and what kind of capacity is coming back? will that be -- will that capacity be international passenger belly capacity particularly? will that be on typical cargo trade lanes or will it be more point-to-point? some of the newer aircraft coming online like the 787 is designed for point-to-point. it can certainly serve hub and spoke, but we're watching that closely. how much capacity will be coming in the trans-pacific, which is a really important trade lane for us? and we see that coming back one more slowly, but as well on the backend of the recovery. so for the amount of capacity that's coming back and the rate that's coming back, we think the demand is going to continue to exceed that supply.
another factor to consider as well is some of the changes the growth of e-commerce and express that are going to continue to grow as we pointed out. as well as some of the new customers, we've been able to create. there's been a tremendous demand from customers that are new to us manufacturers as i said some of the freight forwarders are seeing the value of fixed capacity and controlled capacity. and we think that's going to sustain, beyond the passenger recovery on the international sector. so there are a number of considerations. i'm not suggesting things aren't going to moderate. they will eventually from where we are today, but we feel good about the long-term prospects.
and to tie into your second part of your question, in terms of the duration, i don't think we've said that three to six month duration. the deals we've been signing and amending go well beyond that, including more recent contract extensions of people that are favoring our assets and the service we provide. so we see this as a longer-term play in our ability to pass on those costs. we feel better about it than what your question suggests. spencer over to you.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, john. chris, i'll just make a couple of points, but then more specifically comment on the duration. just a couple of points to add to what john said. as you know, inventory levels are at record lows, and there are a number of widely reported shortages of goods, which means that when these things come back, and when chips are available and when these goods are available, and when people start to-if they go back to malls and things like that, all of that bodes really well for airfreight, because goods will need to move very, very quickly.
and then just one other point and then, i'll talk about the duration is that, manufacturing continues to move away from cities that have large passenger hubs. and so that drives airfreight to airports that are more cargo focused. and so the belly capacity is not as available, and it's less of an issue in those important trade lanes. but then to get to the duration of these long-term charter contracts, the vast majority of them go into 2022, and 2023. some of them go into 2024 and 2025. during the quarter, we added an aircraft with a customer for a term of 3.6 years, so it goes through april 2025, at a really good rate. we also extended term with another customer that goes to october 2024, with a higher rate. and so on a fairly regular basis customer's are extending these agreements at higher rates, so we feel good about the long-term charter business.
christopher nicholas -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
okay. and as a follow-up to that, so you mentioned earlier, i think there was a question around capital allocation here. and the restrictions on the buybacks have lifted under the cares act. admittedly it's probably not a good time for airlines to be buying back stocks all things considered. but with respect to m&a, so you did the southern deal, i think it was in 2015 to get into the 777s. as we look at other potential carriers or perhaps something upstream, you're long 767, 747, 777s. should we assume or is it fair that perhaps moving into the airbus platform might be something that you could do? or would it be something as an mro or something kind of further upstream? thanks.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
yes chris, that's a great question. and i think from our perspective all options are on the table. we're not certainly not ruling out an airbus product. it's a great product. and our view has been, we would want to be sure we have sufficient scale to go into any new aircraft type. i feel very confident we have the organizational capabilities to do that. many of our technical people and flight ops people have flown and maintained the airbus product in their careers, so we're not concerned about that. we just would want to be sure that it's the right asset of sufficient scale for our business. so, i wouldn't rule out an airbus product at all.
with regard to and spencer alluded to this other options, there are fewer and fewer m&a opportunities presently at times. so, do we look to adjacent space mro or something else? sure. i think all options are on the table, so i wouldn't rule anything out at this point.
christopher nicholas -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
okay. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from helane becker with cowen. your line is open.
helane renee becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks very much operator. hi everybody and thank you very much for the time.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
thank you.
helane renee becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
just a couple of questions. the first question i have is, on your pilots what's the average tenure? so if i look at the contract and i compare it to the old contract, i would see the starting salaries didn't go up significantly. but those for people with longer tenures went up significantly. so like, how should we think about junior pilots versus senior pilots and the average tenure i guess is the best way to ask it?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so, i'll speak to the average tenure. it's coming down. the weighted average is coming down. we saw as you know helane over the past four years or so, we've had a tremendous amount of growth. we've grown really all of the platforms. the 777s for sure the 767 in large numbers. so, when you're hiring off this -- when you're hiring new pilots, your average tenure goes down.
i don't have a specific number other than to say, we've had a significant increase in younger pilots. and what i'll say, when i say younger, i mean shorter tenured pilots because we've hired so much. and then the age 65 rules kicked in and scheduled retirements is also contributing to that average coming down. i'd be guessing, i don't have the exact number at my fingertips, but it's probably north of five years, but i'd be guessing there in the aggregate. so that's that piece of it.
helane renee becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes. no i would think it would be coming down. but i'm just thinking if it's like in the eight to 10-year range versus over 12?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i don't think it's over 12 at this point. but again, i don't have the exact number. and look it's an exciting opportunity for us to have the 737 gauge. it's i don't want to say it's an entry-level aircraft but it's a smaller gauge aircraft that we're able to hire into and pilots generally graduate up to larger equipment.
so when i mentioned our fleet we have the ability for pilots to really enjoy a variety of fleet types, smaller gauge, large, largest gauge as well as different types of operations. so we feel we have a really attractive value proposition for pilots to come work for us. so on the rates.
helane renee becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
i'm sorry. go ahead.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
so the second part of your question was on rates. in going through this arbitration process and the negotiations with the union, we looked at all the rates, both entry-level as well as top of scale and strive to be competitive with our comparators in the marketplace. and we feel good about where we landed there.
so i wouldn't say we're on the low end. i'd generally say across the board on rates we're on the higher end of our comparators. that's certainly true with the top of scale people which gives our younger pilots something to strive for.
helane renee becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
got you. okay. thank you very much for all that detail. i really appreciate it. and then i think this might be a question for john. as you think about the growth and i appreciate all the comments that you made in answer to all the other questions about it and the new aircraft and so on, how do you think about somebody like maersk ordering two 777 freighters?
you wouldn't normally for their star air subsidiary, right, you wouldn't normally see a shipping company wanting to own aircraft. so how are you thinking about like non-traditional folks getting into the airfreight market and how that would impact any rates that you might think about or your own marketing position in the next year or so?
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
sure. that's a great question. i personally have mixed feelings about it. i'm always a little cautious when a new potential competitor comes into the marketplace. i get very competitive there and so you want to keep that to a minimum. but on the other hand, if you look at it, it ties in with the comments i was making earlier about the value of airfreight and sustainability.
it says that some very sophisticated players in the freight market see the value of airfreight so much so that they're willing to invest in it. so i think that bodes well for the long-term future of airfreight and ties in with some of the comments of new customers being created.
spencer to the extent, there's modal shift, it doesn't take a great deal of modal shift from sea to air to make a meaningful impact on air freight. so i think you have to view that as a favorable sign for airfreight. what it also means is at atlas we need to continue to compete and be the best at what we do to make sure we get our share of the business.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thanks, john. that s very helpful. thank you very much.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from scott group with wolfe research. your line is open.
scott h. group -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning, guys. so i want to ask one of chris' questions a little differently. just with the longer-term charter business, what's the rough percentage of your business next year that will get repriced in one way or another? and how does that compare with a typical year? i'm guessing it's less, but any thoughts there?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, scott. we have a number of these long-term charter agreements. and as i said, we are in regular conversations with all of these customers. they need this capacity. and so they are entering into conversations with us on a very regular basis about extending those. and those are happening all the time. there's interest in extending these for up to five years. there's demand for five-year terms out in the marketplace.
so as far as our acmi agreements, it's, i would say, less than typical, because those are fairly long-term in nature. as far as these charter agreements, as i said, most of them go into 2022 and 2023, some go into to 2024 and 2025. and again, they're all looking to ensure that they have this capacity so we feel good about it.
scott h. group -- wolfe research -- analyst
no, i get it, but like meaning the rails will say, hey 50% of our business reprices in a given year or the truckers might say, it's 80% or whatever it is. is there a rough ballpark so we can understand it?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
perhaps our customers that might be the case for our customers, scott who are freight forwarders or charter brokers and so forth in their dealings with their customers. but for us, it's a little different, because we have -- we don't have that many of these, right? we have a finite number of acmi contracts. we have a finite number of these long-term charter contracts. and so we're managing them all very closely. it's not sort of law of large numbers kind of thing.
scott h. group -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
scott, i'd like to add a little additional perspective as well, because we've been balancing the long-term charter agreements with the short-term swing capacity that is very high yielding, right? so when we commit to a long-term charter agreement particularly in the environment we're in, it's generally a little bit longer route and that tied in with my comment to chris.
but i also don't want to undervalue the significance of the flex capacity and the ad hoc capacity that at times we maintain by design rather than committing to lower-yielding long-term charters. and that has contributed that fairly complex balance to the very strong results. so while we heavily favor the long-term charter in the acmi, we're also wanting to capitalize on the near term very, very favorable conditions as well.
scott h. group -- wolfe research -- analyst
that makes sense. can i just ask one more? so probably at this time a year ago there's almost nobody thought you'd grow earnings this year and earnings will be up, i don't know, 35%, 40% this year. any thoughts on next year and the ability to grow earnings? and anything you could share on either maintenance or military now that the calendar is reset on those two items?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes, scott, overall, as john has talked about the environment is, incredibly strong and we expect that that will continue. the acceleration of express and the adoption of e-commerce. record low inventory levels, all of these things bode really well for airfreight overall. with regard to 22, we'll look to provide some more information during our next earnings call. it's a -- you know, it's an interesting environment, obviously in the midst of a pandemic. and so, we're only been providing quarterly guidance this year. we'll see next quarter, whether we provide one quarter guidance or whether we get back to the kind of more normal, providing guidance for a longer term. so, we'll talk more about that during our next earnings call.
but there are there are a number of really positive factors. and of course, you know, one big variable is yields. and we do expect that they will normally moderate at some point. and so, we'll just have to see when that is and we'll do a lot of modelling around that.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
and i just have one additional point, if i could add to that, because in my prior remarks, i mentioned we may see some lower flying on military and scott, you mentioned military. i don't necessarily view that in the near term as a bad thing. those resources will be gainfully employed into the strong commercial market. and it's more efficient flying, generally speaking in the commercial market, versus the more adhoc charter flying for the military. that's not in any way to disparage the military flying. it's just, we have other current uses. so the timing isn't all that bad, if there's going to be a softening of the amc cargo business for us right now.
scott h. group -- wolfe research -- analyst
makes sense. thank you guys, appreciate it.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
thank you.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, scott.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from frank galanti with stifel. your line is open.
frank galanti -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
great. thank you very much. i wanted to ask about the supply dynamics for the wide-body freighter market. from what i understand historically their -- dedicated freighters moved about 40% of transoceanic freight in kind of a normalized environment, as passenger belly space took up, make up the difference. can you talk to what that current rate is? and what you expect kind of moving forward, it's international like return to more normalize levels?
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
frank, we feel work from the operating premises, it's more it's closer to 50/50 in terms of what was pre-pandemic, belly versus main deck freighters. clearly, for the foreseeable future, it's going to be more heavily weighted in favor of main deck traders. there will be new freighters coming into the market. but for us, not as directly competitive most of the 777, you know, we talked about we're taking the last 747s. you know, that leaves the 777 and the 767 mainly for new production.
the 777s are largely not exclusively, but largely going to the integrators; the fedex s and dhls and the integrators so not competitive to us. as is true for many of the 767s. but offsetting that there's also a lot of older equipment that that may be retiring and there's going to be a lot of questions on the md11 future. right? while they're gainfully employed now, when they come up for heavy checks, which is a very expensive investment, i think there's going to need to be a lot of thought. so some of that -- the older equipment will retire out.
and then the question will be how much of the international passenger belly capacity will come back? nobody knows for sure. but i think the general consensus is given all the passenger aircraft retirements that it will be less than what was pre-pandemic for a while. and reasonable minds can differ whether that's 80% or 70% of pre-pandemic levels. nobody knows for sure. and then the last factor in that equation is ok how many aircraft are going to be converted? the 777 conversions are a couple of years out. the a330 conversions and for the large widebody those are the real factors that would play into that which again speaks that it will be more heavily weighted toward main deck freighters versus belly. so i don't have an exact percentage i don't know that but i just would say it's more than 50% will be main deck for the foreseeable future.
frank galanti -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
okay. that's really helpful. and i guess as my follow-up just trying to get a sense of what normal supply growth looks like. from what i understand it's about 600 widebody planes flying today, after obviously 2020 brought a bunch of them back from being parked. but in your prepared remarks you said that deliveries for dedicated freighters were lower than usual. can you kind of talk through what's happened with deliveries in the last couple of years relative to more normalized times? and then kind of what the outlook is from your guys' perspective on the years going out? and i guess, secondarily, how many freighters are retired each year in a more normalized world?
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
yeah, there's really no fixed number of how many retirements in a normalized world. i don't know what a normalized world is anymore to be honest and i think it comes down to what are the market conditions at the time some of these aircraft come up for retirement or parking decision? and there's a lot of fluidity to that. and it's really -- it's more market-driven than asset-driven. generally speaking, if you're willing to invest in the heavy maintenance, you can prolong the life of those assets. with regard to the production, i'll just comment on what i said before, you've got one line that's retiring entirely and that's the 747. the 777s are predominantly my understanding will be freighters. and i don't want to speak for boeing, but i think that production rate is something like one or two a month, two on the high end a month of 777s. the 767s might be a little higher than that. so there will be capacity coming into the market. but again, i go back to, to what extent will that be replacement capacity or truly incremental? and i think that's an open question, which will be market-driven on how much carriers are willing to invest into heavy maintenance. spencer, i don't know if you have any more detailed numbers you want to put behind that answer?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
the only thing i can really add is in the long-haul wide-body space where we primarily operate. we have the last four 747-8s. there won't be any more after that. with regard to the 777s, i think there are something like 38 announced aircraft going to announced customers from boeing and most of those are integrators.
so it's dhl and fedex are getting most of those. there are also some asian and europe and middle eastern airlines as well. but there's just not that much capacity coming into the space. so that's a really important consideration, frank.
frank galanti -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
appreciate it. thank you very much.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i'll just add typically, demand grows and as john said, there's no such thing as typical anymore. historically, the demand in air freight grows 3% to 4% per year. and so, if you take 3% to 4% times the number of aircraft that are out there that means the number of incremental aircraft need to be added every year. plus you have the older aircraft that are retiring, as john talked about and so, it's just further need for more aircraft. but there really aren't that many orders out there.
frank galanti -- stifel nicolaus -- analyst
got it. appreciate it. thank you.
operator
thank you. and i have a follow-up with chris stathoulopoulos with susquehanna. your line is open.
christopher nicholas -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
thanks for taking my follow-up. so, spencer, i'm going to ask, even though you answer this just about every quarter now or at least certainly since last year. but i think it's important to ask, because i get a lot of questions around how payload sensitive atlas is today. and that certainly changed versus where you were in 2019, 2018.
but what percent of your block hours are currently on spot? i believe that number is 5. and do you anticipate that mix -- that to remain at 5 through the next stages of the recovery? and it sounds like john feels, based on your comments, that this is going to play out perhaps longer than some do, sounds like at least through 2023.
but that 5%, is that the sort of new level of spot sensitivity for lack of a better word we should think about with respect to block hours, and of course contribution dollars? thanks.
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. thank you chris. so overall i'll give the rundown. our block hours in traditional acmi are somewhere between 60% and 65% of all the flying that we do. these long-term charters are somewhere around 20%. flying that we do for the military is now somewhere around 6%. flying we do in south america is about 5% and that leaves, sort of, ad hoc space at somewhere around 5% to 6%. so hopefully that is true.
the other part of your question was do we expect this to continue? yeah, i think we do chris. this is becoming perhaps the new normal. at least for the foreseeable future our expectations are at these levels. they change a little bit. as john said, military came down a little bit, which allowed us to operate more in the long-term charter space, so these percentages change slightly, but you can tell if you look back they're fairly consistent.
christopher nicholas -- susquehanna financial -- analyst
okay. if i could squeeze one last in here. there was an article out there in the press over the last two weeks or so about amazon, looking around for some 777s and i think for some airbus freighters. on the 777 side, is that something and this is for outbound flights from china, is that something that you would be able to fly without knowing anything else about how that would work point-to-point hub and spoke? but in terms of if it is an outbound flight from china; could you even participate in something like that? thank you.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
so, i'll comment on that and i'll start by saying, we don't speak and can't speak for amazon. what i can say is and this ties in with my prepared remarks that we have global operating capabilities in the asset types we're talking about here. so we'd, obviously, have to look at what the route rights would be involved and whether we could get the right traffic rights, but we are a global player in the 747 and the 777.
operator

i'd like to thank the entire atlas team for their ongoing efforts in delivering these results in this very challenging pandemic operating environment. it's because of their efforts that we've been able to deliver these outstanding results.
as you've seen from our results, we've optimized and leveraged our business to capitalize under current favorable market conditions. we've also positioned the company very well for the future. we have the best assets to serve the air freight market, including an industry leading fleet of 747s, 777s, 767s, and 737 aircraft.
we have a top tier portfolio of customers. we also have unrivalled global operating capabilities, and a team that's simply best in the business. putting us all together, we're very well-positioned to serve the growing needs of our customers and the air freight market today and in the future.
at atlas, safety is a core value and is always a top priority. with that as our focus, we continue to take extensive precautions to protect our employees and our operations to support our customers and safely transport essential goods around the world.
our people no doubt are our greatest asset and we'll continue to focus on their safety and well-being. in that regard, we were very pleased to reach agreement with our largest employer group, our pilots for a new five-year joint collective bargaining agreement, or what we often refer to as a jcba.
under this long-term industry competitive agreement, all of our pilots will receive significantly higher pay, quality of life improvements and enhanced benefits. the new pay rates became effective as of september 1 and we're working together with the union's new leadership to implement other provisions of the agreement as soon as possible. this new jcba provides even more reasons and opportunities for our pilots to grow their careers here at atlas.
we've been preparing for this important investment in our pilots for some time, and we've incorporated our expectations for these new terms when negotiating new customer contracts or when amending existing contracts. we look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with our pilots and our new union leadership to build an even stronger company in the future.
importantly, the new jcba paves the way for us to complete our atlas airs merger with southern air, which we expect to occur during the fourth quarter. the southern air brand has served us well since we acquired it in 2016.
through southern, we diversified our service offerings by gaining immediate entry into the 777 and 737 platforms, ultimately enabling us to perform 777 flying for dhl express and cainiao, the logistics arm of alibaba, as well as 737 operations for amazon. we look forward to continuing to leverage these capabilities as growth engines for atlas in the years ahead.
as we serve the needs of our customers and their businesses in the third quarter, we are also extremely proud to have supported the us government's historic evacuation of us personnel and refugees from afghanistan.
as part of the call up of the civil reserve air fleet, we deployed our formidable fleet of passenger aircraft to help the evacuation. as the largest provider of airlift to the us military, our flight and ground personnel volunteered and stepped up with great compassion to support the significant humanitarian mission. in total, we operated over 30 missions transporting about 10,000 us personnel as well as afghan refugees and their families from various locations into the united states.
in addition to this important military business and as you saw in our earnings release this morning, our strategic focus continues to be on express e-commerce and fast-growing global markets, particularly asia and south america. these markets are driving robust demand for our services and producing excellent financial results.
we've safely increased the utilization of our aircraft despite an extremely challenging pandemic operating environment. we've also extended or entered into important new long-term agreements. in that regard, we recently announced long-term contract extensions for 20 aircraft with dhl express. we also entered into a new long-term acmi agreement with fedex among other long-term agreements.
collectively, this demonstrates our ability to capitalize on current market opportunities while deepening long-standing relationships with our strategic customers for the future. with that in mind, we continually manage our fleet to balance capacity with demand.
we're looking forward to taking delivery of four new 747-8 freighters in 2022. these are the last 747s that boeing will ever produce and we're delighted they'll be coming to atlas. they provide unmatched payload capacity, nose loading capability as well as improved fuel efficiency and noise emissions. we expect to take delivery of these -8s between may and october of next year.
as reported in our press release today, in october, we acquired three more of our existing 747-400 freighters that were previously on lease to us. this is in addition to the 3, 747-400 we recently acquired and discussed during our last earnings call. as a reminder, we previously announced that we will be purchasing 5 of our other existing
747-400 freighters at the end of their lease terms in 2022 bringing the total number of acquired 747-400 to 11. acquiring these new excuse me, -8 and 11 of our existing 747-400 underscores our confidence in the ongoing demand for wide-body freighters and will provide strong returns for atlas in the years ahead.
now turning to our outstanding third quarter results on slide four. as i mentioned, our revenue and adjusted earnings grew to new records. this included our quarterly revenue exceeding $1 billion for the first time in our company's history. our third quarter results reflected higher yield and increased aircraft utilization. they also reflected the impact of numerous new and extended long term customer contracts,
the operation of 1, 747 freighter that we reactivated during the fourth quarter of 2020, the ongoing reduction of available cargo capacity in the market and the continued disruption of global supply chains due to the pandemic.
our third quarter performance also benefited from passenger charter flying for the us military related to the afghanistan evacuation efforts and lower heavy maintenance expense. partially offsetting these benefits were higher pilot cost driven by our new jcba.
now moving on to slide five. we're certainly operating in a very strong air freight market. we expect industry conditions and demand for our services to remain favorable for the foreseeable future. global air freight volumes continue to exceed pre-pandemic levels, while industry capacity, particularly on long-haul international routes has not kept pace with demand. this includes fewer new freighter aircraft coming into the market, as well as the substantial amount of international passenger belly capacity that has not yet returned.
supply chain bottlenecks including the widely reported challenges that ocean ports worldwide are driving increased modal shift to air as manufacturers, retailers and shippers strive to replenish very low inventory levels, especially ahead of the holiday shopping season. in addition, the current environment has led to a structural acceleration of express growth and e-commerce across the globe, which will drive both current and longer term airfreight demand.
while the pandemic continues to make the operating environment a very challenging one, the market dynamics we're seeing in the fourth quarter remain very robust. as a result, we expect record revenue and record adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter, including revenue of nearly $1.1 billion and adjusted ebitda of approximately 325 million from flying more than 9,000 block hours.
we also expect adjusted net income to grow in excess of 20% compared with our prior fourth quarter adjusted net income record of $143.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. our fourth quarter 2021 outlook includes the impact of our new jcba, as well as the proactive initiatives to help mitigate the higher costs in the new agreement including increased contribution from our long term customer agreements.
it also reflect continued high levels of aircraft utilization, driven by strong demand and solid peak season volumes and yields. we also expect ongoing expenses driven by the pandemic including additional pay for employees flying into certain locations that have been significantly impacted by covid-19 as well as costs for continuing to provide a safe working environment for all employees and maintenance expense of approximately $90 million.
for the full year we expect aircraft maintenance expense to be around $450 million and depreciation and amortization to total about $280 million. core capital expenditures which exclude aircraft and engine purchases are projected to total approximately $90 million to $100 million mainly for parts and components for our fleet.
this is a good point for spencer to provide more details on our third quarter results. and after spencer's remarks i'll have some additional comments and then we'll be happy to take your questions. spencer?
spencer schwartz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you john and hello everyone. our excellent third quarter results are highlighted on slide six. on an adjusted basis, ebitda totaled $280.5 million with adjusted net income totaling $145.4 million. on a reported basis, net income totaled $119.5 million. our adjusted earnings included an effective income tax rate of 22.3%.
moving to the top of slide seven revenues rose to $1.02 billion in the quarter. as john mentioned this was the first time atlas generated over $1 billion in revenue during the quarter.
higher airline operations segment revenue was primarily driven by an increase in the average rate per block hour which was mainly due to an increased proportion of higher-yielding flying including the impact of new and extended long-term contracts the ongoing reduction of available cargo capacity in the market, the disruption of global supply chains as well as higher fuel costs.
volumes during the period were relatively unchanged as we reduced less profitable smaller gauge cmi flying, while increasing utilization of our current fleet to meet strong customer demand.
as john shared, volumes also benefited from the operation of one 747-400 freighter that we reactivated during the fourth quarter of 2020 as well as increased passenger charter flying for the u.s. military related to the support that we provided for the afghanistan evacuation efforts. revenue in dry leasing was relatively unchanged.
looking now at the bottom of the slide segment contribution totaled $275.7 million in the third quarter. significantly higher airline operations contribution was primarily driven by the positive factors benefiting segment revenue i just noted as well as lower heavy maintenance expense. these improvements were partially offset by higher pilot costs related to our new joint collective bargaining agreement. in dry leasing higher segment contribution was primarily due to lower interest expense related to the scheduled repayment of debt.
before we move to the next slide and given the recent increase in prices i'd like to take a moment to remind you that atlas has a very limited direct exposure to fuel. for our longer-term commercial charter contracts fuel risk is largely mitigated by price adjustments including those based on index fuel prices.
for our shorter-term commercial charters our exposure to fluctuations in fuel price is limited as those contracts typically reflect prevailing market fuel prices. we don't incur fuel expense for our acmi and cmi services or in our dry leasing business as the cost of fuel is our customers' responsibility. in addition, we don't have fuel risk for us military flying as the us military pays us for fuel, so it's in our revenue and offset in expenses.
now turning to slide eight. our net leverage ratio improved another two ticks, finishing the quarter at a record low of 1.8 times. we ended the third quarter with cash including cash equivalents and restricted cash, totaling $784.1 million. our cash position at september, 30th reflected cash used for investing and financing activities, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities. net cash used for investing activities during the first nine months of 2021 was primarily for payments for flight equipment and modifications, especially including the pre-delivery payments for the four 747-8s, core capital expenditures, as well as spare engines, engine overhauls and upgrade kits.
net cash used from financing activities, primarily reflected debt payments, partially offset by proceeds from debt issuance. we continue to apply a disciplined approach to financing. as we've indicated before this has resulted in a very low weighted average coupon interest rate, which now stands at 2.94%. and the majority is secured by our aircraft assets, which have a value in excess of the related debt.
we remain committed to a strong balance sheet and cash balance, which allows us to opportunistically deploy capital to strengthen our business as well as to navigate unexpected events.
now i'd like to turn it back to john.
john w. dietrich -- president chief executive officer and director
great. thank you spencer. and moving to slide nine. we have great momentum. we've delivered an excellent third quarter and we expect the favorable market conditions to continue. our team is executing on our strategy, proving again that atlas can capitalize on opportunities in any environment. we're pleased to have reached a new joint collective bargaining agreement with our pilots and we're excited for the opportunities this agreement provides to them.
we have the highest quality assets a strong, balance sheet and unrivaled network of customers and unmatched global operating capabilities. and we'll continue to take every precaution to protect our world-class team of employees. to sum it all up again, we're very well-positioned to serve the growing needs of our customers and the airfreight market today and in the future.
and at this point, operator, i'd like to turn it over to you to take our first question please.
",2021-Q3,AAWW
,,,,":
operator
certainly. your first question comes from the line of bob labick with cjs securities. please go ahead.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
good morning, and congratulations on a nice year and nice outlook. i wanted to start with -- spencer, i think, you did touch on this a little bit. but i want to dig in a little bit deeper on the direct contribution from acmi. i think going into the quarter, we'd expected a little bit more growth.
and i know you talked about heavy maintenance being a little higher, i guess, due to allocation and crew cost. but if you could elaborate on the, i guess, flatness in direct contrition there? and then talk about next year within your guidance, not specifically, but do you expect acmi direct contribution to grow?
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
sure, bob. so looking at acmi direct contribution, it's really driven by a couple of things. one is that we had higher -- heavy maintenance cost. we had incremental engine overhauls during the fourth quarter that were driven by operational requirements.
and then, we have an allocation methodology. so for engines, when there are engine overhauls, our methodology is to expense those overhauls as they are put into shop for the overhaul. and then we have to allocate the maintenance expense between our segments, acmi and charter. so for engines, they're generally pretty fungible and they move between aircraft to aircraft.
so our location methodology that we've used consistently is we base it on the number of block hours during the period when the maintenance occurred. so it's unusual for us to have so many engine overhauls during december. but we did this year to help us prepare for peak and also for 2019 flying. so as a result, december, we always have the most acmi hours versus charter hours.
and so a lot of that engine overhaul, heavy maintenance, more of that gets allocated to acmi as opposed to charter. so that happened during the quarter as well. and then we also had the crew increased. as we talked about, we enhanced the southern pilot's wages and work rules with the interim agreement.
and then, bob, i think you asked whether for 2019, yes. we think that in 2019 with all the things, i think, that we've talked. in 2019, we expect our overall segment profitability in acmi to grow. in fact, grow significantly.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
ok, super. and then just.
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
long answer.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
no, no it's great. it's very helpful. i appreciate it. i guess for my follow up just, could you give us a sense of the growth in the fleet or for the ballpark that's within your guidance as well? i know there's a three new cmi coming on? are you contemplating in your guidance any additional fleet at this point?
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
there is some growth that's built into our plan, but we're not providing details on that at this point, bob. most of the growth from 2018 to 2019 in our plan is from the aircraft that we've added throughout 2018 and the benefits that we'll get from that. and it will also be the first year of the accretion from the full 20 767s operating for amazon this year. and there's a little bit more in there, but nothing too expensive.
bob labick -- cjs securities -- analyst
great. ok. thanks so much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of jack atkins with stephens. please go ahead.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning, and congratulations on a great quarter.
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, again.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
so bill, i guess this is a question for both you and spencer. but if i could just start maybe with just a high-level question for you and then would love to get spencer sort of take on how it impacts the 2019 guidance, or what's assumed in the 2019 guidance. but obviously, there's just a ton of potential outcomes on the macro front whether it's europe, or we're talking brexit or just the economic outlook there, or china to u.s. trade.
i would be curious to get your sense for, how all of those are playing together? and what's happening in the minds of your customers right now as they're planning for their business for 2019? and then spencer, just as we sort of think about that all together. what is the guidance assumed for those items in terms of sort of how do we bracket what's good, what's bad for your guidance if we were to see a potential hard brexit, for example, or no china to u.s. trade deal. just trying to think about the potential outcomes and how it impacts 2019 for you guys.
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
yes. thank you, jack. i think that's a very good question and there are several elements to it. so first of all, we step back maybe a little bit.
one of the questions we're often getting is well with the discussions and kind of the push and shove going back and forth between china and the u.s., what have you seen so far? and the answer is, from the tariffs that have been imposed and announced, we haven't seen a large impact yet. now that doesn't mean there wasn't any impact or that there may not be should the u.s. and china failed to reach some agreement even with the talks that are going on now that there wouldn't be. but we haven't seen it yet.
and when i think about our customers, we're not seeing made an impact in the schedules that they're giving us to fly both near term and as we think about the schedules and deployment into 2019. so it doesn't mean that there won't be. but we can't point to significant impact at this point. there is that cloud of uncertainty that kind of sits on top of these kinds of considerations, we just haven't seen that.
we haven't seen that yet. thinking more broadly, what does brexit mean? well, near term and, specifically for us, we, actually, don't have very large operations in the u.k. at present. we haven't had large u.k.
operations for quite some time now since va got out of freighters years ago. we do have substantial operations in the continent. so to the extent that flows change or we see more flows coming in and out of europe, that's potential an upside for us or and/or an upside for our customers overall. and the other point that i do want to make, jack, and we've said this a number of times.
the way to think about atlas in many ways is to think about our customers, because the vast majority of our customers are publicly traded companies. so another way to kind of triangulate on impact, maybe what are the customers, our customers are saying about themselves and their growth plan, given our large position we have with dhl, the 20 aircraft that we're operating for amazon, the overall strength of the charter market, the customers that we've added and the fleet growth we've had. so we've incorporated that into our guidance, and spencer will, perhaps, add framework. spencer has a few more comments to add.
so as we sit here today, we've tried to incorporate the uncertainty that exists out there coupled with what our customers are telling us about their business plans and the schedule they want us to fly for them.
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
and jack, it's spencer. i don't have a whole lot to add to that. but when we put together our plan for the year, we work closely, as bill said, with all of our customers. and so our plan reflects their plans and their expectations for the year and the flying that we expect to do with them.
so all of that is built in. the other thing that we talked about, i think during our last earnings call, is that we just don't see there being that big of an impact for airfreight overall from the tariffs. and the beauty of our business is that we operate airplanes and they can move anywhere we want at any given time. and so if manufacturing, for example, were to move out of china to somewhere else, we can operate it from there.
and so just by the nature of our business we expect our business to continue strong.
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
yes. and i would just add, in our military segment, we talked about it in my remarks we are expecting higher levels of activity in military in '19 over '18 as well.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and i guess for my follow-up, spencer, the change in lease accounting standards, which i think took effect on january 1st, how will that impact the balance sheet for you guys, if at all? and should we expect to see some moving pieces, perhaps on the income statement in 2019 with rental expense perhaps moving net interest expense, trying to think, how that's going to flow through your income statement this year?
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks, jack. so the new lease accounting standard will be adopted as of january 1st. so you'll seen in the first-quarter results.
as a dry lessor, the new guidance really doesn't expect our dry leasing revenue as it's consistent with the current guidance. as a lessee, it requires the recognition of a right-of-use asset and then offsetting right-of-use liability. the good news is that we don't expect any impact to our income statement. so for the balance sheet, you will see a right-of-use asset and then a right-of-use liability.
the liability will be about $650 million. and that is really consistent, if you look at how we calculate our net leverage ratio, you can see that we always include the present value of leases, and that has been somewhere around $600 million, $650 million. so this is very consistent with what we've been using previously and now it'll just be on the balance sheet with an offsetting asset and liability.
jack atkins -- stephens -- analyst
ok. that's great. thank you for the color, guys.
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, jack.
operator
your next question comes from the line of helane becker with cowen and company. please go ahead.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
thanks, operator. thank you for the time guys. so my two major questions on china and brexit you answered. the other question i had, i think, spencer or bill you referred to you know your numbers including some amount of growth this year.
so i have two questions related to that, if you don't mind. the first question is when you think of growth, how are you thinking about that? are you thinking about additional new customers? or are you thinking about increased flying for current customers? and i know you don't like to speak about the amazon contract specifically, but i'm just wondering if there are opportunities to add aircraft for them since a much like your competitor did recently? and then the other question i have is with respect to -- completely unrelated with respect to military flying. i know you don't break that out anymore, but i'm just kind of wondering with all the changes that we see happening, how should we think about that going forward if we need to think about that at all? so kind of a lot there, but you can pick and choose.
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
ok. well, thanks, helane. well, a couple of things. i think, just kind of in marketing 101, it's considered to be somewhat easier to get more business from current customers than to bring on new customers.
but i think we're in a position where we're going to see growth across all of our customers. i think we have growth opportunities and we're always discussing growth opportunities with all of our current customers. you saw that in 2018 and at the end of 2017, we brought new customers in. we've had good growth with those customers as well.
we took on additional assets other than six sevens to serve those customers in 2018. and michael steen, our chief commercial officer and his team are in ongoing discussion with a broad array of customers for growth. as we both noted, this is our full year of operating the 20 aircraft for amazon that we put into service over the last two years and so we look forward to those operations. and beyond that we're not going really comment on any one specific customer other than to say we see good growth potential for the company overall.
in terms of the military, i think, we have said it's about half of our commercial charter operations in terms of hours, the combination of passenger and cargo. i've also said earlier that we expect '19 to be at higher levels than '18. and some of that is levels of activity. but there's another point to make as well.
the military has a large fleet of c-17s and a smaller fleet of c-5s. but not a lot of new, at least, announced plans for additional new mobility aircraft. and so what we've seen in growth over the last several years is, certainly volume. but in addition, the military has elected to put more flying into the commercial operators for a time or some time, because in their program view, they've overflown their c-17 fleet for about a 10-year period and are looking to, if not rest, to minimize utilization of that fleet to extend the program life of the asset and use a higher-rated commercial aircraft to accomplish that.
so that's another important factor that's driving growth in our military flying.
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
and helane, i'll just add that our military entitlement remained fairly steady around 53%, 54%. and that we continue to see higher cargo demand and modest increases in rates. and during the fourth quarter, we flew around 87% one-way missions and almost all of those eastbound. so really continued great flying for the military.
helane becker -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of david ross with stifel. please go ahead.
david ross -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you. good morning, gentlemen. how are you doing? when we look back on 2018, certainly there was a cost associated with putting all of those planes up for amazon. could you quantify, i guess, how much of a headwind, the ramp-up cost, start-up cost, training cost, however you want to describe it, was in 2018? because presumably, i guess, that disappears this year?
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
correct. it disappears. we had start-up costs in '16, '17 and '18. all throughout those periods, we had to bring on pilots.
before they started flying, we had to train those pilots. we had to bring in trainers. and so there are start-up costs related to all of that, but we haven't quantified that. but we did had to start those costs in advance of the actual flying taking place.
the majority of it really took place in 2016 and '17. and then of course, as we added more planes, earnings overtook the start-up cost, but they did continue throughout the period. and then '19 will be the first full year that doesn't have those start-up costs related to the 767-300s.
david ross -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
so if i'm hearing you correctly, there were fewer start-up costs in '18 then they were in '16 and '17?
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
correct. yes. plus higher earnings as well.
david ross -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
oh, of course. i was just trying to separate out the two. and then, bill, some of the other airfreight-related companies, you've been talking about europe, specifically in terms of a macro weakness. i don't know how much charter business you do over there if that's more acmi flying for dhl or other customers.
but to the extent you have any comments on where you see growth or softness in global activity? is europe softer than asia pacific, u.s., south america, any commentary there will be helpful?
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
yes. i think the majority of our operations in and out of europe are both acmi, cmi and military, because of the flights we operate in and out of germany, either as a destination or as a intermediate point between germany and operations into set common, that's a large part of our flying overall. we certainly have some charter operations in and out of europe, but i wouldn't say it's the majority of our commercial charter operations. and as we've talked about and commented several times now, our focus is really on those faster growing markets in asia as both origin and destination and certainly, south america.
coming out of lunar new year, which is where we are now, it does seem a little bit slower in terms of the recovery coming out of new year, our lunar new year on volumes into europe out of asia more broadly than it is on the transpac. so obviously, something we need to watch and understand what brexit means. it's kind of hard for all of us to predict what that means. as i mentioned earlier, we don't have a big position in u.k.
flows either way. so we're somewhat insulated from that impact. not sure what it means for the rest of the europe.
david ross -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you for the color.
operator
your next question comes from the line of seldon clarke with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
operator, we've got to go to the next one.
operator
yes. your next question comes from the line of kevin sterling with seaport global securities. please go ahead.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning, gentlemen. so bill and spencer, you guys have talked about 2019 and growth with existing customers and new customers. how does the feedstock situation looks? so if i'm a new or even existing customer and i come to you and say, hey i need 10 to 15 planes, are you constrained by the feedstock availability or do you think you can get aircraft to convert to freighters?
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
well, a couple of things. you've seen our ability to acquire aircraft and convert where we needed to do that. we've also been able to go into the market and lease-in aircraft to take advantage of opportunities as well. there was aircraft available in the market, it depends on the type.
and also a good part of our growth has been cmi where customers have provided the aircraft for one or another reasons and have elected us, selected us to operationalize and fly the aircraft for them. so i think there are several, depending on the customer, the aircraft type, i think, there are several avenues of growth for us in '19 and beyond, kevin.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok. my second question revolves around labor cost. how should we think about this cost turning into 2019? and how we should think about maybe a new labor agreement with your pilots? i know you talked about the higher cost you had in q4 with southern pilots, but how should we think about 2019 and then new labor agreement with your existing pilots?
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
so overall, kevin, our goal is to get to a new joint collective bargaining agreement with our pilots, an agreement that works for really for our pilots, works for us as a company and certainly works for our investors. and we continue in discussions with our pilots, with their union representatives now. i mean, obviously, it's key for us as a company to be able to attract and retrain -- retain excuse me, and grow our pilots. and the good growth that we've had over these last several years, we've been able to do that to bring pilots on board, but also because of the diversification and the growth, provide meaningful opportunities for people to join as a first officer and then in a relatively short period of time, move over to the left seat and become a captain.
as i said, we're in discussions now. it really takes two parties to get to a new agreement, we're in that process. but we're not providing perspective on what those increases in cost may look like and that we'd be negotiating in public if we did. but we continue in those discussions and look forward to get into that agreement.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
i gotcha. but we can assume or assume that higher labor cost are somewhat -- at least some cost are baked into your 2019 guidance, is that a fair assumption?
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
what's in the 2019 guidance, kevin, is we entered into the interim agreement with our southern pilots in september. and so there was an impact in september and then in the fourth quarter. well, that impact is there throughout all of 2019. so you'll see that throughout 2019.
that part is baked in. otherwise, just sort of standard increases.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok. well, that's all i had. thanks for your time. congrats on a great quarter and 2018.
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and your next question comes from the line of seldon clarke with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
hey, guys. thanks for the question. wanted to ask about free cash flow for next year. just given what you've commented to right now in terms of aircraft purchase, do you expect free cash flow to be positive in 2019? and just, could you give us a sense of maybe what you're targeting for net leverage ratio along the time?
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
sure. seldon, it's spencer. so our free cash flow for 2018 versus '17 grew 29%. so phenomenal jump.
based on our earnings, in 2019 we expected to continue to improve as we'll have all of the amazon aircraft operating and continuing to grow the business and enjoy the rest of the 18 aircraft that we added for the full year. so yes, we expect free cash flows to continue to grow. and then, with regard to the net leverage ratio, we expect both as we pay down debt, as well as grow our ebitdar. we've expect that leverage ratio to continue to decline getting to somewhere around the mid-three level.
so we were at about 4.9 or five times, not to long ago and expect to be at mid-threes by the end of this year, a really important initiative for us.
kevin sterling -- seaport global securities -- analyst
ok. and just to clarify on that in terms of free cash flow, i'm talking about like net of additional aircraft purchases. so whatever you've committed to in terms of like the nippon aircraft for this year not the kind of adjusted free cash flow number that you guys provide?
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
well, the nippon cargo aircraft that's a cmi basis, and so those are not our aircraft. as far as aircraft capital expenditures, we really don't have sort of committed expenditures at this point. we do, however, have core capital expenditures and we've provided that number earlier. we expect that to be about $135 million to $145 million for 2019.
and that really reflects the requirements for parts inventory for the 747-400s that were leased in 2018, the incremental amazon 767's and then just general fleet requirements for the 747-400s and 747-8.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then just, i'm asking in a little bit different way in terms of your guidance for block hour growth, could you give us the sense of how that breaks down from an organic perspective versus what you're getting from some of the new aircraft you're adding?
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
block hour growth is generally driven by the incremental aircraft that we added throughout 2018. the military flying is growing. we also, as we talked about, we took two aircraft that were operating in acmi for a cmi customer. we bought those aircraft.
we moved them into charter and they fly for the nfl. so the utilization in the block hours were actually down just given the nature of the nfl flying, but continued sort of similar earnings on those aircraft. so overall, and looking at block hours, it really is the aircraft, we added 16 aircraft throughout 2018, all throughout the year, and so we'll enjoy the block hours from all the flying. otherwise, utilization generally, pretty consistent 2019 versus '18 other than the military, which is going to increase, as bill talked about.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
ok, appreciate it. and then just last one kind of a longer term. so that maintenance expense come down a little bit on like per block hour basis after 2019, just given something like the timing of your aircraft purchases and things like that?
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
well, line maintenance expense is the vast majority, it's about two-thirds of our overall maintenance expense. and that varies based on block hours, it's basically a variable cost. and the line maintenance on a per block hour basis generally grows similar to inflation. it grows couple of percent, 2%, 3% per year.
so you should expect to continue to see that for line maintenance. and then heavy maintenance really depends on when engines need to be overhauled and when calendar letter checks are due on the airframes. we did have a number of engine overhauls in december and as a result of that we're forecasting that we have three fewer cf6-80 engines, those are the engines that we operate in our 747-400s and 767s where we will have three fewer of those in 2019 versus 2018 as a result of some of the overhauls that happened during the fourth quarter.
seldon clarke -- deutsche bank -- analyst
well, that's helpful.
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
appreciate the questions.
operator
[operator instructions] and your next question comes from the line of chris stathoulopoulos with susquehanna international.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international -- analyst
i've got two questions here. so looking at the competitive landscape there's been a few notable events in the recent months, competitor atsg expanded their agreement with amazon. kkr made a billion-dollar investment with lessor altavair, i think part of which is going to be used to buy six wide-body, cargo jets and last week, 3pl, operator xpo suggested a key customer likely amazon, walked away from a piece of their business. so i was wondering if you could give us kind of a broad strokes, your thoughts on, perhaps, amazon, the potential to expand that business or what you're seeing with regards to increased competitions from lessors altavair or someone who's been more of a traditional competitor, atsg or colder air?
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
yes. let me take that. this is bill, i'll answer the first one. so the kkr -- let me talk about the leasing side of it first.
so kkr investment and with altavair, looks like to me that the altavair team found an additional source of capital investment to grow their fleet. altavair is a longtime player in aircraft leasing. they were guggenheim at onetime, despite the same leadership team over there. and they've been a longtime participant and freighter.
so i don't see that as a new introduction. i think what it points to is that there is a -- airfreight is anticipated to grow. assets will be required to support that growth and kkr, i guess, all the opportunity to work with team at altavair and participate in that overall. we're not going to comment on amazon specifically.
and we don't specifically comment on any one customer or for that matter on competitors, generally. i think, just a couple of thoughts, chris, that we've added 45 aircraft in three years. we've averaged about one aircraft every three weeks. we've added a great book of customers, certainly amazon is an important customer and we're now finally at the full 20.
but we've added other customers that we've talked about, creative ones like npa where it's all cmi. to the earlier question we're not putting our balance sheet at work to fly those aircraft. we added sf express, they are the largest express operator in china today. with their own fleet domestically of north of 40 aircraft and our operation for them is their first international operation over several continents.
so when i look at our position, we've got a great book of customers and diversity among those customers. overall, there's some background there and i think our growth opportunities with current customer, an earlier question that we had, and potentially new customers is, we're really well situated to be able to do that.
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
and chris, this is spencer. i will just add briefly that altavair, in particularly, is a key business partner of ours. we have a nice relationship with the company and their management team.
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
we've leased an aircraft for them.
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
that's right. and they are a good source of aircraft for us.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international -- analyst
and then my follow up question. i think with regards to the block hours it works out to imply growth for around 15% and then depending on the utilization levels that we've plug in there we can kind of back into a fleet total. but how should we be thinking about headcount growth for 2019 if we assume a similar sort of trend of around 19 or 20 heads per aircraft? is 10% sort of like the right number to think about headcount for this year?
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
with regard to crew, yes, it really just depends on the aircraft, the aircraft type, the operations for the aircraft. so that's with regard to crew. with regard to ground staff, it depends on how many stations we'll be opening. and then we also have ground staff that are supporting our overall fleet initiatives and fleet growth and so we'll be adding there as well.
chris stathoulopoulos -- susquehanna international -- analyst
ok. thanks, bill.
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, chris.

bill flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, ed, and good morning, everyone. we're very pleased to have you join us. 2018 was another great year for atlas. we drove substantial growth in the scale, diversity and profitability of our business.
as noted in our press release, we generated record volumes, revenue and earnings both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. and we expect to generate record volume, revenue and earnings in 2019. we're excited about our future and the future of airfreight. our strategic initiatives have expanded our capabilities and enabled us to serve a greater range of customers.
they also provide solid platform for future growth initiatives. our focus is is on express and e-commerce and fast-growing markets in asia and elsewhere, such as, south america, where we have the strongest year in the company's history. as airfreight continues to grow further globalization will require time-definite air networks to facilitate the flow of goods. we're well-positioned to capitalize on the scale and scope of our domestic and worldwide operations, drive higher volumes, revenue, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income and further reduce our net leverage ratio.
we expect to benefit from a full year of flying by the aircraft we added in 2018 for customers, such as, asiana, dhl express, inditex and sf express. we will see our first full year of flying 20 767-300s for amazon. we look forward to continuing to -- we look forward to operating three incremental 747-400 freighters for nippon cargo airlines, which will increase our near-term fleet to 115 aircraft. and we anticipate that the flying we do for the military will be higher than in 2018.
these opportunities build on the growth in our business mix, customer base, fleet and operational capabilities. in addition to delivering record results in 2018, we added 16 aircraft to our operating fleet in response to customer demand and grew to more than 100 planes. we ended the year at a 112 aircraft across five fleet types. these aircraft are well suited to are growing domestic and regional flying, as well as our international operations.
we also ramped up for amazon as scheduled, which included successfully managing multiple station openings throughout the united states. we enhanced our balance sheet by lowering our net leverage ratio, and thanks to our strong and experienced team who executed extremely well during the peak season. moving to slide 4, our fourth-quarter adjusted earnings reflected a 17% increase in block hours and 22% increase in revenue. they also included a 21% increase in adjusted ebitda and 31% increase in adjusted net income.
we began flying for sf express, china's leading express operator, during the quarter, and we ramped up to 20 aircraft for amazon. slide 5 highlights our framework for 2019. it reflects our outlook for another year of volume and earnings growth. for the full year, we expect volume to rise to around 340,000 block hours, revenue to grow to approximately $3 billion.
adjusted ebitda to increase to about $600 million and adjusted net income to grow by a mid- to upper-single-digit percentage. similar to historical patterns, we anticipate that over three quarters of our adjusted net income in 2019 will occur in the second half of the year. maintenance expense in 2019 is expected to total approximately $420 million. the increase from 2018 mainly reflects an increase in daily line maintenance driven by the growth of our fleet and the anticipated growth in over block hours this year.
similar to 2018, we expect line maintenance to comprise about two-thirds of our total maintenance expense in 2019. our outlook also anticipates depreciation and amortization of about $260 million and core capital expenditures, which exclude aircraft and engine purchases, between $135 million to $145 million, mainly for parts and components for our fleet. looking to the first quarter, we expect volumes to total about 75,000 block hours, revenue of approximately $680 million, adjusted ebitda of approximately $110 million and adjusted net income similar to the $23.8 million we reported in the first-quarter 2018. our first quarter outlook also reflects anticipated revenue in our titan dry-leasing business from maintenance payments related to the schedule return of a 777 cargo aircraft, which we expect to receive late in the first quarter.
this will be partially offset by a higher level of heavy maintenance expense compared with the first quarter of last year. this is a good point, i'll ask, spencer, to provide some additional detail about our fourth quarter 2018 results. and after spencer's remarks, i'll add a few additional comments and then we'll be happy to take your questions. spencer?
spencer schwartz -- chief financial officer
thank you, bill, and hello everyone. our record fourth-quarter results are highlighted on slide 6. on an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations, net of taxes total $87 million, which was an increase of 31% over the fourth quarter of 2017. as bill noted, our results reflected record block hours, revenue, adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income.
our segments also generated substantially higher total direct contribution. on a reported basis, income from continuing operations, net of taxes totaled $211 million, which included an unrealized gain of $134.8 million on outstanding warrants. our adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter included an effective income tax rate of 20.5%. for the full year, we had an effective tax rate of 15.2%.
with respect to 2019, we expect our full year adjusted income tax rate to be approximately 20%. looking at slide 7. higher acmi segment revenues in the fourth quarter were primarily driven by an increase in volumes, which reflected increased flying for amazon and the start-up of new or incremental flying for several customers, including asiana cargo, dhl and sf express. in charter, higher segment revenues reflected an increase in total volumes and increases in average cargo and passenger rates.
overlapping the end of peak season, we also operated 32 flights during the college football bowl season for 15 universities. in our dry leasing segment, higher revenues were primarily driven by an increase in the number of 767-300 aircraft throughout 2018, as well as the placement of one 777 freighter in february and a second one in july. moving to slide 8. segment contribution totaled $185.1 million in the fourth quarter, a 14% increase over the previous year.
acmi earnings, primarily, reflected increases in 747-400 rates and volumes. these were partially offset by two key items. first, higher heavy maintenance costs, including an increase in the proportion of heavy maintenance costs attributed to the segment due to our volume-based allocation methodology and the higher levels of acmi flying during the december peak flying period. and second, higher crew costs, including enhanced wages and work rules resulting from our interim agreement with our southern air pilots.
the improvement in charter contribution during the period was primarily due to increases in military and commercial cargo yields, excluding fuel. and higher military cargo demand, partially offset by an increase in heavy maintenance. both acmi and charter contribution during the quarter reflected the redeployment of two 747-400 vip passenger craft from acmi to charter, following our acquisition of these aircraft from a former cmi customer. we have used these 747s to grow our vip charter business and our earnings.
in dry leasing, higher segment contribution during the quarter primarily reflected the placement of additional aircraft. turning to slide 9, you can see the multi-year growth for atlas. and as we said, that growth is continuing in 2019. our performance and our outlook reflect the strategic initiatives that we have put in place over many years.
the robust compound annual growth rates we have generated reflect the addition of 45 aircraft to our fleet since the beginning of 2016. they also reflect our move into 777 and 737 operations through southern air, expansions with existing customers, such as dhl express and the u.s. military, and key new customer agreements, such as with amazon, asiana cargo, cathay pacific, nippon cargo and sf express. as a result, we are driving record volumes, record revenue and record earnings.
we are capitalizing on our strong market position and are focused on express, e-commerce and fast-growing global markets. our financial and operating performances also reflect the leadership and strength of our acmi and charter businesses, the growth in annuity-like contribution of our dry leasing operations, ongoing efficiency and productivity initiatives and a well-disciplined balance sheet approach. we have built a solid platform for future growth initiatives. turning to slide 10, we ended the fourth quarter of 2018 with cash, including cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments, totaling $248.4 million.
our cash position at december 31st reflected cash used for investing activities, partially offset by cash provided by operating and financing activities. net cash used for investing activities during 2018, primarily related to payments for the acquisition of 777 and 767 aircraft. 767 conversions to freighter configuration, spare engines and upgrade kits and core capital expenditures. net cash provided by financing activities during the period, primarily reflected proceeds from our attractive financings of 777 and 767 aircraft, partially offset by payments on debt obligations.
we are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet. as the slide shows, we have grown our fleet to take advantage of great opportunities. in doing so, we have applied a disciplined approach to financing. as a result, our debt has a low weighted average interest rate of 3.3%, all of which is at a fixed rate -- almost all of which is at a fixed rate.
in addition, the vast majority is secured by our aircraft assets, which have a value in excess of the related debt. as you can also see, our net leverage ratio, which remained fairly consistent while we increased our fleet significantly, began to move lower in the second half of 2018. we ended the year at 4.2 times, down from 4.8 times, and we expect our net leverage ratio to continue to improve gradually during 2019 as we benefit from flying the aircraft we added to the fleet in 2018, continue to generate strong ebitdar and reflect debt payments of approximately $70 million per quarter. now i'd like to turn it back to bill.
bill flynn -- chief executive officer
thank you, spencer. moving to slide 11, so 2018 was another great year for atlas. we drove substantial growth in the scale, diversity and profitability of our business. we are a leader in global aviation outsourcing, and we're excited about our future and the future of airfreight.
our focus is on express, e-commerce and fast-growing markets. we are capitalizing on the scale and scope of our domestic and worldwide operations. we're building on the growth in our business mix, customer base and operational capabilities. we have the aircraft and provide the services that customers want, and we are grateful to our dedicated team that delivers them.
heidi, may we have the first question, please?
