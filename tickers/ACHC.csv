thank you. [operator instructions] we'll take our first question from brian tanquilut with jefferies.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning. congrats on a very good quarter. i guess, debbie, my first question is just on the recovery of volumes. it sounds like you've seen a good bit of recovery, but we're not quite back to pre-covid levels yet, and there's still some disruption. so is it right to think that the strong growth trends you saw in q3 should carry over into q4 and into 2021? and how are you thinking about just the market share gains and secular growth that the industry is going to see as we go into next year?
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
well, brian, we did have very strong volumes across all of our service lines. and i think my comment about pre-covid really relates more to those patients that travel for our specialty services. but overall, in the acute area, we saw a very robust volume, and it's far exceeding where we were last year, and certainly, pre-covid. we also, i think, throughout this, have maintained very consistent volumes in the rtc business as well as ctc, which is continuing to grow in volume and also has some favorable payer trends, which i mentioned in my remarks. but i think overall, our visibility is we are now almost through october, and we've continued to see improvement in the census in both the u.s. and the u.k., and i think we actually hit the highest census in the history of acadia in october.
so we believe that because of the strong demand trends and really just the fact that we have such diversity in the service lines that this is going to continue into 2021. i think as we read about individuals that are suffering from anxiety and depression and other suicide attempts, i mean, it's just exploding. and i think that we're seeing those trends now, but i do think they're going to continue to be into 2021 as people cope with this. and with the resurgence, i think that just added to the demand. and so we feel good that all of our service lines are really seeing this demand. and i think that's what's reflected in the third quarter.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
no, that makes sense. and then just on the u.k. sale process. thanks for the color that you gave us. i guess, the question that i have is, what else is left to do in the process? and is there anything you can share with us on timing?
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
well, we're going to move as quickly as possible. and as i mentioned in our remarks, we do have initial bids that have been submitted. we're not going to be commenting on detail around that. but i will say that there is continuing to be a lot of interest, inquiry, and certainly, we have buyer interest that remain strong. and so we'll be giving more detail as it's appropriate around timing and also just how this is progressing.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
all right. awesome. thank you.

our next question comes from ralph giacobbe with citi.
ralph giacobbe -- citi -- analyst
thanks. good morning. just hoping you can give a little bit more of the underlying assumptions, i guess, for the fourth quarter guidance at this point, both in terms of sort of the -- maybe the volume and pricing side of the equation. and then if you're willing at all to give sort of early thoughts on 2021? it sounds like you're pretty optimistic around some of the growth opportunities. so how would we frame that or think about that from a modeling perspective off of either the 2020 baseline or maybe 2019? thanks.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. ralph, first of all, on our fourth quarter guidance, we are projecting mid-single-digit revenue growth and ebitda growth of more than 10% on a consolidated level on a year-over-year basis. and the key trends underlying this guidance include a continuation of the revenue trends we're seeing in our u.s. segment, with volumes increasing 3% to 4%, obviously, potentially even stronger, but we do have some seasonality that we deal with in the fourth quarter and just cautious approach that we are taking around the resurgence. and we see revenue per day trends continuing to be positive and have a range of around 2% to 3% for revenue per day growth. in the u.s., we also expect to see an ongoing contribution from both the cost savings initiatives identified in 2019, as well as the cost management actions that we've implemented in 2020, so believe that our margin will reflect all of those initiatives.
and in the u.k. segment, expect to continue to see sequential improvement, which we've seen recently in both the census and the pricing, as well as the labor cost trends over the past several months. all of those metrics in the u.k. have improved, and we expect to continue to see that. as i mentioned, our guidance does reflect seasonality that we typically see in the fourth quarter, but we do have a very positive outlook for the quarter. we will provide more thoughts around 2021 in february, as we typically do. but we -- as debbie mentioned a minute ago, we think that the trends, the demand, the volume growth opportunities that we have going into next year will continue.
ralph giacobbe -- citi -- analyst
okay. all right. fair enough. and then just a follow-up. i guess how are you finding the labor backdrop at this point, maybe specifically in the u.s.? any staffing challenges? and maybe wage rate increases you're having to give kind of in this environment? thanks.
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
sure. i mean we really have not had any significant disruption or change in the availability or really the cost of our staffing. i think that certainly, we are closely monitoring the health of our employees, and we want to ensure we have the right staff available. but we haven't had an issue around that. i think that certainly, in the u.k., the number of the self-isolating employees there, it peaked at the end of march, early april. so we've continued to see a lot lower levels of that. and i think they've been able to manage the staffing there, and we certainly have here in the u.s. we do think that the, i think, just general economic environment in the u.s. and the u.k. might provide some opportunities for us to access, perhaps staff that had not been in the industry. i know in the u.k., they have started a preceptor program for staff that are not trained in healthcare, but come from other industries. their turnover is down. and we have the same, i think, focus here in the u.s. is just to really utilize those individuals that might seek employment in our industry and make sure that we're using them appropriately. but overall, we really haven't seen disruption there.
ralph giacobbe -- citi -- analyst
okay. very helpful. thank you.

our next question comes from pito chickering with deutsche bank.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions. a couple of questions for you here. on u.s. demand, you talked about seeing strong demand across all segments. can you talk about what you're seeing on geographic areas if you're seeing spikes or weaknesses in areas that are -- that have covid or don't have covid? i'm just curious how covid is impacting your sort of core business?
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
i think that we've been through this now for several months. and i think that the staff out in the field and the leadership in the field have really done an amazing job of just handling areas like hotspots that have seen more covid, but also making sure that individuals are able to access our care. so we did have some facilities that have been more impacted than others. but what we've done is we have very, very solid procedures around individuals that might come in. if we suspect that they have covid, we isolate them. and then we are putting them on another unit if they're diagnosed with the positive test, but they are continuing treatment. and i think, certainly, if their medical symptoms become more severe, we would move them out of our setting. but overall, we've continued to see a flow of patients.
we haven't stopped admissions. there may be -- i know there are a few of our higher-volume substance use facilities that saw more covid, and so there was a little slowing of admissions, but no one was stopped from coming into the hospital. we just wanted to make sure we were very cautious and careful about how we handle those patients. and it varies really right now with some of just the resurgence and there may be a market that has resurgence and then that seems to ease. so -- but we're being very focused on just making sure we're keeping access to our services because we feel like that's more important than ever now.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. and then on the u.k., revenue per pricing was strong. it looks as though it could have been from higher admissions due to the lower length of stays. i guess, how do we think about higher short-term admissions in the u.k. and its impact on margins? and at the same time, on the nhs pricing comment, you said 2.8%. is that for 2021? and then also on the u.k., anything that you want to share with the highest bid you've gotten so far for that business?
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
good try there.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. we'll start with the first part of that question. the u.k. revenue per day, we've talked earlier in the year about, given the pandemic, of there being some interim rate increases with our payers there. so it has been a process to work through the negotiations for what we typically receive in april. and that 2.8% that we have now received on an average basis across our payers, that is the 2020 rate increase. that is around the level of our 2019 rate increase and is really in the range of the 2.5% to 3% expectation that we have going forward, but that does represent our 2020 increase. from a volume perspective, we did see a strong recovery in our shorter length of stay services. that is reflected in our commentary around getting back to our pre-covid volumes early in the third quarter. and that's reflected in strong year-over-year patient days considering managing through the pandemic, the impact that we saw in the second quarter. we are very pleased with the u.k. volumes really across all of the service lines and think we're well positioned for the continuing demand in the u.k.
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
pito, i'll take your last question. we're not going to provide an update on any detail around the initial bids. but i'll just, again, say that our objective is to maximize value. and that's what we're focused on, but we will provide additional updates when it's appropriate.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. and then, because you don't want to answer that one, let me ask one more follow-up one. fourth quarter margins look to be a step-down versus what we saw in the third quarter, excluding return to cares act. it looks to be about 160 basis points, if my math is right, sort of sequential decline. i guess, curious, from a margin perspective, what are you guys sort of assuming different in fourth quarter than you saw in the third quarter, again, excluding the cares act?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. the -- we do project a strong margin in the fourth quarter. if you think about our u.s. business, we see a 200 basis point type improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019. and the step-down from the third quarter mainly relates to seasonality that we see. we do typically see a lower occupancy, especially in between the thanksgiving, christmas holidays, right at the end of the year, and so the margin reflects that as it does in many years for certain service lines that experience some seasonality. and we have just a little bit of caution, thinking about potential resurgence and the effect it may have in different markets. we want to be somewhat cautious. but the trends that we've seen so far in october, as we mentioned, have been very positive. we think that will be reflected in the volume and a strong margin for the quarter. so that's the margin, pito, it does continue to show the year-over-year improvement that we reported in the third quarter.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks so much, guys. nice quarter.
debra osteen -- chief executive officer

and our next question comes from kevin fischbeck with bank of america.
joanna gajuk -- bank of america -- analyst
hey. good morning. this is joanna gajuk filling for kevin today. thanks for taking the question. so first one, actually, a quick one on a follow-up. so did i hear right, you talked about outpatient volumes also coming back, right?
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
yes.
joanna gajuk -- bank of america -- analyst
okay.
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
we did see an increase in outpatient, joanna. it's not at the level that we have been, but it's much better than it was in the second quarter.
joanna gajuk -- bank of america -- analyst
all right. that makes sense. okay. i clearly heard you saying that it was across business lines, so i just wanted to confirm that. and then on the, i guess, on another piece of the pricing outlook. so i know the last quarter call, you mentioned that you have not seen anything on the medicaid rate pressure, but -- anything changed there? anything that you're watching in any particular states?
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
we are not aware of, at this point, any changes or rate cuts from the states. there was one state that we have one facility in, which was nevada. and they recently cut their rates by 6%. but we were excluded from those cuts as a mental health provider. and i think this really demonstrates the support from the state and also just their recognition of the value of the services, especially right now. we are monitoring each state that we're in. we're in 40 states. and -- but we believe that with our diversity and just the climate, in general, and then i think the increased demand that we believe payers are going to be supportive of our services and the payments.
joanna gajuk -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and if i also -- if i can follow up on a commentary about the strength you see in october, and also, the question about labor, you say you're not seeing any pressure. but if you're talking about the outlook of increased demand given the results of the pandemic and people struggling with that, are you anticipating you will have enough labor to serve this demand? or are you preparing for some sort of spiking in the cost because of kind of the increased demand?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
we have a lot of experience and a strong track record, just adding beds, opening new facilities, and being able to appropriately add staff based on the volume growth that we see. so we are not anticipating any challenges there. it is a focus of the team, and we have a strong record on just being able to recruit and add staff for our growth.
joanna gajuk -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. that's great. and the last question, on the u.k., which you've said it -- you're also seeing pretty positive trends there. and in the past, you talked about the retooling of beds. so i don't know if there's anything that's happening there or it's been largely complete. and i'm -- i suspect with the pandemic, there's probably some disruption maybe to that process. so any kind of update on that? thank you.
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
well, we are continuing with our retoolings, and we're on track to reopen the majority of our beds that we talked about by the end of the year. i think these beds that we have opened throughout the year are being used, and i think that we're going to continue to see the positive contribution from those retool beds. i think that as in nhs, it's starting to see this surge and more demand. we are utilizing the retool beds as well as, certainly, the existing beds that we have. but i think -- one of the, i think, strong messages that nhs has given is they are willing to actually back those beds with block contracts. so they are paying for beds without regard to whether a patient is in them. and i think part of that is really insurance and really comfort for them that as demand is growing, and it certainly is in the u.k., that they have a bed available. so we think our retooling is very timely, and we're on track for what we had said we were going to do.
joanna gajuk -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thank you so much.

our next question comes from john ransom with raymond james.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, can you hear me?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. good morning.
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
good morning.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. so a little -- i've got these fancy new wireless headset things, and i'm terrible at operating them. so i was a little nervous. i'm not going to go, pito, and ask you something you don't want to answer, but maybe if i could ask on the u.k., are you finished soliciting bids? and is this -- should we understand your comments as you've gotten preliminary bids and now we're into kind of data room due diligence phase?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
we have received the non binding offers and are moving forward through the process and don't really have much of an update other than that, john, regarding timing and where we stand on valuation.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
so you don't expect to receive any more offers? you've gotten the offers you expect to get. you're just working through that process. is that the best way to think about what you said?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
no. we're not providing more specific updates than what we commented on earlier.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. thinking about 2021, if we adjust for seasonality for 4q, what other things should we think about in terms of a jumping off point for next year? i guess you've had $20 million of cost cuts. so should we say maybe $10 million kind of net new in 2021? anything else that we should look at for 4q as we think about 2021. just as we get our preliminary numbers out there?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
john, i think that assumption around the savings realized this year, $10 million, is there. and we think that will be reflected in the first half of next year because we have achieved a lot of that by the second half of 2020. other than that, it will obviously be an interesting comparison as we move into next year, but i think that the positive trends will continue, as we said earlier.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
great. so as we think about your short-stay u.s. acute business, traditionally, er -- yes, er, emergency rooms, were big sources of referrals and er business was down some 20%, and yet, your numbers are up. so is it that the mental health cases are still presenting at the er? or have you diversified your referral sources because, obviously, your numbers are up, er is down. and i'm just trying to square the circle about where these patients might be coming from?
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
sure. i mean, we have seen really our er referrals return to normal. so i guess if we think about that, there are patients that are meeting mental health and substance use services going to the er. but we've also diversified our referral sources in markets that we think have served us well through this. but on the other hand, we've really seen a return to normal of most of the referral patterns. and i think individuals that might have been afraid, or during the stay at home orders did not seek care, they are seeking care and they are going to the ers, and we are getting referrals at a normal level.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
great. last one for me. david, is -- again, as we think about 2021, is there any reason to think that your capital expenditure cadence or rhythm would be changed at all because of covid or other factors? so should we still kind of layer in the same amount of growth capex that you've been doing over the past few years?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. we do think you should layer in a similar number. we are going through our detailed project-by-project projection right now in connection with our budget. and we'll have more guidance around that in february. we do see a growing opportunity around our joint ventures and partnerships and -- so that's one thing that we will be looking at that potentially could grow. but for the most part, it is a similar level of investment as what we've seen this year.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. thanks so much.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
thanks, john.
debra osteen -- chief executive officer

we'll take our next question from gary taylor with jp morgan.
gary taylor -- jp morgan -- analyst
hey. good morning. great quarter. any cares act assumption in your fourth quarter guidance?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
no, gary. we have received, as we mentioned in our press release, $32.5 million of cumulative distributions. all of that is on our balance sheet and was not included in our fourth quarter earnings projections as something we would recognize in the quarter. we are finalizing our review of the guidance that has been issued in september and october. but we do not have an assumption in the fourth quarter that any of that would be recognized.
gary taylor -- jp morgan -- analyst
and then, just thinking about the 4q seasonality you're talking about, i know it's been asked about a little bit. there is a bigger step-down sequentially than we've typically seen in your ebitda. and i think ebitda margins are up 330 -- or 300 basis points this quarter. your midpoint for 4q implies up about half of that year-over-year. is there anything else you can explicitly call out? is it just the thought -- it looks like you're looking for 5% to 7% same-store revenue growth. so potentially a little softer. is that just the primary driver of that margin performance step-down for 4q?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
well, we did have a very strong third quarter and expect the fourth quarter in that 5% to 7% range to continue to be very strong. it's mostly seasonality, and as we commented on earlier, us taking a cautious approach, knowing that we do have facilities and markets that could see some disruption from a resurgence, and so we want to be cautious around the volumes and other projections as we think about november and december. but obviously, we've seen strong trends in recent months, and we do expect that to continue. so it is seasonality and some element of us being cautious around the resurgence.
gary taylor -- jp morgan -- analyst
if i could just ask one more quick one. it seems over the last few years, as revenue growth has been slower, margins had declined for four years or so in a row. is there a level, just rule of thumb level on same-store u.s. revenue growth that you need to be at to drive margin improvement? so 4% or 5%, you're -- or higher, you're pretty comfortable, you're driving margin improvement. is there any rule of thumb you'd throw at us?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
well, we think that just the revenue per day growth being in the 2% to 3% range helps us maintain the margins. and then the volume growth that we see is a significant factor in margin improvement opportunities as we realize efficiencies and are able to leverage the fixed cost structure as we grow our volumes, and so really only need revenue growth to be in that 2% to 3% range. and above that, we do expect margin improvement. and we've seen that, obviously, in the third quarter. as the revenue growth has been stronger, we have seen strong margin improvement from that volume growth.
gary taylor -- jp morgan -- analyst
thank you.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
thanks, gary.

our next question comes from a. j. rice with credit suisse.
a. j. rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, everybody. just first, i know there's been discussion over time about what the long-term targets are for capital structure. any updated thoughts on the amount of leverage that you're comfortable with long term?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
well, i think we've seen this quarter -- yes, we've seen this quarter, something we've talked about before around just the investments that we've made over the last several years, contributing to earnings growth and that helping us lower our leverage. we saw that in the third quarter. and then obviously, anything above and beyond that relates to a more strategic transaction, like the u.k. transaction, and we are not providing a specific target yet relating to that. we do have a goal of lowering our leverage through the earnings growth and other potential opportunities, but are not sharing a target yet, a.j.
a. j. rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. obviously, there's been a lot of discussion about tele-health and deploying that in the behavioral area. you guys -- as you talk about it, it sounds like it's to support the existing services in some ways that you provide. but i wonder, are you looking at anything where that might be a growth avenue to pursue outpatient more? are you getting any discussions with third-party tele-health companies that are interested in working with you? anything to share along those lines?
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
sure. i mean we -- as you said, we see tele-health is not a replacement for the inpatient part of what we do. it is a good access point. and we've used it for that with patient engagement. i think that the regulatory changes and reimbursement changes that have been made and look like they're going to at least be in place through the end of this year, i think, have been favorable. so we have looked at how we can expand the use of tele-health, a.j., with our partial and our outpatient programs, and we're doing that now. i do -- we are already collaborating with some outside vendors for tele-health. we also have internal capabilities around that, which we've expanded certainly with the pandemic. but i think that as practitioners as well as patients get more comfortable, and i think they have, we see that as a growth area for what we're doing, and primarily, for the partial and outpatients but also for assessments, and then even -- we're using it right now for visitation of those that can't come into the facility. but i think it is an area that can -- is -- now that reimbursement changes have started to reflect the importance of it, we plan to use that. and we're open to collaboration. we're already doing that now, and we think it makes sense.
a. j. rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. maybe i'll slip one more in, if i could, because this just sort of follows on some of the other questioning. you're in 40 states. so you've seen clearly covid surges and then covid easing, and obviously, how communities responding to those surges has evolved over the last six or seven months. do you see at this point where there's a surge in a community -- because you're sort of using that as one of the cautionary comments about the fourth quarter, do you see surges in a community really impact the business? or is it now -- people are sort of just back to at least healthcare utilization as usual, and you really -- when there's a mini surge in a community, you really don't see that much impact anymore. can you just give us a little flavor for -- given you've got a pretty wide view?
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
well, i think, a.j., that as we have had markets that have seen more cases that our patients are still coming to our facilities for treatment. i think where we have really focused on this is how we manage them when they are in the facility and making sure that we are appropriate with isolating patients as necessary, having the right unit for covid patients as opposed to those that don't have covid. but i do think when we talk about resurgence and caution, i would say that's more around just the referral networks. we don't anticipate that happening, but we also want to make sure that we're being conservative because we don't have control over that. we've done a lot of things, and i think we've learned a lot. the facilities know what to expect. i think they're focused on very quickly adapting the referral outreach and also just how the sales and marketing approach is working. we've got that platform that we've used. it's given us a lot of visibility. so i think, overall, as we see cases go up, we haven't seen that really interrupt our business other than just managing within the facility.
a. j. rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
interesting. okay. thanks a lot.

[operator instructions] our next question comes from whit mayo with ubs.
whit mayo -- ubs -- analyst
hey, thanks. good morning. we've seen this interesting trend begin to develop for maybe a quarter and a half now where covid is beginning to actually drive tailwinds for certain providers. some of you have no t&e expense, your malpractice is probably down, workers' comp down, self-insured costs down, then there's the offset with increased ppe supplies to support your field. and i guess i'm just wondering, do you think that covid was a tailwind for you in the third quarter? would you net those two together? i mean we also have the sequester. so i'm just wondering if the covid tailwinds actually offset the headwinds at this point? and should we be thinking that maybe some of those expenses leak back into the business next year?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
whit, we do not believe on a net basis. there are a lot of moving pieces and some savings and some incremental costs, as you mentioned. on a net basis, we do not think there's a significant tailwind that we're seeing here. i mean, obviously, the volume and the demand, we do think will continue partially because of what people have been through. but from a cost perspective, there's nothing significant that we would highlight. we are seeing a lower level of travel, a lower level of employee medical and some other costs this year, but have also seen, as you mentioned, a higher level of the incremental ppe cost, and we will be looking at just how that changes. what is essential for us to add back from a travel perspective, for example, as we think about next year, but i don't think there's any significant amount that we would highlight for you at this point.
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
and i'll just add, whit, that i think a lot of our efforts around the expense management have been focused on making sure we're matching volume with our staffing, and primarily, in the non clinical areas. but we have taken the opportunity through this to really step back and say, what is essential? do we need some of the travel costs that previously we had done in marketing,and even through some of the travel to our events, and looked at virtual solutions. so i do think going forward, that we will be changing some of the way we do things. and there will be, i think, some return of perhaps health claims. and i think that as we get back to normal, which i'm not sure when that will be, but i think that most of our impact on expenses has been around just managing the flow of patients and making sure that we're being very careful and prudent about our staffing.
whit mayo -- ubs -- analyst
that's super helpful. and just one follow-up is, are you seeing any notable changes in how the payers are responding to you guys? just, i'm curious around denials, pretty off, anything that may have impacted, length of stay, the adjudication process. just curious on any observations you have with any headwinds or tailwinds you feel like you're seeing from a payer perspective? thanks.
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
i mean i think that we really haven't seen much of a change there, whit. i mean they're still requiring medical necessity. we make sure that, that's in place as we admit patients. but as i look at payer behavior, i don't see any big difference there. and i think that our length of stay increased. as we looked at it, there wasn't any one factor there. it's been pretty stable across all of our service lines. and so i think that certainly, they've been very collaborative with us as we've gone through the pandemic and they're trying to make sure their patients that are part of their plans get taken care of. but i wouldn't identify anything that's changed. they're still focused on making sure that patients are getting appropriate care for the appropriate length of stay.
whit mayo -- ubs -- analyst

our next question comes from matthew gillmor with baird.
matthew gillmor -- baird -- analyst
hey, thanks. i just had a quick clarification. i think debbie made a comment about record census levels in october. did that mean that, that was the best-ever census level for the company during october or just a record for an october month?
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
it's actually the best census that acadia has had in the u.s. so it's a record that was set for highest census for the company.
matthew gillmor -- baird -- analyst
and would you -- just to follow up on that, would -- is that unusual in the sense that maybe september is normally a better month than october? or is that generally kind of what you'd expect sequentially, maybe with the bed adds to perhaps contributing to that?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
you're right. the bed additions have helped us, and our operations team has done a great job bringing beds online this year, a new facility online in july. october does typically have a strong census month. and so it's a month as you think about other months of the year where we expect a strong census, and we're very pleased to achieve that high number during the month and have seen strong performance from across the service lines to help us achieve that.
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
and i'll just add that with our de novos that we have put in place and also just, as david said, bed additions. we have been pleased that those beds have been ramping at our expectation and some above our expectations. so i think all those factors go together, which is where we were able to actually end up. we've still got a few days left in october, not many, one. but i think across the service lines, we've certainly seen some very, i think, strong numbers around acute as well as specialty returning to kind of normal ranges. so all that adds up with the rtcs as well, certainly to the strong number that we saw in october.
matthew gillmor -- baird -- analyst
okay. great. thanks a lot.
operator
and we'll take our next question from ryan daniels with william blair.
nick spiekhout -- william blair -- analyst
hey, guys. nick spiekhout on for ryan. thanks for squeezing me in. you mentioned in the u.s. that referral kind of distribution is basically back to normal at this point. is that similar in the u.k.? and then is any of the strength kind of as a result of backlog filling? or do you think most of that is basically shaken out at this point?
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
well, i think in the u.k., there was a dynamic in march and april and even into may, where the commissioners were redeployed for med/surg services. and i think as that happened, there were also case managers in the u.k. that were also redeployed for med/surg. and i think that that had some interruption as well as the stay-at-home orders, which were in place in the u.k. we have seen the commissioning process return to normal. and as they have returned to normal, there are patients that are being sent, obviously, to our facilities in the u.k. i think that there's a combination of individuals that need this care that perhaps might have delayed, but i also believe that just -- there's a strong demand even without the pandemic that we've talked about before. if you add then the pandemic and the anxiety and depression, i think they both kind of, i guess, have impacted us, not just in the u.k. but the u.s., where people are coming in that perhaps wouldn't have had an issue prior to the pandemic, but then we're also seeing patients that have had long-standing issues, and frankly, they're -- they've become more acute as they've gone through this pandemic.
nick spiekhout -- william blair -- analyst
great. that makes sense. and then you talked about kind of capex for 2021, kind of looking at 2020 for being a good estimate. would that be the case, too, for kind of bed adds for 2021 kind of like a similar level to 2020?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. we'll provide more detail there, but we have consistently had bed additions at the level that we're seeing in 2020. so it's not just this year, it's been consistent over the last several years, and we think that will continue, but we'll provide more guidance around that in february.
nick spiekhout -- william blair -- analyst
got you. great. all right. thanks, guys. congrats on the quarter.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
okay. thank you.
debra osteen -- chief executive officer

gretchen hommrich -- investor relations
good morning, and welcome to acadia's third quarter 2020 conference call. i'm gretchen hommrich, director of investor relations for acadia. i'll first provide you with our safe harbor before turning the call over to chief executive officer, debbie osteen. to the extent any non-gaap financial measure is discussed in today's call, you will also find a reconciliation of that measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated according to gaap on our website by viewing yesterday's news release under the investors link. this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including statements, among others, regarding acadia's expected quarterly and annual financial performance for 2020 and beyond.
for this purpose, any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. without limiting the foregoing, the words believes, anticipates, plans, expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. you are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by the important factors, among others, set forth in acadia's filings with the securities and exchange commission and in the company's third quarter news release, and consequently, actual operations and results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
at this time, for opening remarks, i would like to turn the conference call over to chief executive officer, debbie osteen.
debra osteen -- chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you for being with us today for our third quarter 2020 conference call. i'm here today with chief financial officer, david duckworth, and other members of our executive management team. david and i will provide some remarks about our financial and operating results for the third quarter and year. we will then open the line for your questions. we were very pleased with our solid financial and operating performance for the third quarter. before we get into the results, i want to thank all of acadia's dedicated employees and clinicians for their continued support and relentless focus on providing the highest quality care to our patients and their families, especially during these challenging times. we are fortunate to have an experienced team across our operations, who continue to work tirelessly to execute on our growth strategy and effectively manage costs. as the global pandemic continues to affect all our lives, we are mindful of our critical role as a leading provider of behavioral healthcare services. the ongoing uncertainties and economic and societal concerns continue to contribute to the demand for our services, especially for those already struggling with behavioral health and addiction concerns and the added isolation and anxiety caused by the pandemic.
above all, our top priority remains supporting our patients with quality care, provided in a safe and accessible manner. as such, we have continued to execute our strategy with solid results. and importantly, we are optimistic about the opportunities ahead for acadia. across both the u.s. and the u.k. operations, we saw strong results driven by solid volumes. in addition, our revenue per day returned to our normal expected range. during the third quarter, we experienced strong top line growth, with revenues up 7.2% over the prior year, reflecting robust demand for our behavioral health services. we believe this result is indicative of the intrinsic strength and demand for our services. we have a resilient business model that can respond to a rapidly changing environment. acadia is well positioned to address the needs of those seeking treatment for mental health and substance use issues. and we expect that demand for our services will continue to increase. in the u.s., this robust demand is demonstrated by our increase in same-facility patient days of 4.2% compared to the prior year. within our acute service line, we have seen solid volumes attributable to our deep network of referral sources. this has remained consistent despite the current environment.
our teams work closely with our patients, their families and referral sources to reinforce the message that we have the expertise and capacity to help. in order to reach our patients, we continue to use additional access points, tele-health capabilities, wellness checks and our crisis hotline. for our specialty service line, we were pleased to see stabilization in our volumes. by shifting our marketing strategies to focus on local and regional markets, we were able to reach those that need the very specialized services that we provide. during the quarter, we also saw a sequential improvement in our out-of-state referrals due to patients being more willing to travel. however, we've not yet seen our referrals return to prior year levels. volumes in our rtc service line remained solid in the quarter. these facilities leverage relationships with state referring agencies to serve children and adolescents with behavioral conditions. as a result, we had solid patient day year-over-year growth throughout the third quarter, and we expect that to continue.
in our ctc service line, we also continued to experience strong patient volumes as both demand and coverage trends remained solid. in the u.s., our same-facility revenue per day increased 3.1% in the third quarter as compared to the prior year. this reflects annual rate increases in our expected range of 2% to 3% as well as normalized ctc reimbursement and improvement in our outpatient revenue. excluding the impact from the reversal of the cares act income of $18.1 million, our same-facility ebitda margin improved 380 basis points to 29%. we are realizing measurable improvement in our cost management efforts and operating efficiencies that we've implemented in 2019 and 2020. we continue to proactively manage staffing and other costs. our team did a great job making timely decisions to reduce ftes in response to the declines in volume. and as our patients returned at higher volume to our facilities, we utilized tools implemented last year to monitor ftes at the facility level. our team is very focused on evaluating every position and determining what expenses are essential. we have implemented a balanced approach to ensure we have appropriate resources to support our patients. in the u.k., same-facility revenue increased 2.7% from the third quarter last year, reflecting a 2.8% increase in revenue per patient day and flat year-over-year patient day volumes.
we saw monthly sequential improvement throughout the third quarter. and our volumes surpassed pre-covid levels in early july, which we were pleased with. we expect to see continued growth in demand from individuals in the u.k. requiring mental health and addiction treatment. we continue to work with the nhs and other referral sources to align our services with expected demand, and we are well positioned to meet this need across our service lines. we were also pleased to see sequential improvement in our third quarter labor costs in the u.k. total labor costs as a percent of total revenue improved 240 basis points to 68.2% for the third quarter of 2020 from 70.6% in the second quarter and was flat as compared to the third quarter of 2019. agency labor as a percentage of total labor cost improved from 13.5% in the third quarter of 2019 to 12.7% in the third quarter of 2020. during the quarter, we also finalized negotiations with the nhs and local payers for our rate increases for the fiscal year. we received an average rate increase of 2.8% across all of our service lines. we believe this demonstrates support for the important care that we are providing their patients. as we recently disclosed, we have relaunched the formal process regarding the potential sale of our u.k. business. our objective continues to be maximizing value for our shareholders.
consistent with market practice for u.k. transactions of this nature and in conjunction with our advisors, we have solicited and have now received nonbinding offers to acquire our u.k. business from multiple bidders. as we continue to work with our financial and legal advisors, we will update the market on the sales process when and as we determine it is appropriate. we continue to make strategic investments in our future growth in the u.s. expanding our market reach through bed expansions and additional service opportunities. for the first three quarters of 2020, we have added 206 beds to our existing facilities in the u.s., and we expect to add approximately 100 beds in the fourth quarter. as part of our strategy, we have continued our strong track record of partnering with health systems and hospitals across the country, which has created important growth opportunities for acadia. along with our joint venture partner, tower health, we opened a 144-bed behavioral health facility in reading, pennsylvania, in july. we expect to open a new joint venture hospital with ascension saint thomas in nashville during the fourth quarter.
together, our bed expansions, de novo facilities and joint ventures provide many growth opportunities for acadia to reach more patients in new and existing markets and further advance our position in the market as well as the growth of our business. going forward, we believe acadia will play a critical role in meeting the needs of many people who are struggling with the uncertainties related to the pandemic. we will continue to focus on our primary objective to deliver the highest quality of patient care as we extend our market reach and advance our position as a leading behavioral healthcare facilities operator.
now i will turn the call over to david duckworth to discuss our financial results in more detail.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
thanks, debbie, and good morning. revenue for the third quarter was $833.3 million compared with $777.3 million for the third quarter of 2019. results for the third quarter of 2020 include a reversal of $18.1 million in other income recorded in the second quarter of 2020 related to the provider relief fund established by the cares act. the company's decision to reverse this income was based on additional guidance issued by hhs. the company received $12.8 million of additional general distributions from the provider relief fund in the third quarter of 2020 and has now received cumulative total distributions of approximately $32.5 million. these distributions are recorded in other accrued liabilities on the company's balance sheet at september 30, 2020, pending the company's final review of hhs guidance. excluding the impact from the reversal of the cares act income of $18.1 million, the company's consolidated adjusted ebitda for the third quarter of 2020 was $177.5 million or 21.3% of revenue.
net income attributable to acadia stockholders was $37 million or $0.42 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020 compared with net income of $42.6 million or $0.48 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2019. adjusted income attributable to acadia stockholders for the third quarter of 2020 was $60.3 million or $0.68 per diluted share, excluding a loss on impairment of $20.2 million, transaction-related expenses of $8.5 million and an income tax effect of adjustments to income of $5.4 million. i'd like to give you some additional perspective into our strategic focus on managing costs and improving margins. as debbie said, we are pleased with the steps we have taken in the past 18 months to streamline our operations, while continuing to make strategic investments. our cost savings initiatives implemented following our strategic review last year are on track as evidenced by our results for the third quarter. we recognized $4.6 million of savings in the third quarter relating to the 2019 cost savings initiatives, and we are on track to achieve a run rate of $20 million by the end of the year. turning to our balance sheet. our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity and capital to invest in and continue to grow our business.
at september 30, 2020, we had approximately $339 million in cash and cash equivalents and full availability under our $500 million revolving credit facility. our cash position reflects a third quarter with robust operating cash flows of $207 million. our increase in cash was driven by our strong earnings growth, positive working capital trends and benefits from the cares act. from a capital structure perspective, we improved our debt maturity profile with two recent transactions. as mentioned on the second quarter call, we issued $450 million of 5.5% senior notes due 2028, and the net proceeds from this offering were used to redeem the senior notes that were due in 2021 and 2022. in october, we finalized the issuance of $475 million of 5% senior notes due in 2029, and used the net proceeds to prepay outstanding borrowings under our existing term loan b facility due 2022. together, these initiatives relating to expense and cash management and our capital structure have put us in a strong financial position for 2020 and beyond. we will continue to make strategic investments in the business while aligning our costs to meet the ongoing needs of our patients.
turning to our financial guidance. as noted in our press release, we are providing guidance for the fourth quarter as follows: revenue in a range of $810 million to $835 million, adjusted ebitda in a range of $160 million to $165 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share in a range of $0.68 to $0.72. while we remain cautious regarding factors that could impact our november and december results, our fourth quarter guidance represents management's expectations, given the positive revenue and cost trends we are seeing in our u.s. and our u.k. operations. we believe the essential nature of the services we provide combined with strong demand will drive growth for the remainder of the year and beyond. this concludes our prepared remarks this morning.
i will now ask lauren to open the floor for your questions.

operator
[operator instructions] we'll take our first question from ralph giacobbe with -- from citi.
ralph giacobbe -- citigroup -- analyst
great. and very helpful framework. just wanted to clarify on the 10% growth, you said two -- facility expansion, i think, was included. m&a was not included. what about the partnership in de novos? are those included in the 10%?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes, ralph, the facility expansions, joint ventures and de novos are included in the 10%. and as we commented, m&a would be incremental to that threshold.
ralph giacobbe -- citigroup -- analyst
got it. and then you just delevered the balance sheet, you talked about the target, sort of i guess, the three to four times range. i guess, how quickly should we think of the speed and ramp-up of these projects and in regard to that leverage ratio?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
well, these projects that we highlighted are really funded with cash from operations. they are included in our projection of capital expenditures, which we do believe will continue to accelerate as we finalize some of those projects. and so there is an earnings ramp associated with new facilities, not with the bed expansions at existing facilities, but with those new facilities. so we plan to fund those with cash that we generate in the business, and really see the deleveraging benefit of that as we look out over the next several years.
ralph giacobbe -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then just my follow-up here, can you talk a little bit more about the guidance, the underlying assumptions maybe on the same store metrics, the volume and pricing? and then implied margins at the midpoint of guidance is about 22%, maybe how you view the opportunities to move that higher or whether it's more about sort of driving top line, to your point, sort of breaking out all of the opportunities that you have going forward? any color around trajectory there would be helpful.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. sure. we do believe that revenue growth will continue at the 6% to 8% range. our second quarter, obviously, will have a comp that compares to what was a challenging quarter in 2020. so it's expected to be above that range. but in addition to that 6% revenue growth, we do see margin improvement in the business. our 2021 guidance assumes about a 27% margin for our u.s. same-facility group. and then as you mentioned, the implied guidance for the company in total, which would include our corporate office, as well as any new facilities and start-up losses that are not part of that same-facility group, puts our consolidated margin in the range of 22% to 23%. revenue growth, the 6% to 8%, it continues to break down, very similar to the trends we've seen in the past with about 2% to 3% pricing growth within that, as well as 4% to 5% volume growth. we do believe going forward, as we look past 2021 with the volume growth, the efficiencies and the ongoing cost management focus that we have, we should continue to see margin improvement as we grow the business. and the expectation there is around 50 basis points of annual margin improvement.
ralph giacobbe -- citigroup -- analyst
very helpful, thank you.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you, your next from pito chickering with deutsche bank. please go ahead.
philip chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
good morning, guys, thanks for taking my questions, just drilling in a little bit on the same-store patient days are up 3.6%, comprised of admissions, up 70 basis points and length of stay up 2.9%. can you give us some more color on the admissions. what are you seeing from each referral channel? for example, you said that acute is nearly 47% of your business. how is demand from the er referral channel trended? and also in length of stay, any color on what's happening in terms of length of stay growing? is this a read-through for trends in 2021 and beyond in a post-covid environment?
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
pito, i'll just mention a little bit along the service lines and what we saw in the fourth quarter. our acute continue to see very strong volumes. and it's really driven by our referral network, which includes ers and we did not see much disruption there, and in fact, it stayed very consistent with what we've seen from june forward. our specialty service line, we did see a sequential decline there from quarter three. and that was really due to the resurgence in covid. there was some reluctance to travel and we saw certain markets that were -- we consider to be more hot spots, california, arizona. we managed through that very well, but -- and we have actually started to see a recovery on that in january, and it's even stronger in february. so i think that was a temporary, and that's, again, based on the fact that we pull from a broad area, a geographic area across the country. rtc was very stable and it's really been stable throughout the pandemic. we actually not only saw stability there, but we saw improvement in our census in rtc. and then the last area that i'll mention is our ctc. and that continues to be strong. it's outperformed the prior year and we mentioned that we're adding clinics this year. we feel like this is an area for strong growth, but it certainly, in the fourth quarter was extremely strong, and we were very pleased that we were able to offer services and there was really no disruption there. length of stay, i think has been -- even though it is up slightly, i think as we look at it, we don't see one common factor there. i think that it's within our expected range. if we look at it by service line, i think that while i say there's not one common factor, i do think that in the acute area, it is up from what we have seen over the years. and i think part of that could be to some increase in acuity. but as i said, it's still within the range that we see and have seen over many years.
philip chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay. great. and then for a follow-up question, telehealth is typically used more in the outpatient setting. can you give us some color on what you mean by growing into new services? is there a chance that you can leverage your physicians, nurses, to expand outside of the inpatient or residential service market?
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
sure. well, we feel like we have a strong platform here. and as i mentioned in my remarks, we did expand the capabilities of our facilities very quickly, really within about two weeks, which i have to give credit to our it department, working in collaboration with our facilities. but we also think there may be opportunity to expand telehealth. and as you mentioned, using our physician network and our capabilities that we have clinically, not only for patient follow-up that might occur as patients are discharged, but then also, we're looking at additional markets that we might not be in right now as well as partnerships that we might have with other telehealth providers or perhaps even trying to expand our capabilities here within acadia.
philip chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
so i mean just to be sort of very clear, on the telehealth, you're talking about possibly expanding outside of your core business lines into the demand you're seeing within the behavioral telehealth market?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes, pito, we do believe that could be an opportunity. we have already seen an expansion and just a better continuum of care in our existing markets that does expand our reach, and we believe that trend could continue.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
and i'll just add to that, pito, before you go, our -- what we have used telehealth for is really even through our assessments and using it as a way to extend the therapy because we do pull from some wide geographic areas. so when we talk about extending beyond our current offerings, we believe that we may have opportunity to extend our connection to patients that are in other parts of the country and also we also pull from rural markets, where sometimes they go back and they don't have a continuum and they don't have resources. so we want to be available to them, and we see telehealth as a way to do that.
philip chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
perfect. thanks so much.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from whit mayo with ubs.
benjamin whitman mayo -- ubs -- analyst
hey, thanks, good morning. just quickly on the 10%, does that include start-up costs? and should we think that same-store ebitda is more like a high single-digit number and then the de novos and the new hospitals will contribute above and beyond the 10% number? i'm just trying to make sure i sort of decompose the building blocks to get to 10%?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. whit, it's a good question. that does include us covering our start-up costs. in every year, we have some normal level of start up, given that we are typically opening multiple facilities every year. we, of course, could see a year, especially in 2022, where we have more facilities opening. but the 10% does have us covering that investment in that start-up period. of course, keeping in mind that we could see some years where we have more facilities coming online, but it's inclusive of that number.
benjamin whitman mayo -- ubs -- analyst
awesome. what's the -- what are you budgeting for start-up cost in 2021?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
in 2021, we believe it will be in the range of $6 million to $8 million. we do have three facilities in various phases of the process right now. that compares to more like $4 million to $5 million in 2020 for the facilities that were at a similar phase in the process. so some slight growth in that investment in 2021.
benjamin whitman mayo -- ubs -- analyst
okay. and maybe two quick ones. i'm just curious, debbie, maybe to get an update on some of the underperforming hospitals that you had in late 2019. how are those performing versus budget and plan? and then back to your comments around sort of like policy and legislation, i mean i've seen like california 855. is there anything that has kind of like bubbled up to the surface that you are paying a particularly close amount of attention to?
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
sure. well, with respect to the five facilities, i think in 2020, we were able to execute our plans around them for improvement. and despite covid, they actually performed very well. and i was pleased, and they were all unique as we had talked about a couple of years ago, but i think that they've all exceeded the budget expectations. and then they are strong performers and we did see a couple were specialty, as we had talked about, and we saw some disruption from covid, not anything that was controllable by the facility. but overall, we see a lot of opportunity for each of those. they're meeting our expectations, but we expect them to continue to improve this year. and they are very solid, strong facilities for the company. as far as legislation, i think -- i've been watching the -- as we have a new president, just his views on healthcare and particularly mental health, and i think that i've been pleased to see that he is supportive of enforcing mental health parity. and i think that while there's been some work and attention given to that, i think that's opportunity, frankly, for the industry. i do think that there are still managed care companies that have not embraced parity and should be held accountable. and so i think he has said very publicly that he wants to focus on that. he's also a supporter of telehealth for rural communities.
and i see that as a positive because telehealth is not going to replace our inpatient business, but it can be, as i talked earlier, a real continuum for us that allows people that can't drive or have too far of a distance to come to services. and then i think just from the state point of view, we've seen strong support for mental health across the board. and i think a lot of that is based on the attention that mental health is getting and you've been putting some of those numbers out. and it's -- there's very strong demand. and i think the states have really collaborated with us and been very supportive in what we're trying to do in our place, in really the industry and meeting the needs. so i'm encouraged that i think we have a president that is supportive of what we do and also has talked about funding for opioid and extending that. so we're watching that very carefully, and we're making sure our voice is heard, but i'm pleased that he understands the importance of mental health.
benjamin whitman mayo -- ubs -- analyst
thanks a lot.
operator
thank you. we'll hear next from kevin fischbeck with bank of america.
kevin mark fischbeck -- bank of america -- analyst
all right. great. i just want to confirm, the five-year growth targets of 10% ebitda, what ebitda number is that? is that off of the 2021 guidance? or is that off of the 2020 pro forma number?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
that's off of the 2021 guidance. and it's a similar growth rate if we think about 2021 compared to 2020. so it's a trend that we see in 2021 and continuing over that five-year period.
kevin mark fischbeck -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and again, just to confirm that, you think it should be relatively stable? because you talked a few times about like 2022 is going to be a big year for jvs, and you're going to be adding more beds in the out years. but net-net, it should be more or less kind of consistent ratable over that time period?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
that's how we see it, kevin. we do see just the ongoing bed expansions being very stable within that, the number of new facilities being very stable. and so we do think that is really, as we look at each year, that's a number that we think we can achieve. and i think the new facilities, of course, even if we are investing in a greater number of those and there is potentially a greater investment in that and a cost in that, that could drive incrementally greater returns once you get one to two years into those new facilities. but it's a very stable rate of growth that we are projecting.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
and kevin, we see potential for m&a over and above that, which i talked about earlier. we think that there's a good pipeline and we believe that, that will be additional growth opportunity, which, obviously, we have not included in the 10%, but we think that there's real potential now that we do have our balance sheet in much better condition. we look at tuck-ins and other opportunities out in the market, and we think that there's a good pipeline for that.
kevin mark fischbeck -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and the last question. it was very helpful for you to kind of reset the u.s. business and the exposure to different service lines. as you think about exiting this growth strategy five years from now, are those percentages going to be pretty much the same? or would you expect the business to be shifting in one direction over another?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
we've provided the detail around the service lines within our u.s. business. and we do certainly see the acute service line growing through the joint ventures and other growth pathways that are focused maybe more on acute. but the growth should occur throughout all of our service lines. so i think any shift would be very gradual. we could see acute continue to grow as a mix of our u.s. business. but we believe all the service lines really provide a good platform for continuing growth. so i don't think we see a significant shift in the composition of the business five years from now.
kevin mark fischbeck -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you we'll hear next from a.j. rice with credit suisse.
albert j. william rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, everybody. yes. thanks for laying out those different business segments. that was very helpful. it does sound like acute will grow, given where some of the strategic initiatives are with m&a and jv and so forth, faster than the rest of those business lines. i guess the question is, if part of the target is to get a 50 basis point improvement in margin, sort of annually, is -- how much of that is driven by margin differentials across the business lines and the business shifting toward higher-margin business, which i would assume acute is relative to some of those other businesses? but if you could confirm that.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
no. we don't see that being a contributing factor to the margin improvement. it really is more the growth, the efficiencies that we believe we should continue to see from volume growth at existing facilities, leveraging the cost structure that we already have. that is the key driver of margin growth. it's -- we don't view the service mix being a factor in that margin improvement.
albert j. william rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
is there a big differential in margin across the business lines?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
we see in -- across our u.s. service lines, strong margins and would really characterize all service lines being around the u.s. same-facility level, which is approximately 27%. it can be different across the country and the different programs that we operate. but in general, our service lines are similar to our overall u.s. same-facility margins.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
and a.j., i'll just add, i think in the specialty area, we have a lot of diversity. and so depending on payer mix, you might see some variance of margin there, because some are larger and very specialized. and there is a lot of diversity there. so with acute, it's a little bit more straightforward and certainly with ctc as well. but i think within specialty, we have a very strong payer mix there as well as referral base.
albert j. william rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. and then maybe the other question just to ask would be around labor. obviously, that's been a constraint in this sector from time to time on growth. and some of the other sectors like acute are talking about some pressures they're having in finding adequate labor and some burnout in existing staff and so forth. can you just sort of give us an update on how you see that? what's happening with your turnover rate? what's happening with your ability to recruit and some of the initiatives maybe in that regard?
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
well, a.j., we've had a very strong focus on recruitment and retention. and i think that we did see occasions in the fourth quarter because of covid and because we saw a lot more staff being impacted, and we certainly saw more patients coming in that i think the team did a fantastic job of just making sure they got services. but i'll say that there are occasions where we've utilized agency and overtime, just to ensure that we have appropriate staff. but as i look at the company and really look across the service lines, we haven't seen significant disruption or change in the availability. we're very fortunate. our turnover rate is fairly stable. we always work to bring it down, but it's stable and i think that, again, i'd just go back to the operators in the field just did a great job of making sure we have the staff there when the patients needed to seek treatment.

thank you. our next from brian tanquilut with jefferies.
brian gil tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning guys and congratulations. i guess, debbie, just to follow-up on your comments on m&a earlier, what is your appetite for larger deals at this point? or should we be thinking about this more as a tuck-in strategy? and then, i guess, given the lack of deal flow in the space, i mean, is it safe to assume that valuations are much lower than what we saw, say, three to four years ago?
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
well, i'll take the first part of that question and let david talk about valuations. but i think m&a has historically been a priority here. i think we're very well informed about the platforms that are out there and larger platforms. we're not going to comment on any specific transaction, but i'll just say we're open to what makes sense for us. we do look at valuation and multiples, but we also look at the strategic part of that as well as synergies. so i think that we -- as we approach this year, we have an open mind for m&a, but we also have a disciplined approach to it and a framework that's going to keep us very disciplined. and i think that it looks from just the pipeline that there are opportunities not only for the tuck-ins, but perhaps going forward, some of the larger m&a that might come to market. do you want to mention that m&a?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
and really, brian, nothing to add around valuation compared to the last several years. i think debbie's point is the right one. we will remain disciplined. we think many different types of m&a opportunities will be attractive. and we will look at those and just evaluate it under our framework, but we do not have a specific view right now on where valuations should be.
brian gil tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and then, i guess, as i look at the ctc side of the business or just the whole addiction treatment complex, right? obviously, the states are trying to negotiate a big settlement with the drug supply chain and they're saying that they're going to use the funds to pay for addiction treatment at the community level. so have you had conversations with your state clients yet on what that could mean for acadia or just the industry as a whole, once that settlement happens presumably sometime this year?
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
we stay in very close touch with our states. and i think the ceos and leadership out in the field really do a good job of making sure that they're talking with the states and officials and those that are, i think, involved in making decisions around funding. i do -- we talked about this, i guess, maybe a year before last, and it didn't work out. it does look like this is going to -- it's going to happen now with the settlement. and i think that we believe that we're in a good position to receive some of those funds, but we can't really predict how the states right now will lay that out. there are other proactive, preventative services that i think they would seek to have, but we also believe we provide a key part of that continuum. so i think we are in close contact. we're watching that. and we're hopeful that it will allow us to treat more individuals with the funding that may or may not become available.
brian gil tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
awesome. thank you

debbie yes, thank you.

our next from john ransom with raymond james.
john wilson ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning, thanks for the update and all the detail on your u.s. business. just a couple for me. on the ctc side, given that there's no public comp out there stand-alone, i don't think that business is fully understood. but are there any sizable private equity-backed portfolio companies that you could see yourself being interested in? or is this going to be, in your opinion, probably just a de novo type business?
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
well, as i mentioned to brian, we don't comment on specifics, but there are platforms for ctc, and we certainly know them. and i think that they have some different geographies than we might have. so those platforms might provide an opportunity for us to move into other states that we're not in or states that we feel would be good to go in with an acquisition rather than a de novo. i do think that the team is -- does a very thorough job of really looking at what makes the most sense for states and really, they've got some good criteria and metrics that they view, but we would not rule out m&a in the ctc area. we just now see a very strong pipeline, frankly, for our de novos. and we have plans and they're concrete, very defined by state. but on the other hand, we would always be open to opportunity if it presented.
john wilson ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. on your labor, you know off hand, how many have been vaccinated. and are you seeing -- is there a subset that's just not willing to take the vaccine at this point as we've seen in other sectors of healthcare?
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
we have tried to be very open with our staff and provide communication and education about the vaccine. i think that right now, i think about 15% of our staff have received the vaccine. i think that it varies by facility and by state. but -- and there are also states, as we know from hearing the news are in varying stages of actually getting the vaccine out to those that need it. but we're going to continue to educate about, i think, the importance of the vaccine, but we've not mandated it here. we don't plan to do that, but we do think it's important for just the country. and we would always encourage our staff to receive it, but we're not at this point, mandating it.
john wilson ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
got you. and then lastly for me. if you -- david, if we think about the de novo losses that you're going to absorb in your 10% ebitda target, could you maybe provide some sizing of that just from a dollar perspective, at least kind of 2020, 2021 in your guidance and maybe 2022?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
we mentioned, john, for this year, we have three facilities that are starting up, and that's around a $6 million to $8 million number for us. so that first year where a facility is going through the opening process and the licensing survey process tends to be around a $2 million loss. i think the team that we have has done a great job in finding ways to manage that. and the survey process and our work with the survey team is essential to that. so i think in general, it's around $2 million a facility. the timing of opening is a factor. and -- but i think we could see some improvement in that number. but in general, it's about $2 million per facility and should stay sort of in that $5 million to $10 million range.
john wilson ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
and how long does it generally take you to get to your average occupancy when you open up a new either wholly owned or jv? is there a difference in the jv and the wholly owned in terms of the -- i would assume the jvs ramp a little quicker because you'll probably transfer over some existing patients from the acute care hospital. but just how long does it take on those two cases to get to full occupancy?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. we do have a goal for a new facility of getting to breakeven from an earnings perspective by the end of the first year, getting all the way to the average occupancy for the company of a mature facility can be two to three years. and the joint ventures that we've opened have demonstrated a faster ramp in the occupancy compared to a de novo. so intend to be a little bit faster in getting to that occupancy. but it's a two to three-year ramp to get all the way to the company average.
john wilson ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
and i'm sorry if you mentioned this, but do i remember correctly that you own generally 80% of the jvs? is that right?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
it depends on the transaction. yes. sorry, john, it depends on the transaction, the contributions from both parties, that is a general target that we have and where we see a lot of our joint ventures. but we're very flexible in working through what's right for a specific transaction, and it can vary some around that level.
john wilson ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
that's thanks so much. thank you.

gretchen hommrich -- director, investor relations
good morning, and welcome to acadia's fourth quarter 2020 conference call. i'm gretchen hommrich, director of investor relations for acadia. i'll first provide you with our safe harbor before turning the call over to chief executive officer, debbie osteen. to the extent any non-gaap financial measure is discussed in today's call, you will also find a reconciliation of that measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated according to gaap on our website by viewing yesterday's news release under the investors link. this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including statements, among others, regarding acadia's expected quarterly and annual financial performance for 2021 and beyond. for this purpose, any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. without limiting the foregoing, the words believes, anticipates, plans, expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. you are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by the important factors, among others, set forth in acadia's filings with the securities and exchange commission and in the company's fourth quarter news release. and consequently, actual operations and results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. at this time, for opening remarks, i would like to turn the conference call over to chief executive officer, debbie osteen.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
good morning. and thank you for being with us today for our fourth quarter 2020 conference call. i'm here today with chief financial officer, david duckworth; and other members of our executive management team. david and i will provide some remarks about our financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year, and guidance for 2021. following david's comments, i will provide additional details on our strategy going forward. we will then open the line for your questions. we are very pleased with our solid financial and operating performance for the fourth quarter, capping off what was an extraordinary and challenging year for our company and the nation since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. before we get into the results, i want to thank all of acadia's dedicated employees and clinicians for their continued support and heroic work to provide the highest quality care to our patients and their families in a safe and accessible manner. as the global covid-19 pandemic continues to affect communities across the nation, we recognize our critical role as a leading provider of behavioral healthcare services. the ongoing uncertainties and economic and societal concerns, as well as the added fear and isolation caused by the pandemic, have resulted in heightened demand for our services, especially for those already struggling with mental health and substance use issues. as always, our primary mission is to support our patients and the communities we serve. we are fortunate to have an experienced team across our operations and a proven business model that supports our ability to meet this strong demand and execute our strategy in this dynamic environment. we're pleased to complete the sale of our u.k. operations to waterland private equity in january. this transaction represents a significant milestone for acadia, as it enables us to focus singularly on our u.s. operations, and we now have complete financial flexibility to pursue our strategic agenda. we are committed to our efforts to extend acadia's market reach and enhance our service offerings in the u.s., which will, in turn, maximize long-term value for our stockholders.
our u.s. operations delivered favorable results with improvement across all key metrics for the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by higher demand and operational improvement. u.s. same-facility revenue increased 7.6%, including a 3.6% increase in patient days and a 3.8% increase in revenue per patient day, reflecting robust demand for our services. throughout 2020, we continue to see measurable improvement in our cost management efforts that we implemented in 2019 and 2020, driving operation efficiencies. and in fact, we achieved our goal of $20 million in annual run rate savings by the end of 2020. we continue to employ disciplined cost management across our business to maintain our strong capital position. we remain committed to making strategic investments in our future growth in the u.s. by expanding our market reach through bed expansions and additional growth opportunities. despite challenges from covid, we added a total of 460 beds, which includes 220 beds through the opening of two new joint venture facilities as well as opening six ctcs in the u.s. we have extended our strong track record of partnering with health systems and hospitals across the country through joint ventures. in december, we opened ascension st. thomas behavioral health hospital, a new 76-bed inpatient facility through our joint venture with ascension st. thomas in nashville, tennessee. with the proceeds from our divestiture of the u.k. operations, we now have a balance sheet that will allow us to pursue additional investments to grow. we believe ample opportunities exist, which i will discuss in more detail at the end of this call. now i will turn the call over to david duckworth to discuss our financial results in more detail.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
thanks, debbie, and good morning. first of all, i'd like to point out that our u.k. business was reclassified to discontinued operations in our fourth quarter financial statements. references to continuing operations represent our u.s.-only business, while references to combined results include the u.k. business. revenue from our continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $541.3 million compared to $501.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2019, a growth rate of 8%. including discontinued operations, the results for the fourth quarter of 2020 reflect total consolidated revenue of $843.3 million. as debbie noted, we reached an agreement to sell the u.k. business at the end of 2020 and completed the transaction on january 19. the sale of the u.k. business resulted in a loss of $867.3 million, which is included in the loss from discontinued operations. results for the fourth quarter of 2020 include other income of $32.8 million related to the provider relief fund established by the cares act. the company's lost revenues and additional expenses incurred in the 12 months ended december 31, 2020 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic exceeded the grant income recognized in 2020. combined adjusted income attributable to acadia stockholders per diluted share was $1.13 for the fourth quarter of 2020. adjustments to income include transaction-related expenses, debt extinguishment costs, loss on impairment, loss on sale and the income tax effect of adjustments to income. acadia's combined adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $207.5 million. excluding income recognized from the cares act, combined adjusted ebitda was $174.6 million compared to $144.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. i would now like to provide an update on the u.k. sale proceeds and debt transactions. as of december 31, 2020, the company had $378.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, which excludes cash held by our u.k. operations. cash flows from continuing operations were $503 million for 2020. in early january 2021, the company voluntarily paid down $105 million of term b loans.
from the u.k. sale on january 19, the company received gross proceeds of $1.525 billion before deducting the settlement of foreign currency hedging liabilities of $85 million, cash retained by the buyer of approximately $75 million and transaction cost of approximately $16 million. these deductions resulted in net proceeds of approximately $1.350 billion. the company initially used the sales proceeds to repay all of its outstanding term a and term b loans of $1.08 billion and added cash to the balance sheet. on january 29, 2021, the company sent conditional notices of full redemption for our $650 million of 5.265% senior notes due 2023 and our $390 million of 6.5% senior notes due 2024. the redemption of this combined $1.04 billion of additional debt, along with breakage costs of only $6 million and estimated transaction costs of $9 million, is expected to be completed in early march and to be funded with cash from the balance sheet of $430 million and proceeds from a new senior secured credit facility of $625 million. the company expects to enter a new term loan and revolving line of credit facility as part of a five-year senior secured credit facility. upon completion of all of these transactions, acadia's debt structure is expected to include $1.025 billion of a senior secured credit facility, $450 million of 5.5% senior notes due in 2028 and $475 million of 5% senior notes due in 2029. these actions should result in the company's net leverage ratio being below three times, and we expect to maintain our leverage going forward in the range of three to four times. turning to our financial guidance. as noted in our press release, we are providing guidance for the year and the first quarter as follows: first, for the full year 2021, revenue in a range of $2.23 billion to $2.28 billion; adjusted ebitda in a range of $490 million to $520 million; adjusted earnings per diluted share in a range of $2.20 to $2.45; interest expense of approximately $80 million to $85 million, of which $11 million of interest expense is expected to be eliminated after the first quarter; a tax rate of approximately 26.5%; stock compensation of approximately $28 million; depreciation and amortization expense in a range of $105 million to $110 million; operating cash flows in a range of $250 million to $285 million; and total capital expenditures in a range of $285 million to $325 million, which includes approximately $45 million for maintenance capital expenditures. and for the first quarter of 2021, our guidance includes revenue in a range of $540 million to $550 million; adjusted ebitda in a range of $110 million to $115 million; and adjusted earnings per diluted share in a range of $0.40 to $0.45. as a reminder, this guidance does not include discontinued operations or the impact of any future acquisitions, divestitures or transaction-related expenses. acadia is in a strong financial position for 2021 and beyond as a result of the sale of the u.k. business, our cost management initiatives and our disciplined capital allocation. our first quarter and full year guidance represents management's confidence in the business, underpinned by the positive revenue and cost trends we are seeing in our u.s. operations. we will continue to make strategic investments in the business, while aligning our costs to meet the ongoing needs of our patients. we are confident in the essential nature of the services we provide, coupled with robust demand, will lead to growth through 2021 and beyond. i will now turn it back to debbie for additional details on our strategy going forward.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
i'd now like to spend a few minutes giving you our view of the business for the next five years. as we look to the years ahead, we believe acadia is well positioned to address the needs of those seeking treatment for mental health and substance use issues, and we expect that demand for our services will continue to increase. without question, 2020 was a very difficult year for many people and even more pronounced for those already struggling with mental health and substance use issues. based on a recent report by mckinsey, approximately 35 million americans are expected to experience behavioral health conditions post-pandemic. prior to the pandemic, there were approximately 20 million adults with a substance use disorder. research collected since the onset of the covid-19 pandemic last spring, has pointed to an increase in substance use related to stress, job loss, isolation and as a means to cope with other issues like anxiety and depression. studies also demonstrate that covid-19 is affecting the mental health of children and adolescents and that depression and anxiety are prevalent. elevated levels of mental health and substance use disorders are expected to remain, long after the covid-19 pandemic ends. therefore, we believe that there will be continued growth in demand for our services. we are also seeing higher demand as societal acceptance of behavioral health increases and coverage options for those seeking treatment expand and improve. we operate in a growing and fragmented industry. our four diversified service lines offer exceptional high levels of care for our patients. our expansive network of treatment facilities and options enable greater access to care, allowing us to serve the diverse needs of patients while maintaining a keen focus on the individual's needs. i'd like to give a brief overview of our service lines. acadia's acute business is our largest service line at 47% of u.s. revenue. this segment provides the highest level of care for patients who are a threat to themselves or others. we are very diversified within this service line, with 44 inpatient acute psychiatric facilities across 20 states and puerto rico and we see opportunities to further grow our share of this highly fragmented market.
turning to our second largest service line, our specialty business is focused on inpatient residential programs that treat patients who are suffering from either substance use or eating disorders. this area of treatment is highly specialized and acadia is further differentiated by our strong marketing platform and national clinical referral network. within this service line, we are positioned as an in-network provider for over 90% of our services. we also have a favorable payer mix, which includes 63% commercial revenue. specialty contributes 21% of our total u.s. revenue. next is our ctc or comprehensive treatment centers, which is an outpatient business, which combines behavioral therapy and medication to treat substance use disorders. in addition to the many challenges presented by covid-19, there are reports that the pandemic is also causing a resurgence in opioid use in the wake of widespread unemployment and isolation. with 131 clinics, we are the largest provider of medication-assisted treatment in the u.s. and our robust platform helps eliminate barriers to treatment. we continue to see opportunities to help individuals deal with their opioid misuse and as previously mentioned, we plan to open 11 new locations in 2021. additionally, we continue to see positive legislative support for our services and favorable reimbursement trends, including expanded funding of medicare and medicaid last year. our ctc business contributes approximately 17% of our u.s. revenue. lastly, our rtc business, also known as residential treatment centers, is our forward-service line in the u.s., representing approximately 14% of our u.s. revenue.
this service line provides longer-term residential treatment for children and adolescents with behavioral health disorders in a nonhospital setting. acadia's rtc business is differentiated by our unique, specialized programs, led by strong facility management teams and our relationships with state referring agencies. this business demonstrates consistent returns, and we will continue to look to grow through bed additions in our existing facilities. as we continue to deal with the challenges from the covid-19 pandemic and other societal and economic disruptions, we are focused on our strategic priorities that will ensure our business is positioned to deliver the highest quality of care for those who need treatment, both now and into the future. with our singular focus now on our u.s. operations and increased financial flexibility, we intend to make strategic investments in four distinct growth pathways: bed expansions; de novo facilities; partnering with health systems; and through strategic m&a. together, these growth pathways will provide additional opportunities for acadia to reach more patients in new and existing markets. we expect that our multiple pathways will provide a 10% ebitda growth rate over the next five years. i will now spend some time discussing in more detail these four strategic growth levers that will support sustained long-term growth across our service lines. first, we believe facility expansions provide us with the best return for our investment. to address the growing demand in our existing markets, we add beds to existing acadia facilities, which allows us to leverage the facility's existing cost structure and improve margins and profitability. as i mentioned, we added 240 beds to existing facilities in 2020 and plan to add approximately 300 beds this year to meet the ongoing demand in our current markets. after 2021, we believe that our existing facilities will have ongoing expansion opportunities and expect to add 300 to 350 beds to existing facilities, which is included in our assumptions of our 10% ebitda growth target.
our second pathway to growth is partnering with health systems across the country through joint venture agreements to build new facilities. this provides access to attractive markets that might otherwise be inaccessible through acquisitions. we also benefit from the partner hospitals' established market presence and favorable reputation in the community. and importantly, joint ventures enable us to integrate physical and mental health services to develop quality programs. through our partnership with covenant health, we expect to open a new 90-bed inpatient facility in knoxville later this year. we also announced a joint venture partnership with henry ford health system for a 192-bed inpatient facility, which will service the detroit metro area when it opens in late 2022. with a solid pipeline of approximately 30 projects in different stages, we expect 2022 to be the strongest year for joint ventures with our partners today, with four to five facilities expected to open. our third pathway is opening wholly owned de novos. there are many markets throughout the country that are still underserved with a shortage of available beds for behavioral health treatment. we believe there are as many as 100 markets in the u.s. with a significant need for inpatient psychiatric beds. this year, we expect to open one acute inpatient 80-bed facility in cincinnati, ohio. for years 2023 to 2025, we expect to open three to four new inpatient facilities, including jvs and wholly owned de novos. we also believe there is still tremendous unmet need for medication-assisted treatment in the 32 states we currently operate in. additionally, five states remain of interest for de novo targets.
we plan to open 11 ctc locations throughout the u.s. in 2021 and six to 10 ctc locations per year for years 2022 to 2025. the fourth pathway to growth is through m&a. we recently announced that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire vallejo behavioral, a 61-bed acute facility located in vallejo, california from adventist health. tuck-in acquisitions have been an important part of acadia's growth strategy, and we believe this facility will be a good addition to our portfolio. the fragmented behavioral healthcare industry provides ample opportunity for future acquisitions, and we are well positioned to capitalize on these opportunities, with our flexible balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation framework. future m&a would be incremental to our 10% ebitda growth target. our growth for each of these pathways is supported by our marketing platform, which has been and continues to be a strength for the company. we have a strong diversified referral base across all service lines and regions. we strive to eliminate barriers to treatment through prompt response times from initial outreach to admission. our marketing team has been and will continue to play an essential role by supporting our facilities and working to reach the many patients that need our services. another focus for us moving forward will be within the area of telehealth. during the second quarter of 2020, with the implementation of stay-at-home orders, we quickly expanded our telehealth capabilities to better reach and support our patients. we see telehealth as an opportunity to expand the continuum of care for our patients, both now and into the future. at the same time, we will be reinforcing our quality proposition. we believe increasing the utilization of our telehealth platforms will help broaden community outreach, assist with physician coverage, support increased opportunities for group therapy and encourage more timely assessment. we will continue to evaluate opportunities to grow in this area of our business within three major buckets: support for existing services, expansion of existing services and growth into new services. acadia is setting the standard for excellence in the treatment of behavioral health, and substance use concerns. we are intently focused on fostering high levels of quality and safety for all of our patients every day. our strong financial position will support our strategic focus on our u.s. operations and growth initiatives. across our operations, we will leverage our experienced clinical teams to deliver the highest quality of patient care, while also extending our market reach and advancing our market leadership, as a leading behavioral healthcare provider. this concludes our prepared remarks this morning. i will now ask cody to open the floor for your questions.

[operator instructions] we'll take our first question from frank morgan with rbc capital markets.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
good morning. first question on the strong same-store top-line growth. just curious, when i look at that looks like nice growth in patient days and part of that driven by about 2% growth in length of stay. so i'm just curious what's driving that increase. and then any color, any breakout on the 4.5% on the pricing side. and then second question is on just the margins and the sustainability there. obviously, you've had some really good cost initiatives in place, things like purchasing, but any other remaining areas of focus we should look for there even, including labor. thanks.

i'll take the first part of that frank. i think, when we look at our volume trends for the first quarter, our acute census is continues to be just very stable and strong. i think that what we were pleased with is that our specialty census, which had a slower ramp up during last year during the pandemic and also had a little bit of a slowness after the holidays, we started to see some very strong trends for specialty. i think that if we look at year-over-year growth both in february and march, we were very pleased with that growth in the specialty area. i think that what we're seeing there is that travel is starting to return to normal. i think that we've also seen an increase in our out-of-state admissions and our volumes there. we actually had the highest referrals from out of state, referrals that we've seen since january of 2020. we always had, i think, consistent performance even during the pandemic from our rtc and our ctc service lines, but those trends are also very strong and have continued, as i said in my remarks, into april. i think, david, if you want to add to that.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yeah. and frank, picking up on the revenue per day, we did see a strong revenue per day of 4.5% year-over-year growth here in the first quarter, that is a continuation of a strong trend that we have seen. we were above 3% in the second half of 2020. our team at the facility and the corporate and those that manage our payer relationships here at the corporate office are doing a great job on rate increases across our service lines and in q1 we're also seeing a strong payer mix. our commercial payer mix did increase slightly just under 30% for the quarter. that is a contributing factor to our revenue per day growth being at 4.5%. and part of that does relate to the specialty facilities and the volumes we saw there it at some are -- some of the higher revenue per day specialty facilities, where we're now seeing strong volumes as we exit the quarter that is a contributing factor to that strong revenue per day number for the quarter and that's a trend that we see continuing into april and continuing into the year.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
i'll just add, frank, on the margin, i think that we had very good cost management and i have to give the operations team just a lot of credit. they stayed very focused on that area. and i think we've been able to sustain the savings from our initiatives in -- that we identified in 2019. but we've also achieved other efficiencies and cost adjustments in 2020 that continued into 2021. we are looking for additional opportunities for savings. but as i just look at their efforts in the first quarter, our margin was -- had a very good impact from that cost management, but then also as david mentioned our strong revenue per day. so those two things combined, i think, helped us and that's why we saw the improvement in the margin. and we believe that we're in a strong position to carry those efforts forward and we believe that the margin can be sustained and we're hoping to improve it from where we are right now.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you very much.

we'll take our next question from kevin fischbeck with bank of america.
kevin fischbeck -- bank of america -- analyst
okay, great, thanks. i guess, i wanted to hear view on m&a, i guess, the couple of large transactions out there. love to hear your thoughts, you mentioned your balance sheet strength. where do you think you'd be willing to take the balance sheet for the right transaction going forward?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
we do see capacity with our balance sheet and our leverage being at 2.7 relative to a longer-term range that we're thinking up for our now u.s. only business to 3 to 4. we are not in a hurry to take the leverage to the high-end of that range, but do think for the right opportunity that that is the situation where we would be at the higher end of the range. but any m&a transactions that we evaluate, we're evaluating through our framework that we have established that we think will serve us well, thinking of the strategic fits and market the real estate, many other factors related the specific acquisition that we look at and of course financial returns and acadia specific factors. so we'll continue to look at m&a opportunities using the criteria and the framework we have. and for the right transaction, we would think about the right place to be within the leverage range. but we're certainly pleased that not -- we not only have that capacity, but we also have multiple options as we think about our growth and the four growth pathways that we talked about earlier, i think, m&a is part of that, but there are also other options and multiple ways that we think we will continue to see those growth opportunities.
kevin fischbeck -- bank of america -- analyst
okay. and then just i guess we think about the de novo growth, is there anything we should be thinking about or being prepared for, i guess, in the past sometimes when you open up a new facility it has start-up losses for some period of time. if you guys are doing more jv developments next year than you have in a long time, is there anything to think about from a margin perspective.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
we have talked about in the first year of operations for a new facility incurring losses that we estimate around $2 million. we have four facilities right now in various stages of that start-up process with two facilities opening in the second half of last year and two more that are opening at various points in time this year. so we do think that we can manage that number that should be a fairly consistent number. of course, if we think about next year, potentially higher number of new facilities. we could see just a greater overall number. it's just going to depend on the timing of those transactions. what we have seen though with the transactions we opened last year that, i think we have the facility that is -- has been fastest to breaking even. as we look back at the history of the company with the one that we opened in the third quarter last year being breakeven here in its third quarter of operations.
so, i think part of that is the team that we have just doing a fantastic job opening that new facility, but also just the benefit of having joint venture partner as we opened a new facility in certain markets, we're seeing a faster ramp than what we've seen in the past. so there is $2 million or so investment in those start-up losses. but at the same time, we are doing a great job getting those new facilities open and hope for a very successful year as we think about a greater number of those new facilities next year.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
and kevin, i'll just add to what david said, i think he mentioned the joint venture that we opened in the summer with tower. and i think what we've seen there is what we're seeing really across the company and that is strong demand. we had very solid pricing and good execution by the team on the ground to really get the facility open. we've just been very pleased. we are looking at opening even more services there in the next month or so. so, i think this is a growth pathway with integration as well as the de novos that we think, -- while there is the short-term impact, the long term of both of those strategies we feel are very positive for us and it -- there are a number of markets that we think are underserved in the de novo area in particular that we've identified and we think that we have a good pathway there as well as to the integrations.
kevin fischbeck -- bank of america -- analyst
all right, thanks.
operator
our next question from ralph giacobbe with citi.
ralph giocobbe -- citigroup -- analyst
thanks, good morning. debbie you mentioned, out of state refer -- debbie you had mentioned out of state referrals. i guess, are there incremental referral streams you're seeing as well? do you think you're just capturing greater share than maybe previously? and then any other strategies particularly as we think about sort of more usage of telehealth in the behavioral space from a referral standpoint?
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
well, ralph, i think if we think about the facilities, the specialty facilities, they pull from a wide range really across the country. and i think that during the pandemic, we did see those referrals were impacted, because in the -- for the most part unless it's close to the state where our services are, individuals do fly and travel in that manner. so as we are looking at it for the first quarter what we've seen is that there is more comfort in traveling. and so these referral sources have really been with us for a number of years. they very stable and steady. i think now, what we've seen is just we've been able to accommodate those referrals and they've been able to make their way to our facilities.
we do have programs that we've opened in several of our specialty facilities that are more specialized. so i do think we're getting in new patients as well as new referral sources that have a lot of cases ask us to provide those services. so, i do think there is additional referrals that are coming, but then we've seen a return of those that have been steady over a number of years and we have an excellent track record and reputation. so now that i think some of the pandemic and vaccinations are -- those are happening, i think we're going to continue to see our specialty census not only recover, but build from where we are right now and we've certainly seen that in april as well.
ralph giocobbe -- citigroup -- analyst
okay. and then little bit on the telehealth on terms of referral patterns and relationships with some of those providers.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
we have -- through telehealth we've really utilize that for our outpatient services. and during the pandemic, it was used to access our services. but i think that certainly through telehealth, it's really an access way for our patients to avail themselves of our services. so if we're in a rural area or even we are planning to try and expand telehealth in some of our acute and specialty service areas where if someone is coming from a distance, we can then extend that continuum and use telehealth as a way for them to continue their treatment with us. and i think that our referral sources during the pandemic and to some extent even as we're seeing that start to become less of an impact to us, our referral sources and our physicians for that matter are comfortable with telehealth.
they are using it. and i think that it just opens up a new area of opportunity for us. that's one of the positive things i think that occurred from the pandemic is. we are looking at support for our existing services. we are looking at ways to expand the existing services and that's connecting with not only referral sources, but our patients. and then also, we're looking at growth into new service areas and that might be linking with someone that is providing those telehealth services either a physician group or others that we might partner with.
ralph giocobbe -- citigroup -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then just quickly a follow-up. i want to go back to the cost management and just wondering if there is anything more that sort of call out there. i guess, i'm trying to reconcile is you put up 7% same-store revenue against 20% same-facility ebitda growth, right. so, obviously, you mentioned sort of balance of pricing as well as sort of the sustainability of margins. so just trying to reconcile and understand, i mean, do you need the pricing levels to sustain these margin levels or if there is a way to sort of frame the benefit of sort of the pricing drop through the margins relative to the sustainability of some of the cost initiatives? thanks.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
sure. we do think that virtually all of the margin improvement is related to the cost management initiatives and i know we've talked about those over the last two years. and all the tools that have been put in place to manage our cost, the cost savings initiatives that we talked about and implemented last year, we do see those as the primary drivers of where our margin was for the first quarter. and really a good way to think about that is if you look at the second half of 2020, we were 27%, 28% margin and that was sustained into the first quarter. we do see some seasonality in the first quarter related to payroll taxes and the calendar around the payroll taxes that has about a 1% impact on margin. so if you think about where we were trending in the second half of last year, that is being sustained into the first quarter with the exception of that seasonality. and so that's probably a more helpful way to think about the margin. and of course, on a year-over-year basis, it does reflect a higher level of margin growth because of some of those cost savings that were implemented throughout 2020.
ralph giocobbe -- citigroup -- analyst
got it. okay, thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question from a.j. rice with credit suisse.
a.j. rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, everybody. first, maybe just on the guidance raise, $10 million of both sides of the range, is that purely, just to confirm the q1 outperformance, i don't know where you were relative to our own expectations. i know you about $7 million ahead of consensus. and then the sequestration with the back half operationally in your view remaining unchanged. and is there anything about the first quarter outperformance that wouldn't continue into the rest of the year. is it just too early to maybe make a change in the outlook, but no thing -- nothing in the back half that somehow gotten a little worse.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
the main factors behind our increase in the guidance where the first quarter beat and it was around $7 million ahead of our expectations, as represented by the midpoint of our q1 guidance range, which was $110 million to $115 million. so there is around $7 million there. medicare sequestration and the extension through the end of the year is $3.5 million value to us. we have about 11% of our revenue is with medicare. there is another 5% or so that is with the managed medicare payer, but that sequestration is related to around 11% of our revenue and there is a $3.5 million value there from april to december.
the other -- there is no other changes in our guidance. i think our guidance as we entered the year already reflected, continuing strong trends in our volume and in our margin. and so with the trends we're seeing in april, part of our reaffirming and increasing our guidance is that we do see those trends that were part of our original guidance now continuing for the year as we are seeing in april. and a.j. there is nothing else that we saw in the first quarter or see in the year that we believe we need to call out. those are the primary drivers of our increase.
a.j. rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay, that's great. and let me just say on the follow-up. obviously, you've got the uptick in the jvs as you think about heading into next year. you're expressing openness on m&a tuck-in potentially larger deals too, i guess. what is the competitive landscape look like? it seems like some of the private equity guys that were competing with you for transactions may actually be now sellers. is the competitive landscape give a little better and maybe that's part of the reason we're seeing the uptick in jvs or is it about the same and has anything changed in the way you're seeing people pricing deals?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
it's hard for us to know exactly what the competitive landscape is and i know there may be private equity that are sellers, but there may also be buyers within the same space. and so there does seem to be acquisition opportunities right now, but it's hard for us to really have a view on either the competition for that or the pricing. we'll see. i don't think we have as many data points to look at just looking back on the last several years. so, we don't have a view right now really on either the competition or the pricing. we, of course, as we think about our own framework, feel like we have the right way to think about acquisitions, as well as other opportunities. and so we'll use that criteria as we evaluate opportunities and we'll see.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
and i'll just say a.j. i think that our diversity of service lines gives us multiple opportunities for certainly m&a, not just in our acute space and service line, but also the specialty and the ctc area. i do think that we're well-informed of the market. we, as david said, can't really speak about the competition there, but i think that as we look forward, we think there's going to be opportunity. there are, i believe, companies that may not have fared well through the pandemic. and if there is a way that we can look at those and they are attractive to us from a strategic and financial fit, we will pursue those. but we also want to, as david said, keep a disciplined approach with our balance sheet giving us really a lot of flexibility. and i think that's why we feel, that's going to be an important pathway. but we'll have to see how pricing looks and how it fits in our view of return on invested capital and other things that we are going to be disciplined about.
a.j. rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. thanks a lot.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
yes.
operator
we'll go to our next question from brian tanquilut with jefferies.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning guys, congratulations. i guess, just trying to go back to frank's question earlier. so debbie if i think about this, you're saying that you've seen some strength carrying over into april. so as i look at the admission trend from q1, i think it was up 80 basis points. and then the pickup in average length of stay and you've talked a lot about how specialty is pretty strong, is that the right way to think that these numbers should continue to firm up? and theoretically, that there is even further acceleration and kind of like the organic growth outlook for the back half of the year.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
i think, brian, that's a good way to look at it. i think that as we saw the quarter and the progression and then now we have visibility on april, i think that it's a good assumption that our trends are stronger and i think that we feel like there is no reason why those would not continue through the rest of the year with the demand and just again with the pandemic becoming less of an issue. still have a few markets where there are issues with the pandemic, but overall we feel good about just the progression. and also, as we just saw, march and april numbers, we think they're strong.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. and then obviously a lot of focus on big deals, but i think with your balance sheet being clean and focused now on the u.s.-only, how are you feel about the opportunity for tuck-ins, kind of like going back to the acadia of old where you're doing a few tuck-ins here and there every quarter?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
we do believe there will be tuck-in acquisition opportunities. we do like those opportunities. and we're excited about the one we talked about earlier in california. and so we continue to look for those and believe we will see more of those and they do present a very good opportunity for us and the benefit we can bring to that local hospital through the infrastructure and the all the initiatives that we've implemented make those acquisition opportunities more attractive.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
and i'll just say i think that one in particular vallejo with adventist health selling, we believe that we will have opportunity to add additional beds just based on what we see with their volume trends. but also we have other facilities in the area and we think they can work together to serve the patients and -- so it's got a strategic focus to it, but also a way for us to to grow over and above what we're purchasing at this point.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
awesome. thank you.
operator
we'll take our next question from pito chickering with deutsche bank.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
good morning. thanks for letting me ask some questions. can you help me understand the dynamics between same-store admissions and length of stay. when i look at the like us say increase, it was a primary driver of patient day growth. so the question is, if the growth like the stay is for managed care easing restrictions or is it increase in mix with specialty? and if managed care push back on length of stay again, do you think you can offset the pressure with increased admissions to keep the patient days growing in the 3% range?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
we do not view any of our metrics as relating to a change in what managed care is doing. it's been a pretty consistent process pre-pandemic and through the last year. we attribute our stats more to just the service mix that we see. we do see a pretty consistent length of stay, but we have to look at it by service line and by facility. and it can vary, but it tends to be within a range and we've seen that trend consistently within a range. and pito, as you ask about admissions, we are seeing a number of factors that impacted our admissions during the quarter and we talked about just coming off of the covid resurgence in the holidays and seeing a lower admissions, but then seeing a significant progression throughout the quarter in the admissions and in our patient day metrics. and so going forward, we do think that there may be a more similar relationship between admissions and patient days. but again, it can be impacted by the service mix that we see. but with what we saw in march, we are seeing nice admissions growth and we're seeing that into april.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
okay, great. and then to follow-up on ralph's question on the revenue per patient day growth, it sounds like this growth with mix of specialty and commercial mix is sustainable over 2021, as you mentioned that specialty continues to ramp sort of during march and april, shouldn't the revenue per day increase from these levels? and then on the margin side, if the revenue per day continues to increase because of the commercial mix and specialty wouldn't that provide of on margin leverage beyond what you're able to achieve in first quarter?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
we do think it will be a continuing factor as we move through the year. of course, in the second quarter, we will be comparing back to the quarter that saw the most impact from covid for the company last year. the second half of 2020, we saw very solid recovery in performance. so the comparison will be different in the second half of this year compared to the second quarter. but we do expect to continue to see that dynamic in our revenue per day and to see strong revenue per day trends, especially in the second quarter, where we did see a greater impact like i said, in 2020. so, yes, we do expect that trend to continue.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. thanks so much and great quarter guys.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer

we'll go to our next question from john ransom with raymond james.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, good morning. just to hit on labor for a minute, i'm curious kind of where your metrics stand now versus, say, the peak of the pandemic in terms of having to step shifts with steps, how many of your folks have been vaccinated turnover anything like that would be helpful. thanks.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
well, john, as i think you know we're located in 40 states. so we will have staffing challenges they're fairly isolated. i think overall, we've been able to accommodate the demand with our current staff. we've actually seen an improvement in agency from year-to-year and it's always been very low before that. i think as we look at our process here, we try and be proactive and that started and has -- was in place before the pandemic. so, our team is supporting the facilities. we have a team here, a recruiting team. we also have, i think, some very robust local efforts. and we have used over time when we need it. but we've also, i think, just generally been able to handle our patients that are coming to us and making sure we can offer services to them. we have i think some good initiatives around retention, which i think is very important. so we can recruit and we have some strong support there, but we also have, i think, some good focus around retention of our staff just generally across the company.
i think we are continuing to see our employees avail themselves of the vaccine. i think that we're trying to really be very supportive and with our education about the importance of the vaccine and certainly it varies by part of the country. but we're -- we feel good about our employees and their interest, but also we want to make sure we're educating them about the various vaccines. and also we have a partnership with walgreens where we are using them as a provider of the vaccine. and we also have health departments in many of our areas that have come to our facilities and provided it. so i think that's continuing to increase. and again we're just pleased that it's something that i think across the country is going to be certainly a positive for all of us, but also for just those that need our services and didn't feel comfortable before now that they are vaccinated will seek our services out.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
great. thanks so much.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer

operator
we'll go next to matt borsch with bmo capital markets.
matthew borsch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yes, hi. could you talk about how you're thinking about demands post-pandemic. i guess my question is, given the increase in instances of mental health issues during the pandemic, to what extent -- i know you can't really predict this entirely, but to what extent do you think those will be sustained versus sort of staging once things get back to quote unquote normal.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
well, i think there's two parts to this. and one is before the pandemic, one in five americans already had a diagnosed mental health conditions. so that was before the pandemic. and i think one of the positives that has occurred during the focus on pandemic, it's not just the public health crisis, but the mental health crisis, which you've just mentioned. but i think the other part is that people are more accepting of seeking treatment. so i think we have this need that was there before the pandemic, certainly some increase from just the stress and the isolation. but also i believe stigma has -- it's not totally reduce, but i think it's starting to reduce from the levels that i've seen over my career.
and i think that we're going to see more people being willing to seek heal and i think that is going to continue. and unfortunately, i do think that this is not a short-term issue, there is research from other pandemics that have shown that it really is a long-lasting effect. we are ready to offer our services for those that might have ptsd, healthcare workers. i can think of a lot of individuals certainly adolescence. there has been a lot of research about just the impact on children and adolescence with their middle health worsen. so if i think about it as where -- the demand trends in general, we started out with strong demand, it's now increased, but we also have more acceptance. and i think this pandemic is going to have long lasting effects.
matthew borsch -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
yeah, that makes sense. thank you.

gretchen hommrich -- director, investor relations
good morning, and welcome to acadia's firth quarter 2021 conference call. i'm gretchen hommrich, director of investor relations for acadia. i'll first provide you with our safe harbor before turning the call over to chief executive officer, debbie osteen. to the extent any non-gaap financial measure is discussed in today's call, you will also find a reconciliation of that measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated according to gaap on our website by viewing yesterday's news release under the investors link.
this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including statements, among others, regarding acadia's expected quarterly and annual financial performance for 2021 and beyond. for this purpose, any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. without limiting the foregoing the words believes, anticipates, plans, expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. you are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by the important factors, among others, set forth in acadia's filings with the securities and exchange commission and in the company's first quarter news release.
and consequently, actual operations and results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. at this time, for opening remarks, i would like to turn the conference call over to chief executive officer, debbie osteen.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer
good morning, and thank you for being with us today for our first quarter 2021 conference call. i'm here today with chief financial officer, david duckworth, and other members of our executive management team. david and i will provide some remarks about our financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2021 and guidance for 2021. following david's comments, we will open the line for your questions.
we are very pleased with our solid financial and operating performance for the first quarter, marking a strong start to 2021. these results demonstrate consistent and successful execution of our growth strategy as well as strong cost management in the face of the impact from the resurgence of covid and one less day in 2021 due to leap year in 2020. before we get into the results, i want to commend acadia's dedicated employees and clinicians across our operations, who have continued to meet this critical demand and provide the highest quality care in a safe and accessible manner. we have a proven operating model supported by an experienced team as well as the financial strength to support our ability to reach more patients who need our services.
for the first quarter of 2021, our u.s. operations produced very favorable results, driven by solid volumes and strong cost management. our same-facility revenue increased 7.4% compared with the first quarter of 2020, including a 2.7% increase in patient days and a 4.5% increase in revenue per patient day. acadia is well positioned to meet the needs of those seeking behavioral treatment with our diversified service lines all of which provide high levels of exceptional patient care.
in 2021 and beyond, we believe that there will be continued growth in demand for all these services. while we are beginning to see some relief from the pandemic with increased vaccinations and a less restrictive environment, elevated levels of mental health and substance use disorders are expected to remain long after the covid-19 pandemic ends. a recent study from kaiser finds that about half of adults continue to report negative mental health issues related to worry or stress from the pandemic and we are prepared to help these individuals get the treatment they need. we are also seeing higher demand and societal acceptance of behavioral health increases and coverage options for those seeking treatment expand and improve.
i would like to highlight a couple of trends in the quarter. overall, we continue to see strong demand in the first quarter and have seen the demand continue into april. while there was some resurgence of covid-19 that followed the holidays, as always, our facility management teams and clinicians did a great job in addressing this challenge by strictly adhering to safety protocols and processes and working in collaboration with local health departments. through consistent and open communication, we were able to operate effectively and meet the needs of our patients.
our specialty business, which focuses on inpatient residential programs, has been slower to rebound following the initial impact from the pandemic, but we were encouraged by the strong trends in this service line as the quarter progressed. as more people are willing to travel, vaccination rates increase and restrictions are lifted. we are seeing higher admissions in these facilities. on our fourth quarter 2020 call, we shared with investors our growth strategy going forward with our singular focus now on our u.s. operations. we identified four distinct growth pathways that we believe will provide additional opportunities for acadia to reach more patients in new and existing markets. i am pleased with our progress so far this year in each of these initiatives as we continue to make investments in key strategic areas that will support our long-term growth across our service lines.
first, facility expansions remain a primary focus of our growth strategy, and accordingly, we added 92 beds to our existing u.s. operations in the first quarter. as previously announced, we plan to add approximately 300 beds this year to meet the growing demand in our current markets. we also continued to identify underserved markets for behavioral health treatment, especially, for treatment of patients with opioid use disorder. as i noted earlier, in addition to the many challenges presented by covid-19, recent studies have shown that the pandemic has continued to affect mental health, including a resurgence in opioid use in the wake of widespread unemployment and isolation. new data also shows that more americans died of drug overdoses in the year leading up to september 2020, been any 12-month period since the opioid epidemic began. to address this critical and growing need, we opened two new ctcs in the first quarter of 2021. ctcs operate on an outpatient basis and combined behavioral therapy and medication to achieve long-term recovery from opioid use disorder. we continue to see opportunities to help more individuals struggling with addiction and we are on track to open 11 new ctcs in 2021.
second, following the end of the quarter, we executed on another priority for our continued growth by completing construction of a de novo facility glenwood behavioral health, an 80-bed hospital in cincinnati, ohio. this facility will provide inpatient psychiatric treatment for those who are struggling with the mental health or substance use disorder. we expect this facility to be fully operational during the second quarter of 2021. third, establishing joint venture partnerships with healthcare delivery systems across the country has been another important growth initiative for acadia. and we have been fortunate to partner with many leading providers in attractive markets.
in march, we were pleased to announce a joint venture with lutheran health network of indiana, one of indiana's premier integrated healthcare delivery systems. together, we plan to build a new 120 bed behavioral health hospital serving fort wayne and the surrounding counties. the new hospital slated to open in spring 2022, will provide a full continuum of inpatient and outpatient care services. we also announced a joint venture with geisinger health, one of pennsylvania's premier integrated healthcare systems. the new partnership will build two new 96 bed behavioral health facilities, providing comprehensive inpatient services in the central and northeastern regions of the stay.
the first facility is expected to open in 2022 and the second in 2023. both the lutheran health and geisinger health partnerships will leverage our combined expertise and resources with a shared commitment to provide quality care and achieved strong clinical outcomes. we will continue to pursue this important pathway of growth for acadia in the year ahead and beyond. with a solid pipeline of joint venture projects in different stages, we expect 2022 to be our strongest year for joint ventures with four to five facilities expected to open. finally, another important pathway to growth is through acquisitions. acquisitions have been an important part of acadia's growth strategy. and the fragmented behavioral healthcare industry provides ample opportunity for future acquisitions.
during the first quarter, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire vallejo behavioral, a 61 beds psychiatric hospital in vallejo, california from adventist health. we are excited to add this facility to our portfolio and we will continue to identify additional acquisitions that meet our criterias. we believe there are significant opportunities for growth for acadia as we continue to expand our market reach through bed expansions wholly owned de novo facilities, strategic joint ventures and acquisitions. importantly, our balance sheet is very strong with ample capital to pursue these growth initiatives and also continue to make strategic investments in our business.
now, i will turn the call over to david duckworth to discuss our financial results in more detail.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
thanks, debbie, and good morning. revenue from our continuing operations for the first quarter was $551.2 million compared with $509.2 million for the first quarter of 2020, a growth rate of 8.2%. net income attributable to acadia stockholders was $9.7 million or $0.11 per diluted share. adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to acadia stockholders per diluted share was $0.47 for the first quarter of 2021. adjusted income excludes income from discontinued operations as well as a $1.7 million tax benefit related to asu 2016-09 transaction related expenses, debt extinguishment costs and the income tax effect of these adjustments to income.
acadia's continuing operations adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2021 was $119.5 million compared with $96.7 million for the same period last year. same facility adjusted ebitda margin improved 280 basis points to 26.5%. in march 2021, the company completed its expected debt repayment and refinancing plans following the completion of the u.k. sale in january. we have strengthened our capital structure through the reduction in debt totaling $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2021 as well as the refinancing transactions completed in 2020 and in the first quarter this year.
with the completion of these transactions acadia's debt structure includes the new $1.025 billion revolving credit and term loan facilities, $450 million of 5.5% senior notes due 2028 and $475 million of 5% senior notes due 2029. the company's net leverage ratio was approximately 2.7 times as of march 31, 2021. cash at the end of the first quarter was $179 million and we have $160 million drawn on our new revolving line of credit of $600 million.
turning to our financial guidance, as noted in our press release, we have increased the previous financial guidance for 2021 as follows. revenue in a range of $2.240 billion to $2.290 billion, adjusted ebitda in a range of $500 million to $530 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share in a range of $2.30 to $2.55. with the completion of our debt refinancings in march, our interest expense for the remainder of 2021 is expected to be approximately $17 million per quarter. with our improved debt structure, our ongoing cost management initiatives and our disciplined capital allocation, we have a solid financial position to support our business. we will continue to make strategic investments in the business, while aligning our costs to meet the ongoing needs of our patients. we are confident that the essential nature of the services we provide supported by robust demand will lead to growth through 2021 and beyond.
with that, christina, we are ready to open the call for questions.

[operator instructions] and our first question will come from kevin fischbeck of bank of america. please go ahead.
kevin fischbeck -- bank of america -- analyst
great. thanks. just wanted to dig into labor cost. it seems like some of the providers have been signaling that labor is getting more and more difficult to source. some companies are talking about that as being getting factored to growth. just want to hear what your seeing and how you feel about the labor -- the pressure on growing or just margins going forward?
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer and director
well, kevin, i think, generally, we have seen a tight labor market, but i believe that we have done a very good job of managing through it. we have a very strong, consistent focus on recruiting and also retention. we're in many markets. we are in 40 states, and we do see, from time to time, isolated staffing challenges. i think that the team has done, as i said, a good job. they're very aggressive, and we've been very proactive in our approach. so our goal is to be competitive in our markets. we have very robust local efforts and focus.
and we also have a corporate team that supports the facilities. so they are recruiting and helping the facilities with some of the challenges that are there. we haven't seen a significant disruption or change in the cost of our staffing. our agency labor has been pretty consistent. it's around 2% of our total labor. so i think we're managing through it. i think it takes a lot of effort and focus. and again, i just have to commend the team because i think they've done a good job with just managing that and making sure that we're not limiting our growth.
kevin fischbeck -- bank of america -- analyst
all right. great. and i think you referenced earlier, certainly in the press release about a favorable reimbursement environment. i guess there was a high-profile press release by united going out-of-network. i just want to hear, i guess, your color on that, maybe specifically, but then more broadly speaking, what the reimbursement outlook looks like among commercial payers. thanks.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. kevin, we do have very long lasting, strong relationships across our diversified group of payers and including our commercial payers. the majority of our commercial, over 90% of our commercial revenue is in-network. and so we are pleased with that strategy and pleased with the relationships that we have, the referrals that we get across our commercial payers. we are aware of the announcement you are referring to, but do not believe that it has an impact on our company, given that we are mostly in-network with united.
and in fact, believe that with that strategy, we could see some benefit to our volumes because we do have most of our facilities in-network. so out-of-network for the company across our u.s. operations is about 2% of our revenue. and again, over 90% of our commercial revenue is in-network. so we think we're positioned well and any potential impact, not only could be limited, but also could provide some benefit in certain markets and certain facilities.
kevin fischbeck -- bank of america -- analyst
all right. great. thanks.

the next question comes from ralph giacobbe of citi. please go ahead.
ralph giacobbe -- citi -- analyst
great. thanks. good morning. debbie, in your prepared remarks, you talked about seeing more push for access for behavioral health. hoping you can give a little bit more context. is it employer, states? does it relate to payers? is it the telehealth influence? just trying to understand where that push for that incremental behavioral access is coming from. thanks.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer and director
well, ralph, i think when we think about access to our services, many of our patients, certainly that come to our inpatient facilities start usually in a lower level of care. and i think that there is a shortage of practitioners in many markets. so i think what we have seen through telehealth is in some of the outpatient companies is really trying to make sure that people that need our assistance for mental health and addiction can see a person, a professional that can help them diagnose what their needs are.
i do think that as we think about just going forward, we are really trying to make sure that people can reach us. we've done -- we have a crisis hotline that we have instituted last year during the pandemic, but there are other funding and sources for these hotlines and crisis centers where people can access and reach out. with the suicide rates that are climbing, i think it's even more important that people be able to get service at the right time and not have to wait in an er or other places.
so we're working with our partners on making sure that they can access our facilities. but then just generally, i think there's a real movement and funding around it, frankly, for access so that as this pandemic has unfolded and many individuals have needs, one of the studies i read recently, half of adults continue to report negative mental health impacts. so as we see this, they need to be able to access someone that can help them. and so we're a part of that, but i think it's happening really across the industry.
ralph giacobbe -- citi -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then it does seem like the joint venture efforts with hospitals and larger systems is accelerating. is the catalyst you think at this point, simply the covid pandemic or anything else that would be driving it? and maybe just give us a little bit more on the pipeline and how easy or difficult it is to integrate and operate sort of the jv relationship versus ma or de novo build, if you can help us with the economics there. thanks.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer and director
sure. i mean we thought that we would see less discussion during the pandemic, and in fact, we actually saw more. and i think that our potential partners wanted to keep the momentum going. they have really started, and i think these large health systems really want to see mental health and physical health put together. so this has started before the pandemic, but i do think it continued to be strong throughout 2020. we do have a robust pipeline, and we have projects that are in different stages.
we recently announced the bronson, which i mentioned in my remarks. we also plan to -- we have a groundbreaking actually later this week for a jv with lutheran health network in indiana. we just announced a partnership with geisinger to build two hospitals. so as we think about just our pipeline going forward, there's usually a competitive process. there are others that are seeking to partner. but we have been fortunate because i think our track record stands for itself, and we've been chosen as preferred partners with many health systems. we have signed several lois that we have not announced. we will do so when we have a definitive agreement.
and i think that what we have seen is that as we work together, we're able to enter a market with a strong partner. they have established reputation. and so together, as we build a facility, which is usually, in fact, always what happens, together with their relationships with payers and certainly, their referral pipeline, usually they're closing beds. and that's folded into the partnership. so it does give us an advantage if we're entering a market to do that with a partner. as far as just ramp-up and other things, it usually moves a little bit faster.
and i think that certainly, the payer relationships helps us with our price negotiations with payers. but we think we're very fortunate because i think that we have these 13 partnerships now. and they all check references when they make a decision, and we're fortunate that we have such a strong reputation. again, i give a lot of credit to those that are in the field working with these partners, and we really want to see that as a growth pathway that will continue for several years because we do have over 30 in the pipeline right now.

the next question comes from brian tanquilut of jefferies. please go ahead.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning, guys. congrats on a really strong quarter. david, i guess, i'll start with you. you mentioned something in your prepared remarks about cost efficiencies that you expect to carry over into q2. just wondering how are you thinking about that given the tight labor market? and i know you've managed through it pretty well. but also, as we think about kind of long-term margin targets from a same-store perspective, where should we be thinking about where that would land?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. brian, the operations team has done a fantastic job for several quarters now managing the volumes, and really seeing with the incremental volumes that we've seen, the opportunity to drive efficiencies and to leverage the cost structure that we have. and that is reflected in our margin. we are managing through, as debbie mentioned, a tight labor market, but it really shown that as we see the incremental volumes, we can manage through that labor market that we're going through right now.
and we have seen the sustained benefits of many of the cost savings programs that i know we've talked about for the last couple of years. so the team continues to do a good job, maintaining discipline really focused on using our data, our dashboards and just weekly visibility into costs at the facility level so that we're able to staff and see the volume growth that we see and also match our costs according to the volumes that we see. going forward, we do continue to add capacity. we're working on our pipelines across all of our growth pathways.
and part of that is adding beds to our existing facilities. we do think that, that additional capacity that we add will drive further margin improvement opportunities. the way we size that, brian, is that, that should add around 50 basis points of margin improvement to our same-facility group of facilities. we will continue, of course, to invest in new facilities, joint ventures and de novos. and so that's a start-up process, that's an investment. those are very attractive longer-term opportunities.
but outside of that same-facility group, where we expect to see the 50 basis points of margin improvement, we'll see some investment in that. but once those mature, we think those will be accretive to margins as well. so we think with the additional capacity that we plan to add, we'll continue to see that margin improvement opportunity.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
that's awesome. and then i guess, debbie, for you, there are a lot of -- there's a lot of chatter about some sizable assets that are out in the market right now. how are you thinking at this point about your view on m&a, picking large deals versus tuck-in transactions? and maybe just any insight you can share on the pipeline? thank you.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer and director
well, brian, we continue to see a fragmented market, which i mentioned in my remarks for behavioral. and i do think that there are a number of the smaller multi-facility systems and then certainly single-facility operators that present future opportunities for us. as we look at -- i mean, we don't comment on any specific transaction. but as we look at the m&a opportunities, we use a disciplined approach, and we are looking at the strategic fit as well as the financials.
so as we look at the strategic fit, what the synergies might be, whether we're going to be able to enter a new market. we also are looking at the financial component, which is return metrics for us, the irr, the return on invested capital. i think that we will see and we will have opportunities for m&a. we're going to stay disciplined, and we're going to make sure that it fits us. the good thing about acadia, which i think is good for long term, is we have a number of ways to grow, and we have a number of ways to grow organically.
but then i also think there will be opportunity. and i think that, fortunately, we're well informed of what's out there. and we do have an opportunity to evaluate. we do a very, i think, a thorough job of that. but also, i think that will be something that will be opportunity for us in the future with just what i see with even just the single facilities. and some have, frankly, not fared as well through what all of us have suffered through the pandemic. but i think that we have an experienced team here who knows what to look for, and we're going to stay disciplined as we do it.
brian tanquilut -- jefferies -- analyst
awesome. thank you, debbie.

the next question comes from a.j. rice of credit suisse. please go ahead.
a.j. rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, everybody. two questions, i guess. first on the -- i appreciate all the comments about how the dynamics have changed in the pandemic in terms of illnesses and behavioral concerns. i wonder, if you look at your patient population you're treating now, are the -- is the orientation of the services changed materially that you have certain services or diagnosis that are much more prevalent right now than maybe pre-pandemic? and i guess, does that have any implications for payer mix or other metrics that we should be aware of?
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer and director
well, a.j., i think that as we see patients coming into our facilities, certainly, they have to meet the medical necessity. so they are acute and they are individuals that need very specialized services. i think as we just think about the impact, we've seen multi-diagnosis for those that are needing treatment for substance use. and i think that, that is something we can see just from the overdose deaths and just the staggering, to me, statistic that was put out by the cdc that, that's a real area of need.
so we see that in our specialty facilities, also not just substance use but co-occurring, which are mental health issues that are a part of the patient's issue. we also have seen demand across our ctc and that stayed very steady last year, but it's continued into this year, and that's why we're opening the number of new ctc clinics. we do see individuals that are depressed and suicidal. that's one of the criteria, but that has actually risen during the pandemic. and i think, again, just our facilities have done a great job of being prepared.
it's really the patients that prior to the pandemic we were treating, but now in some of our locations, we are seeing more acuity. and i think that we've been asked by some of our payers to develop more -- even more specialized programs, which we've done. i think that's benefited the specialty service line. but really, the acute and specialty have both just been very strong demand. and again, i think that's going to continue.
a.j. rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
maybe the follow-up question would be around -- there's a lot of discussion in the marketplace about the use of telemedicine to address behavioral needs and so forth, the outpatient -- people looking at outpatient. how do you guys view that? do you view that as totally sort of a distinct silo from the things you're focused on? do you feel like over time, it's going to be important for you to be integrated with some of those initiatives? so how do you think about that?
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer and director
well, i think that's probably one of the positives that has come out of the pandemic is really just the regulatory environment around telehealth and also the payment environment. we do see it as part of what we do, and we are using it now. we use it in our facilities to support our existing services. we've also -- we are going to be expanding some of our specialty services across the country, and we're going to use that as a way for them to stay connected with our programs. we've found it to be an extension for us of coverage for physicians, which i think we -- when we have a physician shortage, oftentimes, we're forced to use locum.
and in this case, it is an alternative to locum coverage. i do think that telehealth will be a key part going forward. it's not going to replace our inpatient care. our patients need to be in a safe environment. and i think that we see it as just part of what we're doing. and we have a team, it's led by our chief medical officer, a.j., that they're looking for ways where we can integrate. but i do think we're going to be connected to some of the telehealth companies that have come up. we have seen a decline in this year of telehealth usage. last year, it was about 20%. and this year, it's about 10%. so there are individuals that prefer to have the face-to-face.
but there are also individuals that are in rural areas or those that really don't have access that want to use it. so i just think it's a positive for the industry. it's an extension of what we do, and we will be looking for ways we can use it even more. but right now, even on the ctc, we're using it for our counseling and therapy, and it's been something that patients have asked for and we're providing. and so i do think it's here to stay. it will be interesting to see what the regulatory environment ends up being. i know payers are looking at what's appropriate, what they're going to pay for, how they're going to pay for it, how the delivery should be done, and we're watching that very closely to see how that ends up. and advocating for it, frankly, because it's a way to extend access.
a.j. rice -- credit suisse -- analyst
okay. great. thanks a lot.

the next question comes from pito chickering of deutsche bank. please go ahead.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions. just a couple from me at this point. can you talk about the revenue per day a little more? can you break that into commercial pricing increases versus mix? what's the biggest driver there? and talk about the collaboration between you and your payers on specialty? and how we should think about revenue per day increasing over the next couple days five years?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. pito, we were pleased to see the strong revenue per day trends continue. we had revenue per day this quarter of $816, and we saw something very similar in our first quarter. the key drivers for that are rate increases across all of our payers, which we did meet our expected range of 2% to 3%. and we're also seeing a favorable payer mix where commercial has grown slightly.
as a percentage of our revenue, it's typically just under 30%. in this quarter, it was just over 30%, close to 31% of our u.s. revenue. and that commercial mix really does reflect the strong relationships we have across our commercial payers and also the performance of our specialty facilities, which is where we see a higher level of commercial volumes.
so we do believe we are positioned well from a service offering perspective in our specialty facilities and also with the long-term relationships that we have and expect to continue to have with our commercial payers. there is a component of our revenue per day growth this quarter that is a challenging comp to last year. we did see a different service mix in the second quarter of 2020, with acute and specialty being temporarily lower on patient volumes. and therefore, rtc mix was a little bit higher. so that's part of our 7.5% revenue per day growth this quarter.
but as we look ahead, we think where we are right now, the $816 is a very strong metric. we do expect that to continue into this year, and that will continue to provide revenue per day growth, probably more in the 2% to 3% range given that a component of this quarter is the comparison to last year. but we do think a lot of the trends that we see and the revenue per day that we see will continue moving forward.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer and director
and pito, we have a -- it's a focus around our payers and making sure that we're demonstrating our outcomes. and also making sure that we are providing, and david mentioned it, more specialty services for them. and as we do that, we are seeing the ability to have higher rates because we're able to demonstrate that we have the outcomes that go with it. our out-of-state has also added to that during this quarter. so as we bring patients from out-of-state to our highly specialized programs, they do tend to be a higher commercial mix, and we expect that to continue as we go forward.
pito chickering -- deutsche bank -- analyst
great. and then a few quick follow-ups, and i'll ask them all upfront to save time. any more details on sort of what you're seeing on the delta variant in july? can you talk about sort of seasonality in the back half of the year, what we should think about for 3q and 4q? and then on the labor side, if you look at behavioral technicians versus nurses, do you see any more or less pressure on one type of employee versus the other? thanks so much.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer and director
well, i'll take the first part of that. we have seen a slight uptick in the number of covid patients in a few facilities. we haven't seen a significant increase at this point, and it hasn't had an impact on volumes or our staffing. i do think that if we do see another way, then it's certainly -- there's a lot of discussion about how this is going to impact everyone. we feel that we're well prepared with our robust procedures. we're staying in communication with our facilities, making sure they're ready.
we have maintained, i think, all of our ppe supplies as well as just our protocols as -- even as we saw covid start to decline. but i think most important, which i want to emphasize is we plan to treat our patients as they come to us, we want to ensure they still have access to care. so we're ready. if we do see covid and the delta variant, and i think we feel good about our procedures that they're really in the heights of the pandemic, we were able to manage. so that is something we're watching closely, but we're prepared for it. david, i'll let you...
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
pito, on seasonality, we do expect the third quarter to be very similar to the second quarter. and so there's not a lot that's seasonal and it has a significant impact, at least, from the second quarter to the third quarter. in the fourth quarter, we typically do see some holiday seasonality in certain service lines around our census. we typically would size that as having about $3 million to $5 million impact in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, and that's around where it's been in the past. so the third quarter might be a little bit stronger than the fourth quarter. but we do think the trends will continue.
and the only seasonality we would really highlight would just be right at the end of the year around our service line census. on your labor question, we wouldn't highlight any specific group of employees. it does depend some on the service line. certain service lines are more reliant on nurses as compared to other clinical employees where specialty, there would be more therapists and in our rtc business would be more of the mental health techs and not as many of the nurses.
but it does depend on the market, and it's a very market-specific approach. and as debbie mentioned, we're focused on recruiting resources at the local level and the corporate level to make sure that we're able to staff our facilities. and it can depend on the market, but i think we're focused on all of our clinical groups of employees, nurses and the techs.

john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
good morning. david, if we look at 2021, how much do you think the ctc business factors in as a percent of your same-store revenue growth?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
john, i think for this particular quarter, acute and specialty were the service lines that were really the strong contributors to our growth. and part of that is just seeing very strong current year trends. and part of that is seeing -- those are the two service lines last year that had a temporary impact and the decline in their census. ctc last year did stay very stable. and so i would say ctc revenue growth is more in our typical range, strong single-digit type growth for the ctc business, where acute and specialty, because of the comp and because of some strong census trends this year, are leading among our four service lines.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
great. and just kind of looking over the next five years, i know you guys have not have to or made the migration from paper medical records to electronic medical records. is that something that you think is in your future? and if so, do you have any kind of idea what sort of capital investment that might look like?
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
yes. john, we do actually have certain facilities that do have an electronic health record system. we are implementing that and focused on many of our acute facilities. that's where we do have some within our existing portfolio of facilities. we do have a plan, and it begins later this year to begin investing more in those implementations, and again, are focused on any of our acute facilities and many of our joint venture facilities that we bring online. we'll have some type of ehr system. so the capital that we're expecting, of course, it depends on the system that you use. i think we have a good plan to improve our systems and make that transition with a partner that will be a slightly lower cost than many of the investments that i know we've evaluated in the past. so we're excited. we'll have more to share on that probably as we move into next year, but we are beginning to work on that transition.
john ransom -- raymond james -- analyst
can you say at this point who your vendor is for that project?

the next question comes from frank morgan of rbc capital markets. please go ahead.
frank morgan -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
good morning. i know a lot of discussion has been around commercial pricing. but just curious, if you could give us an update on the state reimbursement side, the kind of updates you're seeing any kind of supplemental payments that you may be getting or expect to continue to get? and -- or any changes you expect to see there? thanks.

yes. the state level reimbursement, we, of course, do have a significant portion of our revenue that is medicaid and that's across 40 different states that we're in. so we are very diversified within our medicaid revenue. and of course, most of that at this point in our acute service line, i think over 80% of our acute medicaid revenue is with a managed medicaid payer. so we continue to see at the state level, very positive coverage trends.
of course, we've talked about that with our ctc business really improving across our states, but the coverage for behavioral health continues to be very strong at the state level. we have not seen any rate decreases within our medicaid payers. and continue to expect to see 1% to 3% is how we think about medicaid going forward, but many states could be stronger than that really depends on what the historical rate increases have looked like within each state and within each payer. so it continues to be a very stable, very good payer for us. and continue to see that be very diversified across our states.

okay. maybe one last one. back to the sequential guidance for the -- or comments for the third and the fourth quarter. i know third quarter has always been a tough one. so i guess what level of confidence do you have this year, say, versus past years where it seems like third quarter has always been sort of a not as predictable? thanks.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
well, we did -- this is our first third quarter in a number of years without the u.k. business, and i do know that the summer and in particular, august, was interesting in the u.k. with vacation seasons and some other dynamics in the third quarter. so we do think, as we mentioned earlier, the third quarter should look a lot like the second quarter.
and that, in most years, has been the case in our u.s. business. we have seen july numbers. we're here in early august, so we've seen july, and we're very pleased with the trends that we saw throughout the second quarter continuing into july. and so there's nothing that we would highlight for the third quarter, no reasons we have to think that it should be any different than the second quarter. and have a lot of confidence in the guidance revision that we provided.

thank you, andrea. while we continue to manage the pandemic, the mental health crisis is not over. this pandemic has been a period of tremendous challenges, loss and stress. at the same time, it has brought greater awareness to issues that had not received the prominence they deserve. there is a growing awareness of mental health and substance use disorders across our country.
acadia will continue to be a voice for equity in mental health and strong advocates for patients to receive the right care in the right setting and at the right time. we remain ready across our 229 facilities in 40 states to ensure access to high-quality care for those that need our help. i want to thank you again for being with us today and for your interest in acadia healthcare. if you have additional questions today, please do not hesitate to contact us directly. have a good day.

good morning, and welcome to the acadia healthcare second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, this event is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to gretchen hommrich, director of investor relations. please go ahead.
gretchen hommrich -- director of investor relations
good morning, and welcome to acadia's second quarter 2021 conference call. i'm gretchen hommrich, director of investor relations for acadia. i'll first provide you with our safe harbor before turning the call over to chief executive officer, debra osteen. to the extent any non-gaap financial measure is discussed in today's call, you will find a reconciliation of that measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated according to gaap on our website by viewing yesterday's news release under the investors link.
this conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including statements, among others, regarding acadia's expected quarterly and annual financial performance for 2021 and beyond. for this purpose, any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. without limiting the foregoing the words, believes, anticipates, plans, expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
you are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by the important factors, among others, set forth in acadia's filings with the securities and exchange commission and in the company's second quarter news release. and consequently, actual operations and results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
at this time, for opening remarks, i would like to turn the conference call over to chief executive officer, debra osteen.
debra k. osteen -- chief executive officer and director
good morning. and thank you for being with us today for our second quarter 2021 conference call. i'm here today with chief financial officer, david duckworth, and other members of our executive management team. david and i will provide some remarks about our financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2021 and our increased guidance for 2021. following david's comments, we will open the line for your questions. we are very pleased with the momentum in our business for the second quarter as acadia delivered a solid financial and operating performance.
these results reflect increased demand for our behavioral health services and our continued focus on delivering efficiencies across our operations. we experienced favorable volume trends while providing exceptional patient care across all of our service lines. before we get into the results, i want to commend acadia's dedicated employees and clinicians across our operations who've continued to meet this critical demand for our services and provide high-quality care in a safe and accessible manner. we have a proven operating model, supported by an experienced team as well as the financial strength to support our ability to reach more patients who need our services.
for the second quarter of 2021, our facilities produced strong results. our same-facility revenue increased 18% compared with the second quarter of 2020, including a 9.8% increase in patient days and a 7.5% increase in revenue per patient day. as a reminder of the impact from the covid pandemic and related restrictions, we experienced lower patient days in the second quarter of last year. same-facility patient days decreased 6.7% in april of 2020 as compared to 2019, reversed to an increase of 0.1% in may and in june, surpassed our pre-covid volumes and increased 4.7%. when adjusted for the approximate 5% volume impact from covid last year, patient days increased approximately 4.8% for the second quarter of this year.
we are pleased to see these solid volume trends. leveraging the strength of our diversified service lines, acadia is well positioned to meet the needs of those seeking behavioral treatment, and we expect to see continued growth in demand. the stress and anxiety related to the pandemic had a profound effect on many individuals, especially those already struggling with mental health issues and substance use disorders. a kaiser study in march 2021 found that about half of adults continue to report negative mental health impacts related to worry or stress from the pandemic, which compares to about the same percentage at the height of the pandemic in july 2020.
we believe we are also seeing higher demand and societal acceptance of behavioral health increases with a greater push for access to treatment and expanded coverage options for those who seek treatment. on our previous investor calls, we have shared acadia's growth strategy that is centered around four distinct pathways that we believe will provide additional opportunities for acadia to reach more patients in new and existing markets. i'm pleased with the progress that we continue to make as we drive organic growth and make strategic investments designed to support our long-term growth across our service lines.
facility expansions remain a primary focus of our growth strategy and the best return on investment. we added 86 beds to our operations in the second quarter, which included 72 incremental beds from the opening of a 260-bed state-of-the-art replacement hospital for belmont behavioral hospital in philadelphia. we expect to meet our goal to add approximately 300 beds this year to meet the growing demand. we also continued to identify underserved markets for behavioral health and substance use treatment, including treatment of patients suffering with opioid use disorder.
preliminary data from the cdc indicates that drug overdose deaths increased nearly 30% in 2020 as a result of social isolation, trauma and job losses from the pandemic and the spread of fentanyl mixed in illicit drugs. to address this critical and growing need, we opened one ctc in the second quarter of 2021, following two new ctcs opened in the first quarter. ctcs operate on an outpatient basis and combined behavioral therapy and medication to achieve long-term recovery from opioid use disorder. we continue to see opportunities to help more individuals struggling with addiction, and we expect to open eight more ctcs in the second half of 2021. another important growth opportunity for acadia is the development of wholly owned de novo facilities in markets with a shortage of beds for behavioral health treatment.
on may 24, we opened glenwood behavioral health, an 80-bed hospital in cincinnati, ohio. this facility provides inpatient psychiatric treatment for those who are struggling with the mental health or a co-occurring substance use disorder. as mental health issues have gained more national attention, health systems across the country are looking for ways to integrate behavioral health and expand treatment options. acadia has developed a favorable reputation as a preferred partner for many leading providers in attractive markets. we recently announced a joint venture with bronson healthcare, one of michigan's leading integrated healthcare systems, to build a new 96-bed facility in battle creek, michigan.
with this addition, we now have 13 joint venture partnerships in place with premier health systems to expand our treatment network and improve access to care in more communities around the country. joint venture partnerships such as bronson provide an opportunity to leverage our combined expertise and resources with a shared commitment to provide quality care and achieve strong clinical outcomes. we will continue to pursue this important pathway of growth for acadia in the year ahead and beyond. finally, we also believe that the fragmented behavioral healthcare industry offers additional prospects for future acquisitions, and we are well positioned with sufficient capital to pursue these opportunities.
we believe acadia has the right strategy in place to expand our network through bed expansions, wholly owned de novo facilities, strategic joint ventures and acquisitions. we are encouraged by the favorable trends in our business and believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the expected growth in demand for behavioral health services. as always, our primary mission is to meet this demand and support the patients and communities we serve. we will continue to focus on providing the highest quality of patient care while extending our market reach and advancing our position as a leading behavioral healthcare provider.
now i will turn the call over to david duckworth to discuss our financial results in more detail.
david duckworth -- chief financial officer
thanks, debbie, and good morning. revenue for the second quarter was $582.2 million compared with $491.5 million for the second quarter of 2020, a growth rate of 18.5%. for the second quarter of 2021, net income attributable to acadia stockholders was $44.5 million or $0.49 per diluted share and adjusted income attributable to acadia stockholders per diluted share was $0.71. for the current and prior year periods presented in our earnings release, adjusted income excludes transaction-related expenses, debt extinguishment costs, loss on impairment and the income tax effect of these adjustments to income. acadia's adjusted ebitda for the second quarter of 2021 increased 25% to $141.3 million compared with $112.8 million for the same period last year. same-facility adjusted ebitda margin improved 180 basis points to 29.3%.
during the second quarter of 2021, the company received $24 million of additional provider relief funds under the cares act. these funds have not been recognized in the second quarter or included in our 2021 guidance. we are evaluating the guidelines to determine whether any of the funds will be recognized or will be returned. during the second quarter, we repaid $41 million of debt, including $35 million on our $600 million revolving credit facility, reducing the outstanding revolver balance to $125 million at june 30, 2021. the company's net leverage ratio was approximately 2.4 times as of june 30, 2021, and cash at the end of the second quarter was $185.5 million. as noted in our press release, we have revised our full year expectations due to our strong operating and financial performance for the first half of this year and our outlook for the second half of the year. we have increased our 2021 financial guidance as follows: revenue now in a range of $2.280 billion to $2.320 billion; adjusted ebitda now in a range of $530 million to $550 million; adjusted earnings per diluted share now in a range of $2.50 and to $2.70; and operating cash flows now in a range of $275 million to $310 million.
our guidance for 2021 reflects our expectation that the recent trends in patient volume and pricing and the focus on cost efficiencies and discipline will continue in the second half of the year. as a reminder, this guidance does not include discontinued operations or the impact of any future acquisitions, divestitures or transaction-related expenses.
with that, andrea, we are ready to open the call for questions.
