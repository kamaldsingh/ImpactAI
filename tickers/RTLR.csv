ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the rattler midstream first quarter 2020 conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, mr. adam lawlis, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
adam lawlis -- vice president of investor relations
thank you. good morning, and welcome to rattler midstream's first quarter 2020 conference call. during our call today, we'll reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on rattler's website. representing rattler today are travis stice, ceo; and kaes van't hof, president.
during this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. we caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the sec.
in addition, we will make reference to certain non-gaap measures. the reconciliation to the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon.
i'll now turn the call over to travis stice.
travis stice -- chief executive office
thank you, adam. welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to rattler midstream's earnings conference call covering results for the first quarter 2020. before we get started, i would like to take a minute to extend our thoughts and prayers to all those affected by the covid-19 pandemic. the challenges presented so far in 2020 are unprecedented, but our perseverance is evident in the decisive actions we have taken to preserve our strength through this cycle.
turning to results. rattler's first quarter continued the previous trend of increasing volumes, earnings and cash flow since rattler's ipo less than a year ago. produced water volumes and gas gathering volumes were particularly strong in the first quarter, up 5% and 13% over the previous quarter, respectively, while oil gathering and sourced water volumes were down 1% and 7% over q4 2019 due to the effect of diamondback reducing completion activity in march.
first quarter financial results reflected the strong operational performance in the quarter as rattler grew net income 6% quarter-over-quarter to $55 million, and adjusted ebitda grew to over 14% quarter-over-quarter to $81 million in the first quarter. the company continued to build out our various systems, spending $52 million on midstream capital expenditures in the quarter, and contributing $33 million to equity method joint ventures. both the gray oak and epic crude pipelines begin full commercial service in april and will contribute meaningful -- meaningfully to the cash flow and adjusted ebitda going forward.
three of our five equity investments are now operational with the wink to webster pipeline expected to come online in the first half of 2021. to conserve capital, we have delayed our amarillo rattler gathering and processing joint venture to late 2021 based on the current outlook.
rattler is focused on capital and cost control across the board as evidenced by our immediate reduction to operated capex spend when diamondback pulled back its activity levels in march. we will continue to drive down operating costs and preserve capital wherever possible.
although the forward outlook has weakened, we are very confident in the resiliency of the rattler business model. therefore, we announced a $0.29 per unit distribution for the first quarter, which is flat from the previous quarter and in line with previous and current guidance for 2020. the board intends to review the distribution policy each quarter, but with peer-leading leverage, a core business that is expected to be free cash flow positive, and differentiated visibility into diamondback's future activity, rattler is well positioned to maintain its current distribution policy.
looking forward to the rest of the year, we are reiterating our previously announced guidance of adjusted ebitda for march, which at the midpoint implies growth of 6% year-over-year even in a depressed commodity price environment. furthermore, operated midstream capex guidance at the midpoint implies a decline of approximately 50% from 2019. across our organization and our partners, we are evaluating ways to conserve capital as evidenced by the reduced equity method contribution guidance for 2020, which is roughly 20% down from the previous guidance. most importantly, the net effect of our updated 2020 guidance shows the resiliency of rattler's free cash flow profile as the decline in system volumes and ebitda is more than offset by declines in operated midstream capex and contributions to equity method investments.
in conclusion, i want to emphasize that rattler was set up to be a sustainable self-funding business to combat the inherent volatility in our business. while diversification of customers is often seen as a benefit in the midstream space, we view rattler's concentration with diamondback as a clear positive. diamondback's cost structure with low interest expense, low leverage, industry-leading low cash g&a, a full hedge book, strong midstream contracts and minimal ownership through vital energy partners has prepared it to operate in a lower for longer oil price environment.
with these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] jeremy, your line is open.
james kirby -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, guys. this is james [phonetic] on for jeremy. i just wanted to start kind of a high-level question, just looking at the jv portfolio. how are you -- maybe if you can go just one by one, in terms of the capital spend you expect this year. and then also just focusing more on exiting gray oak. how you see those pipes progressing through the 2q here?
kaes van't hof -- president
yes. so in this case, i'll go through them one by one. the epic and the gray oak pipeline started up in april in full service. we have some small payments left to make on both of those, but not a meaningful number. so we should start seeing some ebitda contribution and most likely some distributions from one or both of those pipelines this year. we've already received a distribution from gray oak. so we certainly expect that to continue onward. our reliance jv, the omog jv with oryx, we've already received a distribution out of that business and have cut capital at that business. so you're going to expect to see some free cash flow and returns up to the rapid level throughout the year.
and then wink to webster, which is our third pipeline commitment, still on track. and we spent about half the capital required for that pipeline to date. and we look forward to that pipeline coming on in the first half of the year of 2021. and lastly, our amarillo rattler gas gathering and processing jv, we've delayed all major capital spend there until at least the back half of 2021, if not the first half of 2020. so certainly put a lot of dollars to work here, and we look forward to receiving some cash back from these investments.
james kirby -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it, thanks, and then just one more for me. i'm looking at the slides. on slide 11, you guys talk about the kind of the savings initiatives with opex. maybe if you could just provide any incremental color on, i guess the surface royalties there. maybe i'm just trying to better understand kind of what the savings are.
kaes van't hof -- president
yes. it's going to be tough to get major savings on surface royalties. it just depends on that particular area and the lease and what the lease says. in some cases, you are required to buy on lease water and in some cases, the opposite is true. so there's certainly going to be some optimization that we can do. you could if you're buying water at $0.30 a barrel from one section, but two sections over, it's $0.10 a barrel, makes sense to buy from the cheaper section. so now that everything's slowed down a little bit on the optimization front, we're certainly looking to buy cheaper water and also dispose water on leases or acreage that has a lower disposal rate. so i can't quantify the savings there. there's certainly going to be some optimization, but i think the real savings is going to be on the true opex side of the equation where our service partners had reduced costs by anywhere from 15% to 25% across the board.
james kirby -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. thanks. appreciate it.
kaes van't hof -- president
thank you.

your next question comes from the line of jeff grampp with northland.
jeff grampp -- northland -- analyst
good morning, guys.
kaes van't hof -- president
hey, jeff.
jeff grampp -- northland -- analyst
just sticking on slide 11 here. kaes, i think you mentioned -- i guess, first i wanted to clarify our last comment, did you say kind of a 15% to 20% type of reduction is what you guys were targeting? and then could you clarify if any of that's kind of baked into the existing guidance you guys have put out?
kaes van't hof -- president
yes, jeff, and it's hard for us to bake in forward-looking costs reductions, similar to the diamondback side, we just like to give you what we're seeing. i think we need to see this prove out in the numbers in q2 and q3. but certainly, across the board, all costs are on the table. so you have seen some reductions to date, particularly on the true service side of the equation, and we'll see it run through. and if it results in significantly higher margins, we'll update guidance accordingly.
jeff grampp -- northland -- analyst
got it. understood. and then for my follow-up, on the distribution, you guys kind of reiterated expectations to maintain that through the rest of the year. just kind of curious, i guess, the sensitivity of that. and maybe if you look at the downside, to the extent, prices don't firm up or maybe they get weaker through the year, presumably diamondback, make some economic decisions to maybe cut some capital and/or production. how comfortable in that type of environment are you guys maybe relying on the balance sheet to maintain the distribution? and maybe in general, what's kind of a general level where you may rethink things on the distribution side?
travis stice -- chief executive office
yes. jeff, i tried to outline in my prepared remarks that the board intends to review that distribution policy every quarter. and if you look at just the macro view of it, rattler has peer-leading leverage and a core business that's turned into free cash flow positive. so the future is hard to predict, but i can tell you right now that this is just what the board has committed to is continue to evaluate how we're going to address the dividend or the distribution. but right now, we're proud to post the dividend for this quarter.
kaes van't hof -- president
yes, i think it goes across the board at all three companies, jeff, that we're going to analyze each distribution or return of capital every quarter. based on the forward outlook today, which assumes some sort of return to work in the back half of the year, we're confident in the distribution today.
travis stice -- chief executive office
and i'll tell you, jeff, just again, that relationship that rattler has with diamondback, we have more visibility into diamondback's future activity than any relationship between midstream -- with the midstream company. and so we'll utilize that as we try to understand how we're going to navigate the future. but that insight, that visibility is truly differential for the rattler unit holders.
jeff grampp -- northland -- analyst
yes, i thoroughly agreed. i appreciate the comments, guys. thank you.
travis stice -- chief executive office
thank you, jeff.

your next question comes from the line of spiro dounis with credit suisse.
spiro dounis -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, guys, can you hear me?
travis stice -- chief executive office
yeah.
spiro dounis -- credit suisse -- analyst
good morning. first question just on the volume guidance and focusing on salt water specifically here. it looks like guidance implies about a 13% volume step down for the rest of the year. imagine that's heavily weighted to 2q and 3q. but i guess, anecdotally, we're hearing about 15% to 20% exit rates or declines in the permian. and so it seems like you guys obviously plan on outperforming that. is that -- just maybe help us just reconcile that? is that a water dynamic? is that county specific, maybe science specific? any help there?
kaes van't hof -- president
yes, spiro. i really can only talk to diamondback aginst rattler [phonetic], it has one main customer. and diamondback's released an exit rate oil guidance of 170,000 to 180,000 barrels of oil per day versus q1 at a little over $2.01. so that's at the midpoint, a little less than 15% reduction. so that kind of ties to the rattler numbers we're projecting. i think overall, on the disposal business, q2 will be the weakest, q3 will be flattish to that with a bit of a rebound and q4 should return to activity levels.
spiro dounis -- credit suisse -- analyst
perfect. that's helpful. and then just thinking about capex here, you could say you all staying lean. but to the extent -- commences activity again late in 2020, i guess, is that already predicated in the guidance? or could we see it adjusted higher? and then as we think about next year, what's a good base level of capex to use if we go into something like a maintenance mode? i think your guidance for the rest of 2020 implies about $25 million a quarter, but it feels like that could be ratcheted down if we're truly in a no-growth scenario.
travis stice -- chief executive office
yes. i think like we said in the prepared remarks, all costs are on the table. the midpoint of guidance implies $75 million of operating capital spend for the rest of the year. it's probably a little heavier weighted toward q2 then q3 and q4. and i think -- and certainly, the base case diamondback plan of going back to work in some respect is baked into that guidance. and i think you can use the q3 and q4 run rate for 2021, should we be in a maintenance mode through all of 2021.
spiro dounis -- credit suisse -- analyst
perfect. that's it for me. thanks, guys.
travis stice -- chief executive office
thanks, spiro.

your next question comes from the line of pearce hammond with simmons energy.
pearce hammond -- simmons energy -- analyst
good morning, and thanks for taking my question. kaes, given the attractive and robust debt market right now, would you consider doing an offering to pay down the revolver? and then what is the max drawn you'd want to be on your revolver?
kaes van't hof -- president
yes, pearce, it's a really good question you asked. while the debt market probably looks good for larger cap companies, i'm not very confident in that interest rate we would get at the rattler level. so i think overall, our strategy has been to be patient, and we're working with our banks and making sure they're happy and getting everything they need, but they're certainly going through a lot of stress right now. and so i think, overall, for us, over time, i would like to have some sort of term on our revolver and a lead to banks of the borrowings on the credit facility. i just don't think that's in the cards yet. there's certainly -- should the market continue to heal, we'll be opportunistic and look at our opportunities in the debt markets.
pearce hammond -- simmons energy -- analyst
thanks, kaes. that's it from me.
kaes van't hof -- president
thank you, pearce.

operator
your next question comes from the line of tristan richardson with suntrust.
tristan richardson -- suntrust -- analyst
hey, good morning. just a quick question. i appreciate the commentary on the cadence of the year at rattler. with regard to the sponsor call, you guys talked about your rig schedule for the rest of the year as well as the 150 ducs exiting '20. can you talk about either the rig schedule or the duc inventory and break out how much of each of these are behind rattler's footprint?
travis stice -- chief executive office
yes. good question, tristan. i think the majority of them have to have -- certainly, have rattler water exposure, whether it's water, freshwater or disposal. so you'll see 100% of those debts go to those -- go to rattler there. most of our ducs are going to be in the midland basin, probably two-thirds to three-fourth of them. so you probably have less oil exposure and less gas exposure. but nearly 100% on the water and the freshwater side, which is the majority of the cash flow of the business.
tristan richardson -- suntrust -- analyst
very helpful. i appreciate it.
travis stice -- chief executive office
i'll add from a capital perspective, we spend capital in preparation before those wells are completed. and so we're prepared from a rattler perspective to draw down ducs at diamondback and not have to spend many incremental dollars on capital of rattler.
tristan richardson -- suntrust -- analyst
makes sense. thanks guys very much.
travis stice -- chief executive office
thank you, tristan.
operator
your next question comes from the line of ujjwal pradhan with bank of america.
ujjwal pradhan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, guys. this is ujjwal. thanks for taking my question. first one, on your expectation for remaining free cash flow positive from here. that's great. i really wanted to get at what sort of commodity price assumptions and maybe banks baseline drilling and completion plans is baked in there?
travis stice -- chief executive office
yes. i think the base case is some sort of return to activity in the third or the fourth quarter. it's certainly not going to be a major return to activity. i think we're running scenarios from three [phonetic] to four frac crews at the diamondback level today. and that's baked into the rattler guidance going forward. i think as we look into 2021, we can go one or two ways. things can stay weak and we'll be drawing down ducs at diamondback and spending very few capital dollars at rattler. or the world starts to heal and oil price starts to heal, and those activity levels remain constant through 2021. so i think our order right now at the parent is: one, return our curtailed production, which we're going to curtail 10% to 15% of production in may; two, get back to work in a small way back half of the year; and then third, keep production flat. i can tell you just from a rattler perspective, diamondback is going to going to want to focus on doing activity that benefits rattler because diamondback still owns 71% of rattler. so we're going to be naturally motivated to do work that benefits rattler.
ujjwal pradhan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thank you. that's helpful. and secondly, nice cash distribution up around $10 million from your equity method investments. is that -- would you say that's readable from here in the subsequent quarters?
kaes van't hof -- president
some of that was a little one-time with the omog jv, returning some cash early after the close. but with the two pipelines starting up in the omog jv in full steam ahead, i think that number is probably a fair number, starting q2 or q3 to consistently receive back cash from these investments that we spent so much on.
ujjwal pradhan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
kaes van't hof -- president
thank you.

operator
ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the rattler midstream q4 2020 conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to adam lawlis, vice president, investor relations. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
adam lawlis -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, brian. good morning and welcome to rattler midstream fourth quarter 2020 conference call. during our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation, which can be found on rattler's website. representing rattler today are travis stice, ceo; and kaes van't hof, president.
during this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and businesses. we caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the sec. in addition, we will make reference to certain non-gaap measures. the reconciliations with the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon.
i will now turn the call over to travis stice.
travis stice -- chief executive officer
thank you, adam. and welcome everyone and thank you for listening to rattler midstream's fourth quarter earnings call. the fourth quarter of 2020 continued the trend of rattler normalizing operations, volumes and capital spend to a business plan with low to no growth from its sponsor diamondback. as a result, ebitda increased over 9% quarter-over-quarter to $78 million and operated capex decreased by over 60% quarter-over-quarter to $12 million.
these metrics set the baseline for rattler's 2021 forward outlook as diamondback plans to maintain relatively flat production and activity levels at current commodity prices. operated capex is expected to decline by approximately 50% year-over-year and will be down over 70% from levels seen two years ago. setting rattler up for significant free cash flow generation that will be returned to unitholders in the form of our distribution and common unit buyback program.
rattler is also near the end of our multi-year investment cycle and non-operated equity method investments, with distributions from equity method investments nearly reaching parity with contributions in the fourth quarter. in 2021, we expect distributions from these investments to significantly exceed our expected remaining contributions. the remaining meaningful contributions are to complete the wink to webster pipeline project. and we are forecasting significant distributions from both our gray oak and omog investments in 2021.
looking forward to 2021, with diamondback planning to keep fourth quarter 2020 oil production volumes relatively flat, rattler's 2021 guidance reflects a continuation of the strong results seen in the second half of 2020. the stable operated business underpinned by diamondback's low cost development of its top-tier permian assets, along with equity method distributions outpacing contributions is expected to deliver increase in free cash flow to rattler's unitholders this year.
in conclusion, when we created rattler to build out the infrastructure necessary to develop diamondback's assets, we envisioned a midstream entity that combined conservative financial management, visibility to volumes and a clear and honest relationship with it's sponsor, the low cost independent producer in north america.
we still believe that each of these attributes apply today and is a clear advantage as rattler adapts its business model from accommodating growth to optimizing operations and free cash flow, which will accrue to unitholders in the quarters and years ahead.

adam lawlis -- vice president, investor relations
brian we're unable to hear the question.
operator
hello, adam.
adam lawlis -- vice president, investor relations
yes. we're here, we're waiting on you to put the questions there.
operator
yes, we have a lot of questions here. first question from james kirby with jpmorgan.
james kirby -- jpmorgan -- analyst
just want to start, diamondback had made comments following the recent acquisition with qep about potentially dropping down the midstream assets held at qep. just wondering if you can provide any commentary there in terms of the nature of those assets? and is that something you're looking at in the near-term or kind of later dated growth?
kaes van't hof -- president
yeah, james. good question. it -- qep did a really good job building out their midstream assets in their county line area and the mustang springs area where they've been pretty active here for the last few years. there's a lot of fresh water assets, disposal assets, recycling assets and on top of that some small oil gathering terminals and assets.
so i think we're pretty excited about how they develop their midstream capabilities, and i think over the long-term those assets likely belong at rattler, but we got to do a lot of work here post hopefully closing this deal in a few weeks and then working up the valuation and getting two boards aligned on valuation for a potential dropdown. but it's certainly our intent. i just wouldn't expect it to happen in the first half of the year.
james kirby -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it, that's helpful. and then just a follow-up on that, when you think about financing of it, leverage here is below 2, do you have any early thoughts in terms of how you'd go about financing the dropdown and if that would kind of coincide with buybacks maybe use the buyback pace in favor of the financing the dropdowns.
kaes van't hof -- president
yeah, i mean, i think it's too early to make that call. but i think in general, we're not going to lever up the company, we're not going to lever up the parent in exchange for the sub or vice versa. so i think it will be prudently financed. and i think it just depends -- i doubt we've put more than 2 turns of leverage on the assets that get dropdown and the rest gets funded with cash or other sources.
so we've been prudent in dropdown financing in the past at viper and i think for us keeping rattler below 2 times because that leverage consolidates up to the parent is probably the right thing for us to do.
james kirby -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it, that makes sense. and then maybe just a point of clarification, are you receiving full distributions from all your jvs in line with proportionate cash flows? and do you expect those distributions to remain stable or to grow across the portfolio over time?
kaes van't hof -- president
yeah, no, we're certainly not receiving 100% because there is some interest to be paid it at gray oak, but we're probably getting 80% to 85% of ebitda there in the form of distributions, on the omog jv there is not a lot of debt at that subsidiary zero right now. so we are getting full distributions of ebitda from that business.
i think we're pretty excited about the forward outlook for the omog jv this year. diamondback is very active and a few of the other producers on the system are going to grow volumes. so i think that system is going to see pretty significant growth. now with that comes a little bit of capital that needs to be spent, but overall i think the distributions from those two businesses are going to outperform our expectations.
and then on the fx side, we're not expecting distributions from that business. so i think it's fair to assume that there is probably $10 million to $15 million of ebitda leakage to what we receive in the form of distributions from the investments.
james kirby -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it, i appreciate the color there. and then last one for me, just previously you guys pause the amarillo build out there and just with current commodity prices where they are, is there any chance that maybe gets pushed accelerated ahead and you guys start maybe building something in this year or is that still later dated?
kaes van't hof -- president
yeah, i mean, i think it still later dated if we decide to even to build the plant. i think we're thinking pretty strategically about the asset and how it fits in northern martin county. so right now, no intention to spend an extra $50 million to build a new plant in an area that -- that's probably low on capacity. so i think we're going to be smart with capital there.
james kirby -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it, that makes sense. i'll stop there. i appreciate the color, guys.
kaes van't hof -- president
thank you, james.

next question ujjwal pradhan from bank of america.
ujjwal pradhan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thanks for taking my questions. kaes wanted to start first on esg and the emission reduction targets, some of the items that diamondback disclosed earlier this week. diamondback has made significant strides in this area and in many aspects leads the industry with the recent emission reduction targets. so i was curious if you could discuss the emission profile for rattler stand-alone and whether some of the esg initiatives within fang's broader esg program include some at rattler as well.
kaes van't hof -- president
yeah, no, it's a good question. and we talked about that a lot in the diamondback call. i kind of see the commitment that diamondback made as consolidated commitment. i think rattler's carbon footprint is obviously a lot smaller than diamondback's with everything on pipe. but we are doing things at the rattler level to reduce rattler's scope on carbon footprint, which is basically getting rid of as many generators in infield as possible, connecting all of our facilities to line power.
and then on top of that i think overall and this is debated if it's a scope 1 or scope 2 emission, but we are buying power from renewable sources and sourcing power from renewable sources and that power gets allocated between diamondback and rattler. so i think certainly the -- put -- building rattler was esg positive because you're putting so much stuff, so much production on pipe versus trucks. but on top of that, the next step is fulfilled electrification across all of our fields and sourcing that electricity from renewable sources.
ujjwal pradhan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. and a quick follow-up on that. so would this be sourcing renewables, are you able to do that from the grid, given where your operations are or is it actually investing in some renewable assets yourself?
kaes van't hof -- president
no it's from the grid only by both power and this has been a hot topic for this week for texas. but when you buy both power, you have the option to source it from 100% renewable sources with some assurances obviously, but it cost you a little bit more, but it wouldn't be a meaningful amount, and that reduces your total emissions profile.
ujjwal pradhan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thanks for that. and kaes with fang's production plants largely flat year-over-year and significant water disposal capacity at rattler level, do you think you could approach third parties for opportunities to get higher utilization of those disposable capacity?
kaes van't hof -- president
yeah. we had discussions with third parties all the time. usually it's an offload capacity. so i think those discussions will continue. i think there's a lot of consolidation to happen in the water business, particularly in the delaware basin and that means bigger relationships with more well-funded counterparties that can take water and vice versa.
so i think overall that's happening, i wouldn't bet on it in our financials, just because we want to bet on what we can control, which is the diamondback plan, but certainly i think rationalization of capacity in all forms of fashion in midstream in the permian is going to happen here.
ujjwal pradhan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. turning to capex plans. this year, obviously the capex -- the operated capex have come down significantly and could be one of the last years where you have bulk contribution to your jv projects. looking forward, are you able to comment on what we should expect be it run rate capex specific to rattler would be? and following up on amarillo build out comments earlier, how much of -- how much capex there could be for that build out?
kaes van't hof -- president
yeah. so if we built amarillo rattler, the build out would be probably less than we originally said probably close to $30 million or $35 million net to us. but that's very unlikely to happen. i don't think that's even a 2021 or even 2022 decision. but i can't speak to the operating capex and i think the team understands that rattler's budget starts with zero and builds up from there.
we spent $11 million or $12 million worth of capital in q4. our guidance assume, somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million a quarter, but i think overall, we kind of break out the capex into mandatory capex and kind of flex capex. that just in case diamondback's drill schedule or completion schedule changes and i'd say in the budget, we presented today 75% or two-thirds or 75% of it is kind of mandatory capex and there is a little bit of flex for the good guys in case things changed throughout the year.
but overall, that number need to continue to decline and particularly in a world where we're not growing at diamondback. i think the capital spend will be extremely limited to areas that are growing rather than areas that are staying flat.
ujjwal pradhan -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. very helpful, kaes. thanks for the answers. and i'll jump back on the queue.
kaes van't hof -- president

next question goes from the line of michael lapides from goldman sachs.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, guys. thank you for taking my question. just curious, a follow-up on the potential of maybe dropping down some of the qep assets. can you remind us or have you all disclosed, a, what's just kind of the book value or the asset value of the qep midstream assets? i'm just trying to get my arms around kind of how big of a potential series of multi-year dropdowns could that be or is it relatively small. that's my first question.
second one is, how are you thinking about the cost of capital for rattler, right, and the best use of cash? meaning, is the best use of cash for rattler to buy assets from diamondback's some of the qep assets or continue deploying it whether it's even more deleveraging or even more share buybacks at this unit price?
kaes van't hof -- president
yeah, michael. good questions. i'll start with the size of the dropdown, i think in general there is -- overall, we're going to drop everything down at once. i think life's too short for us with three earnings calls in a week to do a multi-stage dropdown. i will say -- i'll give you a range, it's kind of 10% to 20% the size of rattler today.
so it's not a huge dropdown and certainly manageable with the amount of free cash that we have and the leverage capacity that we have. so like i said, we're not going to lever up the sub in exchange for the parent. so i think we'll be smart about funding it, but it will be all in one fell swoop.
then your second question, use of cash i think that's the question we need to ask ourselves, every quarter and that's the question our board ask to us, and talks about in every in every audit committee meeting is this the best use of our cash to buyback stock at these levels or should we bring back the distribution.
now, it's a lot easier today -- or it was a lot easier in november to say rattler had afford 18% free cash flow yield is the best place i could put my money maybe in north america, but that decision got a little harder this quarter, because the stocks rallied. but we're still trading at 11% free cash flow yield, with all of that cash being returned to unitholders in some form or fashion because there is not a debt issue at rattler. so i think it's a fortunate place to be. i think in general we prefer this to be a higher distribution vehicle than a low-flow buyback vehicle. but i think that's a good discussion to have.
michael lapides -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thank you, guys. much appreciate it.
kaes van't hof -- president

the next question comes from the line of tristan richardson from truist securities.
tristan richardson -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, good morning guys. kaes, i appreciate the comment just on kind of relative scale of the qep asset, curious just about integration to the extent that that goes forward. is there organic buildout potential or an integration spend potential in terms of linking up qep midstream assets with rattler assets from a connectivity standpoint?
kaes van't hof -- president
yeah, that's a good question. i think if you look at the math, we're going to have an opportunity to build a very efficient system in martin county and qep, like i said did a really good job building out their midstream assets and basically on that county line area we are neighbors. so that's not a huge amount of capital to connect our systems. but i think overall, as you think about our development, there is not a lot of added capacity needed, with the combination of the two.
so i think there's going to be some nice efficiencies there, we'll minimize capital spend. and i think overall, i think investors will be surprised with how little capital was needed to integrate those assets because of how buildout they are at both companies.
tristan richardson -- truist securities -- analyst
appreciate it, kaes. that's all i had. thank you, guys.

thank you for standing by, and welcome to the rattler midstream first quarter 2021 conference call. [operator instructions] please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, vice president of investor relations, adam lawlis. please go ahead.
adam t. lawlis -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, atif. good morning, and welcome to rattler midstream's first quarter 2021 conference call. during our call today, we will reference an updated investor presentation which can be found on rattler's website. representing rattler today are travis stice, ceo; and kaes van't hof, president. during this conference call, the participants may make certain forward-looking statements relating to the company's financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, and future performance.
we caution you that actual results could differ materially from those that are indicated in these forward-looking statements, due to variety of factors. information concerning these factors can be found in the company's filings with the sec. in addition, we will refer to certain non-gaap measures. the reconciliations with the appropriate gaap measures can be found in our earnings release issued yesterday afternoon.
we'll now turn the call over to travis stice.
travis d. stice -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, adam. welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to rattler midstream's first quarter earnings call. despite winter storm uri having an outsized impact on rattler throughput volumes and operations during the quarter, rattler was able to deliver strong free cash flow of over $47 million for the quarter because capital spend was kept under $6 million. this free cash flow was used to fund our $0.20 per unit distribution, $11 million of common unit repurchases, and reduce debt, displaying our commitment to return capital to investors. operated cash capex is down almost 9% from one year ago, illustrating the ability of the company to quickly adapt to a new business model, where lower growth is offset by increasing free cash flow to fund more capital return to unit holders.
we are maintaining our full year 2021 ebitda guidance, even after the slower start to the year due to the impacts of the winter storm, expressing our confidence in the forward outlook. in fact, march operated ebitda was back on track with the run rate we expected to hit, the mid-point of our 2021 guidance. we also see upside from our equity method investments, as volumes are expected to grow significantly on our omog oil gathering system, driven primarily by diamondback activity after closing its merger with qep resources. lastly, operated capex is expected to remain low in the second quarter, giving rattler optionality on our capital plan for the second half of the year, depending on diamondback's forward development plan. moving on to our non-operated equity method investments. the first quarter of 2021 was the first in which our distributions received from these investments exceeded our contributions.
we are also announced the sale of our amarillo-rattler joint venture, which in addition to upfront and deferred consideration of potentially up to $37.5 million net to rattler, removes the need to contribute substantial capital to fund the construction of a new gas processing plant. with rattler receiving an attractive return on its investment, and diamondback secure in having the gas gathering and processing capacity necessary to develop one of its core operating areas, the joint venture exhibits the mutually beneficial relationship between diamondback and rattler. with this sale and wink to webster expected to begin full service in the fourth quarter of 2021, our equity method joint venture build cycle is substantially complete, and we expect to reap meaningful and increasing distributions from these investments in the years to come. we also sold a non-core asset for $10 million, shedding a real estate asset that was no longer core to our business.
the cash from this and the amarillo-rattler sale will go toward the balance sheet for the time being, and could be a source of funds for a future dropdown or investment. in conclusion, with our full year 2021 guidance unchanged, rattler is focused on executing on its business plan of providing the highest level of service to our customers in the most environmentally responsible and efficient manner possible. in doing so, rattler should continue to benefit from the substantial investment over the last few years, peer-leading balance sheet, and best-in-class sponsor, which all position rattler to capitalize on opportunities in this dynamic and essential industry.
with these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of james kirby with jpmorgan.
james m. kirby -- jpmorgan -- analyst
just want to start here with the amarillo decision to exit that jv. i just wanted to confirm there's no impact to 2021 numbers here. and then maybe just on diamondback's view of the asset and what activity levels they're budgeting for going forward there, around that asset.
matthew kaes vant hof -- president and director
yes. good question, james. no impact to our financials this year. the business amarillo-rattler was formed in a time when high growth was in vogue, and we were going to need to build a plant in order to meet diamondback's growth plans for that particular area in northern martin county. i think not only has sentiment change toward growth, but so has diamondback's opinion on growth and therefore we didn't need to add that capacity. generally, enlink had the dedication surrounding this position, and so it made a lot of sense for us to approach enlink and see if there was a deal to be had. so i think a win for rattler, getting some cash in for an investment that we weren't going to spend a lot of capital on and weren't making a lot of money on. it's a win for diamondback because diamondback gets to send its molecules through the enlink system, which provides a little bit of an uplift and i think it secures a long-term relationship between diamondback and enlink for a long time in northern martin county. and then to your activity, activity is going to be pretty high there. we're going to be consistently running multiple rigs across this dedication. i would say generally, we're planning to spend probably 50% of our capital in martin county, and this is probably half of that. at diamondback, excuse me.
operator
our next question comes from pearce hammond of simmons energy. your line is open.
pearce wheless hammond -- piper sandler -- analyst
in the quarter, really good free cash flow generation. and just curious, all things being equal, how do you see capex spending on a runway basis as we move forward since you've already spent a lot of capital to get everything in place? what do you think capital spending looks like as we move forward, absent any big drop-downs or anything like that?
matthew kaes vant hof -- president and director
yes, really good question, pearce. i'd say we have a capex budget of $60 million to $80 million out there. i find it very hard, today on may 5, to think that the high end of that is even close to in play. i think generally q1 was a really low quarter capex-wise, but in our budget we probably have $35 million or $40 million of what we would call essential projects, and i guess the rest is optional in case something happens with diamondback's development plan the rest of the year. so capex is going to stay very, very low in q2. i think we have some optionality in the back half of the year, pending a dropdown or diamondback's activity level shifting significantly. but overall, those dollars are going to be very tight on the capex side, and as travis said in his opening comments, if you're not growing ebitda like we originally expected, we've got to grow free cash flow by cutting capital and cutting costs. and that's the game plan today at rattler.
pearce wheless hammond -- piper sandler -- analyst
okay. and then my follow-up maybe a difficult one to answer, but i'm just curious your thoughts on this. as everyone knows, there's excess oil pipeline takeaway capacity out of the permian and there's some talk about maybe repurposing some of those assets to maybe instead of carrying oil, carrying natural gas or ngls. i was curious, if you did see some assets that get repurposed, would that impact rattler? and then furthermore, how hard is it to repurpose assets, both commercially and just physically?
matthew kaes vant hof -- president and director
yes, it reminds me of the days back when the permian was underpriced and everyone said that epic couldn't turn an ngl line into an oil line, and guess what? they were able to do it. but i'm going to leave that up to the experts, pearce. i think generally, if any basin in the us is going to grow on oil production, it's the permian. so while we're over-piped right now, these things tend to go in waves. i think if other people decided to repurpose pipelines out of the permian, it would certainly benefit the pipelines we have interest in right now because it would make oil supplies tighter. but that would be my best guess today. 2
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of tristan richardson of truist securities.
tristan james richardson -- truist securities -- analyst
appreciate all the comments on plans and thoughts for activity the rest of the year. i guess just on the potential dropdown asset, i think maybe on the last call, you suggested a general size and scale, and this could come down all in one piece. but maybe just any update on some operational metrics of the midstream asset upstairs and either volumes or ebitda size, just to help us get our arms around the scale here.
matthew kaes vant hof -- president and director
yes. no, good question, and we're working diligently to get this prepared. there's not only the assets that need to be dropped down, but there's also a lot of work going on behind the scenes to get kind of a master development plan for our diamondback's martin county position. i think we're going to be more focused on recycling water and storing produced water in order to recycle as part of our esg goals. and i think it's just the right thing to do and probably better for rattler's margins. so that's going on, but also we are sizing the dropdown. i guess i could say generally it's somewhere in the 15% to 20% the size of rattler today, from a cash flow perspective. so certainly a meaningful piece of business and it should belong in the rattler sub, it's just going to take a little time to get through land agreements and that long-term capital build-out plan.
tristan james richardson -- truist securities -- analyst
that's helpful. and then, yes, obviously the name of the game is getting cash upstairs to the parent, but should we think that from a valuation perspective, key objective is a creative on day one for any potential drought?
matthew kaes vant hof -- president and director
yes. i think it's got to be a creative day one because you have two public companies that need to work through these, these details. and i think fortunately, there's a lot of production already on the qep position, so there's not a lack of cash flow that would be dropped down. so i think fortunately, the asset is in the right position from a cash flow perspective. the key details we're working through is, how efficient can we get with our existing systems to not spend a ton of extra capital on the disposal side, and how do we connect everything from a recycling perspective to be able to store water and set some goals on limiting future disposal wells drilled in martin county.
tristan james richardson -- truist securities -- analyst
that's great. and one last follow-up, i think as we look past the drop in terms of priorities for capital, obviously chopped a lot of wood on the repurchase authorization, but when we look forward -- obviously the theme of this call has been being very prudent on capital spend. i guess when we think about free cash flow after a drop, could you talk a little bit about further repurchases and/or reupping the authorization versus shifting back to a growth and distributions type of model?
matthew kaes vant hof -- president and director
yes, i still think the majority of cash distributed to shareholders is going to be in the form of the distribution. even with the repurchase program, the majority of cash is still being returned to unit holders. i think we'd like to be a long-term distribution growth company, but also be smart with capital allocation, where like in the fall we had to put our hands up and say, ""buying back our shares at a high-teens free cash flow yield back then was the best use of a shareholder's dollar."" and that decision is a little less obvious today. i think generally, we want to get through the dropdown in the next couple quarters and then get back to distribution growth. and if there's an opportunity to keep repurchasing, i think we will. the value of the repurchase has to compete with the value of what we're spending capital on at rattler.

thank you, adam. welcome, everyone, and thank you for listening to rattler midstream's second quarter earnings call. rattler had a strong second quarter, highlighted by cost control as volumes and operations normalized after the impact of the first quarter's weather events. both the operated business and our equity method joint ventures witnessed a return to trend in both volumes and earnings. and the rattler team did a tremendous job in controlling capital and operating costs during the quarter. since the onset of the pandemic and the refocus of rattler's and diamondback's operations on free cash flow generation over growth, we have tasked the rattler organization with cutting operating expenses and capital expenditures to reflect the environment in which producer volume growth and its associated call on midstream capacity is limited. while the progress on opex was apparent this quarter, rattler also reduced 2021 operated midstream capex guidance by over 40% at the midpoint to $30 million to $50 million, which compares extremely favorable to the $240 million and $140 million of operated capex expense in 2019 and 2020, respectively. the net result of stabilized volumes and cash flow in conjunction with decreased capex and contributions to equity method investments is the strong free cash flow generation rattler has witnessed over the last year. since the end of the third quarter last year, rattler has used this free cash flow to completely pay down its approximately $85 million revolver balance while simultaneously funding $90 million of distribution and $30 million of common unit repurchases. accordingly, from this strong financial position and peer-leading low leverage profile and with improved confidence in the free cash flow trajectory of our operated business and equity method investments, rattler is increasing its distribution by 25% to $1 annualized per common unit, nearly a 10% distribution yield as of yesterday's close. although while the last year has been incredibly challenging for our industry, through the labors of rattler staff and adherence to its conservative strategy, rattler has endured and emerged in a position of strength. we look forward to continuing our focus on unitholder return of capital and prudent capital allocation to drive value for all of our investors. with these comments now complete, operator, please open the line for questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of [john evans].

hi. could you just talk a little bit about the stock buyback going forward since you increased the dividend so much? does that change your strategy relative to buying back the equity?
matthew kaes vant hof -- president & director of rattler midstream gp llc
not particularly, john. i think overall, we looked at our net debt balance that went down $100 million over the last four quarters. and we still paid distribution and bought back stock over that time period. i think generally, the stock doesn't have a ton of float. so we're a little limited on how much we can buy back. but we've still stayed pretty active particularly in the last month on the buyback. and i think a buyback is going to be a nice ancillary return of capital option for rattler along with a steady and growing base dividend. so overall, we're definitely not souring on the buyback. we just felt with the amount of free cash that we have, getting it back to shareholders with a little higher distribution, which is where we went public at, along with a buyback that's in place through the end of the year this year. but the board is very open to having discussions on that, extending over time as a supplementary return of capital.
unidentified participant
got it. and then may i ask you one other question? just relative to your leverage, etc. you've paid down the revolver. all you have is the bond debt. so if you continue to be this judicious with capital going forward, i mean, is there a place you want to get to relative to net debt? or is it about coverage? or kind of what's the goalpost there?
matthew kaes vant hof -- president & director of rattler midstream gp llc
yes. i mean i think we like to think of the revolver as short-term funding. i think we feel very comfortable with the $500 million of debt outstanding on the bond side, particularly with the operating capex coming down so much. i think we didn't talk about it in the prepared remarks, but we do have a drop-down we're working on from diamondback to rattler. i think generally, we now feel comfortable that we can probably pay for that with cash on the rattler side and be able to not lever the business up. so using that revolver as short-term funding is the priority. and i think the bond is trading pretty well. i think it's trading at a price where next year, should rates stay where they are, we can refinance that cheaper. and that just means more free cash going to the shareholders.

great thank you so much

thank you john
operator
[operator instructions] you have no questions at this time. i do apologize. you have another question from [john evans].
unidentified participant
i'm sorry. could i just ask you one more question relative to the drop down? and so would you just use the revolver to fund it? would you fund it with equity, too? how would you think about that? and i assume it will be accretive to rattler, right?
i'm sorry. could i just ask you one more question relative to the drop down? and so would you just use the revolver to fund it? would you fund it with equity, too? how would you think about that? and i assume it will be accretive to rattler, right?
matthew kaes vant hof -- president & director of rattler midstream gp llc
yes. i mean i think the key message is not using equity to fund it. we have the revolver balance. we could easily tack on to our existing bond if we wanted but -- or maybe do something in between. but generally, i think with the amount of liquidity we have, the amount of free cash flow we're generating and how the equity looks expensive to us, raising equity is off the table for us to fund that drop down.
unidentified participant
okay. and then the last question, i promise. you guys did a phenomenal job on the capital side. and i mean is that just you've pushed projects out into '22? or is that really just the capital that you need for fang staying at this fourth quarter kind of production that they talked about on their call?
matthew kaes vant hof -- president & director of rattler midstream gp llc
yes. i mean i think it's mostly the team cutting scope from the initial budget at the beginning of the year. things are still also coming in under afe a little bit. but generally, i think with fang not growing as much and rattler focusing on the pennies, it's just a lot of little things that add up to a pretty big difference in this year's capital plan. i think generally, if the drop-down happens, there is some onetime capital to spend in 2022 to get ahead of water recycling and disposal in the new areas. but long term, i think getting back down to this $30 million to $50 million run rate feels like a pretty good annual run rate, if not lower, for rattler capital over a long period of time.
unidentified participant
