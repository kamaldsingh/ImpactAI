roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
thank you, viviane, and hello to everyone. thank you for joining us. i hope you're all safe and well in this still challenging times.
let me begin on slide 3 with our q3 highlights. overall, we posted a very strong performance in q3 amid the continuing pandemic with a robust 32% sales growth, significantly outperforming the global cft market and with a strong ebitda and margin improvement as well. we saw growth in all of our businesses driven by natura &co in latam with strong growth in natura and avon in brazil, showing continued productivity improvement and the strength of our digital social selling model.
the body shop and aesop saw further acceleration in digital and e-commerce even as retail gradually reopened. avon international's fundamentals show improvement with early positive sign in some key markets. digital social selling continued its strong acceleration with group e-commerce sales doubling in the quarter. i'm also pleased to announce a new step in our digital journey with the launch of &co pay, our proprietary financial services platform. &co pay will help drive productivity for our consultants and representatives by allowing them access to key financials, while promoting digital and financial inclusion.
&co pay launches first in brazil, will be rollout in latin america and then globally within the next couple of years.
second major highlight, the continued progress we made on the integration of avon, which is proceeding according to plan. synergies are on track with $18 million captured in q3 and we made further progress in working together, including cross-company manufacturing, distribution, storage and combined logistics contracts. we also initiated a pilot of avon's new commercial model in brazil, then will be mexico early next year and also in south africa, capitalizing on learnings from natura.
at avon international, we move to monthly campaign cycles from two to three-week cycles in five markets, including the uk, which will simplify the business model and reduce costs. the avon brand relaunch begun with the rollout of the watch me now campaign in mid-september through online and digital channels in over 30 countries.
third key highlight, our esg agenda. we are very pleased to announce that aesop was certified as a b corp, joining now natura and the body shop. also, in line with our 2030 sustainability commitments, we are partnering with the united nations on two key initiatives, ambition's 1.5 degrees celsius and target gender equality, both a test to our determination to tackle issues of climate change and diversity and inclusion. we also participated in amazonia day with natura, and in breast cancer awareness month led by avon with education programs for millions of women around the world.
and four major highlight. we strengthened our financial structure in october with the successful completion of a $1 billion capital raise. that was the largest ever in the latin america consumer space. we do appreciate the strong vote of confidence from the market and the credit rating agencies, which attest to the attractiveness of our group and validates our strategy. the capital raise was done to optimize our capital structure by accelerating deleveraging through the prepayment of the avon 2022 bonds. and it allow us also to make investments, accelerate strategic priorities, including the avon integration, group digitalization, geographic expansions and the 2030 sustainability commitments.
let me end here by saying that while we have seen a very strong quarter and a return to some normalization in our retail operations, the covid-19 pandemic is far from over. we are closely monitoring its evolution worldwide, particularly the recent lockdowns or restriction measures adapted in parts of europe. in this context, i would like to thank our teams across the group and across the world. our excellent performance in this challenging times that we face is the result of their efforts, purpose-driven, resilience and dedication.
let me now hand over to filippo to go into our financials in greater detail.
jose antonio de almeida filippo -- chief financial officer
thank you.

thank you, roberto. and hello to everyone. on slide 5, you see that we posted very strong consolidated sales growth in the quarter of 31.7% in reais and 11.6% in constant currency. excluding the phasing effect of the q2 cyber incident, sales were up 26% in reais and 6.7% at constant currency, significantly outperforming the global cft market.
natura &co latam's revenue increased by 29.5% in reais and 20.1% at constant currency. the natura brand performed particularly well growing by 41.2% while the avon brand grew 19.3%. the body shop and aesop also had very strong performances with sales in reais up 51.9% at the body shop and 8.2% in constant currency and aesop revenue up 67.2% in reais and 19.9% at constant currency. avon international's revenue increased 22.5% in reais, down 7.3% at constant currency. in the nine-month, consolidated net revenue increased by 7% in reais and was down 5.8% at constant currency. as roberto mentioned, we managed to largely offset the impact of the covid-19 pandemic in our business with a rapid pivot to online, complemented by the gradual reopening of retail stores throughout the quarter.
on slide 6, the group's online sales grew 115% in the quarter, supported by 83% at the natura and avon brands to 164% at aesop and 102% at the body shop. at the natura brand, content sharing grew by 170% since q1, online orders grew by 45% year-on-year and consultant online stores increased by 75% versus the same quarter of last year and touched the 1 million mark. at avon international, sales via representatives sharing e-brochures more than doubled. the number of consumers accessing the e-brochure was up 70% and e-brochure sales in the uk grew by 300%.
slide 7 shows that we posted very strong 71% increase in consolidated adjusted ebitda reaching more than brl1.5 billion, excluding transformation costs. adjusted ebitda margin in the quarter was 14.8%, up 330 basis points. the strong growth in adjusted ebitda was supported by cost discipline across all businesses and was notably driven by solid ebitda at natura &co latam and followed by the body shop and aesop. in the nine months, adjusted ebitda reached more than brl2.7 million with adjusted ebitda margin of 11%, down 60 basis points.
turning to slide 8, we look at natura &co's underlying net income. in q3, it stood at brl587.1 million, up 2.6%, excluding avon acquisition effects and transformation costs. the growth in underlying net income was driven by higher ebitda and lower income tax expense, partially offset by higher depreciation and financial expenses. reported net income was brl381.7 million in the quarter, up 1.3%. in the nine months, underlying net income reached brl88.5 million with reported net loss of brl827.6 million.
on slide 9, we show that we have strengthened our balance sheet by the $1 billion capital raise that we successfully completed last month. in the quarter, we had strong cash generation of brl793 million, which allow us to end the quarter with brl8 billion in cash before the capital raise. we used the proceeds from the capital raise to prepay avon's $900 million bonds due in 2022 in the beginning of this month. this would allow us to accelerate deleveraging, reduce us denominated debt, currency volatility and high interest costs.
as you see on the graph, our net debt-to-ebitda ratio was 3 times at the end of q3, down from 3.63 times at the end of q2 and it drops to 1.38 times post the prepayment of avon bonds. attesting to the strengthening of our balance sheet and improved credit profile, we were upgraded by s&p and fitch in october and early november respectively. the rating outlook by both agencies has also been revised to stable from negative. the second graph provides you with our amortization schedule and shows that we have limited debt maturities this year of brl100 billion with an average maturity of 3.4 years.
let's turn now to our performance by business unit on slide 11 beginning with natura &co latam. total net sales were up 29.5% in reais and 20.1% at constant currency. ex cyber incident, net sales were up 21.2% in reais and 12.6% at constant currency, driven by the natura brand whose sales were up 41.2%. the brand strongly outperformed the cft market in brazil and posted solid growth in hispanic latam. avon showed early positive signs with 19.3% growth in reais and 9.9% in constant currency. ex cyber incident, sales were up 3.3% in the quarter in reais and up 6.1% in brazil. this was driven by increased representative numbers and higher activity.
on slide 12, we look at the natura brands. sales at the natura brand in brazil rose 30.5% in q3, which represents an exceptional performance with continued brand preference and market share gains. this demonstrates the success of our social selling model, which led to the 16th consecutive quarter of higher productivity in brazil, up 13.8% even with the higher consultant base, which increased by 12.8% year-on-year to nearly brl1.2 million. in hispanic latam, net revenue grew by an impressive 65.7% in reais and 32.7% at constant currency in the quarter. we saw growth across all markets, notably argentina, chile and mexico. the average number of consultants increased by 13.3% versus q3 2019 to 759,000.
turning to avon on slide 13. the avon brand's revenue in brazil grew by 24.9%. ex cyber incident, avon's growth was 6.2% in q3, the first growth since q4 2018 supported by higher activity level and number of representatives. in hispanic latam, the avon brand posted revenue growth of 15.7% in reais and was down 3.3% in constant currency. ex cyber incident revenue increased 1.4% in reais and was down 14.9% at constant currency. the region saw improving trends toward the end of the quarter with key markets such as argentina, mexico and chile posting growth in september in constant currency.
on slide 14, adjusted ebitda for natura &co latam nearly doubled in the quarter reaching brl1 billion, driven by strong revenue growth and operational leverage at both natura and avon. adjusted ebitda margin was up 560 basis points to 16.5% with improvement at both natura brazil and hispanic latam. avon brazil also contributed to this increase helped by operational leverage and the positive impact of sales from the cyber incident.
let's now move to avon international on slide 16. net revenue grew 22.5% in q3 in reais and was down 7.3% at constant currency. ex cyber incident, sales were up 19.5% in reais and down 9.6% at constant currency. most markets showed signs of recovery from the impact of covid-19 notably in western and central europe. key markets such as russia and turkey reported growth versus q3 2019, offset by markets still impacted by strict lookdowns such as south africa and the philippines. adjusted ebitda was brl183 million with margin of 7.4%, down 200 basis points as a result of the impact of lower constant currency revenue, foreign currency impacts, higher sales leaders and field investments accelerate to recover revenues and also ifrs conversion adjustments in g&a.
we now move on to the body shop on slide 18. net revenue increased by a very strong 51.9% in reais in q3 and by 8.2% at constant currency, driven by growth in the uk and australia as well as the direct sales and online channels. the direct sales at-home grew 333%, supported by 261% growth in consultants and online sales increased 103%, helping offset slower retail sales as a result of the pandemic. owned stores like-for-like sales decreased 16.5%, but by the end of the quarter, 97% of retail stores had reopened. adjusted ebitda in q3 increased 81.1% to brl308.3 million with margin of 22.3%, up 360 basis points, driven by revenue growth, lower discounts, reduced discretionary spend and covid-19-related government support.
on slide 20, aesop posted outstanding net revenue growth of 67.2% in reais and 19.9% in constant currency. this performance was driven by strong growth in digital sales, offsetting partial retail closures related to covid-19 in markets such as the us and australia. while retail like-for-like sales were down 16%, online sales were up 264%. q3 ebitda stood at brl154.4 million, up an impressive 121.6% with ebitda margin of 31.3%, up 770 basis points, driven by top line sales growth, target cost reduction and utilization of government support programs to mitigate the impacts of covid-19.
let me now hand back to roberto.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
thank you, filippo. let me now conclude on slide 22 with the key takeaways. first of all, natura &co's omnichannel model has shown its strengths in the past quarter and, more generally, throughout the covid-19 crisis. all of our business and brands are showing resilience and increasingly becoming omnichannel. e-commerce and digital social selling drove also strong results this quarter. we are planning increased investments in those areas to further build on this momentum.
we posted a strong performance in latin america, driven by natura and avon in brazil. the integration and digitalization of avon is progressing well with some early positive signs in our q3 numbers. our digital journey took another step forward with the launch of &co pay. our esg agenda is advancing as demonstrated by aesop becoming a b corp and our active involvement at un climate week.
lastly, we have optimized our capital structure. with the successful $1 billion capital raise, we continue to deleverage our balance sheet. and we have further resources to boost investments in key areas to accelerate growth. that position natura &co very well for the future.
so this has been a rewarding quarter despite challenging circumstances. and i'd like to conclude by expressing, once again, my gratitude to the teams across our group who enabled this performance. thank you very much for your attention. we are now going to open the q&a session with filippo, jp and i and are happy to take your questions. so, the floor is now yours.

[operator instructions] we have a question from helena villares from itau bba.
helena villares -- itau bba -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning. thank you taking my question and congratulation for the results. my first question is actually for jp. we wanted to expand a little bit more about natura brand dynamic. we saw very strong results in terms of top-line and profitability this quarter. and what we are trying to understand here is about the market share gain that you showed. so we are just trying to understand if you have any kind of kpi figures that you could share with us to understand how much of these market share gains is going to be sustainable for the next -- for the coming quarters and next year. so that's our first question. maybe something about clients -- new clients, the profile of new clients could help us a little bit.
and the second question is about the body shop. this is actually about direct sales for the body shop, so it's a complete new channel and what we are trying to understand here -- and what we are trying to understand here is about the consultant profile. so, how -- who is this consultant? why do you think that's going so well? and how you are seeing this channel for the future? thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
hi, helena. roberto here. how are you? we're going to start -- i'll ask jp to talk about natura brand and the market share. and then i'll take the body shop. so, jp, please.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
hi, helena. thank you for the question. so, indeed we are experiencing market share gains in the natura brand in brazil. the market year-to-date has grown modest single-digits. however, in q3, the market is stumped [phonetic] by all the momentum centered [phonetic], the market has grown high single digits in q3. nevertheless, when you compare that to natura's performance, yes indeed we have gained significant market shares.
as has been the case of the natura brand in the last four years, so we have succeeded in gaining and sustaining market share continuously over the last four years. for this period, there are some new elements as we sort of indicated. we saw an increase in new consultants, which were recruited fundamentally through digital channels. these consultants are tech-savvy, they are younger -- some 10 years younger than the average of the network, and they already bring new customers, which are also more used to online or digital shopping, if you will. that has also come together with a strengthening of the brand. the way the company and the brand expressed themselves during the pandemic was completely in tune with the society's concerns. and that reflected in brand preference and brand desire, following from also a continued launch of new products didn't stop through the pandemic.
and just to finalize, we saw consultant's loyalty increasing to levels that we have not experienced in the last years. so with all that combined, the ability to acquire new consultants, acquire new shoppers and the omnichannel solutions for the shoppers and consumers and the strengthening of the brand, we are well positioned to retain that acquired market share. to a lesser extent, that's also what we've witnessed with the avon brand in that period and i can give you more details later. roberto?
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
thank you, jp. helena, on the body shop at-home, there is some similarity to what jp just said in brazil. what we are seeing on at-home is an exponential growth, right. so we are seeing this quarter over 300% growth in the two markets that we have at-home, primarily uk and australia. as you know, we are expanding now at-home into the us. we are already present in a very short period of time in 50 states, recruiting about 4,000 consultants. the profile of those consultants tends also to be more tech savvy, therefore, more native in digital, social selling. but one thing that is very important, which i think jp alluded to, is the very symbiotic connection with the brand identity, right.
and the strength of the body shop brand now, especially in the uk, is also driving the recruitment of new consultants into the brand. so, the whole effort of the brand rejuvenation, the activists, positioning of the body shop, it's helping bringing a profile of a younger, more digital savvy consultants into the profile of the at-home business. and that is helping accelerating the social selling at the body shop at-home business.
helena villares -- itau bba -- analyst
great. and just a follow-up about this subject because you just talked about this for natura and the body shop. so, we think here that maybe this (technical issues).
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
absolutely. and that's why -- yeah, so helena, that's why one of the key priorities for avon is the rejuvenation of the brand because we think that is also -- there is a very strong link on our ability as we strengthen the brand and we make the brand more relevant to also attract new consultants with a more social selling profile. and that's one of the things that we're very excited about it as we roll out this quarter over 30 countries the new positioning of avon brand, watch me now campaign, which exactly try to make that connection even stronger.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from robert ford from bank of america.
robert ford -- bank of america -- analyst
hey, everybody and congratulations on the quarter. jp, in addition to the changes from the commercial model, what makes you optimistic in terms or most optimistic in terms of the broader turnaround of the avon international based on what you're seeing in the latam network when it comes to brand or consultant digitalization or the synergies in brazil? and how is that being transferred and prioritized for avon international?
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
hey, bob. so let me start on the avon international and then i'll ask jp to comment on brazil. of course, avon international to your statement, we are taking a lot of learnings from natura on the commercial model on the segmentation. those things, to be honest, hasn't been implemented yet, ok. so that's still to come, right. so we are planning a pilot with south africa using the kind of the same framework of segmentation from natura actually planned to be implemented in q4 this year.
jp will comment on some pilots as well in latin america. but while we are already seeing at avon. i would call some quick wins at avon international, is we are seeing increase on the channel additions, especially on four key markets growing double-digit and the retention is also increasing. so we are seeing a lower churn. and again, those are things that were ready then, call it quick wins, on the earnings strategy of avon international and we are starting to see market share gains. so we saw market share gain for the first time in uk, russia, poland, which is encouraging.
but i want to be clear, there is still a lot to be done. the true change on the commercial model and segmentation yet to be implemented, but we are seeing some positive wins, especially in terms of making the channel a little easier for new consultants to come in, driving digital tool adoption to a much higher level than what it used to be before. so all those things are contributing to some increase in productivity as well and number of actives reps, especially in some of these key markets.
so turn to jp to comment specifically about brazil and some of the things in latam.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
hi, bob. so we are indeed positive about the more recent results of avon across latin america and in brazil, in particular. and they are -- based on quick wins, they are not yet the structural changes, as roberto pointed out. but they -- it suggests what the path that is ahead of us. starting with the brand, we resumed investing behind the avon brand. so, for instance, in brazil, avon advanced 10 positions in the merco reputation ranking. we also resumed communication advertising the new power stay in line couple of weeks ago. and only two days ago, we launched the new black skin line with outstanding technology very relevant for our market and still associated with social causes related to inclusion. so that is pointing toward the relaunch of the avon brand that is to be seen here in latin america early next year but already started in other geographies.
we also talked about strengthening the relationship with the representatives. and in this period, avon in brazil as well as avon in mexico reported highest satisfaction indices -- representative satisfaction indices of the last many years, which is showing that the proximity with the field, some of the incentives that are being put in place are also in the right direction. so with that combination, we are starting to be able to sell the sort of tailwinds that we have been living through in these markets. now that gives us the confidence that when the structural changes come early next year based on the pilots that are already going on, we will be able to sustain the positive momentum that is growing through avon brand across the entire latin america.
robert ford -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you very much. and just one follow-up. and that is, there is a big step up in the sg&a in avon international. and i was hoping you could give some additional color on how you're channeling those resources.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
yeah. hi, bob. how are you? i think that what we saw is more on less dilution on some of those expenses. i don't think this is a trend. i wouldn't consider that. i think they're very specific that you see here. but i believe there is -- and as i said, there is a lot of programs that were put in place and it shouldn't be efficiency. also in terms of avon international, we have to see there were investments also in the channel. so it helped us a lot and that impact. so i don't think that is something that could be considered as a trend. it's just a situation that we had, specifically in the quarter. and then, i don't think this is a standard i can see going forward.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from richard cathcart from bradesco.
richard cathcart -- bradesco -- analyst
hi, guys. good morning and thanks very much for taking my question. just wanted to ask a little bit more about the performance of avon in the uk. i know it's a market that you're doing lots of testing and piloting. and so, just in addition to the implementation of the digital tools in the channel, could you just talk a little bit more about what the drivers of the market share gains are in the uk over the last couple of quarters.
and then, the second question was just whether you could give us an update on your plans for building out a bigger presence in china. thanks.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
hi, richard; roberto here. so, you're right, i mean, we are putting a lot of focus in uk on social selling and really we are seeing is an incredible increase in the adoption of social selling tool in uk. one data point is, the e-brochure sales were up in uk almost 300% this quarter. so really this is a key driver of the market share gain. i also would say that we are putting more focus on the simplification of the portfolio of avon on the catalogs and the campaign uk moved now also to a monthly cycle. so all those simplification focus on the key categories and the key brands and the adoption -- a heavy adoption of digital tools, e-brochures are really the key drivers of the market share gain in uk.
uk for us is a market that we'll continue to invest and continue to drive a lot of the social selling tools, new campaign, the watch me now campaign. it's just online campaign. uk will benefit also from that. so still a lot to be done, but we are seeing some early wins, early signs, positive signs that are very encouraging in uk.
regarding china. china, it's early stage for us, but we are now very committed to make a more robust entry in china, especially with aesop and the body shop. we already established our natura &co legal entity and the body shop and aesop. we are now starting the process of product registration that will take probably about the first half of next year. of course, we have been very careful in working with the right provinces to make sure that the way we do it will continue to align with our values of not -- no testing in animals. so we are potentially planning to have a first physical store likely to be aesop in shanghai in the fourth quarter of next year and then as we enter 2022 expanding that also with the body shop.
richard cathcart -- bradesco -- analyst
perfect. thanks very much, roberto.

we have a question from ruben couto from santander.
ruben couto -- santander -- analyst
hi, everyone. can you talk a little bit more about &co pay. this seems to be a very interesting new initiative. so i wanted to understand what is the difference compared to the previous financial solution that you already offered to consultants in partnership with banks. and i also wanted to understand what to expect in terms of resources, is this kind of a initiative aimed chiefly to improve consultant's productivity and benefits that will give to the channel or could we expect incremental features that eventually could be monetized in bringing direct contribution through fee revenues or other source of revenues. thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
hi, ruben. roberto here. i would just start saying that &co pay, it is something that we're going to treat as a business unit incubated initially in latam to really validate and we have then go to scale that up in other countries [phonetic], latin america and then worldwide in a couple of years. we are going to also dedicate it part of the proceeds that came from the capitalization to accelerate the development of &co pay.
and i'll ask jp now to give some details about your questions on the productivity and the benefits. we are very excited about this. so, please, jp.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
thank you, roberto. ruben -- so as roberto pointed out, it is a new business unit. hence it has its own p&l, it generates new -- it's a new revenue stream. however, it is meant to strengthen our core business, precisely for the reason that you pointed out, the better payment solutions and financial solutions drive higher consultant productivity. and we know that from our previous experiences. so this is an initiative that has a double benefit. it enhances the core and captures new revenue streams. it is different from our previous experiences because it's now all integrated, orchestrated within natura through partners and completely embedded in the consultant's experience, right. also all the information that is captured is used to improve the knowledge we have about that relationship -- that commercial relationship that is building. so that is all new -- completely embedded into the beauty consulting journey.
ruben couto -- santander -- analyst

thank you. our next question comes from gustavo oliveira from ubs.
gustavo oliveira -- ubs -- analyst
good morning, everyone. thank you for taking my question. i would like to understand, roberto, you mentioned that you're basing the avon new commercial model out of what you're doing in brazil to roll it out to avon in other countries. what are the key features that you think that can travel well across several countries and if there will be a lot of adaptation or if the plan is to follow a more standardized approach? and then if i may, a second question would be, there was a very nice increase in the number of new consultants in brazil in natura brand. if you could comment on what would be the drivers that led this increase in new consultants and what are the characteristics of the new consultants that are joining the base? thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
hi, gustavo, roberto here. thank you for the question. what -- really the key elements of what we believe are transferable and, again, avon international team is working very closely with the team here in latam and in brazil to really understand is the notion of a lifetime value approach and the segmentation where the retention, driving productivity, sometimes it's going forth and then just the transaction -- the first transactions and just growing the channel. so there is a lot of simplification that is already being implemented by the avon international organization, as i mentioned, monthly cycle focus on earnings model that is simpler than what it used to be. all those things are already ongoing. but i would say the segmentation approach of lifetime value of the reps are probably something that, again, we want to validate it, we want -- again, through some prototypes and pilots, we want to make sure that also it works well. we know that even as we did it here in brazil and latam, it's not a simple execution because you need to adjust in each segment, great p&ls for each one of those segments to make sure that it works well as a whole. but we are excited about it. i think as a nation, we are preparing a pilot in south africa. and then the idea, once we validate that, is starting a rollout sometime next year. but it's really based on this notion of lifetime value and segmentation approach. so i'll turn to jp. jp, i don't know if you want to comment on anything else in terms of the model that will be transferred to avon international, and then you can comment on the specific question.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
no, i'll just highlight that avon international, angela and her team have been in continuous contact with our team here in latin america so we can exchange all the learnings we've had over the last many years. and so, that gives us the confidence that the acquired know-how will be transferred with the necessary adjustments.
and to your other question, gustavo, on new consultants, the number of new consultants in brazil, i think there are two main drivers for that increase. one is all the investment and know-how that we've developed on digital recruitment that became really seamless and facilitating those newcomers to learn about the activity and the products and how to reach their customers. that's one of the drivers. the other one, of course, is the fact that people spend more time at home, unemployment, trying to find new alternatives, and guess what, that combination allowed us to attract a higher number of new -- of consultants, new consultants, and they are on average 10 years younger than the average of the network. they are tech savvy. they join our network already through digital environment, and because of that, they are being able to reach customers that love the brand but didn't find a good shopping experience so far. so they are coming back to the brands through this new recruits. so, thank you for the question.

yes, thank you. good morning and congratulations on the results. i think that the question is to some extent a follow-up to the question that gustavo just posed. in regards to this increase in the number of consultants in brazil, do you think that this trend will continue? and you mentioned that they are kind of, what, tech savvy, that they already are more native to the environment. do you have kind of productivity indicators of these consultants already? this is the first question. the second question is just in regards to avon brazil. you mentioned that consultant satisfaction is very high. can you let us know why the satisfaction increased so much? what are you doing that is increasing the satisfaction of the avon consultant, please?
operator
please standby, we will resume momentarily.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
hello, are we back?
operator
you may proceed.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
thank you. sorry, we had a problem with our connections here. so let me resume from where i think we stopped, tobias. we talked about the new recruits and i was saying that it's too early to talk about their lifetime productivity. however, i can tell you that they started with the performance that is ahead of our historical records in terms of new consultants. and you also asked about avon's representative satisfaction, a combination of new sales incentives, the elimination of burdens in the operation and the proximity of our sales team with them during the pandemic, helping them to navigate through all sorts of difficulties they faced in that period. thank you.
operator
thank you. we have a question from irma sgarz from goldman sachs.
irma sgarz -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, hi, good afternoon -- good morning, sorry, and thank you very much -- or good afternoon to those in europe, but thank you very much for taking my question. i was curious, in the same-store sales growth in reopened stores, were you able -- or are you able to provide a little bit of how that's been trending for both aesop and the body shop? it was very useful to have that number for the third quarter, but i'm just curious, specifically when you just look at the stores that have been reopened, how those have been trending? and maybe connected to that about how you're thinking about the store footprint for aesop and the body shop in 2021 and beyond? i know you've made [indecipherable] already a large chunk of the adjustment at the body shop. but i'd just be curious for both franchises, where you sort of see the growth trajectory from here? and then the second question. just really minor question, government support for aesop and the body shop, i know it helped to some extent, the ebitda margin this quarter. but if you just sort of indicate to us maybe the magnitude or sort of how we should think about this impacting margins in the next quarter? thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
yeah, hi, roberto here. thank you for the question. regarding the store reopening, this quarter at the end, we saw approximately 95% of the stores open. what we are seeing again, and that explain a little bit a very strong quarter, is even with the reopening of the store, we still continue to see very strong momentum of our e-commerce at the body shop and aesop. so of course, the e-commerce came down a little bit versus what used to be in q2 which, as you might remember, was about 30 plus percent, almost 40% of the revenue. it came down, but it came down still almost more than double than what used to be before the pandemic. so even with the reopening of the store, we still see very strong performance of the e-commerce. the store in itself, we are seeing traffic still way down versus prior to the pandemic about 40%, but we are seeing higher ticket, average ticket per person in general. of course, we will continue to monitor now as we enter into q4, which is our most important quarter in which [phonetic] some of the lockdowns in some markets, especially in europe. but one of the things that we are seeing is that we also got a lot of learnings in terms of being able to adjust, so things like click and collect, curbside delivery, all those things are still in place. so in the combination of e-commerce, we still think that we're going to be able to manage the christmas season well. but of course, we will be monitoring that.
in regards to margin, what i can say is that in our calculation, i would say, it's probably about 100 basis points to 150 basis points in terms of the -- call it the subsidies or the government incentives that we think that are non-recurring, that at some point will disappear, but even if we exclude that, we are still showing margin improvement on a recurring base, which is -- again, which shows the strength of our fundamentals. thank you for the question. thank you. our next question comes from andrew ruben from morgan stanley.
andrew ruben -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, great, thanks very much for the question. i guess just following up on the margin point, so more broadly, you showed some strong leverage in latam, body shop, aesop. so if you could just provide some color on the bigger margin drivers and if there is anything in addition to the government support that might be more temporary or any spending shifts in general we should be aware of as we think about modeling into 4q and 2021? and then just if you could clarify the 100 basis points to 150 basis points, is that just for body shop and aesop or is that on a consolidated basis, that would be very helpful. thank you.
jose antonio de almeida filippo -- chief financial officer
hi, andrew. yes, i think that just to have -- for the question, the 100 basis points to 150 basis points is consolidated basis. it's not specific. also, there are pieces of that that is related to the cyber phasing that we already mentioned before. so we consider like half will be cyber and half would be the stimulus. so again, like we said, with that -- it's taken that even if we do this, we still have an expansion in margin compared to the previous year. so i believe that we can see, of course, this quarter we had this increase, but i think the trend is to really -- to see that going forward on adjusted basis like we said. that's how we expect to see.
operator
our next question comes from joseph giordano from j.p. morgan.
joseph giordano -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, good morning, everyone. thanks for taking my question. they are actually couple ones. the first one is on the avon integration. so if you could shed some light on how you are deploying the technology you have in natura to avon? so what can be done now, particularly in the context that you prepaid your most restrictive bond? so that's my first question. and second question is, how do you guys feel about the outlook for christmas? so, particularly in brazil, we saw like an outstanding growth. we had some emergency aids probably helping the sales, so -- and you mentioned that you saw that mostly perfumes and fragrances. so how do you feel about it? and what's the strategy in terms of like packaging and bundling like you have been doing over the past calendar events? thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
hi. joseph, roberto here. so in terms of the restricted aspects or the covenants of the prepaid bond, this will allow us again to continue to optimize our structure as a group, especially in terms of subsidiary, and better combine some of those at a global scale and some of the opportunities that we have as we now have avon, body shop and aesop overlapping some of those geographies. so, that will give us some more flexibility for optimization on that. in terms of the synergies, they are on track. i would say, that is also explain part of the improvement in margins because we are already capturing about $17 [phonetic] million of synergies this quarter. so that's on track based on our communication and guidance that we talked about it back in q1. so we are excited about it. we are already seeing very material examples up distribution centers, manufacturing sites, especially in latin america, working in a combined way between natura and avon, and that's very promising in terms of not only driving cost down, but improving services through our reps and our consultants. so that's also pretty exciting. and i think that -- did i miss anything on your question? i think that was it, right?
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
christmas.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
do you want to comment on that?
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
yeah. so joseph, jp here. as regards christmas, you know that for aesop, the body shop, natura, all these celebratory dates are quite important. and all the businesses around the world are well prepared to fulfill the demand of christmas. and actually, we do think that in spite of the pandemic, people will be willing to see each other, touch each other, send a token of gratitude. and so, we think that the demand will be here. and we learn how to serve those customers in different ways. that's what you've heard so far. perhaps what might be new and relevant is that avon didn't look at those dates with the same intensity as the other business do. so i can tell you that we are upgrading avon's effort for those celebratory dates and for christmas in particular. so i think, avon will see a positive performance out of -- relative performance from the christmas campaign.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from daniela bretthauer from eleven financial.
daniela bretthauer -- eleven financial -- analyst
hi, good morning, everyone. congratulations on the results. thank you for taking my questions. most of them have already been answered, but i just wanted to follow up on the channel growth at avon. you mentioned lower churn. and actually a twofold topic there. one is, it was very impressive that not only productivity growth, but the channel growth in brazil. but then on avon, you mentioned in the release that it's still decreasing. so do you think, number one, the productivity and channel growth in brazil will remain at this fast pace because it clearly doubled on a sequential basis, and second on avon, the reduction, has it flatten or when do we see a change? and then, i'll ask my second question.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
so in terms of the -- overall for avon, what i would say is, again, some of the structural things we haven't implemented yet, while we are seeing, again, some of the actions that we took to simplify the model to make it easy for consultants to join, of course, all the efforts on social selling and adoption, it's part of that. and while we are seeing also as we make a couple of changes on the earnings model that is also helping the reps sustain longer, and that's what's translates in the reduction of the churn that we mentioned. regarding brazil, i'll invite jp to comment some more specific. please, jp.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
hi, daniela, good to hear from you. so we're going to push for productivity gains. that's the nature of our approach to direct selling [indecipherable] selling. in brazil, both natura and avon grew the number of representatives and consultants. across latin america, though, we didn't see avon growing yet the number of consultants. but i'd like to highlight that many of latin american [technical issues]. so i just want to go to conclude saying that many of the spanish speaking countries face more strict -- much more strict lockdowns. so we're going to see improving numbers as of now. thank you.
operator
thank you. we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. i would like to invite mr. roberto marques to proceed with his closing statements. please go ahead, mr. marques.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
thank you, everybody. so let me first apologize. i don't know what happened, somebody entered in the line. so apologies for that on behalf of natura & co. listen, we are very excited about this quarter and how we really performed. it's really an outstanding result in any stretch or any angle that we look at it from a top line growth, from a margin expansion, from a very solid performance in each one of our businesses, which is really testament of our teams, our four amazing iconic brands and our really approach on the direct to consumer omnichannel when you see retail, e-commerce working in a synergistic way. when e see our more direct selling both physical and now, through social selling, also compounding the performance of our business. so really very excited with the quarter. having said that, we are also monitoring, cautiously optimistic about the future. we believe, we'll continue to outperform the market, but we will continue to monitor some of those recent events on the lockdown in parts of europe. we are still not past this global pandemic. and we, of course, will continue to monitor and adjust in response to those challenges. but anyway. thank you so very much for joining us. hope, you all stay well, stay safe, and i hope to talk to you guys soon. thank you.

let me now hand over to roberto. roberto, please.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, viviane and hello to everyone. thank you for joining us. i hope all of you are safe and well in this still challenging times.
i'll begin on slide 3 with an overview of our highlights for 2020. 2020 was a year that changed the world in many respects. it was a year that show us how vulnerable and interdependent we all are; a year that has transformed natura &co for the foreseeable future, that brought a strong validation of the group, omnichannel and multi-brand strategy and a clear demonstration of natura &co's purpose-driven approach.
i would like to make a call out to our teams across the world for their extraordinary dedication throughout the year and solid results. as soon as the pandemic hit, we determined there was a time to care. we made the health and safety of our associates, our network of consultants and representatives our utmost priority. we provided financial and workplace support to our associates and networks of partners. we also quickly shifted production to essential products such as soaps and hand sanitizers and mobilized significant donations across the world from our four brands. it was also a time to adapt and we rapidly pivoted our brands to online sales and digital social selling when lockdowns across the world temporarily shut down retail operations. this extraordinary year actually accelerated many of our strategic initiatives, specially in digital.
we posted very strong growth in e-commerce and social selling. digitalization of consultants and representatives continue to gather momentum and adoption of the natura enabled digital platforms is growing steadily. we also became truly omnichannel. the group digital sales, which combined e-commerce and social selling grew 79% in q4. we also took decisive steps toward geographic expansions in the past year, buying back the body shop's operation in japan, launching the at-home in the u.s. and making further progress in our future entry into china.
2020 was also the year in which we welcomed avon into our family of iconic brands and we are making great headways into its integration. synergies are ahead of plan and we have successfully launched a new campaign called ""watch me now"". we have simplified the commercial model across all markets with monthly campaign and a new earnings model at avon international and started to pilot the representative segmentation model in south africa, building all learnings from natura.
we also made further advances in innovation with strategic product launches at all our brands. one example, the breakthrough innovation in hero skincare line anew, now powered by protinol, a scientific discovery made by avon which accelerate collagen production. natura's innovation index reached 67% in q4, growing strongly by 8.7 percentage points versus 2019. and aesop brought digital innovation features such as live assistance and wechat e-boutique in asia to gain strong online traction. we strengthened our capital structure with two successful capital raising, totaling brl7.6 billion, including a $1 billion global offering that was the largest ever in latin america consumer space.
we deleveraged the company to the prepayment of avon 2022 bonds and this allowed us to make investments to accelerate strategic priorities including the avon integration, the group digitalization, geographic expansion and our sustainability commitments. these commitments are captured in our 2030 commitment to life sustainability vision; a very comprehensive and ambitious plan to maximize our social and environmental impact over the next decade. our long-standing esg practice resulted in natura &co as a group gaining b-corp certification becoming, in fact, the world's biggest b-corp and the group was once again included in major sustainability index such as dow jones and ise on b3, this quarter, actually.
on slide 4, we talked more specifically on q4. and i would like to highlight four key achievements. first, natura &co posted a very strong performance with sales growth of 24% and net income up 200%. all of our brands contributed to revenue growth, supported by digital social selling and e-commerce with total group digital sales up 79% in q4. our consolidated ebitda margin remained strong, while reflecting phased investments in branding, r&d and technology to support our continued sustainable growth. this excellent performance in a very challenging context translated into market share gains in key markets and very significant outperformance of our global cft market by 6 percentage points in the quarter.
second, we made further progress on avon's turnaround and integration. synergies reached $25.5 million in q4 and $73.3 million in the full year, ahead of guidance through initiatives in administrative, procurement and manufacturing. we also initiated avon's brand rejuvenation with the launch of impactful campaign around the world reconnecting the brand with social causes such as fighting domestic violence, promoting gender equality and anti-racism. despite the higher impact of covid-19 in europe in key categories like makeup and fragrances, we are pleased to see that avon international gained market share in color, driven by key markets, which filippo will comment later on.
third, our esg agenda continues to advance in line with our 2030 commitment to life sustainability vision. we made further progress on our gender parity agenda and you will be hearing more from us next week as the world celebrates international women's day. and we are on our way to reaching net zero carbon emission by 2030; 20 years ahead of the un goal.
finally, we optimized our capital structure, achieving a net debt to ebitda ratio of 0.97 times. we generated cash flow of brl1 billion in the quarter and ended up the year with a robust cash position of brl8.3 billion.
before handing over to filippo, as we announced his transition already, i would like to take this opportunity, as he is going to be stepping down as our cfo at the end of the year, to personally thank him for his leadership, partnership and strong contribution since he joined the group. during the time, he played a leading role in the acquisition of avon in january of 2020, which included listing natura &co both on b3 and in the new york stock exchange, managed two successful capital raise last year, implemented natura &co global financial structure and strengthened our internal controls and liability management functions, completing a very successful cycle with natura &co. to ensure a smooth transition, we are pleased to announce that guilherme castellan will be joining the group as deputy cfo. he will work closely with jose filippo over the coming months and will become the group cfo after filippo completes his cycle.
guilherme is a brazilian national, joins natura &co after seven years at ab inbev group, where he held senior financial position in new york, sao paulo shanghai and hong kong. before joining ab inbev group, guilherme spent several years in the banking industry. in his last position, he was the cfo at budweiser brewing companies at asia pacific, a listed company based in hong kong. he will start his new role at natura &co next april and at the proper time you're all going to be able to also welcome and meet guilherme.
thank you again, filippo, and over to you to go into our financials in greater detail.
jose antonio de almeida filippo -- chief financial officer
thank you for your kind words, roberto, and hello to everyone. on slide 6, you see that we posted very strong consolidated sales growth in the quarter of 24.3% in reais and 6.4% in constant currency, reaching nearly brl12 billion. this reflects double-digit growth in reais in all our brands. in the full year, natura &co's consolidated net revenue stood at nearly brl37 billion, up 12.1% and in constant currency, down by a limited 2.3%, which demonstrates the resilience of our model in a very challenging year.
on slide 7, we focus on our digital performance for both e-commerce and digital social selling. as roberto mentioned, digital sales largely offset the impact of covid-19 on our retail activity, which continued to be impacted in the quarter, notably in europe. the group's consolidated digital social selling and online sales grew 79% in q4. at natura, digital sales were up 82% in the quarter. at avon international, digital sales were up 65% in q4. at the body shop, online and at-home sales reached 40% of total sales. and at aesop, online sales accounted for 27% of total sales in q4.
slide 8 shows that we posted a solid 12.3% increase in consolidated adjusted ebitda, reaching close to brl1.5 billion, excluding avon acquisition-related effects, transformation costs and an impairment at the body shop related to loss making legacy stores, mainly in the u.s., which were further impacted by the pandemic. the strong growth in adjusted ebitda was supported by cost discipline across all businesses and was driven by a solid ebitda at natura &co latam, the body shop and aesop. adjusted ebitda margin in the quarter was 12.4%, down 130 basis points. this is primarily due to the phasing of investments in brand, r&d and technology concentrated in q4 after rigorous cost control steps taken in the first half of the year. reported ebitda for natura &co was brl1.25 billion, up 21.3% with margin of 10.5%. in the full year, adjusted ebitda reached more than brl4.2 billion, up 5.1% with a healthy margin of 11.4%, down only 80 basis points, which is a very strong result in a challenging year.
turning to slide 9, we see that natura &co posted strong growth in profitability in q4. reported net income was brl174.4 [phonetic] million, up by 200% year-on-year as we reversed a net loss of brl176.1 million in q4 of 2019. underlying net income in q4 grew by 47.5% to brl249.3 million, driven by higher ebitda and lower income tax payment. as a reminder, underlying net income includes brl72 million in the quarter of avon acquisition effects, transformation costs and discontinued operations. in the full year, underlying net income reached brl399.5 million and net income was a loss of brl650 million due to the impact of inactivity from the pandemic, avon acquisition-related ppa and tax effects. management will propose to offset losses against capital reserves subject to approval by the extraordinary shareholders meeting to be held on april 16.
on slide 10, we show that we ended the year with a robust cash position and a much stronger balance sheet. in the quarter, we generated brl1 billion in cash, which helped reverse negative cash flow in the first half of the year. this allowed us to end the year with brl8.3 billion in cash. as you know, we completed a capital raise of $1 billion in the quarter and used the proceeds to prepay avon's $900 million bonds due in 2022, allowing us to rapidly deleverage, to lower interest expenses and reduce exposure to u.s. dollar denominated debts. as you see on the graph, our net debt to ebitda ratio was 0.97 times at the end of q4 down from 3 times at the end of q3, giving us a very healthy balance sheet. the second graph provides you with our amortization schedule that shows that we have cash far in excess of the brl3.7 billion in debt maturing this year.
let's turn now to our performance by business unit, beginning with natura &co latam. the net sales were up 20.5% in reais and 13% at constant currency in q4. this excellent performance was driven by growth at both the natura and avon brands. the natura brand was up 24.7% in reais and 20.9% at constant currency, supported by very strong market outperformance in brazil of 10 percentage points. the avon brand recorded growth of 16.2% in reais and 3.9% at constant currency, which is a very encouraging trend, driven mainly by improved productivity of representatives. in the full year, natura &co latam sales stood at brl20.5 billion, up 9.4% in reais and 3.7% at constant currency. the natura brand posted strong double-digit growth both in reais and constant currency, while the avon brand was slightly down in reais at minus 1.8% and down 9.3% at constant currency.
the natura and avon brands combined in latin america gained significant market share in the year above 12% versus 11.8% in 2019. in brazil, the brands combined and also gained market share of 4 percentage points in the quarter and 0.6 percentage points in the year. this consolidates the group's clear leadership in both latin america and in brazil.
on slide 13 we look at natura brand. sales at natura brand in brazil rose 16.2% in q4; a very solid performance on the back of successful christmas campaign, a strong innovation pipeline and continued brand preference. this demonstrates the success of our social selling model, which led us to the 17th consecutive quarter of higher productivity in brazil, up 1.4% even with the higher consultant base, which increased by 12.9% year-on-year to 1.2 million and natura consultant loyalty index in brazil reached the highest level ever. in hispanic latam, the net revenue grew by 44.5% in reais and 35.8% at constant currency in the quarter, with growth across all markets, notably, argentina, chile and mexico. the average number of consultants increased by 16% to over 800,000. productivity of consultant loyalty also increased. in the full year, net sales grew both in brazil and hispanic latam by 16.5% and 33.8%, respectively, in reais. sales in hispanic latam at constant currency were up by a strong 18.7%.
turning to avon brand on slide 14. revenue in brazil grew by 4.9%, marking the second consecutive quarter of growth. this performance was supported by higher activity and improved productivity, while the number of representatives were stable. fashion & home category sales grew by double-digits and considerable advances were made to increase the brand's perception as giftable. avon also completed the pilot of a new commercial model in brazil to be rolled out starting this quarter. avon brand returned to growth in hispanic latam, up 23.9% in reais and 3% in constant currency, driven by growth in argentina, chile and mexico; its largest single market. in the full year, the avon brand sales were down slightly in brazil and latin america by 1.4% and 2.1%, respectively, in reais and down 16.2% in latam at constant currency.
on slide 15, adjusted ebitda for natura &co latam rose strongly in the quarter, reaching brl774.1 million, driven by revenue growth, synergies and operational leverage at both natura and avon. margin grew 120 basis points to 12.2%, driven by natura hispanic latam and avon brazil, even with investment in brand, r&d and technology to support future growth. we saw similar trends in the full year with adjusted ebitda up 25.1% and margin up 150 basis points to 11.9%.
let's now move to avon international on slide 17. net revenue was up 12.1% in q4 in reais and was down 11.5% at constant currency. sales were impacted by the second wave of covid in certain markets, notably central and eastern europe and also sales of categories like fragrances and cosmetics were more affected by the pandemic than other categories. on the other hand, avon international gained share in color in q4, driven by key markets. the u.k. stood out with sales up 3% at constant currency, gaining market share for a third consecutive quarter versus the previous year. in russia, market share improved sequentially since q2 and the philippines gained strong market share in fragrance in this quarter. full year sales were up 2.9% in reais and down 18% at constant currency. adjusted ebitda was impacted by the drop in revenue and foreign exchange. and adjusted margin at 4.1% in q4 and 5.2% in full year reflected the strategic investments in brand, digital and commercial areas to accelerate future growth.
on slide 19 we now move on to body shop with sales up 48.4% in reais and 9.7% at constant currency driven by the u.k. and australia. this growth was boosted by a successful pivot to omnichannel to offset loss to retail sales. new restrictions in some markets, notably europe, resulted in 78% of the stores being opened in the quarter, down from 97% in q3. at-home sales grew 206% and e-commerce sales grew 72%, which combined accounted for 40% of total sales. note that retail store revenue now includes japan following the acquisition in october of the head franchisee in the country. in the full year, sales were up 32.4% in reais and broadly stable at constant currency. reported ebitda margin in q4 was impacted by an impairment of brl144.5 million related to loss making legacy stores, mainly in the u.s., which were further impacted by the pandemic. adjusted ebitda was up sharply, both in q4 and in the full-year by 32.6% and 27.7%, respectively. margin was robust at 23.7% in q4 and 20.2% in the full year, but was down by 290 basis points in q4 and a more limited 80 basis points in the year due to the pandemic's effect on retail sales and channel mix effects.
on slide 21, aesop again recorded an outstanding performance. net revenue was up 62.1% in reais and 19.3% at constant currency in the quarter, driven by a remarkable performance in asia, notably, japan; it's largest single market, an impressive growth of 190% in online sales, which accounted for nearly one-third of total revenue. digital innovation features such as live assistance and the wechat e-boutique in asia supported strong online movement. in the full year, sales rose 50% in reais and 13.2% at constant currency and surpassed the symbolic mark of aud0.5 billion. q4 ebitda was up 66.1% with margin of 37.1%, an increase of 90 basis points, driven by top-line sales growth and cost discipline. full year ebitda rose an even stronger 72.6% with margin up 410 basis points to 31.1%, driven by strong sales growth and strict cost discipline.
let me now hand back to roberto.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, filippo. and by the way, we're still counting on you as our cfo over the next couple of months.
let me now conclude on slide 23 with the key takeaways. first of all, we are on a sustainable growth path. our four brands are performing strongly. the natura brand continues to post double-digit growth, both in brazil and latin america. while the avon brand grew for the second consecutive quarter in brazil and returned to growth in hispanic latam. we also saw further growth in the u.k. and progress in russia and the philippines. the body shop successfully switched to online and at-home and aesop posted another stellar performance. and we did all of this while maintaining our purpose-driven approach that resulted in natura &co becoming the world's biggest certified b-corp.
second, natura &co omnichannel model has shown its strength throughout the covid-19 crisis, helping to offset the impact of this terrible pandemic. all of our businesses are increasingly omnichannel and digitalization of consultants and reps continues to gather momentum. digital social selling has been key to our strong market outperformance in the quarter.
third, the avon integration is on track; in fact, ahead of schedule with synergies ahead of plans and advances in the pilot of the new commercial model. the business simplification is progressing and digital social selling is gathering momentum, supported by a new brand campaign.
and, finally, we have optimized our capital structure as we deleveraged our balance sheet. and we have further resources to boost investments in key areas to accelerate our growth.
so, while the covid pandemic is far from over and we continue to be vigilant, we continue to grow and progress on our strategic initiatives. i would like to conclude by expressing, once again, my heartfelt gratitude to the teams across our group, who really enabled this performance.
thank you so very much for your attention. we are now going to open the q&a sessions and filippo, jp and i are happy to take your questions. so, the floor is now yours.

thank you. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from thiago macruz with itau bba. please go ahead.
thiago macruz -- itau unibanco -- analyst
hi, guys, good morning and congratulations on a very good quarter and year. well, i have a couple of questions. the number one is regarding cash flow. we know that the company's cash generation was always a bit more focused in brazil with a softer currency. but after the improvements we've seen at the body shop and aesop continuing to lead the way in terms of growth, is it fair to say that cash flow has started to arise from international operations, as well on the course over the last 12 months?
and my second question is regarding avon in latin america, brazil and latam. you've touched base on the digitalization of the relationship with the sales rep at the end of your presentation, roberto. i would like to have more information; how has that evolved on the course over the last 12 months and what milestones are left for us to really think that, at least from a channel and relationships standpoint, avon is aligned with the best practices of natura? these are my two questions. thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, thiago, roberto here. nice hearing from you. hope all well. so, on the cash flow, i'll ask filippo to detail, but the short answer is, we are seeing improvement of cash generation across all of our business, including avon international, the body shop and aesop, that is actually creating a nice balance of cash generation in different currencies other than just brazil. i'll ask filippo to give a little more detail and then i'll turn to jp to talk about it, but we're very excited about the progress on the commercial model, a lot of the learnings that we now transfer to avon, both in latin america and also at avon international. just one point is that we are now in full mode of a segmentation pilot in south africa, that is pretty much applying all the learnings of the segmentation model that has been implemented here in brazil and in latin america with natura. so i'll turn to filippo and then jp will comment.
jose antonio de almeida filippo -- chief financial officer
yes, thanks, roberto, and hi, thiago. how are you? regarding cash flow, the brl1 billion generation in the last quarter was with the contribution from all of our business units. so all business units generated positive cash in the fourth quarter. when you see the full year, there were impacts in the beginning of the year, you may recall, on the transaction expenses and integration on the avon integration then. so that is -- there was impact, but overall the end of the year was able to offset those impacts in the early year. so we ended up positive, a small positive but important positive. so what we see here is the contribution of all of the business units, we expect that to see going forward. of course, there are different commitments in terms of investment and other capital use. so it's going to be guiding from there, but overall the business are ready to generate cash going forward.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
hi, thiago, jp here. as regards to your question on the digitalization of the avon business. well, actually if you spend any minute watching tv recently, you probably heard that avon's down. so, avon is on, it's catching up. so the usage of the app and the instant message e-brochure is growing everywhere across the region, actually everywhere around the world. right? but strong growth here in the region. and we expect that throughout the year, it will catch up with the current levels of -- that we see in natura as well. but so excellent progress and transferring technology, accelerating adoption and should catch up with the rest of the operations throughout the year. thanks.
thiago macruz -- itau unibanco -- analyst
now, thank you, guys, thanks for the answers.
operator
our next question today comes from robert ford with bank of america. please go ahead.
robert ford -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good day everybody, congratulations on the quarter and all the progress with avon. i had a question with a little bit more detail and i apologize ahead of time. but can you talk with a little bit more detail about the current functionality in that interactive e-brochure and then with the suite of digital selling tools for reps and consultants? can you touch on new functionalities, ease of use, how you expect those to evolve with the training that you're providing the networks and the branch and geographies where they're currently available, as well as the roadmap you have for wider deployment? i think that's -- it's very critical as you move forward and you have so many positive developments. i'm really excited to learn.
and then, roberto, you touched on the segmentation pilot in south africa. can you perhaps give us your early findings and how you're thinking about broader implementation of segmentation? thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, bob. roberto here, i'm going to try to give you a short answer on your very detailed questions. but one thing that i want to give you a little comfort that you're going to see much more details at our upcoming investor day, but i'll try to address. first, in terms of the digitalization at avon. we are seeing really the e-brochure as being the main vehicle for adoption and really utilization of social selling. total avon has been growing over 90% and this has been consistent. in terms of geographies, the ones that are really -- we are putting more focus on investment and really training and adoption is more the developed markets and u.k. has been really our spotlight. right? so we really want to make it work in u.k. first to then potentially get the learnings on the features, get the learnings on the -- how the reps are really working with avonon. the avonon is the name of the app, similar to what natura has here; doesn't have all the features yet that natura has, but we are catching up pretty quickly.
but just u.k., we are seeing growth of 300% of adoption and growing of e-brochure for three consecutive quarters and i can assure you that, that is the reason that u.k. is now growing sales and gaining share for three consecutive quarters, which is, as you know, that's the first time that avon is showing market share gains in u.k. for at least five years. right?
robert ford -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
wow.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
so, more to come, but it's really very encouraging. now in south africa, the early results are very encouraging. what's really -- it's driving that is the retention of the reps. we're actually testing this on a second brand that avon has in south africa called justine, which is a more premium brand; decided to choose justine because it's a more contained group of reps and we really want to validate the whole growing segmentation model very similar to what we have here at natura. and the early results are very encouraging in terms of retention, productivity gains in south africa and hopefully with the learnings, we are going to be able to expand to other markets throughout 2021. jp, anything that you want to add in terms of some of the tools?
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
some of the tools. the most basic ones already available like accessing the e-brochure with a very easy navigation, allowing the reps to share that content with her -- all of her -- through social media with -- to all of her contracts, get the orders even through whatsapp and load it to the system. so the basic social selling functionality is already available and more coming, harmonizing with natura, as roberto pointed out.
robert ford -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
now that's exciting. thank you very much.
operator
and our next question today comes from richard cathcart with bradesco. please go ahead.
richard cathcart -- bradesco -- analyst
hi, everyone. good morning and congrats on the strong results. just a couple of questions here on avon. the first one, in brazil and i think in latin america. jp, you made a reference to the marketing campaigns that you're running. i'd just be interested to understand a little bit more, kind of, if you're seeing kind of what early signs of engagement you're seeing from consumers and perhaps also reps with the brands and kind of what kind of consumer are you targeting with these campaigns -- the campaigns that you had in the fourth quarter and, obviously, you're supporting big brother in brazil, everyone can see it.
and then the second question just on avon international, just if you could sketch out what we should expect to see from avon international through this year in terms of revenue, hopefully perhaps stabilizing the decline by the end of the year, but would be great to hear your views on that. thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, richard. i'll turn to jp to talk about brazil and some of the exciting things in terms of the new campaign that is coming, and then i'll comment on avon international sales. so, jp, please.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
hi, richard. i'll start from the end. next monday, international women's day, we are launching avon's new positioning, the so called, ""watch me now"" but translated to portuguese and spanish within our internal network. so from then onwards, it will reach the end consumer in the coming weeks and months. so all those story that you already heard has been spread through europe under angela's leadership. it's now going to reach the end consumer in brazil in the coming weeks. in the meantime, from the end of last year, you probably noticed, we have been investing on avon quite a lot, tied to launches of extremely relevant high-technology products like the ones with different tones of skins that were linked to anti-racism positioning here in brazil; all the power stay line, both in brazil and in latin america and the hispanic latin america and a much more modern presentation of the brand, which is driving, not only higher awareness but higher consideration of the brand. so very happy so far and the best is yet to come.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
and, richard, to build on that, i mean, as you know, we started the rollout of the new campaign ""watch me now"" in the international markets. and there is no question about that despite, again, the headwind that we are seeing in europe with the second wave of covid-19, we actually gained market share in color in makeup at avon international in q4, which is really exciting to see. of course, as you know, avon international is highly dependent on europe and highly dependent on actually color cosmetic and fragrance, and those are the categories that are being hit the most. just for you to have this data point, the top european markets declined over 12% in cft and minus 23% in color cosmetics in q4 because of the strict lockdown applied in europe.
but the good news. again for avon international is that because all the progress there we're doing on the fundamentals, the new campaign, we are able, actually, to gain market share in makeup in q4. so that, for us, will create a good foundation that when we have some easiness of the restrictions in europe and hopefully with the vaccinations and everything else, we do believe that fragrance and makeup are two categories that are going to rebound the fastest, actually, based on historical performance of those categories post-crisis.
richard cathcart -- bradesco -- analyst
great, thanks very much for the reply. thanks again.
operator
and our next question today comes from tobias stingelin with citibank. please go ahead.
tobias stingelin -- citigroup -- analyst
yes. thank you very much. maybe, roberto, you delivered some very strong results and i think the synergies -- you achieved synergies higher than expected at least for the first year. is there any indication that you might be able to increase the synergy guidance going forward or it's just really because the process has been moving on faster and you kind of decided to -- you were able to anticipate? and so, might be an early question, but just to get a sense if you are more bullish now than you were before? sorry, that's the first question.
and the second one, just going back again to avon international. which are kind of the milestones, the kpis, that we have to look at in order to see how the progress is evolving, please? thank you very much.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, tobias. roberto here. two good questions. so on the synergies, we are still pretty much within the guidance that we provided to the market, even though, to your point, we actually overdelivered in terms of the synergies in 2020. so if you look at our guidance, we were supposed to probably achieve about $55 million, $56 million of synergies in 2020 and we delivered $73 million. we also ended up underspending a little bit on cost to achieve, which will catch up in 2021. as you know, we were very careful about the spending in 2020 to manage the uncertainty and the crisis, but we do want to make sure that we'll make the proper investments to capture the synergy. so at this point, i would say, we feel pretty good about how it's progressing. we are sticking to our guidance, but we are very pleased with the first year, how we were able to really deliver on the synergies above our guidance.
on the kpis on avon international, i'd say there are a couple of things that we are really putting a lot of focus. the first one, i think the question from bob is the digitalization adoption and this is one metric that we are really putting a lot of focus in terms of utilization of the reps, of the app, avonon, the deployment of the e-brochure, the sharing content digitally across our network. so that's one kpi that we're putting a lot of focus.
the second is the productivity and retention and appointment of reps, with the new earnings model that's being implemented, a much more simplified one, the segmentation that we are rolling out, we want to make sure that the channel is very healthy and that's another metric.
the third one, just to give you three, is the brand health. how we are really rejuvenating the avon brand in terms of preference. and that's very much tied, not only to the brand campaign, the ""watch me now"", but also the innovation; the new products that we're bringing to the market and make sure that is really helping the brand, not only awareness but preference. so just to stay with those three, those are probably the most important ones that we're going to be tracking.
tobias stingelin -- citigroup -- analyst
perfect. thank you very much. and, if i may, just kind of a follow-up. in terms of the geographical breakdown of the synergies, is there kind of -- is it fair to say that maybe 60%, 70% might be kind of achieved in latin america, specifically, where you had a lot of overlap and so on? does it make sense to think kind of this way? and the synergies on the other regions may be much more probably on the, how do we say, on the top-line front or something like that?
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
in fact, if you look at 2020, i would say, we actually got more synergies coming from avon international with the roll -- restructuring that we are doing in leveraging now the group as a whole than even latin america. but i would say, for the future, with all the things regarding the supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, most of the synergies and the top-line, the revenue synergies will come from latin america.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from andrew ruben with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
andrew ruben -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, thanks very much for the question. going back to the points on digital, so you've mentioned the accelerated growth figures for digital sales. i was curious if there is any update on digital as a percentage of your sales and how you think that could trend over time. and then within digital, how do you see the split evolving between pure e-commerce and more of a digitally enabled direct sales model? thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hey, andrew. what i can tell you and we're going to get more details at the investor day, but when you look at it and this is something that we always try to make sure that the market understands. for our color retail business, it's a little easier to track because it's just a movement from a physical to e-commerce and what i can tell you that, for example, aesop, right now, e-commerce is or digital online sales is about 30% of the business and used to be 10% a year ago. right? now, you can argue that this number might come down as the retail -- the physical stores get more momentum back. because, again, this might be a little inflated because the business really had to pivot to online digital because of the weakness of retail, the lockdowns, the closure of the stores. so i think it is important to calibrate that even though it's sitting almost at 30%. we don't think that this will sustain. now, we also don't believe that's going to go back to 10%. right? so i think there is some kind of improvement there.
on the body shop, if we combine body shop at-home, that is primarily digital and e-commerce is now sitting at almost 40% of the total revenue of the business. but again i would caution because this is also driven by some of the restrictions in our physical stores that as the pandemic ease out, as we get some level of normality back, mobility, that probably will increase again the percentage of our physical stores. for the direct selling, the e-commerce is just one component but the most important component is really how the reps are using online to reach out to their customers, even if they buy not through e-commerce, and that is the metric that we're really putting a lot of focus in terms of utilization, sharing content, e-brochure, that we believe there are sales driven by digitalization and online usage, but not necessarily just e-commerce.
andrew ruben -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. that makes sense. i look forward to hearing more at the investor day.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
i hope that helps.
andrew ruben -- morgan stanley -- analyst
it does. thank you. i appreciate that.
operator
and our next question today comes from joseph giordano with j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
joseph giordano -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hello, everyone. good morning and good afternoon for the ones in asia and europe. congratulations on the results and thanks for taking my question. so i'd like to understand a little bit more like and dig into the digital strategy here, like, you're connecting more digitally. so how are you evolving? my question is, how are you evolving on the creation of your data lake to better understand and launch products and be more assertive on the marketing strategy? and the second question is, how are you leveraging and training on your sales force to actually reduce your digital marketing investments; so basically relying more on the sales reps? thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, joe. roberto here. i'll ask jp to talk about data lake, because again, we are leveraging a lot of the things that natura started to do and expanding now to avon in latin america, and we'll then expand to avon international and then he can also complement some of the training. so jp, please.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
sure. joseph, well, the usage of data is critical for the business today, yes, and will be even more so in the future. so i'll focus on latin america. but i can tell you that the body shop, aesop, they're digging the data on their customers thoroughly to understand where the opportunities are today and tomorrow. and in latin america, we have already merged the data lakes so that we know all that is available as regards consultants, representatives and consumers. and we are using that much more currently to reach those reps, consultants and consumers, rather than to design products. but as regards our media planning, our crm, individualized offerings, promotions, trainings, that is being heavily used already. right? i think that's it.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
good. i also would add to just jp's point, joseph, that in the case of the body shop and aesop, this change, more to the online and digital, we are accelerating our crm. we are accelerating a lot of activities also to connect and create loyalty with our customers that are now accessing the products to digital and e-commerce. and again we are very pleased with the progress. we're going to share more at investor day. but it is one area, again, that would just highlight where we are putting a lot of investment in 2021 over the next three years. as you know, after our capitalization, we were very clear, the part of the proceeds would go to acceleration of digitalization and some of those areas that you just alluded to are areas that we are putting a lot of resources against, to really accelerate that growth.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
and joseph has also asked about how consultants are growing customers.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
right.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
right? so, indeed we keep training them, joseph, so that they attract their own traffic, rather than having us investing on their behalf. so, that is an ongoing effort, very successfully so far -- successful so far.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from gustavo oliveira with ubs. please go ahead.
gustavo oliveira -- ubs -- analyst
hi, good morning, everyone. congratulations for the results. i have a question but it's a little bit more short-term but in the end, what i'm trying to understand is the current status of your initiatives in brazil and latin america in avon and comparing that to the avon europe. you mentioned that your results in avon international and europe were affected by coronavirus, right, during the quarter, although, you see the recovery is still ongoing. how do you think that the surging coronavirus in brazil, especially now, could affect the results in the current -- in the short term and the results of avon in brazil? or do you think that avon brazil is a little bit more advanced in the implementation of the initiatives or perhaps all the digital initiatives but also the commercial model initiatives that would allow you to actually deliver good results like you've been doing with natura despite the surging coronavirus cases and restrictions?
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
gustavo, roberto here. there are a couple of things that are important. right? so one, some of the markets in europe actually had to go through much tougher restrictions than we already see, in generally, in latin america; not saying that the situation is easier or more comfortable. on the contrary, there are some very critical situations in latin america, but we do see some restrictions that are really tougher in some markets, especially in central and eastern europe. so that's one.
two, it is a fact that some markets in eastern europe, and that's why we're putting a lot of focus in u.k., has lower adoption in digitalization than in some markets here in latin america and we are seeing brazil growing also in adoption as we are seeing in u.k. so that's a second factor.
the third factor is a category dynamic. in latin america, avon also has a higher percentage of their business in home & fashion, which actually, as we highlighted, is performing very well in the markets in latin america. avon international doesn't have that. avon international is highly dependable on fragrance and makeup, primarily, which are the category most impacted by the crisis and by the restrictions with the lockdowns.
so if you added those three things, you do have a nice picture in terms of some of the difference in performance. but the fundamentals, i would say, they are actually marching very consistently in terms of the new commercial model that was pilot and now it's being rolled out in brazil. now, it's being pilot in mexico and the same thing is happening in some key markets at avon international.
gustavo oliveira -- ubs -- analyst
very clear, roberto, thank you very much.
operator
and our next question today comes from gabriel disselli with santander. please go ahead.
gabriel disselli -- santander -- analyst
good morning and thank you for taking my question. can you please share some more details on the 4 [phonetic] points gaining of market share in lockdown during the quarter? what can you -- what do you believe that were the main drivers there like the -- toward the context of covid empowering direct selling model or a weaker competitive landscape? and then for a second question, the innovation index showed a large improvement in natura brazil during the quarter. so do you make a similar analysis for avon or for avon latin america? and then if so, how it behaved during the year? thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
so, roberto. thanks for the question. i'll start with the last part and then i'll turn to you. in terms of the index of innovation, we don't have the same methodology applied across our business, we're going to get there. it is one thing that we want to make sure that we start probably sometime later this year to have that visibility. we just have that level of detail for natura for now. and i'll turn to jp to answer the first parts of your questions about the market share gains.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer, latin america
yeah. and by the way, the innovation index is the cumulative index. so it reflects all the launches -- successful launches of relevant products throughout the year, which is one of the reasons that support the market share gain. i mean, the brand -- the brands are more relevant now than a year ago. the way we acted throughout the pandemic with our reps, with our consultants, with consumers, in general, across the region, made them consider natura and avon primarily as some of the most important brands to support society during crisis. that was one. and as mentioned, the launch of very relevant products, the high engagement with consultants and reps, actually, record numbers that have been achieved during that period, given the closeness with which we related during the difficult times.
the natural shift from in-store to out-of-store and the fact that we had different tools to operate out-of-store as well, so all of those combined let us to this outstanding market share gain in the region. so we are well prepared, not only to defend that gained market share, but hopefully to expand that even further.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
and again, we are extremely pleased with the progress in market share, not only in brazil and latin america, throughout both natura and now we are seeing momentum also on avon hispanic, but also the market share gains that we we're seeing in u.k. for avon and the market share gain in total of avon in color cosmetics, which is the most important category for avon and again despite some of the headwinds that we're seeing in the category as a whole, the fact that we are outperforming our competitors is very encouraging to show some of the progress on the fundamentals and some of the power of the brand.
operator
thank you. this concludes today's question-and-answer session. i would like to invite mr. roberto marques to proceed with his closing statements. please go ahead, mr. marques.

thank you again everyone for joining us today. again, we are very, very pleased with the results despite this very challenging environment that we're still facing and, unfortunately, i think we'll continue to face over the next couple of months. but i would say, i think our business, our people, our network are prepared to continue to deal with resilience, with agility, with care, really making sure that we stay true to our values, to our principles. and again, i just want to finish saying thank you to filippo, that he will continue with us, but as we announced the succession, for all his contributions and partnership. and thank all of our teams for really an amazing 2020, a very challenging year that really transformed natura &co and our heartfelt thanks to our teams, to our people, to our own network. thank you again everybody. have a great weekend. thank you.

now, i will turn the conference over to mrs. viviane behar, investor relations officer of natura &co. ms. behar, the floor is yours.
viviane behar -- investor relations officer
good morning or good afternoon to everyone. i am viviane behar, natura & co's investor relations officer. thank you for joining us today for this call to present natura &co's first quarter 2021 earnings. we're delighted to be with you again at our investor day last month.
i'm joined today by roberto marques, executive chairman and ceo of natura &co joseph filippo, cfo of natura &co, as well as guilherme castellan, deputy cfo; and joao paulo ferreira, ceo of natura & co latin america, who will join us for the q&a session. our investor relations team of natura & co is also with us.
the presentation we will be referring to during this call is available on the natura &co investor relations website. roberto will start today with an overview of our performance. filippo will detail our financials for natura &co. after that, roberto will make concluding remarks and we will open the floor to you for questions.
for the sake of timing, in order for us to accommodate questions from all of you, we would like to ask you to please limit yourselves to one or two questions each in the q&a session. thank you very much for your understanding and cooperation on this. let me now hand over to roberto. roberto, please.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
thank you, viviane, and hello to everyone. thank you for joining us. i hope all of you are keeping safe and well in these still challenging times.
let me begin on slide 3 with an overview of our first quarter highlights. natura & co turned in another strong performance in the first quarter of 2021. our group sales were up nearly 26% outperforming the global cft market, and we posted a significant increase in ebitda and margin with our report ebitda margin up almost 700 basis points.
this outstanding performance was achieved while we continued to operate in a challenging healthy environment with lockdowns and restrictions in certain key markets. this attests once again to the resilience of our omni-channel business model with a further ramp-up in online sales and to our unparalleled direct-to-consumer reach.
we saw double-digit growth in brazilian reais across our brands and a very good performance in our key markets. natura & co, in turn, had an outstanding performance with both the natura and avon brands contributing. avon international improved its performance in western europe and asia pacific.
the body shop continued to offset store closures with very strong growth in online and at-home channels and aesop had another remarkable quarter of growth, driven by asia and online. digital sales continued to grow. digital enable sales accounted for 48% of our total, up from 33% in the same quarter last year. and total online sales were up 166% in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
the avon transformation journey continues to show progress. the rollout of the new commercial model is under way and we are seeing reshoots such as positive advance in market shares and representative-based even though key geographies and categories like makeup and fragrance are still heavily impacted by the pandemic.
the transformation plan we presented at our recent investor day, supporting initiatives to drive growth and optimize cost, is progressing. and let me remind you that we also raised our target synergies for the avon integration to now a range of between $350 million and $450 million, an increase of $50 million over the period.
another recent highlight i would like to mention here is the successful completion earlier this month of a $1 billion [phonetic] esg bond issue that is linked to sustainability targets on greenhouse gas emission and use of post-consumer recycled plastic in plastic product packaging. this is falling in line with our commitment to life, 2030 sustainability vision and it shows again how we are aligning and connecting financial and environmental targets. the bond issue improves our indebtedness profile in our capital structure. we ended the quarter with a robust cash position of brl6.6 billion, and we made further headway on deleveraging with our net debt to ebitda ratio at 1.18 times at the end of the quarter, a significant improvement over 3.93 times at the end of q1 last year.
so overall, i think we can be very proud of the performance of the entire organization has produced in a very challenging context. it is another demonstration of the strength of our business model, which aims to make positive impact while delivering sustainable growth and value creation.
with that, i'll hand over to filippo for a closer look at our financial performance.
jose antonio de almeida filippo -- chief financial officer
on slide 6, we focus on our online performance, which includes both e-commerce and digital social selling. as roberto mentioned, digital sales largely offset the impact of covid-19 in our retail activity, which continued to be impacted in the quarter, mainly in europe. the group's consolidated e-commerce and digital social selling grew by a very strong 166% in q1, reaching 12% of the total sales, supported by strong growth in our brands. at natura, digital sales were up a spectacular 253% in the quarter. at avon international, digital sales also grew by 132% in q1. at the body shop, online and at-home sales combined 51% of total sales. and at aesop, online accounted for 29% of total sales in q1. overall, our digitally enabled sales accounted for 48% of our total sales.
slide 7 shows that we posted an impressive increase of 470% [phonetic] in reported ebitda, which reached over brl829 million in q1 with margin of 8.8%, up 690 basis points versus the same quarter last year. adjusted ebitda, which excludes transformation costs in both years, as well as avon-related acquisition costs and non-recurring purchase price allocation effects in 2020, was brl963.2 million. this represents a very strong increase of 68.5% with margin of 10.2%, up 260 basis points.
the strong increase in adjusted ebitda and margin resulted from higher sales and operational leverage at natura & co latam and isa. turning to slide 8, we see that natura & co reached brl60.2 million in underlying net income in the first quarter, reversing the negative brl64.1 million [phonetic] we posted in q1 last year. the sharp 122.8% improvement in q1 was driven mainly by the strong increase in ebitda and the line net income excludes avon acquisition-related effects of brl215.3 million. this include transformation and integration costs of brl134.1 million in the purchase price allocation amortization effect for brl111.3 million. this was partially offset by positive discontinued operations expense of brl28.7 million and positive non-controlling interest of brl1.4 million.
i think it is important to take into account, natura & co posted a reported net loss in q1 of brl155.2 million. this marks a very significant improvement over the net loss of brl820.8 million in q1 of 2020, driven by higher ebitda and lower income tax expense, partially offset by higher depreciation of brl47 million and higher financial expenses of brl19 million.
slide 9, on slide 9, we look on our cash and balance sheet. we ended the quarter with a strong cash position of brl6.6 billion, in line with projections and well above our minimum thresholds. we continued to deleverage our balance sheet and at the end of the quarter, natura &co holding's consolidated net debt to ebitda ratio stood at 1.18 times, significantly, down from 3.93 times in q1 last year, including the effects of ifrs 16.
as roberto mentioned, we improved our indebtedness profile with a $1 billion sustainability linked bond issued by natura cosmetics with a guarantee by natura &co. the funds will be used to refinance existing debt, in line with the group's liability management plan to improve its capital structure. the seven-year note mature on may 2028, and carry an interest coupon of 4.1% to 5% per year. the second graph provides you with our amortization schedule and shows that even before the bond proceeds, we have cash far in excess of brl3.2 billion in debt maturing this year.
let's turn now to our performance by business unit, beginning with natura & co latam on slide 11. total net sales were up 24.6% in reais and 15.9% at constant currency in q1. this excellent performance was driven by growth in reais at both in natura and avon brands.
natura brand was up 29.6% in reais and 24.6% at constant-currency, supported by a strong performance across the board, both in brazil and hispanic latam, attesting to the strength of our digital social selling model and the robust innovation pipeline.
the avon brand reported another consecutive quarter of growth of 20% in reais and 8.1% in constant currency, briefing by key markets in hispanic latam. natura &co.'s clear leadership in the cft market in latin america was confirmed but euromonitor. the group recorded market share gains of 0.7 percentage points in 2020, reaching 12.5%. brazil was even stronger with market share of 17%, up a 4 [phonetic] percentage points over the prior year.
on slide 12, sales of the natura brand in brazil rose 12.6% in q1 with market share gains. growth was driven by continued digital social selling penetration and increasing the average number of consultants of 14.2% versus q1 2020 and higher volumes of most categories.
natura brazil's online sales, including e-commerce and social selling, were up 150% versus q1 2020, notably driven by consultants and online stores. at the end of q1, we surpassed 1.1 million [phonetic] natura consultant online stores with a significant year-on-year increase in the number of orders and visits.
the natura consultant loyalty index in brazil remained strong and business leaders' loyalty was also significantly higher versus last year. [indecipherable] consultant was down 3.5% in the quarter after 17 consecutive quarters of growth since the successful implementation of our segmented relationship selling module in mid-2017. this is a result of an increase in our consultant base since q3. this temporary [phonetic] dilutes productivity as new consultants are in early stages of building up their activity. over time, we expect this consultants to progressing higher productivity segments on our commercial module.
in spanish latam, the natura brand recorded spectacular growth of 60.4%, supported by all markets, notably, argentina, chile, and peru. natura saw productivity increase and an expansion in the consultant base of 19.4%. the quarter ended with a significantly higher consultant loyalty index in the region, up 530 basis points versus q1 2020. we also launched natura's e-commerce in mexico, completing the brand's e-commerce platform in the region.
turning to avon brand on slide 13. avon's integration in latam is on track with important progress in procurement, customer service, financial services distribution and digital. in brazil, the avon brand's revenue was down 2.8% in q1 2021, versus q1 2020. this decrease is largely is in effect of the preparation for the new segmented commercial model implementation. as we saw in 2017 at the natura brand, the structural change caused the drop in the number of representatives. with once the [phonetic] representative base stabilizes and the representatives' progress toward higher segment levels based on higher sales, we expect productivity growth to resume. volume was slightly up in the quarter, picking up in march.
a highlight of the period was the avon brand sponsorship in the reality show big brother brazil. this helped avon connect with younger consumer, strengthening the brand's power and improving consumer perception. the brand engagement with the show's audience in various online and offline platforms and we saw e-commerce sales nearly triple with record-breaking number of impressions in social media channels.
in hispanic latam, avon's net revenue grew by a strong 35.1%, supported by a higher activity level and high representative productivity, which helped offset the 5.5% [phonetic] decline in average number of representatives. growth was driven by fashion and home, and most beauty categories such as body care, fragrances, and face care. white-collar continued to be impacted by the pandemic effects.
on slide 14, adjusted ebitda for natura & co latam more than doubled in the quarter, growing by 119% to brl630.3 million, driven by revenue performance and operational leverage in brazil at the natura brand and hispanic latam, both at natura and avon brands. adjusted ebitda margin expanded by 530 basis points to 12.2%.
let's now move to avon international on slide 16. net revenue was up 11.4% in q1 in reais and was down 10.7% at constant currency. sales were impacted by the second wave of covid in certain markets, notable in central and eastern europe, and also by key categories like fragrances and cosmetics, which were more affected by the pandemic. avon gained market share in q1 2021 versus q1 2020 in western europe, driven by uk and in asia pacific. all regions improved share month-after-month, including avon stock countries. avon uk's market share increased for the fourth consecutive quarter and it became the third brand in the beauty market over the last 12 months, up from 10th one year earlier.
avon international's adjusted ebitda was brl97.4 million with margin of 4.1%, down 70 basis points due to the impact of lower revenue and higher strategic investments in digital and commercial areas to accelerate future growth.
on slide 18, we now move to the body shop, with sales up 47.7% in reais and 10.7% at constant currency, driven mainly by the uk and north america. we saw particularly strong performance of the at-home channel, up 121% [phonetic] and e-commerce, which was up 119% versus last year.
together, both channels represented slightly more than half of the total sales. and this growth more than offset the impact of the pandemic second wave in retail. about two-thirds of retail stores were open at the end of the quarter, while the uk and other markets in europe were under lockdown in q1.
ebitda rose by 45.4% to brl184.2 million, while ebitda margin was 14.7%, down 30 basis points year-on-year. this largely reflected the impact of the buyback of the japan head franchisee. excluding this effect, ebitda margin would have been up 110 basis points versus last year to 15.4% despite the pandemic's impacts or with daily sales and channel mix.
on slide 20, aesop again recorded an outstanding performance. net revenue was up by exceptional 71.9% in reais and 30.6% at constant currency in the quarter. aesop growth in all regions. performance was particularly strong in asia, with sales up 67% at constant currency. revenue grew by 6% globally, supported by strong positive like-for-like growth in asia. although stores remained closed across europe, in canada and parts of australia, online again offset the retail impact with impressive growth of 102%. online sales accounted for 29% of total revenue. q1 2021 ebitda more than doubled to brl156.6 million with ebitda margin of 26.7%, up 390 basis points, driven by top line sales growth, higher ebitda, notably in asia and cost efficiency.
let me now handle back to roberto.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
thank you, filippo. let me now conclude on slide 23 with the key takeaways. first of all, we are on a sustainable growth path. the natura brand continues to post double-digit growth, both in brazil and latin america, while the avon brand is growing in hispanic latam.
the body shop and aesop continue their strong growth, even with retail being impacted by the pandemic. second, natura & co omni-channel model has shown its strength throughout the covid-19 crisis, helping to offset the impact of the pandemic. all of our businesses are increasingly omni-channel and digitalization of consultants and reps continues to gather momentum. digital social selling and e-commerce have been key to our strong market outperformance in the quarter.
let me now conclude on slide 23 with the key takeaways. first of all, we are on a sustainable growth path. the natura brand continues to post double-digit growth, both in brazil and latin america, while the avon brand is growing in hispanic latam. the body shop and aesop continue their strong growth even with retail being impacted by the [indecipherable] completed the issue of our $1 billion es&g bond. so, while the covid pandemic is far from over and we continue to be vigilant, we continue to grow and progress on our strategic initiatives.
thank you very much for your attention and we are now going to open the q&a session and filippo, jp, and i are happy to take your questions. so, the floor is now yours.

ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] richard cathcart with bradesco is online with a question. please, go ahead.
richard cathcart -- bradesco
hi, good morning everyone. two questions for me. the first one on the natura & co latam business, very big increase in margin there and even when we compare to pre-covid levels in the 1q19 pro forma numbers. so i just wanted to -- if you could give us a little bit more color on the various drivers of margin improvement, natura versus avon and also brazil, latin america and perhaps what we can expect through the rest of the year? and then the second one, just a quick one, if you could give us any color on mother's day, obviously an important day for you guys for the sector as a whole, we get positive feedback from other retailers. so it would be interesting to hear your feedback as well? thanks very much.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
hi, richard. roberto here. thanks for the question. i'll kick off here and then i'll turn to jp. so on the margins, we are very pleased with the margin progression. but, i would also remind everybody that we have some of the synergies kicking in, which is very encouraging to see that they are materializing, it's helping us navigating some of the pressures that we're seeing in some of our raw materials, etc. so we'll continue to monitor that, but we're very pleased with the efficiency that we are seeing in distribution and manufacturing and really materializing in margins.
i'll turn to jp to talk a little bit about hispanic latam that we're very happy with also the progress in margin and also a little bit of mother's day.
so jp, please.
joao paulo ferreira -- chief executive officer
hello richard. so the market in latin america has been seeing a very modest growth, slightly better in hispanic latin america than in brazil in the beginning of the year. natura has been riding on significant advances in brand power and brand preference, and amazing market share gains, as throughout last year. so that gave us a base of continued growth. i remind you that the share of the natura brand in many of the hispanic latin american countries is still below our fair share, particularly in the northern part of the region, colombia and mexico. so on that base, you saw that amazing growth and there is our reasons to think that that's going to continue.
similarly with avon, now we are benefiting from the quick wins, the harmonization of various commercial practices, i've talked about in previous occasions, also the much sharper selection within our portfolio there, of categories cross country [phonetic], hero brands, and we could use the mix of different categories in our favor.
so, we're pretty happy to see avon growing again in hispanic latin america with a very smaller dispersion as well in terms of the various markets. so all-in-all, that volume increase also helped us with margins, of course, plus the synergies that roberto referred to.
richard cathcart -- bradesco
that's perfect. thank you very much. perhaps just quickly on mother's day. if you could?
joao paulo ferreira -- chief executive officer
here in latin america, we are pretty pleased with the performance of our mother's day campaigns throughout the channels and the brands.
richard cathcart -- bradesco
okay, thanks so much.

robert ford with bank of america is online with a question. please, go ahead.
robert e.ford -- bank of america
hey, thank you, and good morning everybody. and congratulations on the quarter. yes, i was hoping maybe you could discuss some of the changes that accompany the new rep compensation model in brazil at avon. clearly there is, there appear to be some changes in terms of the profile of network leaders and there is certainly a cultural change and the new kpis. i mean i was hoping you could expand on that to the extent it's not strategic. and given your prior experiences and learnings, and now greater scale, how long do you think it will take to stabilize the network in brazil and then begin to grow reps and productivity rates?
joao paulo ferreira -- chief executive officer
hello rob. jp here. so the nature of the change of course. well, first of all, the rollout happened toward the end of the first quarter. so, a significant part of the quarter was dedicated to preparing the ground for that, which include changes in the sales structure, significant changes in the sales structure.
now, as regards with the representatives, they are now on a model that values lifetime value and progression and segmentation which has to be communicated again and again to cascade down that huge network. and as with regards to sales leaders, they are now required to dedicate time to developing those reps, so that -- teaching them more about the products and how to get to develop their client base and by large -- rather than just acquiring new reps.
so the changes are important. based on natura's previous experience, we expect the system to stabilize within one to two quarters. so the second half of this year, it should be stable again.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
rob, the other thing that i would add, which is also important in this change on the commercial model, it's not just happening in brazilian latin america for avon. i mean, brazil, as jp said, already implemented that and we are encouraged by the early results, but we are doing the same thing at avon international. and in fact, we already have two pilots with a new segmentation model implemented, one in south africa and the other one in the nordics. and the results are pretty encouraging from increase retention productivity and the goal for avon internationally to expand to four key markets in the second half of this year and then really for all markets in the first half of next year. so, again, applying all the learnings, all the kpis, all the lifetime value approach that natura has taken very successfully, it's now being implemented at avon, both in latin america and avon international.
joao paulo ferreira -- chief executive officer
and i guess, i should have said, roberto, that the results in brazil for avon are above our expectations.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
correct, right.
joao paulo ferreira -- chief executive officer
[speech overlap] very pleased, bob.
robert e.ford -- bank of america
and then just one, my second question is as you integrate avon into the natura systems platform, what functionality does that enable across administrative and commercial considerations?
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
so, i will start, i mean on the administrative thing, i mean especially in latin america, we are integrating more. but i would say, even there are some now integration that goes beyond north america. so hr platform now, it's been integrated. so we now have all associates in latin america under one platform from compensation, benefits and those things were not small undertakings and that's done.
we now are doing the same thing in some of the other areas, of course, the whole supply chain in procurement, distribution, manufacturing, it's coming and that's producing some of the synergies already that are helping us with gross margin. in terms of the commercial one, i'll invite jp to talk a little bit about the platform, especially with social selling and some of the plans for integration here.
joao paulo ferreira -- chief executive officer
yes, i think it's worth mentioning. for instance, the credit card [phonetic] collection engine, which is now been fully integrated improving the way we assign credit and also reducing delinquency rates. the other one i think it's worth mentioning is the crm. so the way we now can track with those transactions, the representatives and use the same crm algorithms that we use for not natura now adjusted for avon which is already helping to drive additional revenues.
and, of course, on the social selling tools that we keep spreading across all the various countries, you're aware of, producing sharing content and linking it back to their online stores.
robert e.ford -- bank of america
great, that's very helpful. thank you very much.

helena villares with itau is in line with the question. please, go ahead.
helena villares -- itau bba
hi guys, good morning. thank you for taking my question. so my question goes to bs [phonetic]. we are very interested in the growth, the company, the brand has been showing in the last quarters, it's much above the historical level that we had seen. so what we are trying to understand here, if this new channel, the online and the at-home channels, if they are able to reach new clients, new type of clients, and if so, what kind of new public are you able to reach, are you able to skill that the brand is being, it's achieving their purpose in these new channels? that's the first question. and in this sense, what kind of growth we are already seeing coming from asia for this brand or it's very early stage yet and we can see much more growth coming from asia? that's our question. thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
hi, helena. roberto here. thanks for the question. you're right and we are seeing, in fact, this increase in e-commerce and at home through social selling and really bringing also different profiles of customers to the body shop, interesting -- this is not just in isolation.
while we are seeing a tremendous job by the body shop team is really -- we igniting the brand to its purpose. right? a more activist, a brand that has no clarity in terms of its position in the marketplace. i mean we just launched a couple of products, some iconic brands and like the white mask, [indecipherable] and those things are really resonating with existing customers, but also attracting new customers, which also gets enhanced by this expansion of the e-commerce and the at-home.
so we are very encouraged by those results, and i think as we also started to reopen stores, some of the new store designs that is somehow we stopped some of the rollout last year, as we also progress and expand some of those new layouts, which we feel stations and everything else, we also think that this will create more momentum. on asia, i still think that it's early for the body shop. we are seeing spectacular results on aesop. i think there is a lot of upside in asia for the body shop as we know. we acquired the head franchisee in japan, there is some early good indicators, but there is a lot of opportunity and upside for the body shop in asia, particularly in japan.
helena villares -- itau bba

ruben couto from santander is on with the question. please, go ahead.
ruben couto -- santander
good morning, everyone. can you share more color on avon performance in international markets, particularly in the uk. we were surprised with the jump to the third spot in the uk, specifically which is good news. in the earnings release you mentioned contribution from [indecipherable] behind this performance. but what is behind all of these, i mean, now thinking specifically about the categories, is there something related to new product launches? maybe to the relaunch of the brand globally or even related to improvements in sales channel. can you elaborate a little bit further on this performance and a second question actually a follow-up to richard's question on mother's day? i mean you have been highlighting over the best couple of views on how the natura brand manage to gain give and we noticed that avon had some developments in the same direction. i still understood that you guys were pleased, you think it's a pharmacy matters there.
yeah. can you hear me?
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
yeah, we can.
ruben couto -- santander
thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
yes, we can hear. can you hear us?
ruben couto -- santander
yeah, i can. sorry about that.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
okay. okay. no, no worries. thank you for the question, ruben. so on avon international and in particular uk, we are seeing really significant improvement in many fronts. one, we made already some changes on the earnings model for the reps in uk, which again we simplify and has been applied now in many other markets at avon and that is creating more traction with the channel. we are seeing productivity increase in uk.
the channel is growing, which is very encouraged. so that's one factor. the second is digitalization. uk has been the market that we've been applying more the social selling, the e-brochure, and we are seeing quarter-after-quarter strong increase in adoption of the digital platforms and very strong increase in terms of sales through e-brochures, so that's point number two. and point number three, we are seeing traction in some of the new products. our protanal [phonetic] is really working very well under a new and creating some good momentum specifically for the uk market.
so i think it's a combination, but if i were to tell you one thing is probably, again the commercial model, the simplification of the model and getting more traction with the reps combined with the digitalization.
joao paulo ferreira -- chief executive officer
also, he also asked about gifting for avon. so yes, gifting became one of the areas of opportunity for avon. we are developing that offering based on our learnings here in latin america, still isn't as important on relative terms as it is for natura, but it is growing.
ruben couto -- santander

andrew ruben from morgan stanley is online with the question. please go ahead.
andrew ruben -- morgan stanley
hi, thanks very much for the question. i was curious for a bit more detail on the rep count debt natura brazil. i'm curious with the newer consultants. if there is any color you can provide on how long a consultant takes to ramp and any sense on what you think now might be the right number of consultants if you're looking to increase the base versus, say, 1 to 1.1 million [phonetic]. any color there would be very helpful. thank you.
joao paulo ferreira -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question. so normally we look at consultants like beginners when they have less than one year in the activity and mature when we cross that line. productivity increases over time. that is well known. by the way, this is one of the reasons why you saw consultant's productivity coming down this quarter on an aggregate basis, due to a much higher number of beginners, which joined the network bid last year. and the very, very good news is that they were retained. it's not that they entered during the pandemic, the crisis, and went away, they were retained, thanks to the strength of that value proposition.
so that productivity should grow continuously right now in the coming quarters. now, our strategy has been for many years to try and get modest growth in brazil in the number of consultants, right, and a much more aggressive growth in hispanic latin america where there is still more room to increase that consultant base.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
yeah, andrew, and again just to complement jp said, the very exciting thing is that the digitalization is attracting a different profile of consultants wrap in [phonetic] applying the same lifetime value segmentation. we expect that -- also is going to translate in higher productivity down the road, but it's exciting to see the channel expanding with a different profile because of the now enrollment in all the process being done through social selling.
andrew ruben -- morgan stanley

tobias stingelin -- citibank
good morning, everybody. thank you for taking the question and congratulations on the strong quarter. i have two quick ones on my side. and just for going back to your team, already talked about, so going back to avon brand in brazil. it was very interesting discussion, a very helpful color on the rate base. but i wanted to explore more productivity. and you mentioned in the release that wants to the base stabilizes you expect incremental productivity? so if could give us any color on how that, how should we expect that productivity to evolve going forward would be very interesting and very helpful. and the second point, in the hispanic latam, you talked about -- productivity is very, very strong and you remained so -- but looking into the e-commerce impact and you mentioned that you launched the e-commerce platform in mexico. so, how do you expect these dynamics to going forward? right. how do you expect the e-commerce platform to impact the productivity in the region. it would be very, very helpful as well. thanks.
joao paulo ferreira -- chief executive officer
thanks for the question. so as regard with avon's representative productivity in brazil. the commercial model that has been introduced is to foster productivity increase similar to what happened in natura. so if you go back to early 2017 and see how the productivity went up, productivity went up quarter after quarter.
so this is what we are aiming at for avon, right. so that's number one. as regards to introduction of e-commerce in some other geographies across the region, well, first of all, that allows us to achieve new customers, new shoppers in different shopping occasions. we increased the base of customers we have. and as consultants learn how to operate their online stores, that also increases their productivities as they can reach new clients, which they wouldn't be able to do otherwise.

irma sgarz with goldman sachs is online with the question. please, go ahead.
irma sgarz -- goldman sachs
yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. i was curious, we're hearing a lot about the different input price pressures that companies across globally -- but also specifically in brazil are experiencing. so i was just curious about how you're thinking about price increases across your brands, specifically in brazil, but maybe also in some of the other markets where specifically where you are experiencing pricing pressures and how you're thinking about the ability to raise prices versus the ability toward the consumer to absorb any potential price increases? thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
hi, irma. i was started and then maybe, filippo if you want to complement. so listen, we are seeing and we continue to be monitoring that carefully i across all geographies. but as you saw, actually our gross margin across all business went up this quarter. and the reason for that is twofold, one, as we mentioned, we are seeing some of the synergies, the efficiencies kicking in and any most part is also impacting the gross margin. so that's helping us on one hand. on the other hand, we are also doing revenue management across all business in terms of portfolio promotion and make sure that we are managing that through. as you know, i mean, taking the body shop over the last two years, we were able to reduce discount by a magnitude of about 30% to about 15% on average.
so, managing the portfolio promotion schemes, some categories is probably the first line of defense against this on top of the synergies and the efficiencies that we are having across our network. and again, i would also remind all of you that we now as we updated our synergies, we included some synergies that are coming outside of latin america. and one example of that is moving the production of body butters to avon poland manufacturing and that is creating a lot of efficiencies also for the body shop, for example.
so we'll continue to monitor the situation. we think the team has done incredibly well in being able to offset thus far, resulting in increase in gross margin, but it is one area of attention and that will continue to be monitored.
filippo, do you want to add something?
jose antonio de almeida filippo -- chief financial officer
yes, hi, irma. yes, we will be facing pressures definitely as all of the industry in terms of commodity prices inflation some effects as well. this is not something that's not new for us. we've been dealing with this for a long time. i think that's important to recall about our relationship with the supply chain that we take -- it's very differentiated than we managed that very well. but also like roberto said, there is a lot of opportunities and we are already executing in terms of synergies and efficiency gains on this, like merging distribution centers, planning logistics [phonetic], a lot of opportunities there also we will take into account, and using that can kind of help us on addressing those challenges in terms of the cost.

joseph giordano -- jp morgan
hi, good morning everyone. thanks for taking my question. so there is actually a couple. and so the first one is on the cash flow generation. so the company is like quite [indecipherable] at this point very close to its target. so my question here is if we should be seeing you guys getting more active on the m&a front and buying like some niche brands like aesop and accelerate them on the new global platform. so that's the first one. and the second one is, like if you guys could provide some updates on the development of natura brand in asia, and here like particularly in malaysia? thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- chairman
hi jo. roberto here. thank you for the question. listen, we're very pleased with the deleverage and again how we continue to be -- progress in our capital structure. and again, very pleased with the successful bond issue that we did this quarter. but again, the plans that we share with the market and the guidance, was all based on organic growth, and that's the focus that we have right now.
of course, we have the responsibility to continue to monitor the market and we'll continue to do so in terms of opportunities, but i would say right now the focus is again on the integration, the turnaround of avon continue the momentum of digitalization across all of our business, great momentum of natura, body shop, aesop. so we still think that we have a runaway that is very exciting for the business with the organic growth.
regarding asia for natura as you know, we have a pilot in malaysia. i would say that it's still early. last year was of course a year there were so many variables and etc. that is difficult to really read.
so we continued to focus on getting the right portfolio, the right go-to-market, the right positioning. once we have more confidence about the model that we are testing with natura malaysia, then the goal is to expand to some of the markets. so hopefully, we'll get a better reading by the end of this year, and then we'll come up with the right plan.

at the same time, the body shop, the first time came as part of the top 50 in the ranking which also shows the progress that the team has been doing and even continues to be within the ranking. so very, very encouraged by that. i want to also send a shot out to our entire teams, associates network for what we believe was a remarkable quarter under this still very challenging set of circumstances. so thank you all very much for that.
and thank you all very much for your attention and i hope you all stay well, taking care of yourselves and your families and loved ones in this very challenging pandemic. hopefully with the vaccines, we will be able to turn the corner. we are seeing some green shoots in some countries and that's encouraging, but there are a long way to go in some of the other markets. so, stay well, stay safe. thank you very much, everybody.

roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, viviane, and hello to everyone. thank you again for joining us. i hope all of you are continuing to be safe and well in this still challenging times.
let me begin on slide 3 with an overview of our second quarter highlights. natura & co turned in another strong performance in the second quarter of 2021. our group sales grew more than 36%, outperforming once again the global cft market and we posted a significant increase in net income. adjusted ebitda was also up strongly, while margin was impacted by a base effect that guilherme will explain in more detail as q2 last year benefited from exceptional circumstances of some government support in a strict cost containment at the height of the pandemic last year. but it's important to point out that without this impact, adjusted ebitda margin would have been up by 210 basis points in the period. for the first half of the year, we achieved over 9% adjusted ebitda margin, a healthy 120 basis points higher than same period last year. this strong performance was achieved while we continue to operate in a challenging healthy environment with lockdowns and restrictions in certain key markets. this reflects, once again the relevance and resilience of our omnichannel business model, the power appeal of our brands, products in our unparalleled direct to customer reach. we saw double-digit sales growth across our businesses and a very good performance in our key markets. natura &co latam saw growth by both, the natura and avon brands with a very strong performance in hispanic latam.
avon international also posted strong growth and market share gains in some key markets. and the body shop and aesop also were up significantly even while continue to face challenges from covid-19. digital enable represented over 51% of our total sales, four times above pre-pandemic levels. another digital highlight was the strong growth of our [indecipherable] payment platform, which we are piloting at natura brazil. we had a 50% gain in new accounts, totaling 220,000 in six months, and almost brl2 billion in total payment volume. we are particularly pleased with the performance of avon in both latam and international. the sales growth we saw coupled with market share gains in key markets and categories are a demonstration that avon's turnaround is underway.
pilots of the new commercial model, both in the nordics and in south africa show positive initial results and representative satisfaction has increased. the synergies are in line with the plan at $76.5 million in the first half with $41 million in cost to achieve. avon international's transformational plan is also progressing and it's ebitda margin remained broadly stable even while investing more in digital, it and marketing to drive future growth. and we have a very solid balance sheet. we ended up the quarter with a robust cash position of brl8 billion and we made further headway on deleveraging with our net debt to ebitda ratio at 1.43 times at the end of the quarter compared to 3.63 times in q2 last year.
natura &co posted strong growth in net income, which reached brl235 million in the quarter, an increase over brl600 million versus the same quarter last year and almost brl1 billion improvement year-to-date compared to last year. the gain this quarter was driven by a new benefit from the avon integration related to our corporate structure optimization. so overall, i think we can be very proud of our performance in a context that remains very challenging due to the uncertainty, restrictions and lockdowns still very present in many markets in which we operate. it is a demonstration of the strength of our business model, which aims to make positive impact while delivering sustainable growth in value creation.
on the following slide, we show that we made continued advances in esg as we celebrated in june the first anniversary of our commitment to life our 2030 sustainability vision. the slide shows a number of actions, but let me mention just a couple of highlights per pillar. to address the climate crisis and protect the amazon, natura &co begun building the plenamata portal, a platform designed to engage different stakeholders to achieve zero deforestation, conservation and regeneration of the amazon by disclosing scientific data. as part of our aim to protect human rights and to be human kind, we have reached 96% of our workforce receiving a living wage on track to reach 100% in 2023. natura &co also setup ambitions to be the first multinational to ensure our workforce reflect the demographic composition of the societies in which it operates.
and to help embrace circularity and regeneration, as an example, the body shop is rolling out review stations in 400 stores and we will ensure that all of its company market participate in the return, recycle, repeat project having rollout almost 300 to date. overall, we are also on track to achieve 95% or more on biodegradable formulas by 2013.
with that i will now hand over to guilherme for a closer look at our financial performance. as you all know, guilherme took over as a group cfo last month after completing a very smooth transition. guilherme welcome again and over to you.
guilherme castellan -- chief financial officer
thank you very much, roberto and hello to everyone. i'm delighted to be on this call and very much looking forward to meeting all of you.
on slide 6, you see that we posted very strong consolidated net sales growth in the quarter of 36.2% in reais and 31.7% in constant currency, reaching brl9.5 billion. this reflects double-digit growth in reais in all of our brands, as you see on the right hand side of this slide, despite lingering effects of covid. i will detail performance by brand shortly.
it's important to highlight that as you recall we face a cyber incident at avon last year in q2, that shifted brl454 million in sales from q2 to q3. without that effect, net revenue will have been up by 27.9% in reais and 24.4% at constant currency, which is still ahead of the global cft market.
in h1, net revenue reached brl19 billion up 30.8% in reais and 18.9% in constant currency.
on slide 7, we focus on our digital performance. as roberto mentioned, digitally enabled sales, which include online sales from e-commerce, social selling as well as relationship selling using our main digital apps represented 51.1% of our total sales, up from 48% in q1 and compared to 55% in q2 last year when most stores were closed. we are significantly above pre-pandemic levels at all our brands as you see on this slide. total online sales for all brands are between 2 and 4 times pre-pandemic levels.
slide 8 shows that we posted a reported ebitda of brl603 million in the quarter with margin of 6.6%. adjusted ebitda, which excludes the brl181 million in transformational costs, cost selective synergies, avon related acquisition effects and non-recurring effects was brl811 million. this represents a very strong increase of 31.9% driven by synergies, pricing and sales leverage, which help us to offset inflationary pressures and higher prices of raw materials.
adjusted ebitda margin was 8.5%, down 30 bps year-on-year. this margin reflects one-offs as a result of the pandemic as last year's q2 benefited from government support and cost containment actions. excluding these one-offs, adjusted ebitda margin will have improved by 210 bps, all the businesses would have shown margin expansion, despite investments to drive growth.
in h1, reported ebitda is up by a very strong 83% to brl1.5 billion. adjusted ebitda was up by 49.5% to brl1.8 billion with margin up 120 bps at 9.4%, which puts us on track to achieve on our full year target.
now turning to slide 9, we see the natura &co posted a strong improvement in underlying net income in the second quarter, reaching brl482 million, reversing the negative brl191 million in q2 last year. underlying net income excludes avon acquisition related effects and ppa amortization. we benefit in the quarter from a favorable net tax effect of brl474 million, which includes brl823 million in new gains recognized as deferred income tax resulting from the avon integration and corporate restructuring enabled by the prepayment of the avon 2022 bonds. this effect was partially offset by a 6 percentage point increase in u.k. income tax of 25%. net income was brl235 million reversing a loss of brl388 million in the same quarter last year. the swing of more than brl600 million is driven by lower financial expenses and new gains from the avon integration-related to the corporate restructuring.
in h1, net income reached at brl80 million, an improvement of almost brl1.3 billion compared to h1 in the previous year. on slide 10, we look at our cash and balance sheet position. we are in the quarter with a strong cash position of brl8 billion in line with projections and well above our minimum thresholds. we continue to deleverage our balance sheet and at the end of the quarter consolidated net debt to ebitda was 1.4 times, significantly lower from 3.6 times in the year ago period.
we improved our indebtedness profile with a $1 billion sustainability linked bond issued in may by natura cosmeticos guaranteed by natura &co. the funds were used to prepay the $750 million bond maturing in 2023 as well as refinancing other existing debt in line with the group's liability management plan, while at the same time demonstrating our commitment to achieving our esg targets. the second graph provides with demonstration schedule and shows that we have cash in excess of maturities up to 2024.
let's turn now to our performance by business unit beginning with natura &co latam on slide 12. total net sales were up 39% in reais and 37% at constant currency in q2. this strong performance was driven by double-digit growth at both natura and avon brands, both in reais and in constant currency with significant growth in hispanic latam at both brands. excluding the previously mentioned cyber incident, growth would have been 26.7%. the natura brand was up 25% in reais in 26% in constant currency, while the avon brand also reported very encouraging growth of 28% in reais and 26% in constant currency.
in h1, net sales were up 31.7% in reais and 26% in constant currency, with double-digit growth at both the natura and avon brands. we stated for the cyber incident growth would have been 25.6%. another highlight of the quarter was a strong growth of &co pay, our digital payments platform, which supports the growth of digital social selling. we saw expansion of over 50% in new accounts to reach more than 220,000 and total payment volume in h1 was nearly brl2 billion.
now on slide 13. we look at natura brands. sales at the natura brand in brazil rose 8% in q2 on top of tough comps with the market share gains driven by core categories supported by successful mother's day and valentine's day campaigns and a significant increase in brand preference. growth was also driven by higher volume, continue advances in digital social selling and the 14% increase in the average number of consultants versus q2 2020 and the loyalty index was up by 700 bps versus q2 last year. in hispanic latam, the natura brand recorded a growth of 68% [phonetic] and 78% in constant currency, supported by all markets, notably, argentina, chile and mexico.
natura saw productivity increase and expansion the consultant base of 19% and a significantly higher consultant index in the region. a particular highlight was mexico which became natura's largest marketing sales after brazil. after launching, natura's e-commerce in mexico in q1, we opened our first flagship store in mexico city as we continue to rollout our omnichannel strategy. natura's performance in h1 was also strong with sales growth of 10% in brazil and 64% in hispanic latam.
now turning to the avon brand on slide 14. avon integration in latam is on track and we are seeing signs of recovery similar to those we witnessed at natura at the start of its turnaround in 2017. in brazil, the avon brand's revenue grew by 26% in q2. excluding the cyber incident, sales would have been broadly flat. we successfully rollout the new commercial model in late q1 and are seeing positive initial signs supported by several indicators, such as higher representative productivity, a double-digit increase in representative satisfaction score and stronger brand preference and brand power. this translated into market share gains supported by marketing investments made earlier in the year.
the rollout of the new commercial model led to an expected drop of 4.7% in representatives compared to q2 2020. in hispanic latam, we saw very strong growth of 83% in reais and 72% in constant currency. excluding the cyber incident growth would have been at strong 49%. growth came from all markets and categories and was supported by a 10% increase in the number of representatives and higher representative productivity.
in h1, growth was 10% in brazil or minus 1.6% excluding the cyber effect and 55% in hispanic latam or 47% ex-cyber. on slide 15, adjusted ebitda for natura &co latam grew by more than 60% in the quarter, reaching brl598 million driven by strong revenue growth and synergies from the integration with avon, which more than offset raw material inflation pressure and foreign currency headwinds. adjusted ebitda margin was up 140 bps to 10.8%. excluding one-off effects as a result of the pandemic that boosted the q2 2020 ebitda, such as cost containment actions, adjusted ebitda margin this quarter would have improved by 270 bps.
in h1, adjusted ebitda was brl1.2 billion with margin of 11.5%, up 340 bps.
let's now move to avon international on slide 17. like for avon latam, we saw a strong growth at avon international in the quarter both in sales and in adjusted ebitda. net revenues was up 34% in q2 in reais or 29% ex-cyber and up 27% in constant currency, although some markets continue to be affected by the pandemic, especially in central and eastern europe. we recorded market share gains in key markets, such as the philippines, south africa, romania and italy.
all beauty categories reported growth and increasing market share, notably fragrances and color. the average number of representatives in the quarter was flat compared to q2 last year, and we ended the quarter with 7.4% more representatives than in q2 2020. overall representative satisfaction show positive momentum. pilots of the new commercial model in the nordics and south africa have shown initial positive results in productivity, sales growth and number of representatives. adjusted ebitda grew 30% to brl94 million with margin of 4.3%, down 10 bps as strong sales leverage and transformational savings offset the impact of higher inflation and increased investments in digital and it to drive market share an accelerated future growth.
ebitda margins is in line with its transformational plan targets. excluding one-offs effects as a result of the pandemic, adjusted ebitda margin this quarter would have been improved by 260 bps. in h1, net revenue was up 21% in reais and 4.6% in constant currency, while adjusted ebitda margin was 4.2%.
on slide 19, we now move on to the body shop, the sales were up 24.3% in reais and 14.2% in constant currency with growth in all of its regions. stores reopen in the u.k., the body shop's biggest market. while in other countries, we had continue restrictions or even lockdowns, such as in australia and canada. this resulted in approximately 18% lost store days in the quarter. nevertheless, own store performance grew 140% compared to q2 last year and accounted for 42% of total sales in q2, more than double the same quarter last year. this was partially offset by the expected slowdown in e-commerce and at home reflecting a rebalancing of channels. still e-commerce sales are currently double pre-pandemic levels and the body shop at home sales are three times what they were in q2 '19. the body shop's ebitda in q2 grew 9.2% to brl159 million, margin at 13% was down 180 bps as q2 2020 benefited from approximately 600 bps from effects as a result of the pandemic. excluding these effects, ebitda margin would have increased by 450 bps in spite of a channel rebalancing effect and the impact of last october's japan buyback, driven by strong operational leverage.
in h1, sales were up 35.5% in reais and 12.4% in constant currency, while ebitda rose 26.6%. on slide 21, aesop again recorded an outstanding performance with net revenue growth of 47% in q2 in reais and 41% in constant currency. all regions showed growth, particular the americas and asia. even with the continuous challenges brought by covid, we saw about 11% of lost store days. retail accounted for 78% of sales in the quarter with store sales up 129% in constant currency versus q2 2020. online sales at 23% of the total were down from their peak as expected as the stores reopen, but are still twice their pre-pandemic levels. ebitda in q2 '21, reached brl118 million with margin of 21%, it was down 580 bps as q2 2020 benefited from approximately 650 bps from one-off effects as a result of the pandemic. excluding this effect, ebitda margin would have increased by 90 bps despite increased investments in expansion, three launches in fragrances and channel rebalancing effect.
in h1, sales were up by a very strong 58.7% in reais and 35.5% in constant currency, while ebitda rose 51.9%.
let me now hand back to roberto. over to you roberto.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, guilherme and let me now conclude on slide 23 with the key takeaways. so we are on a sustainable growth path. we posted another strong quarter continuing to out outperform the global cft market with double-digit growth across the board and the strong growth in net income. supported among other factors by new gains from avon integration.
second, the avon integration is on track. while we are seeing at avon in latam and international, kind of replicates what we saw in natura when it initiated its turnaround, which is new business model, commercial model back in 2017. this quarter we saw a strong growth both in latam and international for avon with market share gains in key markets. the transformation is going according to plan and we are seeing encouraging results from the new commercial model where it has been rollout or still in pilot.
third, we are making further advances on esg with progresses on all the pillars of our 2030 sustainability vision. let me highlight that we continue to make significant donations to causes that are important to us, especially right now to fight still covid-19.
and fourth, we continue to see increasing traction of our omnichannel model with digital sales significantly above their pre-pandemic level even as stores reopen. i went on slide 24 by reiterating that we are on track to achieve our 2021 targets and the 2023 guidance represent our investor day back in april of high single-digit top line growth on a compound annual growth basis and mid-teens ebitda margin at the end of the period.
let me flag also that we do expect the third quarter to face a demanding comparable base since q3 last year benefited from the phasing effect of the cyber incident and pandemic related one-off effect of cost containment and some government support as well as a strong pickup in business after a very strict lockdown on a onset of the global pandemic that compared to q2. but again this does not affect our short and medium-term objectives. so, while the covid pandemic is far from over and we continue to be vigilant, we continue to grow and progress on our strategic initiatives.
thank you so very much for your attention. we are now going to open the q&a session and guilherme, jp and i are happy to take your questions. so now the floor is yours.

ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions]. the first question comes from thiago macruz of itau. please go ahead.
thiago macruz -- itau unibanco -- analyst
hi, guys, good morning. you've now spent some time exporting up with direct selling commercial model to the international operations of the avon. so i would like to understand first, how far you guys feel you are from completing this process? which major market is not yet using that model? and second, it would be great if you could share with us some more information on the results of that initiative so far? thank you, guys.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, thiago, roberto here. so here's the good news. we haven't seen yet the benefits of the new commercial model on the key markets of avon international. we are going to be rolling out the new commercial model with actually for the representatives who will include the segmentation and the lifetime value approach that we have in natura, rolling out on the top eight markets -- eight of the 10 markets by q4 of this year. so that's encouraging because that's yet to come and the good news is that we are really using a lot of the learnings from natura about establishing the segmentation model, and we're going to do actually in two phases. the first phase is going to be for the representatives and then the second phase, including the leaders, right.
but here's also the other good news. we have two pilots right now in avon international. one in south africa and the other one in the nordics, the countries. and in both of them, we are seeing increasing productivity. we are seeing retention getting to all-time high, like in south africa, we are seeing in existing brand, a retention about 66%, which is a number that we haven't seen in the past, so we are encouraged by the early results on the two pilots, both in south africa and also in the nordics.
i'll turn to jp that also can comment a little bit on the rollout of this new commercial model, brazil actually, avon brazil is a little more advanced than avon international, so he can comment that as well. so jp, please
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer and investor relations officer
thank you, roberto. thank you, thiago. actually as regards to avon brazil, we are very happy with the lead indicator so far. the brand has strengthened significantly. the productivity of the reps has increased. their satisfaction has reached all-time high levels and the market share is going up as they are selling out their products at a higher price. so everything that we had experienced at natura couple of years ago, and moreover, we are building the required experience and sensitivity on those levers to smoothen its implementation in other geographies. so, very happy with that. we are actually -- we have already started rolling that out in ecuador in latin america and we are planning other markets still this year. so excellent learnings and very, very promising, lead indicator so far.
thiago macruz -- itau unibanco -- analyst
fantastic, guys. fantastic. thank you very much for the answers.

the next question comes from luiz guanais of btg pactual. please go ahead.
luiz guanais -- btg pactual -- analyst
hi, guys, good morning. so two questions here on my side. the first one, if you could comment about the competitive outlook in latam in this space to increase prices in the next two quarters. it would be good to hear about that. and the second question also regarding social selling platform. how do you think that the customer acquisition cost is going to evolve in the next few quarters as you guide [indecipherable] this platform not only here in latam, but also to the global operations on natura? thank you.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer and investor relations officer
hi, jp here. as regards to the competitive environment in latin america, well, we see is relatively slow down in consumption, growing inflation, as you all know. nevertheless, we have been managing revenues very actively, not only price, but also product mix and promotional investments to make sure that we remain competitive in terms of our gross margins and ebitda margins. as regards, the cost of acquisition of social selling, actually as our reps and consultants master their skills in terms of the usage of the social selling tools, they are acquiring digitally, the clients they had formerly, so that's not increasing at this point in time.
luiz guanais -- btg pactual -- analyst
okay, thank you very much, jp.
operator
the next question comes from steph wissink of jefferies. please go ahead.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. good day, everyone. i have two questions. the first, maybe, roberto, for you, just as an observation is to see the strength of both avon and natura in brazil and the ability for your reps to co-sell those two brands, both prestige and mass. talk a little bit about what you're learning early on from the brazil market and what that might mean for some of the international markets?
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hi, steph. good hearing from you. listen, we are excited about some of the opportunities or we call cross-sell and up-sell between avon and natura, not only in brazil, in latin america. we think that there is tremendous potential and the data is very encouraging about the opportunity there and we are progressing and i'll ask jp to elaborate a little bit more about it. on the international side, again we are very pleased to see not only some of the leading indicators in the fundamentals of avon strengthening, but i would highlight the market share gain that we are seeing on avon international in key markets in two very important categories, which is color cosmetics and fragrance. this is actually is something very encouraging. again, we are still facing in some markets strict lockdowns and pandemic that impacting the overall growth of those categories. but the fact that we are seeing market share gain on those key markets are also very encouraged. i'll ask jp to elaborate in more detail about this opportunity of the cross-sell and up-sell between avon and natura in brazil. please, jp.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer and investor relations officer
thanks. we are at a very early stage of proactively managing the cross-selling opportunities, but we have already started those using big data analytics crm. so we are probing various promotional and cross-selling mechanics and that is proving effectively. it's not yet rolled out at a larger scale, but it will toward the end of this year, beginning of next year. having said that, we have also experienced both brands gaining share in latin america in q2, which again proves the complementarity of those portfolios, so very excited with that growth avenue.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
that's great. and then my second question is just on apac. there wasn't a lot of commentary, but just curious where you are in casting a vision for the asia-pacific market and china in particular? how you're thinking about entering that market? i think body shop and aesop may be a bit ahead of the others, but maybe share a little bit about when we could start to see china and broadly more the apac region contributing to the business?
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so, great question. so one, i think we mentioned a lot of this outstanding result of aesop again is driven by asia pacific. so aesop is really hitting all cylinders. i would say, especially in the north asia, which is very encouraging. it gives us the confidence again about entering china. the situation in china is as follow. we welcomed some of the change in the regulatory space in china that will allow us to produce and import products to china without compromising our non-animal testing and we are progressing now their registration. that requires that we obtain a gmp certification of our manufacturing sites in the countries that we actually produce and that's ongoing both for aesop and the body shop and in parallel, we are registering our skus both for aesop and body shop. you are correct, the priority will be actually number one aesop, and then followed by the body shop and we are on track to potentially have a physical presence with aesop in probably beginning, first, i would say, first half of next year. so very encouraged by that.
besides china, as you know, we also made an important investment acquiring the head franchisee of the body shop in japan, which is an strategic market for us. early indicators about us taking over the business with our local team in a more direct contact that as a company market is also promising. of course, japan is also facing the pandemic in some -- back and forth in terms of lockdown, but we're encouraged by that. aesop continues to perform extremely well. japan, it is now the largest market for aesop. and korea is also performing very well.
my last point on asia pacific, avon in philippines, which is a very important market for avon, also posted important market share gains in the philippines. but i would also caveat, the philippines right now is facing one of the most strict lockdowns with the resurge of the pandemic. so it is something that we are monitoring very closely.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
very helpful. thank you so much.

the next question comes from bob ford of bank of america. please go ahead.
bob ford -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you. good morning and congratulations on the various sources of traction. can you talk a little bit about your balance sheet tax assets and the path to monetizing those? and with respect to the tranches being recognized in the june quarter, what's the realistic timeframe for monetization? i think the press release makes mention of a 20-year period, but that seems a bit conservative. and then you call out tukuma. it's great. it's doing very well within ekos. how innovative is it and how protected is the ip? and is there a possibility of maybe adding tukuma to other brands?
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, bob. i'll ask guilherme to answer the first one and jp can talk about the -- new ingredient, tukuma. so please, guilherme.
guilherme castellan -- chief financial officer
thank you, roberto, and bob. it's a pleasure to meet you and looking forward to meeting you soon. yeah, as you mentioned, basically, this quarter we recorded more than $800 million -- sorry, brl800 million in deferred tax assets, as we continue to optimize our subsidiaries structure, right, which is caused by the avon integration, right. as you probably remember as well, this was enabled by the prepayment of the avon 2022 bonds. they had some restrictive covenants that allow us to execute those restructurings. so it's important to highlight here that this gain was not factored in the guidance that we gave, $350 million to and $450 million in synergies from the avon integration. so it's an upside to that, right. and as you mentioned, there are definitely more opportunities to be captured which is good -- which is very good about capturing those opportunities and we are working hard on that though. of course, we cannot comment on whether and when we will report additional deferred tax assets. to your question on the 20 years, yeah, i mean, this is what we disclosed at this point and basically, this is what we are comfortable and the valuation allowance were recognizing the timeframe this quarter is appropriate at this time. with that, i'll pass to jp.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer and investor relations officer
hi, bob. thanks for asking. we are very excited with tukuma. actually, it highlights one of our strengths -- one of the strengths of the group; bioscience understanding the richness of bioingredients and the ability to transform those ingredients into active agents of -- in the cosmetics industry, which ties to one of your questions. if anyone just squeezes that fruit, one get that property. so there is significant science behind the transformation of tukuma into this active ingredient which is protected by patent. and it has regenerative properties which translates to your skin, which is then probed to generate its own hyaluronic acid. so we are very excited with that and is now the second best-selling variant under the ekos line. thanks.
bob ford -- bank of america -- analyst
and is there a role for tukuma in brands where natura does not overlap? i mean, would you, is there a role for this in -- within aesop or the body shop in other markets outside of brazil and latin america?
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer and investor relations officer
so as an explicit claim, that's a lots to do with the ekos line. now, as an active ingredient, this is one of the areas where the group now is discussing how to translate those active ingredients into various formulations of the various brands, even though it's not explicitly claimed.
bob ford -- bank of america -- analyst
and could you just discuss, you mentioned the patent. how long do you have the rights or how long is the duration of the patent?
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer and investor relations officer
i wouldn't know the details at this point, bob, but i'll be glad to share those with you later on.
bob ford -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you very much, and again, congratulations on all the traction.

the next question comes from felipe cassimiro of hsbc. please go ahead.
felipe cassimiro -- hsbc -- analyst
hello, thanks for taking my questions. first, i would like to [indecipherable] natura & co in mexico. could you give us more color on the updates, an update on the recent initiatives in mexico that have helped the country to step up as the second largest market in latam? and also on the operational side in mexico, do you see additional synergies to be gaining with the integration of the brands in the country? and second one, i would like to explore a bit more on apac, follow-up on what roberto said. thank you for the colored explanation on all the initiatives there. i just wanted to follow-up maybe on avon in philippines that the plant is doing so well. is there any perspectives of interests of avon in new market in southeast asia in the next 12 months, maybe? anything on this? thanks.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer and investor relations officer
hi, thanks. jp speaking. as regards, mexico, sure. i mean, we -- couple of things happening recently there. heavy and growing investments behind the brand, that's number one, then, the development of the omnichannel solutions with the opening of the e-commerce and various stores. as regards to synergies, operational synergies, there are many being explored at this point, but the main one i would like to highlight is the usage of avon's manufacturing plant in mexico to manufacture some of the natura's skus.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. and regarding to avon in asia, our priority is really to continue to focus on the new commercial model, the rejuvenation of the brand, and digitalization. so right now, i would say we are not planning to entering new markets. but really strengthening our presence through to the commercial model, digitalization and the brand rejuvenation and let's not forget that avon is also present in china. and with this new effort of the group, we also want to make sure that we can strengthen our position at avon in china.
felipe cassimiro -- hsbc -- analyst
okay. thank you very much.

the next question comes from andrew ruben of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
andrew ruben -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, thanks very much for the question. so hoping to pivot back to natura brazil. i was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the balance between consultant growth and productivity? any color on how you think productivity trends will progress into the second half? and bigger picture, any update on how you think about the right consultant count for the business? thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
thank you for the question. as you know, i mean, the events of q2, q3 last year were exceptional and they distort somehow the way we report productivity -- consultants productivity at this point. there was huge increase in the number of reps -- of consultants in q3, right. very abruptly, they are younger with us. they are less productive. in addition to that, in q3, last year, there was a shift of channels from in-store to out of store channels and a shift of portfolio toward the essential items. so those numbers will be distorted for a period and should return to normality -- sorry, toward q4 this year. thanks. thanks for the question.
andrew ruben -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.

the next question comes from richard cathcart of bradesco. please go ahead.
richard cathcart -- bradesco -- analyst
hi, guys, good morning. thanks for taking my question. a couple here, just firstly on the body shop. you mentioned i think 20 stores have been renovated into the new format during the quarter. so just wanted to hear a little bit about kind of the performance there and the plan to continue rolling out that new concept to other stores across the body shop portfolio? and then the second question, i think for guilherme, just on debt, just wondering if you've got any additional potential renegotiations on the horizon, and what are, kind of, let's say, the next steps for debt over the next six months to 12 months to 18 months? thanks.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
hey, richard. i will start and then i'll pass to guilherme. so on the new store design for the body shop, the good news is, right now we have approximately 50 already in place and they are showing double-digit gains versus, call it, the previous design. so that's very encouraging. we are planning to potentially get to a 100 by year-end.
and as you know and i would that -- as part of that, as you know, we are also driving the refill stations within the body shop stores, which is also very much in line with our commitment to like, but it's also very much tied to the values and the strategy of the body shop. and on those refills, we are planning actually to get to 300 refill stations in the stores by end of this year.
so, it's progressing well. of course, we continue to monitor it. the retail reopening in some of the key markets and again, a lot of markets going back to lockdown, so -- and we are still very much paying attention to that, but all the indicators that we have -- the early indicators on the new store design are pretty encouraging. so i'll pass to guilherme to talk about the debt strategy here.
guilherme castellan -- chief financial officer
thank you, roberto. yeah, on the capital structure side, i think, as you probably saw, we ended the quarter with a very strong liquidity position, right, of brl8 billion in cash and equivalents. we continue of course, to deleverage our balance sheet with net debt to ebitda of 1.4 times. and i think the highlight of the second quarter, as we already disclosed in the q1 results, was the issuance of the $1 billion sustainability linked bond, right. we're quite comfortable right now with our capital structure. i mean, when you look at the liquidity in hand, then when you look at it that tower [phonetic], the monetization schedules, we have covered basically all the way into 2024. when you look at our exposures by currency, we're extremely well-matched as well. so we are comfortable where we are. of course, we're always assessing opportunity in the market. but at this point, i think that, again, especially after the follow-on in the second half of last year, we're quite glad on where we landed.
richard cathcart -- bradesco -- analyst
okay. thanks very much.

the next question comes from joao soares of citibank. please go ahead.
joao soares -- citibank -- analyst
hi, thanks. two points on my side. first one on apac, and i think, i appreciate the follow on the physical strategy there on aesop. but wanted to get more color on the digital strategy. could you give us an update in terms of how your e-commerce operation is right now in apac? what types of opportunities do you think you can explore in short term, maybe through partnerships, maybe some m&a? so anything, if you give us on that, would be very interesting.
and the second point regarding avon international. we saw a pickup in digital investments. the penetration is clearly moving very well. so just, give us some idea in terms of how those investments are progressing going forward, maybe calling back to your guidance on the low to mid-teens margins for avon international by 2024. how does the digital penetration play out into those margins, that we will be very interesting to hear? thanks.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, joao, thank you for the question. roberto, here. so, in regarding to asia-pacific and i'll focus a little bit on china, right now, our presence is to the cross-border and it's all e-commerce and is actually progressing very well. we are doing some partnerships. in fact, this quarter, we just launched a cross-border wechat, a mini program that are allowing users to purchase, ease of products directly within the app. and the good news is because to some extent we are late entering china, we're going to really optimize the e-commerce and social selling and not needed to actually invest heavily in brick and mortar.
yes, we're going to have retail when it will be important, but maybe the only good news of us being a little late in entering china is that our omnichannel approach and the focus much more on the e-commerce and social selling and use of key opinion leaders will help us to penetrate probably to less capital investment compared to some of the other early entry in china.
what's again the second question?
joao soares -- citibank -- analyst
yes, yes, roberto, thanks for this one...
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
the digital, yeah, the digital, sorry...
joao soares -- citibank -- analyst
yes, yes.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
the digital piece at avon international is progressing well, joao. i mean, we are really moving to similar to natura one app for the representatives to actually do all the business, having all the information, content being able to share. it's called avon on, and there's been a lot of investment to the point that you made that we are actually putting a lot of investment in digital for avon as a whole. this is actually going to facilitate a lot for the representatives to moving to social selling. so, more to come on that, we still think that we have a lot to catch up on that, but the good news is, the team is investing, the reps will be able to access in one platform, in one app, and similar to what we have within natura and that should be a pretty excitement, improvement for the reps within avon international.
joao soares -- citibank -- analyst
great, great. thanks for the answers.

the next question comes from irma sgarz of goldman sachs. please go ahead.
irma sgarz -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. i was just curious to come back to brazil for a second and you do cite and i think it's certainly evident in the number of different sectors, the raw material, input cost pressures, and i was just curious how you think about that for price increases into the back half or maybe you're already taking prices up at the outgoing cycles of the second quarter and how we should think about gross margin for the operation. i guess this applies to -- i'm specifically interested in brazil, for both the avon and the natura brand. thank you.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer and investor relations officer
hi, irma. jp speaking. so indeed, the cost pressures are present and we have been managing actively revenues. we did increase prices. we have others scheduled, but that's not the only source of value. as i mentioned, we have been improving and shifting the mix of products in both naturas and avons as well as promotions to maintain, keep and ideally, even improve gross margin going forward. thanks.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah, and one thing, irma, that i also add on top of what jp said, which i would just call attention for all of you, right. if you look at it year-to-date, as a group, we are actually up in gross margin, which i would say in this environment, it's very unique. and even in latin america, year-to-date our gross margin is up versus prior year. and that is because not only i think the team is doing a great job on revenue management, we are leveraging our volume increase, but also the synergies, which is very somehow unique to this combination in this group. the synergies are kicking in and we have on the quarter over $40 million, in the year-to-date almost $80 million of synergies that are helping us navigate some of this pressure in terms of cost inflationary and currency. so that's just one additional comment here on the gross margin.
irma sgarz -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you, again.

this concludes today's question-and-answer session. i would like to invite mr. roberto marques to proceed with his closing statements. please go ahead, mr. marques.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
before i close, it seems that we have one additional question and just i would hate not to answer, joseph. so joseph, please, if you have your question, we're happy to answer and then i'll do the closing. please go ahead, joseph.
joseph giordano -- jp morgan -- analyst
right. thank you, roberto. so that should be a quick one. so, on the digital front, right, you're really doing like major advancements in connecting directly to customers. so my question to you is, like how the fulfillment has been working on this front? i recall that you guys are delivering more to the clients. so how are you moving on this front, both on natura and avon front? thank you.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
yeah. so thank you for the question, joseph. so we are progressing well. our fulfillment, our supply chain are really showing tremendous resilience and being able to again, since the pandemic, to really be very responsive and not only in natura and avon but also i would say the body shop and aesop with the surge and the growth. again, our e-commerce and our social channels are three times, four times, higher than the pre-pandemic. and that to your point, it is changing our fulfillment in the way we are serving both our reps and also our customers directly. so we feel good about that. we are also investing on that, but it is something that at this point, we don't envision any major disruption.
jp, you want to add something, please.
joao paulo brotto goncalves ferreira -- chief executive officer and investor relations officer
yeah, joseph. just want to add, recent information is one, both avon's representatives and customers here in brazil are scoring service level very high, the best nps ever actually to be honest. and as you may have seen, natura's e-commerce has just received the blue diamond award, which is granted by end customers that have rated our e-commerce as the best in the country recently, which i think speaks somehow to our fulfillment capabilities.
roberto de oliveira marques -- executive chairman and chief executive officer
great. that's a great way actually to end the call. so i just again, thank everybody. we are very pleased with our strong q2 results, which once again demonstrate the strength of our omnichannel model, the power of our brand products and most important, our people, our organization, our network, who continues to really focus on our direct-to-customer reach and really as a group, continue to progress in our strategic ambitions. i want to thank everybody for being with us today. i wish you all a good day and on behalf of us, stay well, stay safe. thank you very much.
