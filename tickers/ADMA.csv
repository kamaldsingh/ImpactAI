thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of anthony petrone from jefferies. your line is now open.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you and good afternoon. i hope everyone is doing well. congratulations on a great quarter here. adam, maybe i can begin...
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
hey anthony, i hope you're doing well too.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
hope you're well, yes, and your families. maybe begin where you left off on your comment, adam, on continuity of supply, and where you sit on visibility and consistency of supply. and so, as you look into the fourth quarter and next year, maybe describe a little bit on why that visibility is in place today and what this does for the company as it negotiates with potential customers, whether those be physician groups or larger distributors in the ig space?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
sure. thanks, anthony for the question. so i think there are a number of points that speak to this. and if you look at the q and the financials, i think when you look at the amount of inventory and the growth, about 25% in the second quarter to the third quarter. i think that that should give you a good idea that we've been producing this product. that's been working itself through the supply chain and we're sitting with more finished goods and inventory than we had previously.
and we're currently working on building a, what we are considering to be a safety stock. because i'm sure as you can imagine in the precarious environment that we're in due to covid-19 and i've been reading a number of analysts' reports from other firms covering many different plasma companies, the forward-looking forecast out there is that the ig market is going to be tightening.
and what we're able to do is, we're able to use our balance sheet really with our customers to demonstrate to them, look we've documented inventories. as you know, anthony, our production cycle time ranges anywhere from seven to 12 months. we're doing better, but we're in that 10 to 12 month timeframe.
so the reason why we have this visibility is, i know what we were doing 10 and 12 months ago, and as you can see with that inventory growing, it's working itself through the supply chain. all of our issues that we experienced in the early to-mid parts of navigating the covid landscape with some of our third-party testing labs have been resolved, and we are releasing more batches than we ever have previously.
so we feel really, really confident in our ability to deliver on our stated objectives of generating considerably more top line revenue in the second half than the first half. i think we've had a really strong quarter, our best quarter this year. and we're trending in the right direction.
what i'm most proud of, anthony, is that the team at adma has really been working tirelessly throughout covid. and our operations under our control have been operating very, very well and we have been producing product on schedule, according to budget and plan this year.
and it's really a testament to the dedication of our workforce that we will have more products available for sale in 2021 than in 2020, and we anticipate, based on our plasma collections and the reliability of our third-party suppliers that we're going to have more product to sell in 2022 than 2021 and i don't know have many other plasma companies out there are able to say that right now, due to the headwinds from the collections market from covid-19.
so we feel really strong. we don't mean to sound like a broken record, but we wanted folks to use inventory as a measure for how much product we should have available for sale in subsequent quarters.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
that's helpful. i'm wondering, just as a follow-up to your comments there, adam. how does this position the company really to play offense here in kind of going after share when you kind of referenced the dislocation in the market from other suppliers? how active were you in terms of discussions etc.?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
you know, i want to sit here and say to you, of course, we're going to be on offense. we're always on offense, anthony, but we also recognize the size of our organization compared to those in the industry. as we've mentioned before, and in our corporate deck, we have a plant that could process today 400,000 liters of plasma with rough yield somewhere between 3.5 to 4 grams of finished immunoglobulin through our manufacturing process per liter.
that leaves us somewhere with, call it 1.5 million, 1.6 million grams. last year, i believe that number was around 100 million grams of ig sold. so we're about 1% to 2% player in the market. so we're aggressively out there. but again, we're not going after these large hospital contracts, we're not looking to fill the void that may be left by some of the larger or the big three or four players out there.
we're going out to the customers that are being told that they're being put on allocation or that they're starting to see their deliveries be delayed. and we're receiving a number of inbound calls from different classes of trade and different types of ig infusion centers, health clinics, physicians' offices, as you say.
so we feel really, really good about this. the inventories are growing and we are aggressive, but we also understand and we hope that the market understands our size. i feel very confident that as we build our inventory, we want to ensure that there is safety stock there for our customers. they don't want to put patients on a drug where they don't believe that they're going to have a substantial supply in the subsequent months to ensure the continuity of care.
so we're doing this in a very controlled way. we're very, very optimistic with our visibility in our inventory and our supply chain right now. fda releases are coming through. our labs are operating. things are moving forward very, very well. and we anticipate having that supply -- two to three months' supply, if you will, to demonstrate to our customers we've got the inventory available for you.
you can feel confident about putting your patients on bivigam during this period, that's going to be quite tumultuous, based on all the reports that i was reading today. so we're here, our products are commercial, they're fda approved and we're ready to serve the market as they need product.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
that's very helpful. and i'll get one more and hop back in queue here. maybe just an update on immunorank, the assay for sars-cov-2 and just sort of how do you see this playing out just considering the backdrop and where the development cycle is for polyclonal antibodies for covid-19. just a quick update there. thanks a lot and congratulations.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
sure. so -- no, no, no, thank you, anthony. we're hopeful that we'll be able to achieve some type of a eua through fda. and as we make more progress, we'll certainly update the market. this assay, we're really proud of this because we really believe that adma and our development partner, leinco technologies, maybe i can say this maybe i can't, but i really believe that we're solving the key problem of being able to detect which convalescent covid-19 patient donors have the most potential to help. the ones with the highest antibody titers.
this is a very easy-to-use elisa kit based assay. it's a standardized way for hospitals, blood collection centers, as well as plasma centers to identify which donors have the highest neutralizing titers -- neutralizing titers to sars-cov-2, and we believe that this is going to have the ability to determine which of these units is going to have the greatest potential for full clinical benefit.
so it's hard for me to give you an idea as far as size. we really do believe that adma and our expertise and the expertise of our development partner, that we're solving the number one problem with convalescent plasma. now we're not in the convalescent plasma treatment business. that's not our area. we're not getting into that business. we do not use the plasma that we collect for the therapeutic transfusion of covid-19 donors.
what we're really doing here, anthony, and i know that, you understand this, with adma's ip portfolio and the ability to differentiate asceniv from other igs based on the plasma pool and the types of donors that we collect plasma from were really using our expertise in developing these specific testing assay to identify neutralizing titers in human plasma, and we're going to make that available to the world.
so i'm optimistic that there is potential. but again, we're really just doing this because we find it something that was easy for us to do. it's right in our wheelhouse and as we progress more, we'll keep you posted. but i'm excited to see what happens with this.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you very much.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
thank you for the questions.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of elliot wilbur from raymond james. your line is now open.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, adam, brian.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
good afternoon. how are you doing?
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
doing all right. thanks. appreciate it. a couple of questions, maybe i'll just start on -- right on the financials. if i could just ask you to comment in terms of revenue performance in the core or maybe just talk about some of the key drivers of the increase, at least sequentially, whether it'd be increased customer base or increased customer penetration or mix, more favorable asceniv versus bivigam uptake. just some of the key drivers there as we think about the sequential progress from 2q results?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
sure you know -- brian, go ahead. take this one.
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. thanks, adam. how you're doing, elliot? nice to hear from you. regarding the revenue growth, i mean, we're very encouraged this quarter to see the continued market demand and we were certainly in a place to meet it. i would say that increased revenue is attributed to, across the board increased sales from all products, by-products, intermediates, in addition to additional customers that we're seeing.
to adam's point earlier on the call, customers see our inventory continuing to grow and that gives them confidence to continue to look at us and use us as a premier seller of ivig products into the market.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and it sounds like, based on some of your earlier commentary that obviously, you're continuing to expect sequential growth in the fourth year?
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
that's correct. that's correct. and if you look at our balance sheet, elliot, you can see that finished goods have increased by 25% second quarter $56 million to $70 million overall inventory. so we continue to purchase inventory. we continue to move inventory through the channels while also keeping safety stock. so it's all been a positive quarter from that inventory standpoint, continue to expect the inventory to grow and build out the investor -- build out the customer base as well along the way.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. question for you, adam, anything you can share with us in terms of updates on key wins with additional points of distribution or p&t committees and payers, just wondering what your ability to engage with those constituents has been kind of mid -- sort of the resurgence of the pandemic in certain spots, and maybe more specifically, whether or not, the recent grant of the j-code has kind of opened the door for more discussions at least with respect to asceniv obviously?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
sure. to touch on asceniv, i can certainly tell you that, ivig is pretty much on every hospital's formulary around the united states. and when you look at the label for asceniv, it has a label similar to that of ig, the differentiating factor type of plasma that's used. and we blend normal donors with donors tested that have sufficient titers of respiratory syncytial virus and that's the product that we have.
so as the winter months are upon us, as covid becomes a topic of conversation, our commercial team or medical science organization, we just had the big symposia that we sponsored at idweek a couple of weeks ago. we're starting to see a lot more engagement, a lot more thoughtfulness from the hospital-based community on appropriate patient types and appropriate utilization of asceniv in the hospital.
on the outpatient side, the reimbursement through medicare certainly is not hurting us. we're very, very pleased with that. we've continued to -- if you will, defend the asp. there are no changes to the price reported for the third quarter. and we are continuing to switch patients that physicians and their caregivers believe have appropriate risk factors and could benefit from monthly infusions of asceniv.
bivigam as well, having that inventory available in a market, again, that's been historically tight. there's no shortage of customers out there, elliot. i mean, we really are in a place right now where our sales force and our commercial operations team is truly engaged with folks. some of our field reps, i'm not the one pushing them out on the road. certainly not coming from me, but i can tell you that our folks want to carry that adma flag, and they're starting to reengage with certain clinicians in safe manners outside and we are getting face-to-face time with prescribers and caregivers.
so we're seeing things loosen up a bit. virtual engagement efforts continue. we continue to have a presence at the medical and scientific conferences, and engagement is there. immunoglobulin really is a hot topic right now. from the pharmacy buyers and the hospital pharmacies, they're all getting notices about, look at your ig utilization, we're hearing little anecdotal reports that they're starting to reconvene the ig treatment ethics committees at a number of institutions, when ig has been in short supply in previous periods, throughout the immunoglobulin history over the last 20, 30 years.
they convene these committees to decide who should get product and who's the most needy and we're starting to hear rumblings that those committees are starting to be reformed. so ig is a topic front and center. and again, not to reiterate the inventory balance, but we feel real good about our position here to be able to service the current unmet need and the potential future unmet need that's out there.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. and just one last question, adam, as you move forward with your enhanced fill-finish capabilities, it sounds like the timelines are fairly consistent with what you have discussed previously. but i know that on some past calls, we talked about sort of the statutory timeline in terms of fda signing off on some of these processes being roughly four to six months under a standard supplemental nda.
but wondering if you've had any -- at this point, you've had -- been able to have any further discussions with the agency in terms of thinking about trying to get them to act in a somewhat more expeditious manner, given the demand trends that are out there for ivig?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
sure. that's a great question. and the answer i can give you is that, we've got comfort around the fact that we've seen the agency is conducting a number of paper audits of a number of different types of pharmaceutical manufacturers, plasma collection organizations, etc. so we know the fda is ongoing and they're working. we have not yet submitted our application for the vanrx machine for our products to fda. so it's hard for me to ask for an expedited review or to beg for any favors until we actually put the application on file.
so the guidance that we provided is that, we should have this application on file before the end of the year. and certainly, when we do -- if it's not me, it will be someone from our organization, we will call the agency and see what we can do, and if there is a path for an expedited review.
we feel really confident. i mean, the fact that we're continuing to remain on track with these timelines. i know a number of our staff do listen to these calls, but i got to give credit to the adma leadership all the way down to the newly indoctrinated fill-finished technicians that are working tirelessly nights and weekends in order to keep us on schedule, due to some of the impacts due to covid-19.
so a lot of hard work, a lot of late nights, but we're staying on track. we understand we made commitments and promises to shareholders, and our team is breaking their backs in order to meet those timelines. so we feel really good, elliot. we really do believe that mid-2021, second half of 2021, we should start realizing some benefits from a number of our supply chain robustness and enhancement initiatives and fill-finish is certainly one of them.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. thanks for taking the questions.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
thank you so much.
operator
thank you. our next comes from the line of leland gershell from oppenheimer. your line is now open.
leland gershell -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
hi adam, thank you for this update and for taking my questions.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
hi leland, thank you.
leland gershell -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
yes, just a few questions from me. one is just drill a little bit further on the inventory trend, as that increases, do you have any sort of numbers or brackets you can give us as to what you would consider as steady state for overall inventory of ig product that you might be getting to in the foreseeable future? and i have a couple of follow-ups. thanks.
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure, i can take this. leland, how you're doing? it's brian.
leland gershell -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
hey brain.
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
with regard to the inventory, we stated that we expect to see sequential quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year revenue growth. so that's going to be commensurate along the lines of increased inventory. as we continue to purchase more plasma, we're opening up more plasma centers, so we're collecting more plasma.
that plasma has a long, long shelf life, 10 years. we're going to continue to purchase more plasma, as i mentioned. and that inventory will then lead to future year-over-year revenue growth. so seeing that increased inventory will be a testament, it's signifies continued quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year revenue growth, getting to that $250 million top line revenue line within the next three to five years.
leland gershell -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
okay. all right. and then as we think about spend, admirably, you're building the centers perhaps ahead of schedule. but want to consider expense burden on the company as you have debt obligations and so forth. how should we think about kind of your outlook on cash as it stands from this report and how we should think about additional tax resources that might need to come into play as you continue to build the organization?
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. thanks, leland. so with regards to cash and cash needs, look, we're going to manage the expenses as close as we can. you could see quarter-over-quarter from second quarter '20 to third quarter '20 net loss is down from $20 million to about $17 million, so net loss is heading in the right direction. we believe our revenue growth is going to outpace our increased expenditures. so revenue growth is heading in the right way.
with regards to debt, you mentioned our debt relationship. we've dramatically increased our capitalization, receiving several regulatory approvals since taking on the additional debt back in 2019. and it's all a context of very supportive credit markets.
so we're confident that we're able to address our debt, our debt relationship with our largest lender, they're aligned with management. they're our largest holder about 19%. they as well as our board and management, they've made, we've made open market purchases throughout the year. and again, our balance sheet, from a collateral position, continues to directionally grow in the right place.
leland gershell -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
okay. thanks. thanks for that color. then my last question, just on asceniv. as you had launched that last winter, but it was kind of -- we were already kind of into the winter season as that was rolling out, and then you made investments in the fields effort behind that coming into this season. and as we're in the colder months now, just wanted to ask if you're seeing a return from those additional investments as perhaps the mix shifts toward asceniv as we get through this winter. thanks.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
sure, leland. yes, we are seeing the investments pay off. i mean, we're having a lot more conversations. we're having a lot more detailed conversations. and again, we are converting patients and we're getting the product and we're seeing utilization in hospitals, as well as in outpatient infusion centers and in the home care setting.
so we feel really, really good that we're in a great place to supply a differentiated ig, a product that when you look at the published data and you look at the patents that we have around the product that we screen these donors for high titers to rsv, but they have a panel. but when you actually look at the plasma that we're collecting rsv really is the marker.
and what our patent state is that these donors are also containing high levels of antibodies against influenza a and b, metapneumovirus, two types of coronavirus oc43 and 229e, as well as parainfluenza 1 and 3.
so when -- i can tell you that when these infectious disease, doctors and clinical immunologists are looking at the patients, they're looking at the data out there. about 20% or so, plus or minus, of patients infected with covid are also co-infected with some other respiratory viral pathogen. one of the highest on the list is rsv.
i think we all can agree that more antibody is better than less when trying to treat to prevent an infection. and the way that we manufacture our product offers standardized levels of these antibodies. so clinicians and payers can be sure that every time they pay for a prescribed asceniv they're giving a consistent amount of this unique antibody profile ig to their patients.
so, we're seeing growth. things can always grow faster than they are, leland. i would love it to grow faster. and if our commercial team listening, we're getting out there, we're making it happen, we're seeing growth across all of our immunoglobulin manufacturing product portfolio. and we're really proud on what we anticipate is going to occur in the fourth quarter and throughout 2021.
leland gershell -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
terrific. thanks very much for the additional information.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
no, thank you for the good questions. so hope you guys are doing well. it's not that cold down here, leland, so.
leland gershell -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
hope [phonetic] i'll visit.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
anytime, wear your mask.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ram selvaraju from h. c. wainwright. your line is now open.
boobalan pachaiyappan -- h.c. wainwright & co, llc -- analyst
hi. this is boobalan signing in for ram selvaraju. can you hear me ok?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
how are you?
boobalan pachaiyappan -- h.c. wainwright & co, llc -- analyst
yes. i'm doing great. how are you?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
good thanks.
boobalan pachaiyappan -- h.c. wainwright & co, llc -- analyst
yeah, thank you. a few questions. so first is, how often does a supplier deliver plasma to adma? is it weekly or monthly or quarterly or as often as possible and what factors could accelerator or slowdown the supply process?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
sure. you cut in and out a little bit, but i believe the question was around our third-party supplier for source plasma, where are the deliveries? i can tell you that we've got a delivery schedule that's been already formally agreed to with our third-party vendor. and i only get told when there are problems and i haven't been told that there's a problem in a long time.
so i believe that we do receive deliveries as per our contractual arrangement right now. those deliveries typically occur monthly. we do keep inventory in a third-party warehouse location as well as onsite in boca raton that is being prepared for further manufacturing. so the supply relationship is intact. the contract is being serviced.
we have experienced no delays or difficulties with our vendor in the quarter. and we're really appreciative of their efforts. we know that it's not easy out there, but they are 100% committed to adma and they're committed to honoring their obligation and we truly thank them for their support. they understand that patients are counting on us as well, and they're giving us the product -- the raw material that we need in order to keep our production ongoing. so it takes a village in this industry and we all seem to be supporting each other very well right now. so we thank our partner very much.
boobalan pachaiyappan -- h.c. wainwright & co, llc -- analyst
yes, thanks for the clarity. and moving forward, so you mentioned that adma could generate $250 million annual revenue at some point in the near future. so that just assume all the five to 10 new centers are already opened?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
so, the $250 million in top line revenue would be cumulative of our entire organization. so everything stemming from our plasma collection business unit to contract manufacturing activities, as well as our commercial products and then the sale of our intermediate fractions. we feel really, really confident that the way that we've set our business up today -- and again, this is based on the existing capacity of our manufacturing facility, that 400,000 liter capacity, i believe i mentioned, earlier on the call.
as we progress with the 4,400 liter bivigam plasma pool expansion project, we believe that our capacity is going to grow potentially by up to 50%. and so there may be even upside over and above this $250 million cumulative top line revenue generation from our entire manufacturing portfolio and subsidiary business unit. so hopefully that answers your question there.
the five to 10 new centers that we've given guidance that we're building and we said in our remarks earlier today that we currently have six centers from approval through just having their leases signed. that effort is really about demonstrating to our shareholders that management is focused on self-sufficiency at some point in time. if we have the ability to sell some of that plasma, we certainly will. the price of normal source plasma is increasing almost weekly in this climate.
and we really want to be able to insulate ourselves from the supply and demand fluctuation that may be out there, especially when you look at what's happening due to the covid-19 pandemic and its impact to collections. so we feel really good about our initiatives there. it all comes down to the source plasma, right? when we have visibility on how much plasma we can put into our manufacturing plan, that's when we're going to have very good visibility into consistent revenues and consistent growth quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. and everything seems to be on track at the present time. so knock wood, we're going to keep it up.
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
regarding the plasma centers, if i may. typical plasma centers, once they're fda approved and operating within call it 18 to 24 months, there's a market value that we've seen, public information, they sell anywhere from $10 million to $15 million. i'm not saying we're going to sell our plasma centers, but there's a true asset value behind these fda approved plasma centers, not just collecting the plasma and using it for our fda approved products, but we believe that there's true asset value between each and every plasma center.
boobalan pachaiyappan -- h.c. wainwright & co, llc -- analyst
understood. thanks for the clarification. i want to change gears and talk about the immunorank assay. so, it universal that all patients who recovered from covid-19 exhibit high levels of neutralizing antibodies or is it only a small percentage of patients? what conclusions could be drawn from your own immunorank assay results?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
sure. so, i'd love to answer that question. and it's based -- we have not published any data yet regarding our evaluation of donors out there. i can tell you that, our immune systems do not all function the same way. so not every person who recovers from covid-19 mounts a substantial neutralizing antibody response.
and in fact, there are even people who are asymptomatic, who we test from time to time in our normal plasma collection center, donations who appear to have very, very strong neutralizing and high levels of neutralizing titers to sars-cov-2. so at the present time, we have not published any of our data, i think as we generate more data, you may see some publications at some medical conferences either later this year or there are a couple of immunology meetings early next year.
but, i know that there are a number of publications out there that talk about 20%, 30%, 40% of patients who recover from covid 19 have very low levels of available neutralizing antibodies. and what this assay is designed to do is, it's designed to solve that problem. not every person who recovers from covid-19 is a great fit to be a plasma donor for convalescent plasma treatment. so that's what this assay is designed to do is it's designed to help the clinician, it's designed to help the hospital, help the blood center, the folks who are actually dealing with the therapeutic transfusion of convalescent plasma.
again, we feel that we've got the ability to solve this problem for them and provide them with an easy to use cost-effective assay to help them determine, which of these recovered covid-19 patients are most likely to provide clinical benefit. so, we have to wait and see what the fda says with respect to an eua, but we feel really, really confident that we're on the right track.
boobalan pachaiyappan -- h.c. wainwright & co, llc -- analyst
that's great to hear. and along the lines, so yours is a plasma products company. and do you think that immunorank assay would be a strategic fit for your business objectives? and also if you can talk about terms and conditions between you and leinco technologies with respect to the immunorank assay kit, that would be helpful.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
sure. so, we're not prepared to talk about the financial terms and conditions at this time. we have not made any disclosure around that. and look we're a platinum products company, as you say. and we also have a number of different patents in our portfolio around the ability to screen and generate high titer plasma pools in order to make hyperimmune globulins. this assay is synergistic with the work that we do. but at the present time, we are unable to give and we don't really feel that there's a material impact, if you will, to the profitability outlook.
we have no plans to develop our own hyperimmune for covid. we are still a member of the covid plasma alliance at the present time. we are collecting covid plasma that we do contribute to the alliance. but we really -- look, sometimes a number of companies are out there doing things for the greater good. if there is a commercial opportunity for this assay, certainly between adma and our development partner leinco, we're going to do what we can to capitalize on that.
but quite frankly, the real purpose behind this is, helping to solve the problem that we feel so many are out there. these are expertise that adma was founded on back in 2004, 2007. i mean, we've got the ability to develop these novel testing methodologies in order to detect neutralizing antibodies and plasma.
and i think what this should do is show shareholders that look adma is a differentiated company from the likes of the bigger players out there. we're very nimble. we were able to develop this assay quickly. and i think it's a testament to the scientific prowess of our company, and the forward thinking nature that adma brings to the plasma products community.
boobalan pachaiyappan -- h.c. wainwright & co, llc -- analyst
great. and one final question if i may. so have you guys thought about or maybe you can characterize [phonetic] where do you stand in terms of developing subcutaneous formulation for asceniv and bivigam? i mean considering we are in the pandemic period and these subcutaneous drugs are gaining traction and these are considered perceived more safer [technical issues]?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
yeah, i think he cut out there, but your question was around subcutaneous formulation.
boobalan pachaiyappan -- h.c. wainwright & co, llc -- analyst
yeah, i can repeat that.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
at the present time we have no plans to develop subcue. we've got a lot on our plate at adma biologics. and subcue is growing in the ig space. but i can tell you that, i don't know if i should quote the data if i'm not correct about it, but i know the majority of immunoglobulin that is utilized on the market today remains in the iv form and preparation. we like to target the immune compromised patient population. i don't want to get into all the scientific differences around bioavailability of antibody and the mechanisms of action that may differ between subcue and iv. but, we feel very strongly that iv is an appropriate route of administration for an immune compromised patient.
i think that there are some benefits that certain clinicians can argue. additionally, based on data that i've read, you need approximately 20% more immunoglobulin in the subcue dosage form to achieve the same igg trough levels that you can experience from an iv preparation. so that utilizes more ig.
our goal is to provide as much product as we can to treat as many patients as possible. so at the present time, we're going to let the big boys fight it out in the subcue market. we're going to continue to provide, where the lion's share of immunoglobulin is being used and that's in the intravenous route of admission.

all right. thanks for your time.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
thanks for your questions. say hello to ram for us.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of zach weiner from jefferies. your line is now open.
zachary weiner -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, guys. congrats on a great quarter. one more from us on performance batches, can you give a timeline as to when you think the bivigam performance patches will be sold through and right to the bottom line? and then also, if you expect a more expensing [phonetic] the performance batches for the additional fda clearances that you guys are currently working on with the fill-finish and -- i guess that's it. yes.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
sure. thanks zach for the question, good questions. we haven't given specific -- we have not yet given specific timelines on the 4,400 liter process. we're hopeful and optimistic that we have it on file later this year or maybe early q1. and it should be a four to six months standard pas review.
so, as brian and i said, during the prepared comments, we expect to see benefits on the top and bottom line in the middle part of next year to the second half of next year. so, i mean, we understand the production cycle times, we told you when we made these batches, if we get them on file, no. we're hopeful third and fourth quarter that we'll have those batches available for release. again, we really do feel very strongly about the sequential quarter-over-quarter future revenue growth.
and certainly, i don't have your model right in front of me, but i think as we approach the second half of 2021, we anticipate considerable growth. and i think that some of that can be attributed to not only the fill-finish and the additional yield there and the faster cycle turnaround times, but also that at some point next year, we're going to begin producing at a 4,400 liter scaling and getting more product out the door using the same staff, the same equipment, the same disposables, and really it's going to change the outlook of our business going forward.
i mean, we're doing everything the right way. we're doing it in a methodical way. we've demonstrated to the street, we've demonstrated to the fda that, when we put our mind to something and we give you guys guidance on our timelines, we do hit them. and we feel really confident about our ability to produce ig. as i mentioned, we are producing more ig than this plant has produced in the previous four or five calendar years.
my management team is great. they're running the great shop. our quality unit, our manufacturing team, our facilities team and our quality control teams are working around the clock to get as much product out the door as possible. so, we don't -- to answer your other part of your question, i don't believe we have any planned additional conformance batches, but if you refer to our risk factors, we never know what the fda is going to ask us to do.
so, we will certainly do our best to guide you and other analysts, if we do see any potential r&d and/or expenses that we may incur due to getting this a very important part of our strategic plan for supply chain robustness approved. but everything's on track. and i wish i could rush the clock back, but seven to 12 months to produce a batch of drug, fda reviews are still running about four to six months for a prior approval supplement. so, hang in there. we're going to continue to execute and meet our stated objectives and milestones, while growing top line and controlling expenses and the burn.
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
one thing to keep in mind, zach, thanks for bringing up the conformance batch, the batches that we went through earlier this year. we expensed those conformance batches in the first half about $7 million, obviously that hit all of our costs of sales. so, as adam mentioned, in the second half of 2021, when we start selling those conformance batches pending fda approval, we would realize 100% gross margin, 100% profit on those batches straight to the bottom line.
zachary weiner -- jefferies -- analyst
yes, understood. perfect. thanks so much.

good afternoon, and welcome to the adma biologics third quarter 2020 financial results conference call on thursday, november 5th, 2020. [operator instructions] please be advised that this call is being recorded at the company's request and will be available on the company's website approximately two hours following the end of the call.
at this time, i would like to introduce skyler bloom, director, investor relations and corporate strategy at adma biologics. please go ahead.
skyler bloom -- director, investor relations and corporate strategy
welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us this afternoon to discuss adma biologics' financial results for the third quarter 2020. i'm joined today by adam grossman, president and chief executive officer and brian lenz, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
in today's call, adam will provide some introductory comments and provide a corporate update and then brian will provide an overview of the company's third quarter and nine months ended september 30, 2020 financial results. adam will then provide some brief summary remarks before opening the call up for your questions.
earlier today, we issued a press release detailing the third quarter 2020 financial results. the release is available on our website at www.admabiologics.com.
before we begin our formal comments, i'll remind you that we will be making forward-looking assertions during today's call that represents the company's intentions, expectations or beliefs concerning future events, which constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995.
all forward-looking statements are subject to factors, risks and uncertainties such as those detailed in today's press release announcing this call and in our filings with the sec, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by such statements.
in addition, any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of the date of this recording and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. we specifically disclaim any obligation to update any such statements except as required by the federal securities laws.
we refer you to the disclosure section in our earnings release we issued today and the risk factors section of our 2019 annual report on form 10-k and our third quarter 2020 10-q, which we expect to file following this conference call, for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
with that, i would now like to turn the call over to adam grossman. adam?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
thank you, skyler. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. we hope that those joining us today continue to remain healthy and safe. the third quarter of 2020 was our strongest quarter this year with adma generating approximately $10.3 million in revenue, which represents year-over-year growth of 42%.
year-to-date, we generated approximately $28.3 million in revenue, an increase of approximately 63% compared to the same prior year period. we achieved these strong results due to the focus and hard work of the dedicated adma biologics team, despite the continued covid-19 operating headwinds.
looking ahead to the remainder of 2020, we continue to anticipate a strong fourth quarter with respect to top line revenue, while also building inventory levels to contribute to anticipated future revenue growth. we believe we are well positioned to achieve our previously stated goal of delivering considerable growth during the second half of 2020 compared to the first half and we anticipate this revenue growth to continue into and throughout 2021.
during the third quarter, we continued to add new customers and prescribers for bivigam and asceniv, as our virtual grassroots promotional and engagement efforts continued to yield results. although traditional commercial engagement remains limited and challenging as covid-19 headwinds persist, we are encouraged by the provider and physician reception to our presence at recent scientific and medical conferences, including at idweek 2020 in october, where we hosted an exclusive educational event on respiratory viral infections and strategies for their treatment and prevention.
during the quarter, we continue to experience certain covid-19 related impacts to areas of our supply chain. specifically, as a result of past state and local shelter-in-place orders, we experienced lower than normal donor collections at our fda approved plasma collection center during the third quarter. with that being said, we, like other plasma collection organizations, have continued to see sequentially improving collections over recent weeks and we are hopeful that these trends will continue for the balance of this year and into 2021.
at present, the immune globulin market continues to expand, but remains restricted by historically tight supply. we expect the tightness to continue and even be somewhat exacerbated by the persisting covid-19 pandemic. as there is a general feeling among many parts of the american public to only visit essential stores and businesses, some people are reluctant to go to plasma collection centers and donate source plasma. in spite of this backdrop of increasing broader immune globulin market tightness, we believe that adma is uniquely positioned as a smaller player to provide supply and even offer greater quantities of its fda approved ig products in the forward-looking periods ahead.
as a smaller player in the early stages of our manufacturing and commercial scale-up, we can say with confidence that we do not, at present, expect any disruption in our production throughput in the periods ahead.
beyond our revenue growth, we have several other important corporate accomplishments i would like to take a moment to highlight. first, we're continuing to build our inventory balance in support of further anticipated growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 and into 2021.
we closed the third quarter with approximately $70 million in total inventory, up approximately 25% from $56 million at the end of the second quarter of 2020. secondly, our net loss has been reduced considerably. we closed the third quarter of 2020 with a net loss of approximately $16.9 million, down 16% from approximately $20 million for the second quarter of 2020.
as you can see, our top line revenue, inventory balance and spending are all heading in the right directions. additionally, the expansion of our plasma collection center network is currently progressing ahead of schedule. we opened our second center in knoxville, tennessee in july and began donor collection shortly thereafter, including some covid-19 recovered donors. we anticipate receiving approval from the fda for the knoxville biologics license application in mid-2021.
our adma biocenters plasma collection business now has six plasma collection centers under way at various stages of development and approval, which include; kennesaw, georgia, our current fda approved center; and now knoxville, tennessee with a pending bla and anticipated fda approval in mid-2021; along with four other centers currently under construction and in the architectural design and planning stages.
we are extremely pleased with the progress of these initiatives, securing favorable long-term leases with ideal locations and we believe we are on track to achieve our stated goal of opening five to 10 new plasma collection centers over the next three to five years.
the global demand for u.s. source plasma for further manufacturing continues to outpace the available supply, and these investments into our adma biocenters plasma collection business unit are anticipated to support ongoing production and growth for our end-to-end biologics manufacturing company into the future.
as an update with our supply chain robustness initiatives, these projects remain on track. we continue to invest in and make progress with several supply chain robustness enhancements, including the successful on-boarding of aseptic fill-finish capabilities with our newly installed vanrx sa25 workcell.
we're also advancing regulatory efforts for the planned capacity expansion to the 4,400 liter bivigam plasma pool process. these and other ongoing important supply chain initiatives are designed to reduce operating costs, improve product yields and margins, increase scale and provide for faster production cycle turnaround time, which in turn could lead to a potential reduction in working capital requirements as well as provide us with increased control and independence from third-party vendors and contractors.
we expect to submit the appropriate regulatory applications resulting from these initiatives to the fda before the end of 2020 and into 2021 and we anticipate, we will begin to see these initiatives impact our top and bottom lines potentially as early as mid-2021. with respect to our ongoing covid-19 development efforts, we continue to work with our development partner toward a regulatory submission and potential eua for immunorank, a proprietary antibody assay that we believe, if approved, has the potential to provide faster, simpler, and a more cost effective way to identify sars-cov-2 high titer convalescent plasma for using both in treating covid-19 patients as well as for creating covid-19 hyperimmune globulins.
with the adma biologics organization focused more than ever on commercial execution, we remain committed to tightly managing our expense structure, while we work toward achieving our previously provided operating targets, including reaching revenues of $250 million or more over the next three to five years.
with that, i'll now turn the call over to brian for a review of the financials. brian?
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, adam. since we issued a press release earlier today outlining our third quarter 2020 financial results, i'll just review some of the highlights.
for the three months ended september 30th, 2020, total revenues were approximately $10.3 million compared to $7.2 million for the third quarter of 2019. this represents an increase of approximately $3.1 million or 42%.
the revenue growth for the third quarter of 2020 was favorably impacted by the continued commercial ramp up of bivigam and asceniv and by the manufacturing and supply agreement adma entered into in january of 2020 to produce and sell plasma-derived intermediate fractions.
as adam mentioned earlier, our total inventory as of september 30th, 2020 was approximately $70 million, up approximately 25% from the end of the second quarter of 2020. finished goods commercial inventory has also increased to $15.6 million, up from $5.2 million compared to year end 2019.
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the value of our inventory is stated at our cost. in the periods ahead, we expect to continue to build both work-in-process as well as finished goods inventories, which we believe will translate to quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth moving forward.
additionally, given covid-19 related uncertainties across the pharmaceutical supply chain, we intend to retain a portion of our growing inventories as safety stock, which we believe will strengthen our position as a reliable supplier to our customers, distribution partners, and prescribers over the coming quarters.
in addition to ensuring supply continuity, we anticipate our strong and growing inventory position will enable us to achieve our previously stated expectations for considerable revenue growth during the second half of this year compared to the first half, as well as into and throughout 2021.
consolidated net loss for the three months ended september 30th, 2020 was $16.9 million or a $0.19 loss per basic and diluted share. for the nine months ended september 30th, 2020, total revenues were approximately $28.3 million compared to $17.3 million for the nine months ended september 30th, 2019. and this represents an increase of $11 million or 63%. the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased sales of our immunoglobulin and plasma products portfolio bivigam, asceniv, nabi-hb and intermediate fractions.
consolidated net loss for the nine months ended september 30th, 2020 was $56.3 million or a $0.68 loss per basic and diluted share, compared to a consolidated net loss of $37.7 million or a $0.72 loss per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended september 30, 2019.
at september 30th, 2020, adma had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $59.7 million and accounts receivable of $6.3 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of approximately $26.8 million and accounts receivable of approximately $3.5 million at december 31st, 2019.
adma's net working capital as of september 30th, 2020 was approximately $123.1 million compared to approximately $71.8 million as of december 31st, 2019.
with that, i will now turn the call back over to adam for closing remarks.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
thank you, brian. adma has had a strong year thus far and has made excellent progress during 2020 on executing toward our key corporate priorities. these include initiatives to strengthen our supply chain, which we believe will greatly benefit the company over the long-term by reducing operating costs, increasing production yields, improving margins, and shortening production cycle timelines.
given the unprecedented macro-market conditions in the u.s., and covid-19 effects being experienced by us and our third-party vendors and suppliers, we believe these impacts will prove temporary and that our future is bright and right for growth.
we believe the rapid expansion of our adma biocenters plasma collection business unit demonstrates management's focus on ensuring raw material availability into the future and we believe these initiatives will allow us to continue to increase production throughput into 2021 and beyond, ultimately allowing adma to have more finished immunoglobulin available for sale compared to prior periods.
looking ahead to the remainder of 2020 and beyond, we believe we have built a strong foundation with our supply chain and other initiatives over the past year to provide a continuous supply of bivigam, asceniv and nabi-hb, as well as a growing level of intermediate fractions for sale to third-parties.
market demand for all of our plasma products remains strong and we remain confident in achieving considerable revenue growth for the second half of 2020 compared to the first half. longer-term, we believe we are well positioned to grow our business to $250 million or more in top line annual revenue over the next three to five years.
i want to assure all of our stakeholders that our fundamentals remain strong and we remain deeply committed to successfully navigating the ongoing commercial rollouts of bivigam and asceniv and bringing each product to patients with life-threatening immune deficiencies. we truly thank our dedicated staff members for continuing to achieve, because we all know at adma, patients are counting on us.
with that, we will now open up the call for your questions. operator?

thank you.
[operator instructions]
our first question comes from anthony petrone with jefferies.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
hi, good afternoon, everyone. congratulations on a strong year through 2020. i'll just start off, maybe again just to -- a little bit on timing. a couple of timing questions and i'll have some questions on supply and demand. on timing, maybe just an update on the fda fill/finish clearance as well as bivigam lot expansion, it sounds like that's still potentially a first half event, so just an update there maybe. a quick follow-up there will be brian maybe to just walk us through under a scenario where both of those are secured in the first half, what does the sort of second half gross margin ramp look like from there, and i'll have a couple of follow-ups?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
thank you very much anthony. great questions. fda is very engaged with adma right now. we're going through the review process. our previous guidance, i believe we said was mid-year, but we are still on track. we feel very confident that we're in a good place with the review and we feel very comfortable that you should see the approvals coming in sometime on or around mid-year and then we've said, second half, to start realizing some of the accretion from the enhancements to the supply chain from these potential approvals. but, everything is on track. the agency is very engaged. i mean, being in the immune globulin space during covid, you get a lot of attention from fda and these are products that without them, many of the patients would not be able to survive and live normal productive lives. ivig continues to remain on the fda drug shortage list. adma continues to be a company that's saying that we've got more ig to bring to the market in 2021 than we had last year and customers are being very receptive to it and the fda is really working very closely with us to ensure that we can continue the continuity of supply and care for the market. brian, you want to take anthony's next part?
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. thank you, adam. so with regards to our second half gross margin ramp-up, we reported earlier that we have about $8 million of our conformance lot manufacturing taken the manufacturing of bivigam from 2,200 liters to 4,400 liters. and in doing so, we had to expense those four conformance lots in accordance to us gaap. now, when we receive fda approval, hopefully in the middle of the year, we will be able to realize 100% gross margin sometime in the second half, maybe third, early part of fourth quarter for those four conformance lots. we've already -- if you back off the $8 million from the $61 million and the cost of product revenue anthony, we've already started to see gross losses narrow or i should say improved to the positive. so we expect that trend to continue toward the second half, especially as we receive the fda approval of the 4,400 liter capacity expansion.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
that's helpful. and then couple follow-ups and i'll hop back in queue. one would be, when we think about the manufacturing timeline today, whether it's for bivigam or asceniv, when you secure clearance for lot expansion and fill/finish in-house, what do you think that does for a timing on inventory turns from overall source plasma to finished goods? and then once you have that visibility in hand, how should we think about bivigam contracting once visibility is enhanced? thanks.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
thanks anthony. so our production cycle was seven to 12 months. i think as i've said previously, we are on the longer end of that cycle time right now as we're using third parties for our aseptic fill/finish label pack etc. and we have seen improvements in this production cycle time throughout 2020 and we're actually looking at some data today, things are looking really good. obviously when we get to bring fill/finish in-house and as i've said, we can just take the bulk and wheel it [phonetic] down the hallway into the fill/finish suite rather than putting it on the truck, shipping it up to our cmo during the appropriate identification testing and getting into their queue, we believe that we can shave some time off of this. but no matter what anthony, it's still going to be within that sevem to 12 month window. our hope is to be in that seven, eight, nine months range for the production cycle. but you really can't get it any faster than that. but we're currently on the outer bound of that cycle, which is where we've seen -- we are seeing improvements. our hope is that we are in, call it seven to nine months as we go forward. with regard to bivigam contracting and making sales, we're really seeing very, very good demand. q1 happens to be shaping up really nicely, and we feel very good about the quarter as we wind down here. we're really building a good following and brand loyalty. we've got great reimbursement restructure for both bivigam and asceniv. as we get more bivigam available, our feeling is as patients continue to do well, our customers will continue to put more patients on our products. so we feel very good about this. we're already cultivating and speaking with our distribution partners and our alternate sites of care, home infusion, specialty pharmacies that are working very, very closely with our field force and the prescribers and we're really able to identify gaps in the market where they are not able to have complete supply with all the brands, all the sizes that they would like. so we feel very good about bringing more product into the market. we feel that the demand is there. based on our first quarter performance that i've seen so far, we really feel that we're on a good track to continue to deliver quarter-over-quarter revenue growth.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks again. i'll hop back in.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
thanks anthony.
operator
our next question comes from elliot wilbur with raymond james.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks, good afternoon. first question for yourself [phonetic] adam. just if you could, certainly the build-out of the collection centers has progressed at a faster pace than what we would have anticipated over the past 12 months. can you just talk about some of the decisions internally or the factors that have enabled you or led you to pull forward the build-out of the collection centers and then just what the messaging or body language has been from fda in terms of review timelines? certainly approved last facility quicker than anticipated, or on a quicker than anticipated timeline, but just what you may be getting from the agency in terms of messaging that may influence your expectations around the timing of approval for the collection centers as well.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
absolutely, thanks elliot very much, hope you're doing well. so, the decision to build more plasma centers, there is a simple answer and then there's a multifaceted answer. i mean, quite frankly, we've got a plant that has a 400,000 liter capacity today,, we're talking about being able to upsize our lots for our production lot size for bivigam sometime in middle of this year. one can reasonably assume that we may have more capacity in the future. we want to have control of our plasma supply. not to be funny, but the reason why you're hearing for me today and why we own this and essentially vertically integrated provider of specialty immune globulin products is because we used to rely on third parties. when you rely on third parties, you don't have all the control you want. and even before covid, adma management team was talking about building out our plasma centers, gaining more control, supply chain enhancements and i think what we've learned during covid and really the way that we've been able to operate and navigate during covid, we want to have as much control over our destiny as possible. i think that's what a potential acquirer would want to see in our business and i think that's really what our shareholders want to see from this business. so, first and foremost, collections have been down as reported from others in the industry as well as adma in my prepared remarks. we are being impacted. i don't believe that we're being impacted as severely as some of the other collectors that have made statements publicly, but we are seeing quarter-over-quarter improvements, week-over-week improvements with respect to collections up and down here and there, the government stimulus keeping things a little bit flat right now, but we're optimistic with the vaccination rollouts that things are going to improve. but no matter what, the world relies on us plasma for the global production of plasma-derived therapies across the globe. so there is going to be a supply constraint of plasma. one thing that has been proven time and time again, and i've been a student of this industry for -- this is my third decade, supply and demand of plasma goes up and down, but we've got a place to put that plasma, the demand for ig continues to be forecasted to be favorable and we want to control our supply. i think covid has allowed us to be opportunistic with respect to finding locations. as we all know, unfortunately, the retail industry has taken a big hit during the covid-19 pandemic, small businesses all across the country. we like strip malls, we like pads on strip mall parking lots and we take 10,000 square feet to 15,000 square feet of retail frontage if you will in existing strip malls or these types of locations and i don't want to speak for brian, but brian and the biocenters management team are -- they like to pay very little floor rent and we're being very opportunistic. so we know that this pandemic is going to end at some point and we're locking ourselves in with 10 year plus leases for these plasma centers and you're seeing rents for prime retail spaces that used to be in $15 to $20, $25 a foot. you're seeing in the high single-digits. you got to pounce on it and you got to do it now because you lock yourself in for 10 years. that directly goes to the reduction of cogs that quite frankly when my team and i are modeling, we haven't factored that in, but it could be substantial. so, we're really being opportunistic. we see that the demand for plasma continues to grow. the number of collectors out there, the other point elliott is there are some recent transactions in the industry. there was a deal for 25 centers and the value of that yield i want to say, it's north of $14 million per center. so these are facilities that adma can build for between $3 million to $5 million we say. the approval cycle, as you've been asking, the approval cycle typically has been from the time at the bla is filed, typically at 12 months you'll get an approval. our last center was approved in a little bit over six months from the time that we submitted the bla and that was done without an fda inspection. typically, fda requires an on-site inspection of the plasma center. our last center had its inspection waived and they accepted a paper audit. we've been a known plasma collector to the fda since 2011 we received our first license. so we're not an unknown entity, we're not a new entrant in this space and we feel really good about approvals. elliot, i can't tell you whether they're going to approve it early or whether they're going to approve it within that 12 month cycle. my feeling is that they will approve it. i want to say our guidance is sometime in the fourth quarter of this year, we expect the approval. could it come early? anything is possible, but at the present time, i'm not prepared to change my guidance on when the approval will come in. if the fda wants to do it sooner, we're not going to be upset. brian, anything you want to add there?
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
hi, i think you hit on the main points adam. the marketplace for plasma centers certainly has grown almost $15 million. there was a recent transaction of 25 centers that were acquired for about $15 million per center. so the market value is there, the marketplace is there and we just think it's a great opportunity to build more plasma centers and to become fully self-sufficient. as we said, we increased our guidance from five to 10 centers to 10 or more and we're certainly well on our way currently having seven centers under our corporate umbrella at this present time.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, next question with respect to the supply chain initiatives. the 4,400 liter capacity [indecipherable] fill/finish, what are the remaining gaining factors in terms of obtaining fda approval? do they actually need to come on-site and inspect the equipment in the facility in order to sign-off, is there something they can do remotely? just curious, obviously, if they have an on-site inspection for that to occur.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
sure. elliot, one thing i'll say is we are in an active review. so i want to be cautious about the things that i say. but what i can tell you is that for the 4,400 liter plasma pool expansion, no inspection is required. that is a normal and customary prior approval supplement submission. we send in, they review our data, they review the specifications. typically, that would be a paper review and there is no prior approval inspection required for that submission. for the installation of the fill/finish line and beginning all of the operations that go along with billing, labeling, packaging etc., typically that would require a fda on-site inspection. and i say typically because that's what's required in the code of federal regulation. now, we've installed this vanrx sa25 and a couple of investors over the last, i guess the year or so that we've been talking about that machine, they ask me why do you keep saying vanrx sa25. and i say, well that's material. it's very important for the reader to know, the investor to know, because the vanrx is a -- [indecipherable] and my kids make fun of me. but it's a state-of-the-art machine. it's a totally self-contained isolator system and there is no customization of their system at all. so, the fda has approved this device over 30 times, maybe 40 times now and there was a precedent, i want to say, middle of last year, late last year, there was a vanrx sa25 approved and a press release went out that was a vanrx sa25 approved at another company and they did not have a pai. so i can't comment on whether or not the fda has come in or they haven't come in or they are going to waive pai or not waive pai, but what i can tell you that there is precedent out there for this machine. this is a state-of-the-art machine that is a totally self-contained isolator system that we don't have it, we don't have special clean rooms, we don't have special areas. yes, it's in a controlled gmp environment, but pretty much this machine is what it is. so we feel very, very good about where we are with the review cycle. we feel that we will receive approval for the device this year, and we're also optimistic that the vaccine rollout is going to continue and we are already seeing some modifications in the behavior of our government. we are seeing the cdc revise guidelines for school children to be less socially distanced if you will and we're really hoping that as we get to may, that with the vaccine rollout, maybe we'll see fda start to travel around and do inspections and/or continue to feel very comfortable with the vanrx and potentially waive the inspection. but we feel real confident elliott that the review is going well and we're very, very positive on the outlook for the business for the remainder of the year.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then just two final financial questions for brian. brian, you provided a total inventory number, was a little over $81 million. if you happen to have it in front of you, could you tell us what the finished goods number was within that? and then as we think about your prior commentary that you expect the topline to continue to grow over the course of 2021, given where we are currently, you obviously have a good line of sight into 1q, how should we be thinking about the balance of the year in terms of the trajectory here? would you expect growth to be relatively linear or is it -- should we be expecting more of a second half acceleration?
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure, thank you elliot. i do have the breakdown for the inventory, the different components of raw, wip and finished goods. finished goods for 2020 is $19 million of the $81 million and that increased from $5 million in 2019. so $19 million of the $81 million is finished goods inventory for the year ended 2020. regarding revenues, as adam mentioned, we do feel really good about the first quarter, topline revenues here, with about just less than a week left in the quarter and then thinking about how the second half looks and just from an overall standpoint, we have publicly disclosed we anticipate quarter-over-quarter sequential topline revenue growth. thinking about the second half, as we hopefully receive fda approval of the 4,400 liter expansion and continue to receive market acceptance of our products, the j code april 1 for incentive and then going forward, we feel very optimistic about the second half, again, thinking quarter-over-quarter sequential revenue growth.

good afternoon, and welcome to the adma biologics fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results conference call on thursday, march 25, 2021.
[operator instructions]
at this time, i would like to introduce skyler bloom, director, investor relations and corporate strategy at adma biologics. please go ahead.
skyler bloom -- director, investor relations and corporate strategy
welcome everyone and thank you for joining us this afternoon to discuss adma biologics financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. i'm joined today by adam grossman, president and chief executive officer and brian lenz, executive vice president and chief financial officer. during today's call, adam will provide some introductory comments and provide a corporate update and then brian will provide an overview of the company's fourth quarter and year ended december 31, 2020 financial results. adam will then provide some brief summary remarks before opening the call up for your questions.
earlier today, we issued a press release detailing the fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. the release is available on our website at www.admabiologics.com. before we begin our formal comments, i'll remind you that we will be making forward-looking assertions during today's call that represent the company's intentions, expectations or beliefs concerning future events, which constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all forward-looking statements are subject to factors, risks and uncertainties, such as those detailed in today's press release announcing this call and in our filings with the sec, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by such statements.
in addition, any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of this date of this recording and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. we specifically disclaim any obligations to update any such statements except as required by the federal securities laws. we refer you to the disclosure notice section in our earnings release we issued today in the risk factors section of our 2020 annual report on form 10-k, which we expect to file following this conference call for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
with that i'd like to now turn the call over to adam grossman. adam?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
thank you, skyler. good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call. we hope those joining us today continue to remain healthy and safe. 2020 was an unprecedented year for businesses and difficult for most of the nation due to the pandemic. despite this enormous unforeseen challenge adma biologics delivered on its commitment to stockholders, customers and most importantly, the patients who were treated with our lifesaving plasma-derived therapeutics. because of the focus and dedication of adma's workforce, we are pleased to report that 2020 was a year of multiple achievements, including record revenue of $42.2 million, which represents a 44% increase over 2019. this topline revenue milestone, taken together with the rapid expansion of our plasma collection center network as well as delivering on all production and regulatory objectives as part of our supply chain enhancement initiatives, adma ended 2020 in the strongest position it has been in since inception.
on the financial front, we substantially strengthened our balance sheet and ended 2020 with assets totaling $207.7 million. as evidenced by the increased production throughput we experienced during 2020, we significantly grew our inventories to a year-end balance of $81.5 million, as well as increased our accounts receivable and recorded investments in property, plant and equipment. although plasma collections for the industry, including for adma remain pressured due to among other things, a present combination of government stimulus packages, persisting social distancing measures and different vaccination rollout state by state, i am proud to report that adma continues to successfully navigate the evolving covid-19 operating backdrop and is producing its products in accordance to plan. all of our plasma collection centers remain fully operational and we continued to see stabilizing and improving collection trends over recent periods, which we are hopeful will continue as vaccinations rollout across the country. our supply chain continues to experience areas of improvement with easier access to certain raw materials and we have built robust inventories of newly identified long lead-time items. most recently, for our biocenters business unit, we announced korean ministry of food and drug safety approval for the sale of source plasma into south korea as well as announcing fda approval to implement a hepatitis b immunization program, enabling adma to collect hyper-immune plasma from donors immunized with an fda licensed commercially available hepatitis b vaccine. these approvals are a testament to our company's adherence to global regulatory standards. it should be noted that this approval to collect hepatitis b hyper-immune plasma will allow adma the option to retain raw material for the forward fractionation and production of nabi-hb or to monetize this inventory by selling it to third parties. as many of you are aware, a key corporate initiative is to expand our adma biocenters' plasma collection center network and further secure enhance and optimize our raw material supply.
earlier this year in february, we received approval for another plasma collection center and in this business unit, we now have seven plasma collection facilities at various stages of operations and development, including one facility presently pending fda biologics license application or bla approval in the second half of this year. additionally, we expect to file blas for two new centers during 2021. due to our ahead of schedule expansion progress, we have revised guidance from building five to 10 facilities by 2024 to our current expectation of having 10 or more facilities fda approved and fully operational by 2024. in combination with our contractually committed third-party plasma supply contracts, we believe adma is positioned to produce growing and continuous quantities of immune globulin supply in the forward-looking periods and ultimately we will emerge from the pandemic operationally stronger than ever. we remain well on track to achieve our goal of becoming an end-to-end integrated and highly profitable manufacturer of specialty immune globulin therapies.
our strong execution during the first full calendar year for the commercial rollout of our two intravenous immune globulin products bivigam and asceniv, together with our long-term third-party plasma-derived intermediate fraction supply agreement allows us to provide first-time peak revenue guidance of $250 million or more, which is expected to be achieved in 2024. our 2020 progress and forward-looking outlook also enabled us to confidently commit to achieving profitability by no later than the first quarter of 2024. in addition to our firm commitment to these longer-term operating targets, we confidently reiterate our expectation to generate quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2021 and beyond. i'm proud to say that we achieved all of these operational milestones while acting decisively in the face of covid-19 to enact all the medically recommended safeguards for our patients, employees and customers, which collectively we believe will enable us to continue to successfully navigate through the pandemic related headwinds in the periods ahead. our dedicated staff in each of our business segments across the country take what we do seriously, patients are counting on us to provide high quality life sustaining products. our performance during this global pandemic is a result of a company unified and focused with its mission. i thank the adma team for keeping your focus and composure in the face of true adversity. additionally, we are sincerely grateful to our shareholders for your continued support of our efforts to provide these lifesaving products to patients in need.
with that said, i'd now like to turn the call over to brian for a review of the 2020 financials.
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, adam. since we issued a press release earlier today outlining our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results, i'll just review some of the highlights. for the three months ended december 31, 2020, total revenues were $14 million compared to $12 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. this represents an increase of $2 million or approximately 16%.the revenue growth for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 was favorably impacted by the continued commercial ramp-up of our ivig product portfolio. as adam mentioned earlier, our total inventory as of december 31, 2020 was approximately $81.5 million, up approximately 54% from $53.1 million at year-end 2019. this inventory consists of raw materials, including source plasma and other materials expected to be used in the production of our three commercial products as well as work-in-process inventories for bivigam, asceniv and nabi and finished goods of intermediate fractions as well as our three commercial immune globulin products.
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles, the value of our inventory is stated at our cost. in the periods ahead, we anticipate continuing to purchase raw materials and building work-in-process inventories as well as finished goods inventories, which we believe will translate to quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2021 and beyond. additionally, given covid-19 related uncertainties across the pharmaceutical supply chain, we intend to retain a portion of our growing inventories as safety stock which we believe will strengthen our position as a reliable supplier to customers, distribution partners and prescribers over the coming quarters.
our consolidated net loss for the three months ended december 31, 2020 was $19.4 million or $0.20 loss per basic and diluted share compared to a consolidated net loss of $10.6 million or $0.18 loss per basic and diluted share for the quarter ended december 31, 2019. the increase in year-over-year net loss was primarily attributable to increased manufacturing ramp-up activities at the boca facility to support our commercialization efforts of bivigam and asceniv.
moving on now to the full year 2020 financials. total revenues were $42.2 million compared to $29.3 million for the full year 2019, representing an increase of $12.9 million or 44%. the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to increased sales of our immuno globulin products portfolio. consolidated net loss for the full year 2020 was $75.7 million or an $0.88 loss per basic and diluted share compared to a consolidated net loss of $48.3 million or an $0.89 loss per basic and diluted share for the full year 2019. at december 31, 2020, adma had cash and cash equivalents of $55.9 million and accounts receivable of $13.2 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of approximately $26.8 million and accounts receivable of approximately $3.5 million at december 31, 2019. adma's net working capital as of december 31, 2020 was approximately $133.8 million compared to approximately $71.8 million as of december 31, 2019.
accounting for our most recent atm financing activity, we have now extended our cash runway guidance into the fourth quarter of 2021, representing a two fiscal quarter extension from our previous guidance. during the year, we additionally refinanced our senior secured term loan, which among other things, lowered our overall effective cost of capital, consolidated our previously subordinated debt and most importantly provided for a two-year extension of the interest-only period through march of 2024 which we believe will allow adma to reach profitability prior to maturity.
with that, i will now turn the call back over to adam for closing remarks.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president & chief executive officer
thank you, brian. the totality of our 2020 achievements leaves us well positioned to execute on our ongoing operating targets and advanced toward our goal of generating substantial revenues and profitability from our multi-faceted product offerings across all business segments. we anticipate 2021 to be defined by continued commercial execution in addition to a series of value creating fda decisions during the year with our supply chain, production and biocenters plasma collection business segments. these anticipated upcoming fda decisions include expanded 4,400 liter ivig plasma pool production scale, in-house aseptic fill finish capabilities with our installed equipment, including our vanrx sa25 and the continued expansion of our adma biocenters plasma collection center network. upon receipt of these fda approvals, adma expects to realize significant operating efficiencies and improved gross margins beginning potentially as early as mid-2021, which we believe will ultimately support durable profitability with enhanced in-house control of our most critical manufacturing and operating functions.
while our organization's focus remains singularly on achieving our near-term operating targets and ultimately progressing toward profitability, i'd like to take a moment to acknowledge several of our recent scientific developments. notably, we presented a poster at idweek 2020 detailing the challenges in the management of respiratory viral infections. and more recently, we presented a late-breaking poster at the aaaai conference, highlighting the potential clinical utility of a strep pneumonia hyper-immune globulin in vulnerable patient populations. adma continues to establish its reputation in the scientific and medical community as a thought leader in the development of specialty hyper-immune globulins. and when considered in combination with our expanding intellectual property of state [phonetic], we believe adma could be a partner of choice for the rapid development of targeted infectious disease therapies as well as for a potential suitor moving forward. management will continue to evaluate all of our business development options in order to maximize shareholder value.
we enter 2021 from a position of strength across our value chain in the immune globulin end markets and in the context of our improving financial position and asset value. we look forward to executing on all of our commitments in 2021, and in doing so, we anticipate creating meaningful value for our shareholders in the near and mid-term. on behalf of the entire adma biologics team i thank you, our stockholders for your continued support as your investment in adma helps to advance our mission to save lives and make good, safe products that help our friends, family and neighbors. please donate plasma, get your vaccine, help save lives.
and with that, we'd now like to open up the call for questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of anthony petrone with jefferies. your line is now open.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, everyone. congratulations on another strong quarter. maybe to begin, adam, we can start a little bit on the inventory comments. $94 million in the desire to have a level of safety stock going forward. maybe can you give us an idea of what that magic level is in safety stock and where do you expect that to be on a consistent basis going forward?
and then secondly on inventory cycles, can you also give us a sense of what the inventory cycle will look like in terms of the timing, once the expanded liter pool process is fully up and running? and then thinking ahead to vanrx coming in, where is it today, and where will it trend to over time? and then i have a couple of follow-ups.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
sure. so let me touch on part of the inventory question. so from our perspective, it's all about the continuity of care for these patients. our immune globulin products, asceniv and bivigam, are labeled for use in patients with primary humoral immunodeficiency. these are patients who need these products every three to four weeks for the rest of their life. from our perspective, somewhere in a -- three to four months of finished goods probably is a strong safety stock, but as you know, our production cycle times with the 4,400-liter approval or without any of our immuno globulin products are typically still going to be within seven- to 12-month production cycle, anthony. so, nothing really changes there.
i think i've said publicly and i know that you and i have spoken about this. we're currently in the, call it 10 to[phonetic] 11-month range today. you asked about vanrx. with vanrx, we're not totally comfortable on giving firm commitments, but we do believe it should shorten that time, but it's not going to make it any faster than that seven- to 12-month cycle. quite frankly, the approval of the 4,400-liter process meaningfully de-risks the company and our path to profitability.
the fact that roughly about 80% or more of our production at the present time is coming from bivigam. this is really going to substantially improve throughput into the facility, better utilizing that capacity, absorbing that manufacturing overhead, and ultimately improving margins because we are keeping the fixed cost structure for certain consumables, single-use disposables, filters, labor, electricity, water, all of these things. a lot of it stays the same. so, we anticipate significant margin improvements from this approval and more product coming out of the plant over the next seven to 12 months as we are implementing this 4,400 process.
maybe to touch more on the inventory, brian, maybe you can add some more color regarding the current inventory.
brian lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. thank you, adam. so a couple of very encouraging things happened during this first quarter. number 1, our production efforts continued to increase. and that resulted in us allocating more direct labor, more overhead directly to work-in-process and finished goods which attributable -- which is attributed to building more safety stock.
the other thing that happened that was very encouraging during the quarter, our unabsorbed manufacturing overhead continued to decrease. and again, that's as a result of continuing to increase production as we moved through the first quarter and we expect those trends to continue throughout the rest of the year, especially as we received approval for our 4,400-liter capacity expansion.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
a couple of follow-ups would be to stick to margins and sort of the progression from here. couple of follow-ups. one would be, as we think of absorbed manufacturing overhead continuing to decline, maybe just a little bit more visibility on sort of where that number is today, and where it can go over the next, say, 12 months? and then, maybe a quick update on the bivigam conformance lots. is the timing of that still in 2021? and if so, when do you expect those to be realized?
brian lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. [speech overlap] i'll touch on the unabsorbed manufacturing overhead. over the past three quarters, we've seen several millions of dollars being essentially transferred out of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead moving direct labor hours and overhead into with work-in-process, as well as into finished goods. we expect that trend to continue. as i mentioned throughout the rest of this year, as we continue to expand our capacity going from 2,200 liters to 4,400 liters as well as into 2022 and 2023 and our margins -- gross losses will continue to narrow. we will be turning to gross profit and then essentially this is going to put us on a path to profitability.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
and last from me. i'll hop back in queue. appreciate the color here. would just be on plasma collection centers. you mentioned that three are currently under development should have blas in place at least a handful before the end of the year, and then there is a pipeline moving toward 10. so maybe jumping ahead to the end of '22, how many plasma centers in total should be up and running, say over the next 18 months by the end of '22? thanks again, and i'll hop back in queue.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
sure. i would say anthony -- brian, you can certainly take it, but anthony, we are talking -- we should have 10 centers open and operating by the end of '22, absolutely. brian, you want to add some?
brian lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
absolutely. so, we have two fda approved centers currently. we have one on file with the bla for hopefully another approval this year. we're going to file two additional blas by the end of this year. as adam mentioned, we expect to have 10 or more centers open, operating, fda approved by the end of 2024. we just restated or updated that guidance favorably to increase those number of centers to meet our demand as well as to become self-sufficient for our raw material normal source plasma supply.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
i'll also say anthony, the real estate market is still pretty -- pretty good for retail space. even though the market is opening up, we're still very optimistic. we've got a number of locations and sites identified. and i can tell you, we are accelerating this process. we feel really good now that we've got the 4,400 approval. i mean, the market will take more product. we're going to put more product into the plant, and we're going to sprint and run through walls to get to the promise and stated goal of $250 million of topline by year-end '24. and then, again, we've revised the total topline to be able to generate in excess of $300 million with this recent fda approval of the 4,400-liter.
we might need to build some more plasma centers. we do say 10 or more. but we should have -- we've got four centers currently opening collecting right now as brian said. three more in development. we're hoping to have open by the end of the year, more blas on file, and next year more of the same. we continue to knock down our milestones. we continue to hit our timelines within reasonable time frames to see the fda works with us. we're not just giving you a lip service here. we appreciate the fda's attention to the life-saving need of these drugs. we're getting approvals. we're delivering things during covid and it's still present. i may be based in florida, but covid is still around.
we're managing the supply chain. our contractors are managing inventories of the raw materials and the supplies we need to build these plasma centers and we continue to remain on track. we are not revising any of our timelines here. we are moving forward with full speed. we are a company firing on all cylinders, and we plan to continue to execute throughout the rest of this year, just like we've done in the beginning part of '21.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks again.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
thank you. hope you doing well.

our last question comes from the line of elliot wilbur with raymond james. your line is now open.
michael parolari -- raymond james -- analyst
hi guys. this is actually michael parolari on for elliot. thanks for taking my questions.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
sure.
michael parolari -- raymond james -- analyst
so first, if you could talk a little bit about just kind of the incremental importance of offering the 100 ml offering of bivigam and how the company plans to really capitalize on that new market opportunity?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
sure. so how do i say this? a number of our competitors offer various biosciences. when we came to market with bivigam, we offered a 5-gram, 50 ml vial. if you read the package and if you're dosing, it's typically 300 milligrams to 800 milligrams per kg of body weight, but typical dose for an adult primary immune deficiency patient, let's just say somewhere between 25 grams to 35 grams. by the way, ivig typically is infused is a pharmacy will pool the product together into some sort of an administration bag. and the more vials they have to manipulate, the more work there is for the pharmacists.
what our competitors do is, they are able to offer these different vial sizes in the 5-gram to[phonetic] 10-gram size, 50 ml, 100 ml size. and it allows for an easier administration of the product. so, the importance of this 100 ml is that, look, we've been very successful with the introduction of bivigam with the singular vial presentation. and that shouldn't be lost on folks. people like bivigam. bivigam is a high quality product and efficacious. and they've been using it and now it puts us on the same playing field with a number of our competitors who offer multiple vial sizes.
so, we've got the ability to go to these higher volume clinics, higher volume infusion centers that, ok, maybe they were using some bivigam, but now it allows them to use more and faster. it puts us on the same playing field as number of our competitors. we're really proud to be able to offer those vial sizes. it's customers who may be listening today. we've got some in inventory. but again, through the seven to 12-month production cycle, i think as we get to the back half of this year and into 2022, i think we'll start to see more 100 ml vials available in the market, but we think it really just continues to keep adma at the forefront of being a competitive player at the site of care and offering ease of administration to -- for the caregiver.
michael parolari -- raymond james -- analyst
all right. yeah, thanks for that. that's helpful. and then maybe one for brian. if you have it on hand the finished goods number and inventory cadence for the rest of the year. and then also on that note, you guys have mentioned multiple times about gross margin expansion. i know that historically we typically look at inventory with a 40% margin and kind of back into a revenue number using that. how should we adjust that 40%? or should we still go about thinking about it like that?
brian lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so regarding the first part of your question, finished goods, our finished goods number was $21.2 million of the $94.2 million. that number is -- has continued to grow quarter-over-quarter for the last several quarters. and this is where our safety stock is going to reside as well as some of our raw materials. all components, raw material, wip and finished goods has continued to grow. and we think it's very important to show the -- our customers, suppliers, distributors that we're going to continue to build this inventory balance.
in the past, we've said gross margins by 2024 of 40% to 50%. as we see the 4,400 batches start rolling out, realizing we just received fda approval just a few weeks ago, a seven to 12-month manufacturing lead time, we hope to start seeing some of those gross margin improvements as we roll out the rest of this year and certainly into 2022. and those margins or gross losses are going to narrow, gross profit will be realized in the very near future. and as i said, these things are going to continue to roll out in a very positive trend, as we continued to see from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, gross losses are narrowing, net loss is being -- is lower, and we're very encouraged for what we're seeing going forward.
michael parolari -- raymond james -- analyst
got it. thanks for that. and then last one from me. i believe you guys have said in the past that 10 to 12 or 10 to 14 plasma centers put you on the playing field for being fully self-sufficient. so just wondering if you could speak to what you're looking for in the new third-party supply contracts that you mentioned that you are in the process of negotiating for post 2022? thank you.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
sure. we reiterate that 10 or more centers certainly is going to get us to self-sufficiency. but i think as i've said previously, things may change, but why do they also stay the same. and the one thing i can say is, i think it's good practice to have multiple suppliers, especially for your raw material. you never know when you're going to have an issue at a center. you never know when you're going to have a weather event. you never know when you're going to have some sort of outbreak. you just never know what's going to happen. so certainly, the goal is to rely heavily on internal supply. and that's the goal.
you may have heard in my comments, we're exploring all potential alternatives to minimize dilution for shareholders here. so be it strategic, be it speaking with debt lenders, thinking about equity wherever it may be. i think investors, acquirers, they want to know that you've got the capabilities to be self-sufficient. we will have the capabilities to be 100% self-sufficient. but the right thing to do is to bolster your supply with some plasma from third parties. this ensures consistency. it ensures a diverse donor base, may come from centers from different geographic regions. and it allows you to also offset by having some contracts to supply plasma to other third parties to generate revenues where we could potentially pay less from one of our suppliers and charge more to a potential customer, so we just think it's good prudent business practices to do this.
again, our goal to be totally self-sufficient to be able to support that now up to 600,000 liters of plasma fractionation capacity. with that capacity, typical plasma center pre-covid was collecting about 50,000 liters annually. in light of covid, plasma centers are collecting 35,000 liters to 40,000 liters,[phonetic] 45,000 liters of capacity, so that can give you an idea roughly how many centers we might need in order to be self-sufficient. but i can tell you that we plan to be in this business as adma biologics whether we're running the company or someone acquires this company, but we're going to set ourselves up for success. i was talking to someone earlier today. the reason why i'm in the chair [indecipherable] we relied heavily on third parties. we don't want to rely heavily on third parties. but certainly, third parties can support your business and be a very important part of protecting your business to ensure continuity, as we continue.
the value in the plasma center collection network cannot be understated. plasma centers typically are valued in precedent transactions in the market. and in our opinion, there is still value pretty, pretty strongly in that $10 million to $15 million range. they cost us $2 million to $3 million to build. we're going to continue to do this. we're going to continue to build our asset value and i can't overstated enough, you've got a management team and a workforce at adma biologics highly dedicated and we're going to continue to hit these milestones and we're doing it. we're doing it in the face of covid, and we're just really, really pleased with the progress. and we thank everyone for all their continued support. all the shareholders, thank you.

with that, i would now like to turn the call over to adam grossman. adam?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
thank you, skyler. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. we hope those joining us today continue to remain healthy and safe.
adma is off to an excellent start to 2021, and the company's accomplishments during the first quarter and in the weeks thereafter established the foundation for what we expect will be a very strong year of continued growth and asset value creation. we believe the transformative milestones achieved since the beginning of 2021 across both our biocenters plasma collection segment as well as the biomanufacturing segment meaningfully de-risked the pathway for the company to continue to deliver revenue growth, as well as ongoing strategic and longer-term financial commitments to stockholders, including reaching profitability no later than the first quarter of 2024.
financially, adma exceeded analyst consensus topline revenue forecast, generating record revenues of $16 million during the quarter. this represents a 57% growth rate compared to the first quarter of 2020. additionally, for the first time since the launch of adma's ivig product portfolio, topline revenue growth outpaced operating expense, which enabled the company to successfully narrow both gross losses as well as net losses quarter over quarter, a trend the company anticipates will continue in the coming quarters and accelerate throughout 2022.
adma additionally grew its total asset value to a quarter-end balance of $235.7 million, which is approximately a 13% increase quarter-over-quarter. the growth in asset value notably includes $94.1 million in inventories, which adma expects will support continued production ramp-up as well as quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2021 in addition to ensuring the continuity of product supply into an ongoing supply constrained immune globulin market. we strongly believe that adma's asset base and future growth prospects are substantially undervalued when compared to the valuations of precedent acquisitions in the plasma product space. i will discuss this in more detail following brian's financial remarks.
in the face of pandemic-related challenges and in the context of high-profile regulatory setbacks seen elsewhere in pharmaceutical supply chains, adma has taken aggressive measures to strengthen its supply chain and to ensure the continuity of high quality product supply and patient care. with seven plasma collection facilities now at various stages of approval and development, including four facilities that are presently operating and collecting plasma, adma remains on track to have 10 or more plasma collection centers in operation by 2024.
over the remainder of 2021, adma expects to receive fda approval for one plasma collection facility, currently pending a biologic license application or bla, and anticipates filing blas for two additional plasma collection centers before year-end. supplementing its growing internal plasma collection network, adma disclosed an extension of its existing third-party plasma supply agreement from june 2022 through december 2022. adma is also in the late stages of negotiation with additional third-party plasma suppliers to further solidify the continuity of its source plasma supply. to achieve anticipated plasma supply self-sufficiency in the 2024 time period, still is on track.
adma's growing internal plasma collection network coupled with its contractually committed third-party plasma supply obligations position the company well to easily access sufficient quantities of raw materials source plasma to meet those ongoing as well as future production requirements. with the recent fda approval of its 4,400-liter ivig plasma production scale, adma strengthened its supply chain and enhanced its manufacturing capabilities and the financial and strategic impact of this fda approval cannot be overstated.
the approval enables adma to significantly expand its production capabilities of 1,200-liter and 2,200-liter production scales, while at the same time keeping a substantial portion of its fixed cost structure unchanged. as the expanded capacity throughput works through the seven to 12 months ivig manufacturing cycle, we anticipate meaningful gross margin improvements beginning potentially in the second half of 2021 and accelerating throughout 2022. we also anticipate enhanced supply chain visibility and improved working capital efficiencies as a result of this fda approval.
additionally, we expect the approval of the 100 ml vial configuration for bivigam to meaningfully benefit the product's go-to-market offering, as it facilitates greater ease of use for the healthcare professional at the site of care. taken collectively, adma remains committed to revenue growth throughout 2021 and beyond, and we believe the company now has the capabilities to generate peak revenues in excess of $300 million, which represents a 20% increase to our previously stated topline expectations.
as a matter of update on the vanrx fill finish machine, the fda has proceeded with the review of our prior approval supplement. however, in light of covid-19's travel and other restrictions, the agency has been unable to expedite our required facility inspection. adma is actively working with the fda to find a way to expedite the plant inspection, and the company sees a potential pathway for receiving approval during the fourth quarter of 2021. the pieces are in place for adma to sustain the momentum realized during the first quarter and move even closer to profitability.
to our employees, we thank you for your tireless efforts and unwavering commitment. it is because of these unified efforts that we are proudly able to serve our customers and to ensure the continuity of ivig product supply for the underserved immune-deficient patient populations that our life-sustaining plasma-derived therapeutics treat.
we are additionally sincerely grateful to our stockholders for their continued support of our efforts to provide these life-saving products to patients in need, and we are confident that our continued operating execution will unlock meaningful value in the periods ahead. each and every stated goal the company has set since taking over this manufacturing plant from our then cmo in june of 2017 has been met on a timely basis. we have remediated a warning letter, received multiple fda product approvals, allowing us to now commercialize three immune globulin products, generating year-over-year and increasing revenues. and we have significantly expanded the capacity of this plant, which we believe will unlock value that has not yet been realized at this facility.
driven by an experienced management team, our boca raton facility is successfully operating as a compliant drug manufacturer. we take what we do extremely seriously, and we plan to continue to execute on our goals. patients are counting on us, and we know it could be us or you that needs one of our products. we cut no corners. we engage our teams and we watch our operation top-down to ensure continued adherence to gmp regulations.
i reaffirm my commitment to our stockholders that we remain in continued operating compliance, and i truly thank my fellow adma team members for their focus, commitment and dedication as well.
with that said, i'd now like to turn the call over to brian for a review of the first quarter 2021 financials.
brian lenz -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, adam. since we issued a press release earlier today outlining our first quarter 2021 financial results, i'll just review some of the highlights.
for the three months ended march 31, 2021, total revenues were $16 million, compared to $10.2 million for the first quarter of 2020. this represents an increase of $5.8 million, or approximately 57%. the revenue growth for the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020 was favorably impacted by the continued commercial ramp-up of our ivig product portfolio and expanding customer base in both our biocenters plasma collection segment as well as in our biomanufacturing segment.
as adam mentioned earlier, our total inventory as of march 31, 2021 was approximately $94.1 million, up 80% from $52.3 million in the first quarter of 2020. this inventory consists of raw materials, including source plasma and other materials expected to be used in the production as well as work-in-process and finished goods inventories comprised of our commercial ivig products and intermediate fractions. in the periods ahead, we anticipate continuing to purchase raw materials, while also growing our internal plasma collection center network, building work-in-process inventories, as well as finished goods inventories, which we believe will translate to quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2021 and beyond.
additionally, given covid-19-related uncertainties across the pharmaceutical supply chain, we intend to retain a portion of our growing inventories as safety stock, which we believe will strengthen our position as a reliable supplier to our customers, distribution partners and prescribers over the coming quarters.
our consolidated net loss for the quarter ended march 31, 2021 was $18.4 million, or a $0.16 loss per basic and diluted share, compared to a consolidated net loss of $19.2 million or a $0.26 loss per basic and diluted share for the quarter ended march 31, 2020. the decrease in year-over-year net loss was primarily attributable to increased revenues as a result of customer expansion and narrowing gross losses. the improved net loss was partially offset by increased plasma collection center operating expenses to support our biocenters plasma collection network expansion strategy, as well as an increase in sg&a expenses attributable to commercialization efforts for our ivig product portfolio.
with that, i will now turn the call back over to adam for closing remarks.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
thank you, brian. as evidenced by our recent accomplishments, including exceeding analyst consensus topline revenue forecast for three consecutive quarters as well as continued operating successes in the face of covid-19 challenges, adma continues to deliver on its commitments to stockholders and we look forward to building on the momentum we demonstrated during the first quarter of 2021.
we believe that adma enters the remainder of the year from a position of strength. the multi-year remediation and production enhancement objectives at our biologics manufacturing plant are nearing a successful conclusion. adma supply chain investments are on the precipice of yielding significant returns in the way of margin improvements and anticipated quarter-over-quarter revenue growth is poised to continue throughout 2021 and beyond.
prior to opening up the call for q&a, we would like to provide some brief commentary around the current stock price, as well as to quantify the asset value demonstrated by precedent acquisitions within the highly acquisitive plasma-derived therapeutic space. as sizable common stockholders, we as a management team are acutely aware of the increasing disconnect between adma's market value and the intrinsic value that our asset base fairly commands. although the total asset value recorded on our balance sheet is $235.7 million in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, valuations from precedent acquisitions of comparable plasma collection networks and fractionation facilities support in our opinion, an asset value of $450 million to $650 million or more for adma's current asset base.
we encourage the investment community to review the publicly available information and these valuations regarding plasma-derived therapies, production facilities on a global scale, as well as the multiple transactions reported for plasma collection centers in the u.s. and abroad. what we do? the market we are entrenched in, the growing demand for plasma and plasma-derived therapies is a highly durable, sustainable and needed area of the biotech industry.
our capabilities, patents, regulatory and commercial successes should not be overlooked. what we do has significant barriers to entry, and adma is finding success in this market dominated by a select few players. adma has a strong foothold in the u.s. with an integrated end-to-end supply chain and production capabilities, something only substantially larger-valued companies can stake a claim to.
with consideration to the significant asset valuation arbitrage as well as the additional value yet to be realized for our anticipated future cash flows, we are actively evaluating all strategic and financial alternatives to maximize stockholder value and minimize equity dilution. we intend to update the market with developments as appropriate.
on behalf of the entire adma biologics team, i thank you our stockholders for your continued support as your investment in adma helps to advance our mission to save the lives of many and make good safe products that help our friends, family and neighbors. please donate plasma. please help save lives.
and with that, i'd now like to open up the call for your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] and our first question comes from anthony petrone from jefferies. your line is now open.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, everyone. congratulations on another strong 2q here.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
thank you, anthony.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
i'm going to start with the $100 million target exiting this year. just wondering what the mix of bivigam, nabi and asceniv is in there. so that would be the first question. and then, on the disclosure here on the cdmo arrangements, when we think about the plant in boca eventually getting to an operational capacity of 600,000 liters, what should we be thinking about in terms of allocation to future potential cdmo agreements? and i'll have a couple of follow-ups.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
sure. thanks anthony. thanks for your kind words. hope you're staying safe up there in new york. so yeah, we're -- it's a great time to be in the immune globulin business. i think that you stay on top of current events with the collection segment as well as how that flows through to finished goods. and a number of our competitors, large, mid-size and the smaller players, they're not taking on new customers right now. they're talking about having tightness of supply anticipated later this year, early next year. we're hearing that there are substantial countries in europe, in the eu that are truly undersupplied at the present time. and i'm not sure how much longer the competitors are able to take product from one country and bring it into the us. so the outlook for our revenue growth really looks very, very strong. again, we've got more product in the supply chain and coming online than we've never had before.
and regarding your question about the $100 million potential run rate that we would be achieving later this year, as we've previously said to you and others and on these calls, our current mix is pretty much 90-10, 80-20 right now, bivigam being the majority of the product that we are producing and distributing and selling out of this plant. we are seeing growth in our hyperimmune product segment, utilization of nabi, and the press release earlier this week regarding now having the 1 ml size back on the market certainly is welcome to our customers. so we're very, very excited there. and we hope to gain some more market share back since we haven't had the 1 ml product on the market for a while.
and asceniv is growing at a steady pace, both in the outpatient and inpatient segment. we feel very, very confident that the j-code has really helped to bolster and solidify reimbursement in multiple treatment settings. and we're just very proud of the work that we're doing and the acceptance of our products. again, we've got more product available, and we are taking new customers. we are adding people to our distribution network. we are selling through distributors and pulling it through. and we are also adding new specialty pharmacies, hospitals, home care organizations all the time. so really, things are going very well for us from a commercial standpoint.
i think your next question was around capacity. again, it's going to take us a little while to get up to the 600,000 liter capacity. what we do say is that within three, four years or so, we should be able to generate revenues of, we say, $250 million or more in 2024, and then potentially generating more thereafter. it's probably going to take us 2024, 2025 to get to really that 600,000 liter capacity, anthony. we're currently expanding our adma biocenters business segment. i'm sure you saw that press release yesterday after market. and we're really very proud of the work that's being accomplished there. and you take our vertically integrated plasma collection, coupled with our third-party supply agreements and some new contracts that are going to come online later this year, next year, and we reiterate all previously stated financial and strategic objectives with respect to quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. and we anticipate that's going to continue all the way through profitability forecasted for q1 2024. hopefully that answered your question.
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure. and i could add a little bit more color to the revenue mix, anthony. as we saw in this quarter actually, compared to the first quarter of '21, we had a negative 11% gross margin. actually, that number has been cut in half now to a negative 6% gross margin. and that's really attributable to selling more of our hyperimmune globulin products. so, that product mix is already starting to see a shift. the hyperimmune globulins, as we mentioned previously, have a 70% to 80% gross margin. and our standard ivig product globulins have a gross margin of 20% to 30%. so we've already started seeing that product mix really start in the second quarter. we think that that's going to continue that trend. we've also in this quarter -- as a result of the increased revenues, we've seen more customers that have been added. we've expanded our customer base. and again, we're selling more of our hyperimmune products into the market and being well received.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
that's helpful. and a couple of follow-ups here would be, one, just to reiterate on a plasma collection side, you're eight -- in the process of getting to the eight centers. i just want to confirm that exiting 2022, the target is still for 10 operational centers. so that would be the first question. and then secondly, just as you speak to inventories, and you mentioned safety stock, maybe what should we be thinking of -- as we look at the inventory going forward, what percent of your balances will be represented by safety stock? thanks again, and congrats again on the quarter.
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure, ok. also, i can take those questions. with regards to the centers, we currently do have eight centers in various stages of development. two are fda approved, five centers are collecting plasma at present. by the end of 2022, we want to have 10 centers or more under our corporate umbrella. by 2024, we'd like to have all those 10 centers or more fda approved, and really being in a place will be self-sufficient to bring in, from a supply chain standpoint, the majority, if not all, of our raw materials, 400,000 to maybe 600,000 liters of revenue -- liters of plasma coming in from our plasma centers.
now, as you look at our inventories, ending the second quarter of 2021, we have $100 million in inventory. and half of that inventory -- and this is a testament to show how much production we've really been able to ramp up here in boca. our work in process is close to $50 million. and that's a real -- i think that's a testament to show how much the production has continued to increase here. we just got the 4,400 approval process approved by the fda just in april. so we think that that wip number is going to continue to grow, which is a good sign because as that wip number, work in process number, moves through the manufacturing and filling phase of our 7 to 12 month production lifecycle, a lot of that product is then going to go into the final phase, the finished good phase.
so to answer your question, roughly, how much finished goods would we estimate to have on a quarterly basis? if we're -- since we've got it to $250 million, anthony, in 2024, and we say roughly a blended margin of about 50%, on a quarterly basis, you're looking at somewhere between $60 million and $70 million a quarter, 50% gross margin, i think it's somewhere around $30 million to $40 million, and it's at our cost, of finished goods. so we're certainly well on our way having a balance sheet of $100 million in inventory at our cost, thinking again about 50% gross margin on that number. we're certainly setting ourselves up for a very strong foundation that we've created to beat or achieve quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year revenue growth, again, which is a testament to these recently published financials for our second quarter.
anthony petrone -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks again.
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. and our next question comes from elliot wilbur from raymond james. your line is now open.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. first question for brian, maybe just following up on some of your commentary around cogs and inventory. specifically thinking about the cogs line, always a lot of questions when you have negative margins. but just trying to think about how this line progresses or changes going forward as your top line increases. i guess if i look at second quarter, revenue went up sequentially around $1.8 million, cogs went up around $1 million. is that how we're going to see things progress going forward? basically, you're going to start to see 40%, 50% incremental margin per incremental revenue dollar on top of sort of the average cogs run rate we've seen in the last quarter. just trying to figure out how exactly that number is going to trend as sales continue to accelerate.
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
sure, thanks for the question, elliott. so, a couple things with cogs. when we achieve the $250 million run rate from a revenue standpoint in 2024, we'll essentially be at very close to full capacity production, 90%, 100% capacity production, producing that much product to get to that level. we're certainly not there yet. so we currently do have some unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs that are still in the cost of product revenue line. but as we continue to scale up operations, most importantly, as i mentioned about the 4,400 scale-up, as we continue to produce more bivigam at the 4,400 liter, more products, more margins are going to be improved to essentially generate those additional revenues. so when you think about the -- really the main variable cost, going from a 2,200 liter to a 4,400 liter batch is just the raw material, not a very small modest amount of additional direct labor, but the overhead is essentially the same.
so revenues, to put it simplistically, will be outpacing the overall cogs number in the not too distant future, number one, because of the 4,400 liter batches we're producing now that we're going to be releasing next year. number two, the second half of this year, we have the four [phonetic] 4,400 liter batches, the conformance batches that we manufactured previously once we got the fda approval just this past april a couple months ago, we're hoping to be selling -- we hope to expect to be selling those batches in the second half of this year. so you will see margins continue to improve there. and again, just thinking about the lifecycle timeframe of 4,400 liter production, it will take 7 to 12 months. so we're going to start realizing some of those synergies, cost efficiencies, margin improvement as we've seen this quarter from the previous quarter. we expect those trends to continue to second half of this year and certainly accelerating into the first half of 2022.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
i also think, elliott, if i can just add something, something else to take note of is that with any drug manufacturing, and i think in the comments, brian and i have both said that producing biologics is certainly complicated, complex and not the easiest thing in the world. but there's always the possibility of some onetime, one-off charges and expenses, and they're unpredictable. and these are just things that -- it's hard for us to guide you as an analyst and others, but i think that as we continue to produce more, the effects of maybe some of these discrepancies and one-off occurrences could be less meaningful. additionally, i think with the pandemic and certain issues regarding supply chain, raw material, disposables, consumables, testing reagents, etc., other supplies, there are some costs, shipping charges, one-time expenses.
honestly, i'm sure i don't have to really say these types of things, but you need to get a truck delivered with ethanol, but there's no driver, but you may have to offer the driver an extra $5,000 to get in the truck to come down here to drive it to you. there are there are some very interesting things that are going on across industries with the supply chain that i -- they're just unpredictable right now. but to brian's point, we expect revenues to continue to increase. the product mix is certainly improving. the acceptance of our hyperimmunes is growing. and i think that as we've reported previously, the margins on our hyperimmune products are typically, call it, 60% to 80% gross margin product. the more of those that we can sell, the better our overall cogs are going to be as an operating business unit in the biomanufacturing segment.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. adam, if i can ask you a question as well, historically, nabi has been a relatively steady product. but can you speak to any factors that might be driving marginally increased demand there? and a similar question on asceniv. what may be driving the incremental volume there? is it just overall demand for ivig and then there's capacity constraints? or is it more specifically tied to the emergence or the increase in rsv infections that we've been hearing about in the media?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
sure. with respect to nabi, nabi ebbs and flows across the market. again, we're not -- i'm not hearing about any of our competitors having supply chain issues, but you never know what's occurring there. we've got a pretty competitive price in the marketplace. i know that some of our competitors across our immunoglobulin portfolio and their immunoglobulin portfolios, they've taken some price increases. we feel very good about our pricing across products, and we've recently announced a price increase that's going to take effect, i think, in the next week or so on nabi. and we've got a competitive price. we've got a good product. as you know, it's got a brand name out there.
there are some other factors. i think people are still hunkering down in cohabitation with other people with hepatitis certainly is a labeled indicated use for the drug. and, quite frankly, i think, awareness, maybe some of the marketing programs and some of the campaigns that we spent money on and invested on, i like to think that they're working. with respect to asceniv, as you know, what differentiates asceniv from bivigam and from other immune globulins on the market is our patented method of how we identify and screen plasma donors, and we collect from donors who are tested to have high levels of neutralizing antibodies to respiratory syncytial virus. and our patent states that these donors also seem to have high antibody levels to a panel of other respiratory viral pathogens. and, i cannot explain it. it defies everything that i've ever learned throughout my 25-year career in the rsv, immune globulin space, but global awareness of rsv is heightened. the cdc put out some guidelines a couple of months ago, at least for the southeast region of the united states, that rsv is on high alert. and we're seeing an increased rate of rsv infections in advance of what's typically the normal and customary rsv season.
so, the drug also -- in an outpatient setting, look, when you look at -- again, when you visit the asceniv website, we talk about patients that are suffering from chronic and persistent bacterial, viral infections. they may be on concurrent antibiotic therapy and receiving other drugs there. i think our commercial team and the investments that we've made into the commercial launch, both through the face-to-face approach, the virtual congresses, the website, the media campaigns, everything that we've done, we've made a significant investment into the launch of this product. again, getting the j-code and solidifying reimbursement i think helps. but i think that we're starting to see a good return on our investments that we've made.
something that i talked about, and i mentioned it in my prepared remarks today, is we do a lot of things here at adma. and one of the things that we do is we've built an entire commercial organization to support our three commercial products. and we've got a stellar sales force, a stellar national accounts team. we've got some of the leading market access and reimbursement folks. and i'm proud of where these people have cut their teeth and come from, and now they're bringing their expertise to adma biologics. they're able to flourish here. and i think that -- i take my hat off to this team. it hasn't been easy. it's been a challenge during covid and the pandemic to engage with clinicians. and let's just say, when the country opened up this past summer -- late spring, early summer, when things were opening up, our team pushed me to resume traveling. they were some of the first to get vaccinated, and they've been pounding the pavement, and i'm seeing the expense reports coming through. so we're starting to see some hospital closures. we're starting to see hospital beds fill up. and we're hearing, reading the articles that i'm sure you are as well. but i think it's all a mix of the chaos that is stemming from the pandemic. immune globulin is what you use to prevent or treat certain infectious diseases in immune-compromised people. remember, immune-compromised patients typically don't respond well to vaccines, so, be it an influenza vaccine, an rsv vaccine, we know that there are trials that are that are ongoing, the covid vaccine and all the other normal and customary vaccines, that's the purpose of immune globulin is to provide passive immunity to infectious pathogens.
so i think it's all coming together. and i say it, but i really do mean it. it's not a bad time to be in the immune globulin business. we continue to receive inbound phone calls, and our sales force follows up with them. and we're taking on new customers. and we're really proud of it. and the supply chain cycle, there's improvements anticipated with the upcoming potential approval of the vanrx machine and us taking control in-house. but you're never going to really speed it up faster than that seven, eight, nine, 10 month time frame. that's how long it takes to make these drugs. and you got to think about it like gestating a baby. sometimes they come a little quicker, sometimes they take a little longer, but most of the time, you're looking at nine months. you can't [phonetic] accelerate this process.
so we appreciate our shareholders' patience as we continue to grow and build our manufacturing throughput and as we secure our plasma supply. but at the end of the day, we really want people to feel confident that we've got an excellent commercial team leading the charge out there. they're putting the product into the channel and they're pulling it through. the utilization is there. the reimbursement is there. and all of this is coming together. and i think with our revised guidance that we put out this quarter, where we anticipate the potential to exit this year with $100 million revenue run rate, and that's only going to grow as we proceed through 2022. brian and i can't be more bullish on the amount of finished goods that we're going to be able to provide to the market. and we want the patient community and the patient advocacy community to know that if you have a problem obtaining ig from your standard supplier, we are here and we've got grams available.
elliot wilbur -- raymond james -- analyst
thanks. and one last question, if i may. can you just talk a little bit about the 100 ml vial offering, how important that is to expanding the franchise? i know it's available in limited quantities currently. but when do you have -- when are you kind of at full run rate with respect to that presentation? just curious if that just allows you to expand business with existing customers. does it open new doors just because that's sort of the preferred offering in the market? just strategically, what does that mean in terms of growing the franchise going forward?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
it's -- first of all, it's something all of our competitors have. we have been commercial with a 5 gram, 50 ml vial size. when i was a younger man and i was selling ivig, when you only had 5 gram vials to sell, it was a lot harder than having 10s or 20s. if you think about it, the product is dosed -- typically, immune globulin is dosed at 500 milligrams per kg of body weight. so you take a 70 kilogram adult, you're talking roughly 30 grams to 40 grams is a dose. so when a hospital pharmacist or when a home care pharmacist is preparing the immune globulin for infusion, typically, you will either pull it into a type of infusion transfer bag, or you're going to hang each individual vial. would you rather hang three vials or pull three vials or would you rather pull seven vials? it's a factor of labor costs. and when you're looking at our customer -- and our customer really are the home care companies and the hospitals that are the place where patients are infusing the products -- they look at this like they're a manufacturing organization also, and their time is worth money and they look at these things.
so, having the 100 ml vial certainly helps us to be more competitive, especially in the higher-volume, higher-throughput, specialty pharmacies, home care organizations and hospitals where time is extremely valuable. i think that it also demonstrates our commitment to improving product quality and the diversity of our available offerings. these are all things a commercial manufacturing business does. so i think when you factor all this together, we don't have plans in the short term for additional vial sizes. we plan to offer for bivigam both the 5 and 10, 50 ml and 100 ml vial. the 100 ml vial is available now. so those are available for sale. and as brian mentioned, the vials that we currently have were produced in those four conformance batches that were the basis for the prior approval supplement submission for the approval from fda.
so elliot, coming from a place where we -- you took over this plant with a warning letter. it was not in commercial production at that point in time. you fast forward, our four year anniversary, if you will, was in the second quarter, june 6, was our fourth anniversary. and to get to a place where we've got a full finish line that we just completed an fda pre-approval inspection, with zero 43 observations. we've got new container closure system out there. that means new vial label packaging stopper cap, multiple vial sizes across our product portfolio, three products approved. the plasma center expansion and build out is exceeding our expectations. we've accomplished a lot of things in four years. and i think that our customers see it. and i know it's a long answer to your question about the 100 ml size, but i think it all really makes a difference, and it puts adma on the same playing field as the csls, takedas, grifols, bpls and kedrions. i don't think that there is a hospital pharmacy or a homecare company out there that isn't aware that adma biologics is a player and has grams available, should they need them, with bivigam, asceniv and nabi-hb.

skyler bloom -- director, investor relations and corporate strategy
welcome, everyone, and thank you for joining us this afternoon to discuss adma biologics' financial results for the second quarter of 2021 and recent corporate updates. i'm joined today by adam grossman, president and chief executive officer; and brian lenz, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
during today's call, adam will provide some introductory comments and provide an update on corporate progress, and then brian will provide an overview of the company's second quarter 2021 financial results. finally, adam will then provide some brief summary remarks before opening up the call for your questions.

before we begin our formal comments, i'll remind you that we will be making forward-looking assertions during today's call that represent the company's intentions expectations or beliefs concerning future events, which constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. all forward-looking statements are subject to factors, risks and uncertainties such as those detailed in today's press release announcing this call and in our filings with the sec, which may cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by such statements. in addition, any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of this date of this call and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. we specifically disclaim any obligations to update any such statements, except as required by the federal securities laws. we refer you to the disclosure notice section in our earnings release we issued today and the risk factors section of our 2020 annual report on form 10-k and our quarterly report on form 10-q for the second quarter ended june 30, 2021 for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.
with that, i would now like to turn the call over to adam grossman. adam?
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
thank you, skyler. good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. we hope those joining us today remain healthy and safe. adma continues to excel with the commercial launch and revenue ramp-up of its immunoglobulin and hyperimmune globulin product portfolio, as well as more broadly, advancing our company's strategic goals to create value for stockholders in the periods to come.
the underlying business trends for our commercial immune globulin business have never been stronger, and the operational execution by our organization across business segments cannot be overstated. the significant strides made during the first half of 2021 form the foundation for continued quarter-over-quarter revenue growth over the remainder of the year and thereafter. the totality of our achievements to date will enable adma to enter the next phase of its profit-oriented growth strategy from a position of strength.
the multi-year investment and remediation initiatives will be successfully winding down with the anticipated approval of the vanrx aseptic fill-finish machine over the coming months. and as a result, the company is now on the precipice of realizing significant operating leverage on its pathway to corporate profitability.
during the second quarter of 2021, adma exceeded analysts' consensus top line revenue forecasts for the fourth consecutive quarter, generating record quarterly revenues of $17.8 million, representing a 129% growth rate compared to the second quarter of 2020. additionally, the company successfully narrowed gross and net losses year-over-year, a trend adma believes can continue in the coming quarters and further accelerate throughout 2022.
while adma's revenue and execution of its business plan have seen record and favorable results over the past several quarters, it is important to highlight that pandemic-related headwinds have impacted and continue to impact adma's commercial launch phase. further, these records second quarter financial results do not yet reflect the added benefits expected in the recent fda approval of our 4,400-liter expanded ivig production scale, the additional plasma center developments, including opening a new plasma center, and implementing the new persona donor collection software, nor includes the operating efficiencies expected from the anticipated vanrx approval over the coming months. we expect these approvals and enhancements to act as significant tailwinds for our business over the remainder of 2021 and beyond. said another way, through unprecedented adversity, adma is just beginning to scratch the surface of the ultimate financial and value potential we believe this asset base and biologic drug manufacturing organization is now able to support.
we expect the supply chain milestones achieved thus far in 2021 will result in greater product yields and cost of goods sold improvements to support both near-term and ongoing financial results. and importantly, they will set the stage for durable value creation and continued narrowing of both gross and net losses over the longer term.
the recent achievement of fda finding no form 483 observations as part of the pre-approval inspection for the vanrx aseptic fill-finish machine should pave the way for an anticipated approval over the coming months. when approved, the licensure of the vanrx machine will cap a successful multi-year remediation process and supply chain investment initiative at the boca raton, florida manufacturing facility, propelling adma into an elite group of us-based drug manufacturers with comprehensive in-house control of a majority of its critical manufacturing functions.
the covid-19 pandemic has illuminated high-profile vulnerabilities in pharmaceutical supply chain among our large and mid-size peers. and it is in this context that we believe the successful remediation of our manufacturing operations, establishment of end-to-end supply chain control and adma's continued commitment to cgmp compliance uniquely differentiates our manufacturing footprint and is a testament to our industry-leading regulatory, quality and operational personnel.
in addition to recently revising the plant's annual peak production capacity up to 600,000 liters, as well as increasing peak revenue guidance to $300 million or more, adma will actively explore new contract manufacturing opportunities, following the anticipated approval of the vanrx machine in the second half of 2021, which could add additional revenue sources presently uncontemplated in the company's current financial targets. we intend to provide updates to these financial objectives and communicate developments to the market as appropriate over the coming months.
ensuring uninterrupted raw material plasma supply has been a strategic priority and investment focus for adma prior to and throughout the covid-19 pandemic. industrywide headwinds pressuring plasma collection remain intact and are likely to sustain due to recent us government policy restrictions pertaining to the us-mexico border and plasma collection facilities, among other variables. accordingly, we believe the 2021 year to date milestones achieved by our adma biocenters business unit will yield significant results and largely insulate the company from broader market plasma collection and pricing fluctuations in the periods ahead.
most notably, the first half of 2021 can be defined by three overarching achievements for adma biocenters segment and ongoing raw material supply: one, the implementation of haemonetics' persona technology across our plasma collection center network, which is expected to enhance collection yield by approximately 8%; two, the extension of our company's principal third-party plasma supply contract through year-end 2022; and three, the continued on-track expansion of the biocenters plasma collection center network, which now includes eight centers in various stages of approval and development. collectively, the benefits of these three elements establish a solid foundation for adma to ensure continuity of product supply into an increasingly supply constrained immune globulin market.
adma's robust inventories of approximately $100 million at the end of the second quarter further validates the company's commitment to generate quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2021 and beyond, as well as meet the production needs to achieve longer-term revenue guidance of $300 million or more. all told, adma remains on track to have 10 or more fda-approved plasma collection facilities in operation by 2024.
adma is hitting its stride at a moment in time when immune globulin and continuity of plasma supply has arguably never been more critical or threatened. less than two years into the commercial launch of our company's immune globulin and hyperimmune globulin products portfolio, adma has established a strong foundation to continue to penetrate the rapidly growing us immune globulin market, which reached approximately $9.5 billion in total revenues in 2020, up approximately 19% year-over-year.
with adma's commercial portfolio now annualizing more than $71 million in top line sales and with losses continuing to narrow, we anticipate the next several quarters of forward-looking financial results will be reflective of what we believe is a highly undervalued asset base well on its way to generating peak revenues of $300 million or more with significant profitability beginning no later than the first quarter of 2024. additionally, as previously mentioned, we believe there may be opportunities to formally revisit the company's current top line revenue and profitability guidance as the year progresses and anticipated regulatory events unfold. the evaluation of these targets is ongoing, and we look forward to communicating more in the periods ahead.
we would like to thank the adma biologics team for keeping its focus and continuing to execute. producing biologics is a very complex process with many constituents throughout the supply chain. and i commend you all for meeting our top goal, delivering for the patients who are counting on us. additionally, we are sincerely grateful to our stockholders for their continued support of our efforts to provide lifesaving products to patients in need.
with that said, i'd now like to turn the call over to brian for a review of the second quarter 2021 financials.
brian lenz -- executive vice president, chief financial officer
thank you, adam. since we issued a press release earlier today outlining our second quarter 2021 financial results, i'll just review some of the highlights. for the second quarter of 2021, total revenues were $17.8 million, compared to $7.8 million for the second quarter of 2020. this represents an increase of $10 million, or approximately 129%. the revenue growth for the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 was favorably impacted by the continued commercial ramp-up of our ivig product portfolio and expanding customer base at both our biocenters plasma collection segment as well as in our biomanufacturing segment.
additionally, adma grew its total asset base to a quarter-end balance of approximately $232.8 million, which includes approximately $100 million in inventory. adma expects the robust inventories, which are recorded at the company's cost, to support quarter-over-quarter revenue growth throughout 2021 and beyond, as well as meet the production needs to achieve longer-term revenue guidance of $300 million or more. this inventory balance consists of raw materials, including source plasma and other materials expected to be used in the production, as well as work in process and finished goods inventories comprised of our commercial ivig products and intermediate fractions.
in the periods ahead, adma anticipates continuing to purchase raw materials, while also growing its internal plasma collection center network, building work in process inventories, as well as finished goods inventories. given the ongoing industry plasma collection constraints, as adam previously characterized, we intend to retain a portion of our growing inventories as safety stock, which we believe will help solidify our emerging position as a reliable supplier to our customers, distribution partners and prescribers over the coming quarters.
our consolidated net loss for the second quarter of 2021 was approximately $18.9 million or $0.15 loss per basic and diluted share, compared to a consolidated net loss of approximately $20.2 million or a $0.23 loss per basic and diluted share for the second quarter of 2020. the decrease in year-over-year net loss was primarily attributable to increased revenues and improved gross margins. with this being the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, we anticipate this trend to continue in the periods ahead.
with that, i will now turn the call back over to adam for closing remarks.
adam s. grossman -- founder, director, president and chief executive officer
thank you, brian. within two years following fda approval of asceniv and bivigam, adma has successfully established end-to-end control of its manufacturing chain, and while doing so, has also built a high caliber commercial organization well positioned to compete in the rapidly growing us immune globulin market. this market is expected to reach approximately $17.2 billion in annual revenues by 2027.
adma's 2021 year-to-date accomplishments across business segments will enable the company to accelerate robust financial trends in the period ahead and enter the next phase of what we believe will be a multi-decade profit-oriented lifecycle opportunity. in the short term, we now anticipate exiting 2021 with an annualized revenue run rate of approximately $100 million or more.
additionally, and as communicated in prior calls, we as a management team and board of directors have invested significant capital into the company. and we are acutely aware of the valuation disconnect between adma's appreciating intrinsic value and the company's current market cap. we are aligned with you, our stockholders. as such, we are considering alternative business opportunities to maximize stockholder value, including, for example, the acquisition or sale of specific assets or businesses, collaboration and/or license agreements, or other co-development agreements or arrangements. we look forward to a strong remainder of 2021 and the bright future for adma biologics.
in closing, i'd like to thank you, our stockholders, for your continued support, as your investment in adma helps to advance our mission to save lives, make good efficacious, safe products that help our friends, family and neighbors. please donate plasma and help save lives.
and with that, i'd now like to open up the call for your questions.
