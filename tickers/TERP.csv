sherif el-azzazi -- head of investor relations
thank you, sidney. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our 2019 fourth-quarter and full-year results conference call and webcast. i'm joined today by john stinebaugh, our chief executive officer; and michael tebbutt, our chief financial officer. please note that a copy of our earnings release, supplemental information, and letter to shareholders can be found on our website, terraformpower.com.

in addition, we will refer to non-gaap financial measures. for more information on the reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures, please refer to our earnings release and supplemental information. with that, i'll now turn the call over to john. 
john stinebaugh -- chief executive officer
thanks, sherif. in 2019, terraform power made substantial progress executing its business plan of acquiring high-quality assets for value, enhancing the cash flow from its existing asset base, and strengthening its balance sheet. as a number of the key initiatives were completed during the course of the year, our financials do not fully reflect these benefits. nonetheless, terraform power increased cafd per share by 17% year over year, primarily driven by the full-year contribution from the acquisition of saeta.
i'll briefly go through a few select highlights from 2019 and subsequent to year end. first, we executed value-adding acquisitions totaling 400 megawatt -- 480 megawatts, including the acquisition of 320 megawatts of dg solar assets in the united states in the fourth quarter in the recent acquisitions of 145 megawatts of solar plants in spain, deploying equity of approximately $440 million. with regards to repowering, we received all permits and a non-materiality determination from the new york independent system operator required for our two new york projects of total 160 megawatts. and we continue to target commercial operation date in 2021.
upon signing long-term service agreements, we transitioned 15 out of 16 wind farms in north america to ge, who are providing o&m services, an initiative that is expected to reduce o&m cost/expense by $20 million. we also replaced the legacy operator of our wind farms in europe with the original equipment manufacturers and executed ltsas that are expected to lock in annualized cost reductions of $4 million. and finally, we signed a framework agreement with sma solar technology to provide o&m services for our north american solar fleet, an initiative that is expected to reduce annualized costs by approximately $5 million and convey robust performance guarantees to our fleet. now, i'll turn the call over to mike, who will discuss our financial results and provide an update on our liquidity.
michael tebbutt -- chief financial officer
thanks, john, and good morning, everyone. i'd like to start by recapping our financial results. in 2019, we generated cafd of $173 million, which was $47 million greater than 2018. on a per share basis, cafd was $0.81, which was a 17% increase over the prior year.
the increase was largely attributable to a full-year contribution from the saeta acquisition, which closed in june 2018, a partial year contribution from our recent dg acquisition and cost savings from the implementation of ltsas in north america and europe. this was offset by lower availability from our north american wind fleet as we accelerated deferred maintenance in order to implement the ltsas, as well as lower realized prices in north american wind due to contract roll-off and greater negative basis in texas and [inaudible] spanish wholesale market prices. factoring in depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash charges, 2019 net loss attribute to class a shareholders was $149 million, compared to net income of $12 million in 2018. the year-on-year change was primarily due to higher allocation of losses to non-controlling interests in the prior year, related to the reduction in u.s.
corporate tax rates. moving on to our liquidity. in 2019, we continued to capitalize on attractive market conditions to bolster our liquidity and position ourselves for growth. in october, we issued $300 million of equity priced at $16.77 per share, representing a 50% premium to our price at the beginning of 2019.
during the year, we were very active on the liability management front at both the corporate and project levels, locking in historically low interest rates. we issued $700 million of 10-year senior notes at a coupon of 4.75% and used the proceeds to repay our $300 million notes due 2025 and a $344 million term loan b due 2022. with that refinancing, we expect to realize debt service savings of $6 million per year and extend our maturity profile such that we have no corporate maturities until 2023. over the course of 2019, we also completed seven non-recourse debt refinancings to actually $1.6 billion, raising net proceeds of $460 million and lowering our weighted average interest rate by 50 basis points.
as a result of these initiatives, our corporate liquidity stood at $1.3 billion at the end of 2019, including our $500 million sponsor line with brookfield. i'll now turn the call back to john to discuss outlook and provide an update on the merger agreement with brookfield renewable.
john stinebaugh -- chief executive officer
thanks, michael. as i mentioned, despite substantial progress in executing its business plan, 2019 was a transition year for terraform power from a financial perspective. we executed a number of key initiatives that significantly increased the value of our asset base yet these initiatives were not fully reflected in our financial results. in 2020, terraform power will benefit from nearly a full-year results from the 480 megawatts acquisitions of dg assets in north america and regulated solar assets in spain.
furthermore, we should realize the vast majority of the benefits from the cost savings and performance guarantees in the o&m agreements for our wind fleet in north america and europe, as well as our solar fleet in north america. as a result of the rapid global spread of covid-19 pandemic, there's been tremendous uncertainty as to the economic impact of the virus on supply chains and consumer demand as well as unprecedented volatility in the financial markets over the past few weeks. fortunately, we believe terraform power is well-positioned to ride out the crisis as 95% of our revenue is generated under long-term contracts and have a weighted average contract duration of 13 years, which insulates our business from declines in commodity prices. in addition, we have a geographically diversified portfolio of projects, of which over 90% of our ppa offtakers are either investment grade credits, or municipalities with investment grade characteristics, mitigating our exposure to any single region or counter party.
also, our business is less labor intensive than most other industries, which enables us to allow many of our staff and contractors to work remotely for extended period of time without impacting operations. and finally, our wind and solar assets are predominantly operational, mitigating our exposure to supply chain disruptions. we will continue to monitor this situation very closely, in particular focusing on the impact these events are having on our o&m providers and any adverse impact to our customers, but we remain confident in the resilience of our business. now, i'll spend a few minutes discussing the merger with brookfield renewable.
i'm very pleased to report that last evening brookfield renewable and terraform power entered into a definitive merger agreement by which brookfield renewable will acquire each share of class a common stock of terraform power for consideration equivalent to 0.381 of a brookfield renewable power -- renewable partners unit. terraform power shareholders can elect to receive their consideration in units of brookfield renewable partners or bep, a limited partnership, which currently trades on the new york stock exchange and the toronto stock exchange, or shares of brookfield renewable corporation or bepc, a new security that will be launched in conjunction with the close of the merger that is designed to be equivalent in value to a unit of bep. for reference, bepc will be a canadian corporation listed on the tsx and the nyse, and will be structured with the intention of being economically equivalent to bep units, including identical distributions, and it will be fully exchangeable at any time at the shareholder's option for a bep unit on a one-for-one basis. the special committee of terp's board of directors has unanimously recommended the transaction, which features an improved exchange ratio relative to brookfield renewable's initial proposed offer in january of 0.36 units of bep for each terp share and provides a 17% premium to terp's unaffected share price.
the transaction is subject to the approval of terp shareholders, representing a majority of the outstanding terp class a common shares not owned by brookfield renewable and its affiliates. it is also subject to other customary closing conditions. it is expected that this transaction will close in the third quarter of 2020. now, i want to take a moment and highlight the benefits of this merger to terp shareholders.
terp shareholders will be owners of a combined company that will be one of the largest integrated pure play renewable power companies in the world with total assets of approximately $50 billion and with a 20-year track record of delivering strong total returns across a number of economic cycles, as well as consistent distribution growth. in addition, terp shareholders will benefit from the premium of 17% to terp's unaffected stock price. a broader growth mandate that includes acquisitions of all technologies of renewable power assets as well as development opportunities globally, enhanced diversification through exposure to long-life hydro assets in addition to wind and solar assets, as well as geographic exposure to the high-growth asian and latin american markets in addition to north america and europe, reduced risk as a result of brookfield renewable's strong investment grade balance sheet and increased liquidity, as well as finally continued sponsorship by brookfield renewable asset management, which will own 54% of the combined company. in closing, we believe this merger provides significant value for terp shareholders, giving them the ability to continue participating in the upside of terp's operating assets in developed markets while benefiting from brookfield renewable's enhance diversification, development capabilities, and strong investment-grade balance sheet.
we encourage shareholders to vote for the transaction at the shareholder meeting, details of which will be announced in due course. this concludes our formal remarks. we'd be pleased to take questions at this time. operator?

hey, guys. congrats on the great results.
john stinebaugh -- chief executive officer
thanks.
antoine aurimond -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
just a quick question with regards to the acquisition from brookfield. is there any plans to sort of refinance the terp capital structure in the near future?
john stinebaugh -- chief executive officer
at closing, terraform power will be a subsidiary of brookfield renewable. so, its corporate debt will remain in place as well as the project debt underneath the corporate debt. at this point, i am not aware of any plans to refinance that corporate debt.
antoine aurimond -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
i'm sorry. i didn't catch that. at this point?

john stinebaugh -- chief executive officer
thanks, sherif. in the first quarter of 2020, terraform power continued to execute its business plan of enhancing the cash flow from its existing asset base, investing in organic growth opportunities and strengthening its balance sheet. i'll briefly go through a few key highlights. we continue to make significant progress on the repowering of our 160-megawatt cohocton and steel winds projects in new york.
the projects were recently awarded rec contracts by nyserda for the 25% of incremental production resulting from the repowerings. these rec contracts have 20-year terms at attractive prices. we also made substantial progress on the related project agreements and are targeting executing a corporate ppa, the nyserda rec contracts, the turbine supply agreement with ge and tax equity agreements in the second quarter of 2020. we remain on track to commence construction in the first half of 2021.
while we do not anticipate any delays due to supply chain issues resulting from covid-19, we continue to actively monitor the situation. turning to operations. we have signed ltsa agreements for 540 megawatts of projects in our north american solar portfolio and transitioned operations of these projects to sma. we have sent out consent packages to project lenders and tax equity investors for the remaining 450 megawatts of projects in our north american solar fleet.
upon receipt of these consents, we are targeting execution of the balance of the ltsas and transfer of operations to sma by the end of the third quarter of 2020. our new o&m contracts are expected to reduce annualized costs by approximately $5 million and convey robust performance guarantees to our fleet. with regards to the covid-19 pandemic, we have taken important steps to ensure our employees and contractors are safe. at the end of march, we closed our new york city and madrid offices and implemented our business continuity plan.
currently, the majority of our corporate and operations teams are working remotely with minimal disruption. over the past weeks, we've engaged with o&m providers to ensure that they have appropriate business continuity plans in place to safeguard the health of our employees and contractors, as well as to ensure our wind and solar plants continue to generate power. to date, we have not seen any material degradation in the performance of our assets as a result of the pandemic. however, in a number of our distributed generation solar sites, we experienced temporary inability to access sites due to limitations on nonessential work.
in such instances, we work with local authorities to clarify that these regulations did not apply to our assets, and we now have access to these assets. we continue to monitor this developing situation, and we will provide further updates as appropriate. all in all, we believe that terraform power is positioned to ride out the covid-19 pandemic given it's 95% of our revenues are under long-term contracts, over 90% of our ppa off-takers are either investment-grade rated or municipalities with investment-grade characteristics. our business is less labor-intensive than most other industries, and our assets are predominantly operational, which mitigates our exposure to supply chain disruptions.
now i'll turn the call over to michael to discuss our financial results and provide an update on liquidity.
michael tebbutt -- chief financial officer
thanks, john, and good morning, everyone. i'd like to start by recapping our financial results. in the first quarter of 2020, terraform power had a net loss attributable to class a common stockholders, adjusted ebitda and cafd of $55 million, $180 million and $20 million, respectively. this represents an increase in net loss of $46 million, an increase in adjusted ebitda of $2 million and a decrease in cafd of $24 million compared to the same period in 2019.
performance in the quarter was negatively impacted by a 36% decline in market prices in spain, as well as 6% lower wind generation in north america compared to the first quarter of 2019. offsetting these factors were contributions from recent acquisitions, as well as high srec revenues. the lower market prices in spain were, in part, caused by lower demand resulting from the economic slowdown caused by covid-19 pandemic. we expect this decline in market prices in spain to be mitigated through the price ban adjustment mechanism defined under the spanish regulated revenue framework, whereby any shortfall in the actual power price compared to the forecasted power price outside of spain are recouped in future periods through an increase in the capacity payments that our assets receive.
the lower wind generation in north america was mainly due to lower resources, especially in our central and northeast regions, as production guarantees in our ge o&m contracts largely offset availability that was below expectation. moving on to our liquidity. despite the challenges covid-19 posed to the capital markets during the first quarter, we were able to continue executing our plan to extend debt maturities and reduce financing costs. in march, we completed $246 million in project-level refinancing of one of our north american wind farms at a rate of 3.28%, which we expect to achieve interest savings of $2.5 million per annum.
the senior note -- senior secured notes are fully amortizing with a final maturity in june 2037. at the end of the first quarter, our total corporate liquidity was $1.2 billion, inclusive of our $500 million sponsor line with -- credit agreement with brookfield asset management. i'll now turn the call back over to john.
john stinebaugh -- chief executive officer
in march, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with brookfield renewable to acquire all the outstanding shares of class a common stock of terraform power, other than the approximate 62% currently owned by brookfield renewable and its affiliates. each share of class a common stock of terraform power will be acquired for consideration equivalent to 0.381 of a brookfield renewable unit. for each share of terraform power's class a common stock, shareholders will be entitled to receive at their election either class a shares of brookfield renewable corporation or limited partnership units of brookfield renewable. the special committee of the board of directors of terraform power, comprised solely of non-executive independent directors, has unanimously recommended that terraform power shareholders approve the transaction.
the special committee believes the transaction is fair and in the best interest of terraform power and its unaffiliated shareholders. a preliminary version of brookfield renewables f-1 merger proxy was recently filed with the sec. once the merger proxy is finalized, the transaction is expected to be presented for approval of terraform power shareholders representing a majority of the outstanding shares of terraform power class a common stock not owned by brookfield renewable and its affiliates. the transaction is subject to other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2020.
now i'd like to discuss our outlook. when brookfield became our sponsor in 2017, terraform power owned 2,600 megawatts of wind and solar assets primarily in the united states. since its assets have been largely neglected during its former sponsor's distress and bankruptcy, a major aspect of our business plan was to enhance the value of terraform power to existing asset base and invest in organic growth opportunities within its portfolio. over the past three years, we've made significant progress on executing this plan through cost reductions of approximately $30 million, signing o&m agreements that include robust production guarantees at lta generation levels and progressing two important repowering projects.
we have significantly increased the cash flow generating capacity of terraform power and enhanced shareholder value. in order to grow the business, our mandate relative to other brookfield-sponsored entities was to acquire operating wind and solar power assets in north america and western europe. in a little over two years, we invested $1.2 billion of equity to expand into western europe and an additional $440 million of equity to further grow our european business and build out our distributed generation business in the united states. not only did these transactions increase the scale of our business to 4,200 megawatts, but we expect them to meet or exceed our return on equity target of 9% to 11%.
since we've harvested most of the low-hanging fruit within our existing asset base, terraform power is entering a new stage of its growth cycle in which we will have to deploy significantly more capital to continue achieving our distribution growth target of 5% to 8% per year. furthermore, as a result of a substantial increase in institutional capital-seeking investments in operating wind and solar assets in developed markets, the ability to achieve its target returns has become more challenging. as such, the timing of our pending merger with brookfield renewable is opportune. following the close of the transaction, our shareholders will own a significant stake in one of the largest publicly traded, globally diversified, multi-technology, pure-play renewable power platforms with total assets of approximately $50 billion and annual funds from operations of approximately $1 billion.
in addition, shareholders will participate in a broader growth mandate that includes investments in high-growth countries, such as brazil, india and china, as well as the opportunity to invest in higher-returning development projects through brookfield renewable's 13,000-megawatt development pipeline. this broader growth mandate should enable brookfield renewable to continue achieving its higher return on equity target of 12% to 15% and its distribution growth target of 5% to 9% annually. finally, shareholders will upgrade their investment to a bbb+ balance sheet with liquidity in excess of $3 billion, which is even more important in today's turbulent macroeconomic environment. for these reasons, we believe the merger is of great value for terraform power shareholders, and we encourage you to vote in favor of the transaction at the upcoming shareholder meeting, details of which will be announced in due course.
this concludes my formal remarks, we'd be pleased to take questions at this time.

operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of colin rusch from oppenheimer. your line is now open.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thanks so much, guys. as we look out at your growth prospects and certainly, the brookfield relationship enhances your position as an acquirer of assets. but as you survey the landscape, could you talk about the opportunities for acquisitions, distressed projects, as well as the access to capital from the debt markets right now that you're seeing?
john stinebaugh -- chief executive officer
sure. we do think that the market volatility caused by covid-19 is going to potentially present some interesting opportunities. initially, there was a significant trade-off in the public market certainly. although many companies have largely rebounded, what we have seen is that there is uncertainty in terms of the cost of capital.
and in particular, within the renewable power sector, the cost of tax equity is uncertain. so that's creating greater uncertainty from a developer perspective as to what their development margins are. and we think that all of this could potentially lead to some interesting opportunities for terraform, as well as brookfield renewable. generally, we still are very bullish about the continued build-out of renewables in all of our target markets, so we think that the trend is going to continue to be a very strong trend for the foreseeable future.
and what we're excited about with the combination of brookfield renewable and terraform power is the ability to have a broader growth mandate. we are seeing right now that if you look at risk-adjusted returns, we think it's more attractive to invest at the development stage as opposed to the operating stage. there's a lot of capital looking to invest in operating projects which has squeezed returns. but we think that you earn attractive risk-adjusted returns if you've got the development capability to invest earlier stage in projects and capture premium returns that we think more than compensates for the risk.
so that's one of the big opportunities that we're excited about from the combined platform.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
all right. and then just thinking about the tax equity market and some of the public reporting that's happened around the potential for changes to treasury guidelines and rules around tax equity and the potential for cash or the tax equity requirement, at least for a period of time, what's your best diligence and intelligence right now on what's happening with those provisions from the federal government?
john stinebaugh -- chief executive officer
it's hard to say. certainly, if you look at the financial crisis, there was the cash in lieu of production tax credits, the cash grants that were offered. and i think part of the reason for that is there was a lot of uncertainty regarding the tax appetite of a number of the investors in tax equity. and as a consequence, i think that's certainly one of the things that's being discussed right now as an incentive to help continue the sponsorship in support of renewables during this crisis.
so it's something i know it's certainly on the drawing board, and it's being advocated by a number of the lobbyists that support the industry. we view that to be a positive. we like being able to utilize the cash grant, have more simplified capital structures that where you don't necessarily need to incorporate tax equity into your capital structure. but we're -- with the strong relationships we have with banks, even if tax equity continues to be a important form of financing, we've got access because of the strong relationships in the brookfield group to tax equity.
and i think we'll be able to continue using that as an important financing tool.
colin rusch -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
thanks so much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of nelson ng from rbc capital markets. your line is now open.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
great. thanks, and good morning, everyone. my first question relates to the draft merger proxy. do you think it will be finalized this quarter? or do you expect a few extra turns on the documents kind of implying for a q3 date for finalizing the documents?
john stinebaugh -- chief executive officer
yes. it's a tough one, nelson. on the one hand, it is a pretty complex document because not only do you have the merger, but there is bepc, the c-corp equivalent that the sec has to review as well. so as a consequence of that, we do think there's going to be questions that we receive by the sec that we'll have to address before we can finalize the proxy.
it's hard to say to what extent working remotely is going to affect schedule and whatnot. but i think we generally think that probably 60 days after filing it, we should be in a position to finalize it as a rough estimate. so we filed it end of april, so 60 days would kind of push a -- with the wait time for shareholder vote to a close, it would be sometime mid-second quarter, which -- sorry, mid-third quarter, which we still think is our best estimate.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then my next question relates to the new york wind repowering projects. so i think you said the repowering would start next year. is the completion date also in 2021? or would that drag into 2022?
john stinebaugh -- chief executive officer
the completion date is 2021. so we've got basically a schedule that we're negotiating with ge that it'd be basically beginning of the fourth quarter that we would anticipate completing, both cohocton, as well as steel winds, which then provides a good probably six to eight weeks of cushion in order to make sure that turbines are online by the end of '21 to qualify for the 80% ptcs.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
ok. and then is there -- like in terms of the u.s. charger's potential one-year extension, is there any potential upside for getting 100% of the ptc qualification rather than 80%?
john stinebaugh -- chief executive officer
i don't think so. because in order to access the 80% ptcs, we've been working with ge to purchase turbines that have been warehoused at that level. so where we are in terms of finalizing our turbine supply agreement, tax equity agreements and all that -- the other project documents, we're well down the path. so our focus is on basically get our documents executed, maintain the schedule that we're on for the 80% ptc turbines, and our economics have always been predicated on the 80% ptc turbines.
nelson ng -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
got it. and then just one last question. in terms of interest expense on the regulated wind and solar segment, i think there was a material increase from $15 million to $21 million during the quarter. does that include some onetime costs? or is it purely due to the recent tuck-in acquisition?
michael tebbutt -- chief financial officer
nelson, it's michael. it's predominantly related to the acquisition that we've completed end of december and in february.

good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the terraform power 2020 second quarter results webcast and conference call for investors and analysts. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to michael tebbutt, chief financial officer. you may begin.
michael tebbutt -- chief financial officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for 2020 second quarter results conference call and webcast. before we begin, i'd like to remind you that a copy of our quarterly financial report can be found under the financials and sec filings page on our website at terraformpower.com.
note also, that we'll -- may make forward-looking statements on this call. these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, and our actual results may differ materially. for more information, you're encouraged to review the risk factors section in our sec filings, which can be found on our website.
in addition, we'll refer to non-gaap financial measures. for more information on a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures, please refer to the supporting reconciliation document we posted on our events and presentations page on our website at terraformpower.com.
i'd like to begin by making a few comments related to our recent merger transaction. as recently announced, we completed the merger transaction with brookfield renewable and terraform power on july 31, and terraform power's common shares were delisted from the nasdaq stock market. we believe the merger will have an immediate positive impact to terraform power's business.
the combined company will be one of the largest, integrated, and pure play renewable power companies in the world, with one of the strongest investment grade balance sheets in the sector, with no material near-term maturities, and a 20-year track record of creating shareholder value through multiple economic cycles. this combined company will also benefit from a simplified ownership structure as well as continued sponsorship by brookfield asset management.
in terms of the covid-19 pandemic's impact to terraform power's operations, we have not seen and do not expect a significant impact on the performance of our critical infrastructure assets due to our contracting nature of our cash flows, the scale of our business, and our market and offtake diversification. we are confident on the resiliency of our business and operations, given the nature of our long-term stable cash flows, 95% of which are secured by long-term contracts with an average duration of 14 years across a diverse set of investment grade customers.
turning to our operations, at this time, we have signed substantially all long-term service agreements with sma solar technology for the majority of our north american solar o&m provider, which corresponds to close to 1,000 megawatts. during quarter two, we transitioned around half of 480 megawatts of projects to sma, and we're on track for the remaining sites to transition by september.
i'm also pleased for report that in june, we signed a number of key transaction agreements in connection with the $165 million repowering, about 160-megwatt cohocton and steel winds facilities in new york. these include a framework agreement with ge, which secures 80% ptc eligible turbines, and is comprised of detailed term sheets for the turbine supply agreement, and a 20-year full-wrap ltsa o&m agreement, a 12-year power purchase agreement, and a tax equity term sheet with two large financial institutions. we're targeting, finalizing all material project agreements in the third quarter, and continue to expect the project to generate attractive returns. we remain on track to commence construction in the first half of 2021.
from a financial performance perspective, in the second quarter of 2020, terraform power delivered adjusted ebitda of $216 million. this represents an increase in adjusted ebitda of $20 million compared to the same period in 2019. performance in the quarter was positively impacted by contributions from our acquisitions of utility scale solar assets in spain and dg solar assets in the united states, which took place in late 2019 and early 2020, as well as by performance guarantees and cost savings achieved from the implementation of our long-term service agreements with our o&m providers. these contributions were offset by lower market power prices due to covid-19 pandemic and lower results in spain. the lower impact of -- sorry, the impact of lower prices in spain will be mitigated through price ban adjustment mechanism defined under the spanish regulated revenue framework, whereby, any shortfalls in the actual power price compared to the forecasted power price, are recouped in future periods through an increase in the capacity payments that our assets receive.
in terms of the debt and a liquidity uptake, from a non-recourse debt perspective in june, we closed on a 16-year eur463 million refinancing of our recently acquired 100-megawatt portfolio of csp projects in spain at attractive terms that exceeded our initial underwriting.
at the end of quarter two, we had $693 million of corporate liquidity, which is ample liquidity to fund our capital requirements and growth initiatives. overall, 93% of our total debt is fixed rate or swapped debt, and we continue to have a very manageable corporate debt stack with no corporate maturities until 2023.
that concludes our remarks for today. if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact our investor relations team at investors@terraform.com. thank you.

good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the terraform power operating, llc, 2020 third quarter of 2020 results webcast and conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to michael tebbutt, chief financial officer. you may begin.
michael tebbutt -- chief financial officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our 2020 third quarter results conference call and webcast for terraform power operating, llc. before we begin, i'd like to remind you that a copy of our quarter three 2020 financial report can be found under quarterly reports on the financial and sec filings page on our website at terraformpower.com.
note also that we may make forward-looking statements on this call. these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and our actual results may differ materially. in addition, we will refer to non-gaap financial measures. for more information on a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures, please refer to our quarter three 2020 financial report under item 2, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
turning to operations, our business performed well in the quarter, supported by strong asset availability and contributions from recent acquisitions and we advanced key strategic priorities, including our merger with brookfield renewable and maintaining a robust balance sheet and access to capital. from a financial perspective, in the third quarter of 2020, terraform power delivered adjusted ebitda of $238 million. this represents an increase in adjusted ebitda of $45 million compared to the third quarter of 2019. performance in the quarter was positively impacted by contributions from our acquisitions of utility scale solar assets in spain and distributed generation solar assets in the united states which took place in late 2019 and early 2020, as well as cost savings, including performance guarantees, and the implementation of our long-term service agreements with our o&m providers. these contributions were partially offset by lower generation levels in north america solar.
as we mentioned in our last earnings call, we signed all long-term service agreements with sma solar technology for this substantial majority of our north american solar fleet. on october 01, we completed the transition of all of the underlying projects to sma, which corresponds to close to 1,000 megawatts. we are also making good progress on the repowering of our 160 megawatt cohocton and steel winds facilities in new york, underpinned by a 12-year power purchase agreement with verizon and expect to finalize all material project and financing agreements in the fourth quarter and to commence construction in the first half of 2021.
turning to our debt and liquidity, at the end of the third quarter, we had $569 million of corporate liquidity, which is ample liquidity to fund our capital requirements. overall, 91% of our total debt is fixed rate or swap debt and we continue to have a very manageable corporate debt stack with no corporate maturities until 2023. in the quarter, we financed a 250-megawatt portfolio of distributed generation assets in the united states, investment grade private place market. the 23-year, $296 million issuance priced at a low fixed-rate coupon of 3.38%. net proceeds from this non-recourse project level financing were used to make a partial pay-down of our bridge financing facility associated with the 2019 altagas dg portfolio acquisition. we expect to repay the remaining amount outstanding under the bridge financing prior to year end with proceeds from another well-advanced, non-recourse financing. in addition, this was our inaugural green-labeled financing issued in accordance with our 2020 green finance framework, which describes the approach of the company with regards to issuing green debt instruments in various formats to finance or refinance investments in renewable energy. for more information, our green finance framework can be found at terraformpower.com under esg highlights.
subsequent to quarter end, we completed the sale of a minority interest share in an 852-megawatt portfolio of four wind projects located in the united states by selling a 40% interest for $264 million net of working capital adjustments alongside a non-controlling owner, who sold it's 9.9% interest. we used the proceeds of the sale for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of corporate debt and further bolster our available liquidity.
that concludes our remarks for today. if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact our investor relations team at enquiries@brookfieldrenewable.com. thank you for joining us today.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the terraform power operating, llc fourth quarter and full year 2020 results webcast and conference call. as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
i would now like to turn the conference over to michael tebbutt, chief financial officer. you may begin.
michael tebbutt -- chief financial officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our 2020 fourth quarter and full year results conference call and webcast for terraform power operating, llc.
before we begin, i'd like to remind you that a copy of our 2020 audited consolidated financial statements is published on our website and can be found under the financials & sec filings page on our website at terraformpower.com.
note also that we may make forward-looking statements on this call. these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and our actual results may differ materially.
in addition, we will refer to non-gaap financial measures. for more information on a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures, please refer to our 2020 audited consolidated financial statements.
our business performed well in 2020, supported by strong asset availability and contributions from recent acquisitions. we advanced our key strategic priorities, including the post-merger integration with brookfield renewable, and our new york state wind repowering projects, while continuing to maintain a robust balance sheet.
from a financial perspective, terraform power delivered adjusted ebitda of $847 million in 2020 compared to $730 million in the prior year, which represents a 16% increase.
performance in the year was positively impacted by contributions from our acquisitions of utility-scale solar assets in spain and from a full year of operations from the distributed generation solar assets we had acquired in the united states in late 2019.
during 2020, we committed to a plan to repower two wind power plants in new york with a combined nameplate capacity of 160 megawatts by replacing certain components of the wind turbines with new equipment, while preserving the existing towers foundation and balance of plant. the repowering activities represent opportunities to increase efficiency and extend useful lives of the existing renewable energy facilities.
we are pleased to have completed all material projects and financing agreements for the repowering projects, inclusive of signing a 20-year service agreement with ge and a 12-year power purchase agreement with verizon.
turning to our debt and liquidity. in the year, we completed $1.5 billion in non-recourse project level financings across our portfolios in the u.s. and europe on attractive terms side using investment grade metrics at an average interest rate of approximately 2.5% with a weighted average term duration of 18 years.
overall, our financial position remains healthy; and at the end of 2020, we had over $780 million of corporate liquidity available to fund our capital requirements. overall, 93% of our total debt is fixed, as fixed rate or swapped debt, and we continue to have a very manageable corporate debt stack with no near-term maturities.
in the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed the sale of a 40% interest in an 852-megawatt portfolio of four wind projects located in the united states for nearly $265 million. we used the proceeds of the sale for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of corporate revolver, which was drawn to fund growth and to further bolster our available liquidity.
we would like to also give an update on the recent weather events that occurred in texas in february. we have limited exposure to texas through two wind power facilities totaling 300 megawatt of proportionate capacity net of minority partners' interest.
during the storm, our operations team was able to keep one of our two texas facilities running throughout the period. furthermore, our power marketing capabilities were instrumental in mitigating any impact to our business as our energy marketing teams were able to cover sure positions by acquiring energy well below the $9,000 per megawatt hour price cap.
overall, the financial impact to our business was slightly positive and the assets have been up and running normally since february 20th, following the storm event.
that concludes our remarks for today. if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our investor relations team at enquiries@brookfieldrenewable.com. thank you for joining us today.

operator
good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the terraform power operating llc first quarter 2021 results webcast and conference call. as a reminder, this conference is to being recorded.
i would now like to turn the call over to michael tebbutt, chief financial officer. you may begin.
michael tebbutt -- chief financial officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our 2021 first quarter results conference call and webcast for terraform power operating, llc. before we begin, i'd like to remind you that a copy of the q1 financial statements is published on our website and can be found under the financials and filings page at terraformpower.com.
note, also that we may make forward-looking statements on this call. these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and our actual results may differ materially. in addition, we refer to non-gaap financial measures. for more information on a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures, please refer to our q1 financial statements.
our business performed well in the first quarter of 2021, supported by strong asset availability and a healthy balance sheet. from a financial perspective, terraform power had adjusted ebitda of over $184 million in the first quarter of 2021, which was in line with the prior year as we continue to generate stable revenues and benefit from the diversification of our fleet and highly contracted cash flows with long duration power purchase agreements.
there was a severe winter weather in the quarter, in particular in texas. the conditions did not have a material impact on our financial results due to our operating and power marketing capabilities, which reacted to mitigate risk. we are proud of how our teams performed during these difficult times keeping our employees safe and our operations running.
we continue to progress at two wind repowering projects in the state of new york, with the nameplate capacity of 160 megawatts with construction financing and tax equity secured for both projects. construction teams are on-site finalizing civil works, and we are on track to commence repowering all turbines in the second quarter and remain on track to reach completion of the project by the end of 2021 on scope and budget.
turning to our debt and liquidity. our financial position remains healthy at the end of the first quarter. we had approximately $643 million of corporate liquidity available to fund our capital requirements. overall, 91% of our total debt is fixed or swapped debt, and we continue to have a very manageable corporate debt stack with no near-term maturities.
driven by a favorable regulatory outcome in spain for our csp assets, execution of a number of operational priorities, the low interest rate environment and strong bank demand for financing renewable power assets, we see a meaningful opportunity to further optimize leverage across our business.
looking ahead, we will continue to execute our key operational priorities, including maintaining a robust balance sheet, optimizing project level financings and surfacing value through enhanced cash flows from our existing portfolio.
that concludes our remarks for today. if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact our investor relations team at enquiries@brookfieldrenewable.com. thank you for joining us today.

good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the terraform power operating llc 2021 second quarter results webcast and conference call. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. i would now like to turn the conference over to your host, mr. michael tebbutt, cfo. please go ahead.
michael tebbutt -- chief financial officer
thank you, operator. good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our 2021 second quarter results conference call and webcast for terraform power operating llc. before we begin, i'd like to remind you that a copy of our q2 financial statements is published on our website and can be found under the financials and filings page ar terraformpower.com.
note also that we may make forward-looking statements on this call. these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and our actual results may differ materially. in addition, we refer to non-gaap financial measures. for more information on a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures, please refer to our q2 financial statements.
our 4,200 megawatt renewable portfolio performed well in the quarter. in addition, we continued to execute on a number of initiatives that are meant to strengthen the credit profile of the business by derisking operations, executing on margin enhancement initiatives, completing accretive growth opportunities, and sourcing low cost of capital for capital recycling and asset level up financing initiatives.
from a financial perspective, terraform power had adjusted ebitda of $227 million in the second quarter of 2021. which was 1.4% higher than in the second quarter of the prior year. we had high ebitda contribution from our wind segment and our regulated solar and wind segment included in part from higher average realized market prices in spain, which continue to be well above prior year, partially offset by lower availability in our u.s. solar.
overall, we continue to generate stable revenues from our wind and solar assets and benefit from the scale of our fleet, diversification of our customer base, and highly contracted cash flows with long duration power purchase agreements with average remaining term of 14 years.
we recently executed a new 10-year operations and maintenance contract to service the distributed generation fleet we acquired from altagas in 2019. the new agreement consolidated the portfolio's operations and maintenance service under one agreement and streamlines asset management. we expect to complete the transition in the third quarter and provide $1 million of cost savings on an annual run rate basis.
in the second quarter, we continue to advance the repowering of all turbines at our two new york wind projects with a nameplate capacity of 160 megawatts. construction is progressing well and we remain on track and on budget to reach completion of the project by the end of 2021. once completed, annual generation will increase by 100 gigawatt hours, which will generate an additional $7 million of adjusted ebitda.
recently, our parent company brookfield announced an agreement with trane technologies to jointly pursue and offer decarbonization-as-a-service for commercial, industrial, and public sector customers comprising energy efficient retrofits and upgrades of building energy infrastructure along with captive distributed solar, energy storage, and other power generation across north america.
over time, we expect this will provide some growth opportunity to terraform by leveraging our u.s. distributed generation business and trane's leading energy efficiency and technical engineering, construction, and project development experience to jointly develop and implement new customer opportunities. these decarbonization solutions will help customers meet sustainability targets while reducing operating costs through upgrading critical energy infrastructure and installing onsite renewable energy.
turning to our debt and liquidity, our financial position remains healthy and our current available liquidity stands at $670 million of corporate liquidity to fund our capital requirements. overall, 93% of our debt is fixed rate or swap debt and we continue to have a very manageable corporate debt stack with no near-term maturities.
we continue to take advantage of the strong market conditions for financing renewable power assets at low interest rate environment to execute on refinancings and upfinancings across the portfolio. in june, we closed $160 million non-recourse refinancing of four [phonetic] utility scale solar assets in ontario, canada totaling 60 megawatts generating net proceeds of $27 million. the benefits of this transaction include reduced cost of debt and a 14-year extension of the maturity date.
post quarter-end in spain, we closed two strategic refinancings at extresol 3 and surazello [phonetic] concentrated solar power assets comprising of 100 megawatts. the benefits of these refinancings include reduced cost of debt, extending the maturities by up to six years, eliminating refinancing risk and generating net proceeds of $260 million, which were used to pay down almost the entire balance drawn on our corporate revolver.
in addition, we recently closed on a new letter of credit facility for $50 million guaranteed by export development canada, which will free up additional capacity on our corporate revolver facility. as we look forward, we will continue to focus on key operational priorities including executing on our repowering projects, margin enhancement initiatives, and strengthening the credit profile of the business.
that concludes our remarks for today. if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact our investor relations team at inquiries@brookfieldrenewable.com. thank you for joining us today.

2021-Q3,TERP,2021-11-23 08:30:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the terraform power operating, llc third quarter 2021 results webcast and conference call. [operator instructions]
i'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, michael tebbutt, chief financial officer. please go ahead.
michael tebbutt -- chief financial officer
thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 results conference call and webcast for terraform power operating, llc. before we begin, i'd like to remind you that a copy of our third quarter financial statements is published on our website and can be found under the financials and filings page at terraformpower.com.
note also that we may make forward-looking statements on this call. these forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and our actual results may differ materially. in addition, we will refer to non-gaap financial measures. for more information on a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to comparable gaap measures, please refer to our third quarter financial statements.
overall, we continue to see a drastic transformation in the power and utility sector, as decarbonization becomes a global mandate among the largest carbon emitting governments and industries who are adopting ambitious climate plan and sustainability targets. our business is well positioned as a leader in renewables through its scale and through brookfield's ecosystem to benefit from this momentum.
during the quarter, we advanced a number of initiatives that strengthen the credit profile of the business by derisking operations, executing on margin enhancement initiatives, completing accretive growth opportunities and asset level up financing initiatives. in terms of growth initiatives, at our u.s. wind business, we continued to make excellent progress on our 160 megawatt wind repowering project in new york, which continues to be on schedule and on budget with 90% of the turbines replaced and running. the remaining turbines are expected to be replaced by the end of the year.
overall, the project is expected to deliver improved facility performance, revenue enhancement and derisking of cash flows, resulting in increased annual adjusted ebitda of approximately $7 million. this will be accomplished through major component modernization that will enhance asset availability and reduced downtime, as well as from an increased rotor diameter that is expected to improve generation by 25% to 35% or approximately 100 gigawatt hours annually. the project will also benefit from its recent [indecipherable] tier 1 status qualification that enables the project to generate incremental revenues from renewable energy credits that have priced approximately 10 times higher than unqualified new york renewable energy credits. this regulatory qualification initiative may also provide additional upside through higher renewable energy certificate prices in the future as corporate and industrial counterparties continue to advance their decarbonization goals and net zero mandates.
the repowering initiatives will also have to derisk our cash flows. the current long-term service agreement underpinning the facilities will be replaced with a 20-year full wrapped long-term service agreement with production guarantees. this will help to stabilize operation, and is expected to reduce forecasted expenses by more than 50% by 2025.
on the back of the success of this project, we will continue to evaluate other wind repowering opportunities across the portfolio. across our north american businesses, we can continue to review opportunities to enhance the value of our assets and deploy capital, including assessing solar and wind repowerings and other opportunities to buyout tax equity investors where it is economical. these opportunities could potentially increase distributable earnings for the business and deliver incremental cash flows available for debt service.
from an operations perspective, in the third quarter, we completed the transition to a new 10-year operations and maintenance provider for our 318 megawatt distributed generation fleet we had acquired from altagas, which will provide approximately $1 million of cost savings on an annual run rate basis. from a financial results perspective, terraform power had adjusted ebitda of $226 million in the third quarter of 2021.
overall, we continue to see -- generate stable revenues from our wind and solar business -- solar assets and benefit from the scale of our fleet, diversification of our customer base and highly contracted cash flows with long duration power purchase agreements with average remaining term of 13 years. during the quarter, our wind and solar segments generated a combined $139 million of adjusted ebitda, compared to $144 million in the prior year. the business benefited from favorable pricing at our texas wind assets. however, this was offset by lower solar generation compared to the prior year, due to lower results and unfavorable asset availability.
adjusted ebitda in our regulated solar and wind segment was $91 million compared to $96 million in the prior year. in spite of higher electricity market prices compared to the prior year, adjusted ebitda decreased by 6% as a result of the spanish regulatory compensation mechanism. under this mechanism, regulated revenues are subject to a negative non-cash accounting adjustment when actual market prices exceed the pre-defined threshold price that has been established.
from a cash flow perspective, the business continues to capture pricing at elevated market levels. on a 2021 year-to-date basis, this translated to incremental remediable cash flows of approximately $70 million compared to 2020 and is poised to continue to benefit from these pricing levels into 2022.
turning to our debt and liquidity. our financial position remains robust and our corporate liquidity stands at over $600 million to fund our capital requirements. when factoring in project level restricted and unrestricted cash and portfolio level undrawn credit facilities, available capital is almost $900 million. overall, 91% of our total debt is fixed rate debt or hedged, and we continue to have a very manageable corporate debt stack with no near-term maturities.
in the third quarter, we closed on a new letter of credit facility for $50 million guaranteed by export development canada, which will free up additional capacity on our corporate revolver facility. during the quarter, we also continued to take advantage of low interest rates and executed on asset level financing initiatives across the business.
as we reported in our august update, in spain, we closed two strategic refinancings at two concentrated solar power assets comprising of 100 megawatts of nameplate capacity for approximately $590 million or net upfinancing proceeds of $260 million. this initiative reduced our cost of debt and bolstered our liquidity position by extending the project level maturities by up to six years. recently, we also closed a refinancing at a 78 megawatt canadian wind facility in ontario, generating net proceeds of $20 million and reducing our cost of borrowings.
with the regulatory environment and strong pricing outlook in spain, coupled with the low interest rate environment and bank demand for financing renewable power assets, we expect there is opportunity to further optimize financings at a number of our csp assets. we also expect to take advantage of similar market conditions for refinancing or upfinancings across our portfolio.
as we look forward, we will continue to focus on our key operating priorities, including executing on repowering projects, margin enhancement initiatives and strengthening the credit profile of the business.
that concludes our remarks for today. if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact our investor relations team at inquiries@brookfieldrenewable.com. thank you for joining us today.
