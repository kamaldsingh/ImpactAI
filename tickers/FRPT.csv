[operator instructions] our first question is from bryan spillane with bank of america merrill lynch. please proceed with your question.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey. thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. so just, i guess, a high-level question, billy, that we've gotten a few times kind of really since icr. just stepping back, now that you've raised the long-term projection, how much of this sort of acceleration would you attribute to covid? meaning has covid sort of pulled forward some sales? and i guess how do you have confidence that it's not just kind of a pull-forward versus an acceleration and expansion of the trends you were expecting a year ago?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
yeah. it's a good question, bryan. 2020 was a mix of some, obviously, some helps and some hurts. the things that i would put in the helps would be, obviously, people spending a lot more time with their dog and caring for, paying attention to, the various needs of their dog.
we had some lower-cost media. but we had some significant hurts that occurred in the year that, i think, tamped that down and probably fully offset it. so the capacity limits that we had in the year were significant. the retail disruption, the inability to get purchased in earlier in the year rather than later, having to push back our advertising.
and so we had to net it all out. and when we netted it all out, our conclusion was that 2020 might have been a pull-forward not just in the year, but of an underlying trend that was very, very strong. and it's going to continue for a long time. we think like many people have described 2020, it didn't create new trends.
it took the trends that already existed and just made them happen faster. but when we saw that, we realized that the upside was even bigger for us. and you'll see in the presentation in the investor deck that we put out, we did the modeling several different ways to confirm for us that this wasn't just a temporary phenomenon. there really was a long-term underlying trend here, and that's what got us ahead of where we thought we'd be.
so that's why we're raising the guidance.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. great. and then just maybe just one follow-up, quick one. the $430 million or better of revenue for this year, and maybe i missed this in the presentation, so do you have the capacity in place today to deliver that? or is that dependent on more production capacity coming online during the year?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
all the equipment to deliver that is installed. it's the staffing, and we have a chart in the investor deck that maps out by quarter the staffing additions that we are making that enable us to deliver that. so you'll see quarter by quarter what the capabilities are. so we had a good start to this year.
you'll see we produced very, very well in january. if we get rid of the darn snowstorms that keep slowing things down, we are doing incredibly well. but we have a step-up in capacity from a staffing perspective that happens in march. we have another one that happens in the second quarter.
so as you go along throughout the year, there are staffing additions, but the equipment is all there that will get us to where we need to be. there is equipment coming online, to be very fair. there is another line coming on at kitchens south in the second half of the year. but that's really designed to cover our very high run rate in the second half -- in the fourth quarter of the year.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
terrific. thank you.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, bryan.

and our next question is from peter benedict with baird. please proceed with your question.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hi, guys. thanks. i'll ask two just right out of the gate here. so the first one, just billy, you had mentioned the $50 customer acquisition cost that -- and then i guess the longer-term plan assumes you hold that.
just talk maybe a little bit about the puts and takes to that number, what you see that could either bring that down over time, or just how you think about that. and then the second would be around the pet specialty channel, the resurgence that you're kind of talking about there. i think, heather, you mentioned smart moves by some of your partners. just curious what you think is going on there and why the pet specialty space might be -- channel might be relevant again, i guess, for lack of a better term.
thanks.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
let me make one comment on the customer acquisition cost, and i'll let scott give you more color on that, as well as on the pet specialty channel. the $50 was a sort of a long-term trend. we've operated at a level well below that. so it's almost going back to bryan's comment just a -- question a minute ago, the customer acquisition cost in 2020 was significantly lower than that.
and our modeling going forward does not assume that. it only shows that if you stayed at $50, which is a number that we've delivered in the past, that we'd still greatly exceed our goal. so it's part of the long-term trend. but scott can give you more commentary on what causes that to get better or worse and also talk about pet specialty.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
peter, yes. so as billy mentioned, we've seen a pretty wide range on our acquisition cost. this year, we continued to pull back, and it was kind of one of those exceptional years, where the media well exceeded what we anticipated. the biggest factors that we see over time kind of plusing and minusing our consumer acquisition costs really center around how much innovation and how much fridge visibility do we have out there.
so when we have good innovation that's really appealing to consumers and we also have fridges that are either highly visible incremental distribution, and they become kind of multipliers or force multipliers in a way and actually drive our consumer acquisition costs significantly down. what we have budgeted over time is to -- we had been budgeting, seeing acquisition costs actually going up. and we've seen it for multiple years now actually decreasing. and we think some of that is the -- this idea of as we get bigger and we have more visibility, people are more familiar with the idea of freshpet food, it's actually become easier for us to acquire consumers.
also, they're very -- people are thinking differently about nutrition, and it's really translating into the pet universe now. so that's a big factor on what happens with our acquisition costs. from a pet specialty standpoint, both the major big-box pet guys have really made nice progress in general on their overall business, and they had kind of weighed in with us. they put our fridges in higher-profile locations, added second fridges and even third fridges in certain locations.
and we've also had some nice innovation there. so i think it's just a compounding effect of some consumer trends in covid. i think they've done a nice job with their businesses, and we've had nice placement and kind of incremental fridges being added in those channels.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
ok, great. thank you very much.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, peter.
operator
our next question is from bill chappell with truist securities. please proceed with your question.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. just on understanding kind of the postponement of second fridge doors and doors, in general, this year. so i'm just trying to understand, is that because you're taking a step back and rethinking kind of the whole capacity expansion, and so there's a little bit of a pause and it just changes the cadence? is it near-term issues with snow and something like that? i'm just trying to understand, does that imply that there's slower growth until they're up and running? just trying to understand the decision behind that.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
so from a decision perspective, the decision is just we have to be able to supply the fridges that are out there. and customers, as you might imagine, have been seeing us short shipping for quite some time. and so it's not prudent for us to be putting incremental fridges in stores if they can't be stocked. the long-term interest in second and third fridges is incredibly high, and the gains that we're getting from them are incredibly strong.
so the demand for them is very, very strong. we have no doubt that there will be significant interest in it. we just need to make sure that when we put them out there, that they can be well-stocked. and frankly, our customers have the same concern, too.
they don't want us to put in something that they can't reallocate the space in the fridge to something else when we can't supply. so we need to get the supply up. but by the end of april, we should be in pretty good shape on our shipments. and at that point, you can start seeing people doing more normalized activity, but they're going to want to be comfortable that it's working.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
billy? yes, let me build on that real quickly. so just when we put in second fridges, just to be clear on it, we're seeing -- so if we're already growing at, call it, 30%, we pick up anywhere between 20 and 40 incremental growth points on that second fridge. so the return continues to be strong, both for us and the retailer. it's also continuing into the second year.
so we're seeing really good progress there. one of the things that we become not only us slowing down a little bit on some second fridges earlier in the year, but there are several retailers that are pushing some of their major changes toward the back of the year or not doing as much in-store this year due to kind of the entire -- what's going on in the marketplace. and that could change. we actually got some very positive surprises late in the back of last year, but we do not want to kind of weigh into that.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and i guess on that same note as a follow-up, i think 30% growth in 2020 is great. obviously, very impressive. any gauge now looking back for the full year of how much was left on the table in terms of had you not had capacity constraints, what that growth could have been, especially as we're looking to 2021, should be at full capacity for most of the year? that 35% growth doesn't seem that aggressive if you left 5, 6 points on the table last year.
so any color around that would be great. thanks.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
yeah. it's always hard, bill, to decide how much you really lost. i'd say what we quoted was at the end of the year, the trade inventories were down by $15 million versus where we thought they'd be, and against the base of sales that's somewhere around 3 or 4 points. so you could say pretty confident there would have been 3 or 4 points more for that.
now, how much you lost because a consumer walked in the store couldn't find it, and they had to buy something else or a new consumer who came to your fridge based on having seen your ads and showed up and there's nothing in the fridge or not the item they wanted, we really didn't do any modeling to figure out what that could be. but if you're telling us that having 35% growth is sandbagging or is a little bit conservative, i would tell you we're very mindful of the fact that we need to run. as heather said, walk before you run, run before you sprint. we want to kind of amp up the growth as we go along and make sure we can supply it.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes. one other factor on that, too, bill, is that the entire year, we kept canceling more and more and more media in addition to us not having enough product. so if we had spent the media plus all those factors in place, we're encouraged that we could be seeing some pretty significant growth rates.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. thanks so much.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, bill.
operator
and our next question is from brian holland with d.a. davidson. please proceed with your question.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
yeah, thanks. good evening. do we continue to assume media will be 12% of sales through 2025? and just if i could throw on top of that, given the increased flexibility by added capacity, could that go higher?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
as we've always said, when we have capacity, we want to fill it. the plan that we've laid out gives us the ability to always be -- once we get this next incremental capacity in, to be a line or so ahead of where the demand is, so we don't get ourselves caught where we are short on supply. but we do plan to spend at 12% of sales between now and 2025. so the real question will be, does it overdeliver the returns because it over-delivers the returns that would then have us using more of the capacity.
and that's why we're building the incremental capacity to stay ahead of it, so we don't have that supply problem.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
ok. fair enough. and then you've got a lordly share of this segment of the pet food category, and one that has to be increasingly difficult for the larger players to ignore. so as you guide out to 2025 and make plans for that capacity accordingly, to what extent have you factored in the evolution of the competitive landscape?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
you know, obviously, it's a factor. i've seen lots of studies done on what happens when a category creator ends up with a challenger. obviously, the lot depends on who the challenger is and what the approach is that they take. do they come in with a knockoff product at the same price? do they come in with a more premium product? do they come in with a price-driven product? but typically, what happens is when a second player enters the market, it significantly expands the rate of growth and the size of the market.
and so while your share of the market might go down, the size of the opportunity that you have is actually quite large. and so while we fully anticipate, at some point, we will have a competitor, it's only natural and what we should expect. our expectation is it will make the category more competitive, not necessarily our business opportunity smaller.
brian holland -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
appreciate the color. thanks.
operator
and our next question is from mark astrachan with stifel. please proceed with your question.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. i wanted to ask maybe a different way on the new store adds. so i guess i was a little surprised that you're talking only 1,000 stores or so. and i wanted to ask kind of specifically about how the discussions are going with some of those retailers like walmart or kroger or costco, where you're understored relative to where you could be and where you are in places like target.
so how has the out-of-stock situation manifested itself with some of those? how do you think about the out of stocks just broadly? obviously, some of your retailers have also put stickers on doors to say, hey, there are alternative products elsewhere. maybe just enlighten us a bit on some of those discussions with the legacy retailers. and if i could just add a sort of related point to that, what are your expectations in bed for nontraditional retail, meaning like chewy or amazon within the base?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
scott, do you want to take that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. so, mark, no one likes to be in a situation where -- that we can't supply as much as not only consumers but also our customers' want. it obviously frustrates the customers, but i think if they're looking across the entire store, especially episodically over the past year, it's been incredibly challenging times. and i think that people have been fairly understanding.
most of them have been very, very understanding and really, really good partners. and i think some of that comes from the equity that we've built in working with them and being as transparent as possible for the past 10, 15, and even 20 years in some cases of people that we worked with throughout our careers. but look, i think the other thing is people really, really appreciate and love the growth. they love the margins that we're continuing to deliver to the category.
but i do think they have expectations of us making sure that we're getting them back in a better in-stock position so they can deliver to their consumers, our consumers, and their consumers quickly. we kind of laid out plans. we've had many, many meetings, many, many top-to-tops with them, kind of walking through exactly what we're doing. they, again, are really cheering for us because they love the proposition and how we've built this business and what our long-term vision is and where we can grow, and where we can go over time.
and i really think, overall, they're behind us. i think that there's some near-term pain, and everyone is sharing that. but they recognize it is a quarter's worth of pain. it's not a year's worth of pain.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's helpful. and then just on the non-retailers, the internet e-commerce piece, how are you thinking about that and some guidance?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes. sure. and i think there's actually a page in the deck that talks about e-comm. it's actually page 12, i believe.
yes, page 12. and although we've had a lot of success with what we've done from an e-comm perspective, we understand really, really well how to invest, how to grow, what the productivity is versus our traditional advertising. we're actually getting better returns on the e-comm advertising than the traditional advertising that encourages us to spend more in that area. so we will be spending more, and we will have significant incremental partners that we'll be adding from an e-commerce standpoint over this next year.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and our next question is from jon andersen with william blair. please proceed with your question.
jon andersen -- william blair & company -- analyst
couple of quick ones. one, just related to the out-of-stock situation, how do you think -- what has been the feedback from your customers? billy, you talked about empty fridges. do you think there are longer-term ramifications from that? have you seen users maybe kind of fall out of the franchise that will be hard to bring back? so just some thoughts on that based on the interactions you've had with customers. and then the second question is just around your kind of view of the new product lineup for 2021, characterizing it maybe relative to some of the innovation that you've done over the past couple of years? thanks.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
yes, i'll let scott take those.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. let me talk about the innovation piece first. so it's interesting because a lot of people would say, oh, you're growing at 20%, 25%, 30%, 40% growth. why are you bothering to innovate? well, as billy -- as someone brought up earlier, we believe that at some point, people will want to be coming into this category, and we want to have the absolute best product than anyone could possibly imagine and be basically cutting the territory, cutting kind of the head of the swathe through the jungle and coming up with the absolute best products out there.
now, that being said, innovation is not just something that's kind of like a fun side project. we've been able to demonstrate year after year that the innovation typically sticks very well. the vast majority of innovation, over 80% of our innovation sticks around multiple, multiple years out. it's a significant contributor to not only improving our advertising but also our overall sales growth and the size of our business over time.
so we do believe innovation is a core of it. and then we have kind of a -- we want to improve our current products. we want to innovate, meaning coming out with like varieties and flavors and maybe some incremental benefits on some of our existing -- with some of our existing technology, but we're also working to truly reinvent and come out with like next-level category changing technology like you'll see there's new plant-based meals we're coming out with. some of it's positioning work that we're doing where we'll have the most sustainable pet food that's out there in our nature's fresh brand and some of the things we're doing in our homestyle brand.
so innovation is really critical and core, and it delivers. on the out-of-stock piece, it's interesting. it's unfortunate but interesting. over the past 10 years, there have been times where we have had challenges on our business.
and sometimes, it's been challenges on making rolls or challenges on making bags or packaging supplier, whatever it may be. and the one thing that we have seen is the consumers in this business has been unbelievably resilient. do i wish we wouldn't be having out of stocks? 100%. literally, like there is no way to tell you how much my heart bleeds every time i see a consumer frustrated.
but if you look through those consumer comments, and i've looked through thousands, literally thousands of the consumer comments on the notes that i posted, the vast majority of them are cheering for us, waiting for us to come back in stock, looking for us. we're doing everything we can to help them and make it easier for them and get products out there as fast as we possibly can with no expense spared. so is it going to be a blip? yes, i'm sure it's going to be a blip, and it's unfortunate. but i do think, over time, we have the, by far, the best proposition of anything in pet food.
consumers will come back to our franchise, and we'll continue to just move forward on our growth trajectory.
jon andersen -- william blair & company -- analyst
thank you. good luck.
operator
our next question is from ken goldman with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question. ken goldman, your line is on mute.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
can you hear me now?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
yeah. yeah. yeah, we can.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. yeah.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
we can hear you now.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
long story, not mute, though. so you're almost two-thirds of the way through the first quarter. the street's modeling a little over $90 million in sales and about $10 million in ebitda. how close are those to kind of what your expectations are for the quarter? if you can give us a little bit of a ballpark there?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
so obviously, we don't like giving out quarterly guidance, but what we said in the narrative is that as you think about the cadence for the year, q1 should be a strong quarter because even though we're delaying the advertising start-up, we are refilling the trade inventory hole. so you can expect it to be a stronger quarter. q2 is up against a very tough year ago because that's when we were refilling the trade inventory. and we have a delayed start in the advertising this year, so it will be delayed in building consumption.
so it will be our softest quarter. and then q3 and 4 will be very, very strong because of the advertising investment that we're making starting in q2 but really paying dividends in 3 and 4. so without giving quarterly guidance, i can just tell you that we're expecting, at least from the top-line perspective, to be off to a good start. in terms of the bottom line, there is a little bit of a delay in the advertising investment, but there's also a higher cost that we're going to be carrying because we brought in incremental staffing to make sure that we could produce what we needed to produce.
we don't want to find ourselves in a position where because of people being out for testing or quarantine or issues that we're having out with snowstorms that we can't meet the demand. so we do have extra staffing that we're carrying.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's a little long, so i'll let it go. thank you.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
all right.

and we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. and i will now turn the call over to ceo, billy cyr, for closing remarks.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, everyone. sorry, we had to cut you short today. unfortunately, as you can imagine, with all the things we have going on, it has been a very hectic day. but i did want to close with one thought for you.
lou saban, the football coach, said, no matter how little money and how few possessions you own, having a dog makes you rich, to which i would add, feed your dog freshpet, and we can call it even. thank you very much for your interest and attention. we appreciate it.

bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. i'm speaking with you from bethlehem, pennsylvania, the home of the freshpet kitchens; and scott and heather are in our offices in secaucus, new jersey. we will do our best to not trip over each other on the call. and as always, please excuse any barking in the background and any other technical issues we might encounter.
it is hard to believe that one year ago, we gathered with many of you at nasdaq in new york city to outline our five-year strategic plan, and what a year it was. i'm so proud of our team's resilience through these trying times. fortunately, freshpet was able to navigate the shifting environment while still making significant progress against our long-term strategic goals. in fact, the last year, despite its numerous challenges, has seen an acceleration of our business progress toward our 2025 goals.
as such, we are going to update those long-term goals to both reflect the fast start we had in 2020 and also to include the impact of some of our most recent learnings. but first, i want to go back to where i started our investor day presentation one year ago. in that presentation, i asserted that freshpet had the potential to join the pantheon of iconic brands that change the world, brands that change things we do every day and reflected significant changes in society's values and priorities, brands that leverage technology to make the previously impossible possible or more broadly available, brands like nike, starbucks, gatorade, netflix, and apple. that may have seemed like a lofty ambition then, and to be clear, it remains a very lofty ambition today.
but freshpet is on that path and accelerating. freshpet is changing the way people feed their pets. that change reflects the fundamental shift in how society views both pets and food. our pets are no longer creatures who sleep in doghouses and backyards.
they are the favorite child who sleeps in our beds, and our food needs to be fresh and natural, not dehydrated and preserved. those fundamental changes in society's values and priorities are here to stay, and freshpet will lead the transition to fresh and natural food for our pets. like those other iconic brands that change the world, freshpet is growing quickly from our infancy through our juvenile and prepubescent years toward the teenage years and then to adulthood. in many ways, freshpet is like an 11-year-old boy who wears size 15 sneakers.
he is growing really fast, and everyone expects him to be big. but along with that explosive growth, there can be some awkwardness. our challenge is to do everything we can to achieve our enormous growth potential while insulating ourselves from some of the bumps along the way. in pursuit of that goal, i think it is worthwhile to highlight a few of the critical achievements we had last year that demonstrate both our capability and the foundation that we are building to achieve even greater goals.
number one, we accelerated our growth for the fourth consecutive year, posting 30% net sales growth for full-year 2020, and ended the year with 38% consumption growth in q4. number two, we increased our adjusted ebitda growth rate for the third consecutive year, growing adjusted ebitda by 61%. third, we increased household penetration by 24%, reaching almost 4 million users for the first time, and increased the buying rate by 7% at the same time. number four, despite the retail challenges presented by covid, we added 1,146 net new stores and, more importantly, installed double fridges in another 1,640 stores and upgraded 795 stores.
five, we doubled our installed production capacity and broke ground on a project that will result in a tripling of our capacity by the end of next year. those capacity additions included completing the construction and start-up of kitchens 2.0, adding more than 200 million in new capacity with significant increases in automation, and breaking ground on kitchens 3.0 in ennis, texas. we also opened kitchen south in conjunction with a long-term partner. and sixth, we increased our organization headcount from 450 to just under 600, including the hiring and onboarding of three important new leaders: heather, our cfo; thembi machaba, our svp of hr; and ricardo moreno, our new vp of manufacturing.
in each case, we were able to attract first-rate talent because of the power of the freshpet proposition and the opportunity to change the way people feed their pets. we got all this done while sheltering in place, working remotely, and devoting significant energy to protecting the safety of our team. i'm incredibly proud of the number of people who stepped up and played critical leadership roles for our company when the situation required it. they demonstrated the qualities that should give all of us confidence that we can overcome almost any obstacle and achieve great things.
like that rapidly growing teenager i mentioned earlier, there were some awkward moments, too. we struggled to keep up with demand and ended the year with nearly empty fridges in many stores. that means that we are spending the first quarter of 2021 digging out of a trade inventory hole we dug rather than putting our foot on the gas to grow faster. the good news is that we're making great progress against that.
since january 1, our manufacturing output has grown, and it is now averaging 26% more per day than during q4, and it is accelerating. other than the week of winter storm orlena, our production has outpaced consumption each week since january 1, enabling us to steadily refill the trade inventory hole. it will take until mid to late april to refill the deficit, but our capability is growing quickly. and we are confident we have built sustainable capabilities that can support the near-term and long-term goals we have set for ourselves.
to help manage consumer expectations around the empty fridges, scott, as the co-founder and coo, has been posting letters to our consumers on social media, explaining the reasons for the empty fridges and outlining our efforts to refill them. the support we have gotten from consumers has been largely positive not only for the efforts we are undertaking but also for the transparency with which we are updating them and also the value we have been placing on employee safety in the face of covid that has resulted in some of the out of stocks. he even told people that we are hiring or we're only hiring people who are willing to do work. they would be paid and treated well, including stock grants and the same benefits he has.
he provided them with a link to our hiring website. consumers loved it, particularly the part about how we treat our employees. consumers who have seen the social media posts are even more attracted to freshpet than ever before because they realize we share their values. and this experience also highlights how our team moves quickly and innovatively to solve our most pressing challenges.
the improvement in our supply position that began in january is due to exceptional work by our hr team at filling vacancies and recruiting incremental staffing to backfill behind employees who are out for testing or quarantine related to covid. as we previously discussed, you will see some of the cost of this added labor in our adjusted gross margin early in 2021. but we believe that it is necessary to provide our consumers and customers with the pet food they need. since we gave you a preview of our 2020 results earlier this year when we presented at the icr conference, i will leave it to heather to provide the final details on q4 and the year.
i will instead focus my comments on where we are going in 2021 and our longer-term goals. we've taken some time to analyze our 2020 results and all the consumer data we gathered during the year. in total, it presented a very encouraging picture of the long-term opportunity for freshpet. when we met one year ago, we shared our plan to convert 5 million more households to freshpet by the end of 2025, getting to 8 million households in total.
as ambitious as that sounded a year ago, we are well ahead of schedule. in fact, we're almost one year ahead of the pace we needed to deliver 8 million households. what's more, we did that despite pulling back on our advertising investment, spending only about 10% of sales instead of our target of 12% and significant out of stocks that made it hard for consumers to find our products at times. if we simply continue to grow household penetration at the rate we have for the past two years or 24%, for the next four years, we would exceed our 8 million household goal one year early and by a wide margin.
think about this in a different way. if we return to our pre-covid era customer acquisition cost of about $50 per consumer and invested in media at our traditional 11% to 12% of net sales rate, we believe we would also greatly exceed our 8 million household goal. this and other analyses prove to us that we could achieve a far higher share of the greater than 20 million household total addressable market or tam that we'd outlined and do it at a faster clip. further, while we have not rerun the study to determine if the tam has grown, we believe it is highly likely that the tam is larger today than it was when we ran the study more than a year ago.
the number of millennials and gen z who have entered the household formation stage of life and acquired a dog is growing quickly, and they are our best prospects for future freshpet users. we saw that powerful dynamic play out in 2020. we also shared some compelling buying rate cohort data at the january icr conference that demonstrated how our underlying buying rate grows over multiple years and ultimately reaches more than 4 times the year 1 purchase rate. that data was like the rosetta stone for us, unlocking and understanding of our long-term potential in the way that we had not been able to do before.
the combination of that household penetration growth and buying rate data convinced us that the market demand for freshpet over a foreseeable time frame was much bigger and could be realized much faster than our initial 2025 goals suggested. the only limiter to our ability to achieve that opportunity would be our ability to build capacity fast enough to satisfy demand. given that, we spent much of the year working on ways to accelerate our capacity expansion. we did the following.
first, we proved that we could construct and start-up kitchens 2.0 successfully, even under the severe limitations imposed by covid. second, kitchens 2.0 also proved that we could create and operate higher throughput lines with more automation that drive better margins. that demonstration of our technical capability is an important proof point for us, and the higher capacity of those lines is very encouraging. third, we started up operations with a long-term partner at kitchen south, initially installing one of our lines in a dedicated facility that they operate and ultimately expanding that to a 2-shift operation capable of producing about $50 million per year.
we have since expanded that relationship by committing to install a second line. by the end of 2021, we will have $100 million of capacity operating at that partner and have proven the strength and durability of that partnership and are ready to expand it further to enable more rapid capacity expansion. fourth, we broke ground on our biggest project yet, ennis phase 1. we built and trained an entirely new team capable of designing that facility in conjunction with our kitchens experts in bethlehem and some long-term engineering partners and are on track to open that facility next year, initially bringing on at least $400 million in capacity and the ability to add a second phase that could add at least $500 million more.
fifth, we installed and are operating a smaller scale line that supports meaningful product innovation such as home sale creation meals. and sixth, we significantly advanced some new manufacturing technology that has the potential to produce more freshpet in less space, potentially lowering our future capital costs and increasing the capacity in some of our existing facilities. to be clear, we are not ready to deploy that technology yet, but we are working to qualify it for ennis phase 2 and for a future project at kitchen south that i will discuss in a minute. even with all that capacity installed or under construction, we think we will need even more to satisfy the demand for freshpet.
we think the long-term opportunity for freshpet is well north of $2 billion and that we will achieve more than our original goal of $1 billion in 2025. so today, we are announcing that we are raising our long-term goal from $1 billion in net sales in 2025 to $1.25 billion in 2025 and simultaneously increasing our household penetration target from 8 million households to at least 11 million households by 2025. due to the rapid increase in new buyers we are anticipating, we are holding the anticipated buying rate at about $162 per household per year. we are also holding our adjusted ebitda margin target at 25%, planning on investing the incremental g&a savings from added scale and incremental capability for growth, including international staffing and more r&d, plus some modest margin dilution from having increased production through our partner at kitchen south.
our updated long-term plan would deliver a cagr through 2025 of 31% in net sales, 23% in household penetration, and 7% in buying rate, all in line with our 2020 actual performance, which we achieved with less marketing investment, significant out of stocks and broad-scale disruptions at retail. basically, what we are saying is that we think that we have the tools and capability to repeat the performance we had in 2020 for the next four years. to deliver that, we will need more capacity sooner. so we are taking the following actions to accomplish that.
first, accelerating existing projects. these include starting up our second line of kitchen south in q3 of this year rather than q4. and secondly, pulling forward the start-up of our ennis facility by one quarter, targeting to open in q2 of 2022 instead of q3. we are now paying for extended construction hours to complete the project early and have incented the contractor to get it done on time.
secondly, leveraging the capabilities of our partner to increase capacity faster. our partner has a deep engineering bench and has proven to be an effective partner over the past year, so we are developing plans to add the third line to kitchen south that will enable some new product innovation and add significant capacity. additionally, we've initiated discussions with them about adding another building with a capability to produce another $300 million of product and are targeting to have that ready by the beginning of 2023. third, we are also increasing our estimate of the production capacity of the ennis production lines to reflect the learnings we are getting in kitchens 2.0 and some further upsizing of the equipment.
both phases of the ennis project will include the technology we validated in kitchens 2.0 with some selective increases in the capacity of some pieces of equipment. in total, this will allow us to increase the anticipated capacity of the first three lines in ennis phase 1 from $300 million that we had previously outlined to $400 million, and the four lines in phase 2 from $400 million to $500 million. in total, we are building the capacity to deliver almost $2 billion in net sales by 2025, with some of it coming online sooner than previously planned to meet the accelerated near-term growth rate. to accomplish this goal, while being mindful of balance sheet leverage, we may seek to raise equity as part of our financing plans.
we filed a preliminary prospectus supplement today regarding a potential equity raise. the goal of this raise is to ensure that, along with our recent credit facility amendment, which increases our available debt to $350 million, our balance sheet does not become our limiter. we are mindful of the total amount of capacity we are planning. so our plan does not call for us committing to the second phase of ennis until early 2023.
that phase is planned to deliver $500 million of capacity at a cost of about $200 million. finally, let me turn my comments to 2021. in line with the long-term plan and the incremental manufacturing capacity we have available to us, our plan for 2021 calls for another increase in our growth rate going from 2020's 30% growth to 35% growth in 2021, which results in net sales guidance of greater than $430 million. the growth rate will be a bit backloaded due to the delay in our advertising investment in q1 and the time we need to rebuild trade inventories.
but once those are in place, we will be investing heavily to drive growth, with u.s. advertising returning to 12% of net sales for the year and includes slightly more of the u.s. media in the back half versus the first half. this cadence is unusual for us, but it is necessary with the trade inventory hole we are trying to fill first.
that spending pattern will also create significant momentum for the business at the end of the year, and that is in part why we are pulling the ennis project forward and adding a third line of kitchen south. that will ensure that we have adequate capacity as we enter 2022. we believe that many of our leading customers will be matching that growth and investment with incremental stores and second fridges, both later this year and early in 2022. however, both we and our customers will delay some new fridge installations until we can guarantee that we can supply them reliably.
thus, our near-term store additions will be reduced, but the longer-term store additions and upgrades will be very robust. in total, we expect to add greater than 1,000 net new stores, upgrade greater than 500 stores and add second or third fridges in greater than 550 stores this year and significantly more next year. we believe the incremental advertising investment and the modest overhang from new capacity will cause the adjusted ebitda margin to dip temporarily this year before resuming its upward trend in 2022. underpinning that margin acceleration are two primary drivers: continued improvement in g&a, which we believe will improve by approximately 220 basis points in 2021; and a resurgence in adjusted gross margin as we work through 2021.
we believe we will end the fourth quarter of 2021 at a rate higher than we achieved for full-year 2020. we have a solid portfolio of new products we are launching this year. we are adding a beef version to our wildly successful small dog product, launching our flagship fresh from the kitchen product in the u.k., and launching a test of a plant-based product in limited distribution in the united states. in total, i believe we have a compelling plan for 2021 and are very well positioned to continue accelerating the growth of freshpet.
our team has demonstrated incredible capability during some of the most challenging circumstances. we are inspired by our mission to change the way people nurse their pets, and greatly appreciate all the support we have gotten from consumers, customers, and shareholders while we manage our way through those challenging circumstances. equally important, we appreciate the support of our team, many of them whom worked long hours with short staffing or remotely to deliver for our consumers. in particular, i cannot say enough good things about the leaders within our team who took on the responsibility for keeping our teams safe.
they inspired confidence, demonstrated supreme professionalism, and navigated uncertain waters with the vision, determination, and flexibility needed to get us through the storm we all faced. all of us owe them a debt of gratitude. thank you. now, let me turn it over to heather to provide more detail on our 2020 results and our guidance for 2021.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
thank you, billy, and good afternoon, everyone. as we disclosed previously, net sales for q4 of 2020 were $84.5 million, up 29% versus year ago. actual nielsen mega channel consumption was up 38%, so we drew down trade inventory again in q4. our final results were also constrained by a large snowstorm in mid-december that cost us a few days of production and shipping with very few days left in the year to catch up.
as a result, we believe that trade inventories were $15 million below where we would expect them to be under normal circumstances at the end of the quarter. as billy indicated, we began refilling those in january and expect to have largely refilled the trade inventory by the end of april. one of the most exciting and encouraging aspects of our growth in q4 was the continued resurgence of the pet specialty channel. behind some smart moves by our team and our customers and some overall tailwinds for that channel, our nielsen big-box pet specialty consumption was up 43% in q4, leading all channels.
and it was still accelerating at the end of the quarter. in q1 of 2021 to date, it is up greater than 55% despite some significant out of stock. we are encouraged by that progress and bullish on their prospects for 2021. final net sales for 2020 were $318.8 million, up 30% versus year ago, our fourth consecutive year of accelerating growth.
this is a major accomplishment for our organization, and we intend to extend this momentum into 2021 by posting another increase in our growth rate. we think of this as walking before you run and running before you sprint. each year, we increase our capability to drive incremental demand and also build incremental supply. adjusted ebitda for q4 was $12.9 million, down 2% versus the year ago.
recall, we had fourth-quarter media this year for the first time, and that was one of the contributors to the flat adjusted ebitda. media investment in the quarter was approximately $5 million versus approximately $2 million in the year-ago quarter. the other major challenge was gross margin. due to significant losses in production caused by short staffing related to covid testing and quarantines and higher beef prices in the quarter, our adjusted gross margin was 45.8%, in line with expectations that we set at icr.
adjusted gross margin for the year came in at 48.3%, also in line with the expectations we set at icr. we will begin to see some of the benefits of the higher speed, more automated production of our kitchens 2.0 facility toward the end of 2021, as i will outline in a few minutes. we continued to deliver g&a improvements in the quarter, with 130 basis points of adjusted sg&a reductions after excluding media investments in the quarter. for the year, we delivered 220 basis points of improvement.
2020 also represents a broader accomplishment against our long-term plans. looking back at the introduction of our feed to growth plan in 2016, we committed to deliver 700 basis points of adjusted sg&a, excluding media, improvement by 2020. as our results show, we exceeded that, delivering 780 basis points over the four-year period. this execution demonstrates that our 2025 plan to deliver 1,000 basis points of sg&a savings, excluding media, is very achievable.
we know how to do it and have the discipline to execute against it. and there are still lots of room for leverage in our current cost structure. our final adjusted ebitda for 2020 was $46.9 million, up 61% versus year ago. this is in line with the guidance we provided in may and slightly ahead of the updated guidance we shared at icr.
our net cash flow from operations was $8.1 million in q4, and for the year, we produced $21.2 million. turning to the revised long-term goals. billy outlined the increase in the net sales goal to $1.25 billion in 2025 and the rationale for it, so i won't go into that here, other than to say that target is based on our assessment of the u.s.-based dog food opportunity. we remain very committed to developing and nurturing a meaningful cat food business and expanding our international footprint but have not assumed disproportionate growth in either area in our new goal.
in our 2025 plan, we are holding the adjusted ebitda margin target at the 25% we previously committed because we believe by the time we get there, we will be investing in a european organization and incremental r&d to support a broader business platform. we see significant growth opportunities in both areas and want the flexibility to invest organizational resources to deliver those opportunities. we also plan to increase capacity by leveraging the technical team and resources of our partner at kitchen south. we see this as a critical enabler of growth.
however, this will have a margin implication in the near term. the capex plan supporting our growth ambition is outlined in the investor deck we published today. the key projects it includes are, one, we are pulling forward the start-up of ennis, and that will cost an incremental $20 million. it will start one quarter earlier in q2 of 2022.
two, we are adding on-site chicken processing to the ennis project to improve both the quality and cost of our primary ingredient. we will build and own the building, but it will be equipped and operated by a third-party chicken processor, delivering fresh chicken to our facility without any extra transportation costs and within hours of processing. fresher chicken will deliver higher quality at lower cost for us. third, the kitchens self-expansion project will come in two phases.
in the first phase, we will enhance the plans we had for one additional line and build out that space to include a total of two additional lines. these lines will add net sales capacity of approximately $150 million. in the second phase, we are adding another $300 million of net sales capacity in a relationship similar to the relationship we have in the first phase, i.e., they build their own building, and we own the equipment. they will operate the building with a dedicated team.
we estimate that project to cost approximately $100 million and be ready to produce in 2023. taking this updated framework around capacity and the capital expenditures that will support it, i want to impress upon you that we are focused on driving positive free cash flow over the long term. our business has been generating positive operating cash flow for the last several years as we've achieved scale in the business. importantly, we are also on the cusp of generating free cash flow, excluding the incremental capacity investments we've laid out today.
however, given the amazing growth opportunity that we are presented with, we will be more heavily investing in the next two years. and as a result, we expect our free cash flow generation will be temporarily constrained until we reach 2023. at that point, we see free cash flow becoming positive and then building from there as we move out toward our 2025 milestone of reaching 11 million households. turning to our guidance for 2021.
we plan to accelerate our growth again this year. with significant amounts of new capacity now online, we intend to increase our advertising investment to a more normalized approximately 12% of net sales, up from approximately 10% in 2020 to drive accelerated growth. we expect to deliver more than $430 million in net sales in 2021, up 35% versus year ago. the growth will be strongest in quarters 1, 3, and 4 as we refill the trade inventory hole in q1, and we get the full benefit of the added capacity and incremental marketing investment in the back half of the year.
q2 is up against some strong comps where we refilled the trade inventory hole last year, and our delayed start to marketing this year will push more of the growth to the back half of the year. we will continue to make investments in our international business to support the momentum we have generated there behind the advertising we invested in last year. those businesses, canada and the u.k., are now growing very quickly but off a very small base. that growth has stimulated strong interest from our customers in expanding the distribution of freshpet to more stores, exactly what we had hoped to accomplish.
as we have said many times, it is a multi-year cycle of investing in advertising to drive velocity that results in incremental distribution and enables us to invest more in advertising. the result is a very solid foundation of support with customers and loyal consumers and a rapidly growing consumer franchise and retail footprint. that is our model, and it is working. we expect adjusted gross margin to be flat on a full-year basis versus 2020, starting lower due to the added staffing costs and improving throughout the year as we gain volumes to absorb those costs.
we are expecting modest increases in commodities, largely beef, early in the year, and generally flat costs overall. our chicken price has been locked for the year, and it is flat versus a year ago. we expect continued improvement in sg&a, excluding media, delivering another greater than 200 basis points on our path to our target of 1,000 basis points by 2025. as part of our operational improvement plan and to support the scale of the business, we will be doing an erp upgrade currently targeted for october 1, 2021.
we do expect some freight inflation this year, and that is included in our guidance. we are forecasting adjusted ebitda for the year to be greater than $61 million, with the adjusted ebitda margin dipping a bit this year due to the increased investment in advertising to drive a higher growth rate and the freight inflation. also, in 2021, we expect to produce continued positive net cash from operations. in summary, our guidance for 2021 is for net sales greater than $430 million, up 35% versus year ago, and adjusted ebitda greater than $61 million, up 30% versus year ago.
while our liquidity is strong, we have amended and expanded our credit agreement to include a delayed draw term loan of up to $300 million and a $50 million revolver. as discussed, we will also explore one or more equity raises depending on market conditions and other factors so that we can fund our accelerated growth plan and not stress the balance sheet. we have heard from many of our largest and longest-tenured shareholders that they believe the long-term opportunity for freshpet is too big to allow any potential short-term issues to create risk. so they prefer we maintain low leverage.
our plan does that with a target of approximately 2 times leverage and not more than 3.5 times. we believe we are very well-insulated from the occasional market risk or hiccups along the way and are well-positioned to pursue the freshpet opportunity to its fullest. in 2021, we anticipate spending approximately $380 million in capital. in closing, we are incredibly excited by the opportunity in front of us.
if anything, 2020 has shown the strength and resilience of our team under very challenging circumstances and in its own strange way, galvanized our organization to deliver even greater results as we look to our revised 2025 plan. we believe we have a winning consumer proposition and the tools to deliver it to consumers. we have a deep pipeline of innovation being ready for the market. the strength of our marketing team and programs have never been better, and our customers recognize the opportunity that freshpet presents.
we believe that is the recipe for significant success, and we are ready to achieve it. that concludes our overview. we will now be glad to take your questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of ken goldman with j.p. morgan. please proceed with your question.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. thank you. i know there's some year on year, i guess, lumpiness to -- there's some lumpiness to the year-on-year numbers. but the way i see it, you've guided to annual run-rate capacity in 1q of $390 million in potential sales.
you've guided to $490 million in 2q for the run rate. so i guess if you just average those out, it kind of gets you to a quarterly run rate of about $110 million in dollar sales capacity this quarter. i apologize for doing the maths on the call on the fly, but it just feels like you're sort of saying to us, you know, you should probably get close to that $110 million number in dollar sales unless you under ship consumption, which seems unlikely. so i just wanted to make sure my math there is not totally inaccurate in how to think about, you know, implied guidance for 2q revenue.
hello?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
hi, ken. hi, ken, i'm sorry, i was talking on mute. i apologize.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
no. i thought i [inaudible] someone for the first time in history.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. no. sorry. scott, thanks for trying to jump in.
so ken, your math is right. but i caution that there's a couple of assumptions that are built in there. the first assumption is that we have at the end of the quarter that we -- that the demand is fully utilizing all the capacity. we're filling the trade inventory hole now.
so it assumes that at the end of the quarter, the nielsen consumption is using all of it up. the second assumption there is as we continue to ramp up production, your -- the assumption is that what we produce and what is in demand is a dead match. and so as you can imagine, we're going to start doing longer production runs and try to refill some of our inventory to improve our customer service because we know as we have more inventory in-house, our ability to do -- fill trucks goes up. so we may end the quarter with higher inventory as opposed to necessarily selling everything that we make.
it's not the ideal way to do it, but it's ultimately what could end up happening. but other than that, your math is right.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. so just to clarify, and i'm not -- i don't want to pin you down on an exact number here because i know things are so fluid right now. but $110 million seems like the maximum you can produce, but there are some caveats to that, that could bring a potentially slightly below that. and we're not holding to that.
i'm just trying to get a sense of what you're saying.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. just recognize that there's a human component, yes. i mean let's put it this way. can we get in that direction? yes.
there's a human component. we're adding staffing. we have to produce well every week. you get the idea, but we're in that ballpark.
ken goldman -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
understood. that's helpful. thank you for that. and then you spoke last quarter about a major expansion in e-commerce.
obviously, e-com is doing great for you still. i didn't hear though another mention of that major expansion today unless i missed it. i just wanted to know, are you still on schedule with those partners? or maybe have your production challenges temporarily delayed some of the bump up you might have expected? just hoping for an update because that was such an important part of the story last quarter.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
now, do you want to take that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
it's scott. yeah. it's scott. so no, everything is running on schedule.
i wish everything was running as tight as this is. so i think what you're going to see from us over the course of this year, you'll see a lot of expansion in e-commerce in general. we've actually had to shut down a lot of the marketing and advertising that we've done over the past year just because of some of the capacity issues. so you'll see expansion with many of the folks that we currently work with, where the majority of it goes through our existing fridge network.
and you'll also see some additional e-commerce partners coming, where you would be able to order different things from some new partners. we're going to increase the marketing. we anticipate we'll continue to increase our share -- overall share of the business. we're getting a ton of inbound requests from consumers from a subscription standpoint.
we think we'll be able to -- we will be able to solve that this year. so we're very excited about that. and we're really planning on working with the right partners under, you know, a really, really good kind of joint set of terms that we can really kind of make a major impact in e-commerce over the course of this year.

your next question comes from the line of steph wissink with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, everyone. i have a question for you, heather. it's just on the overall cost structure.
so you talked about chicken being locked in, beef seeing a little inflation, some packaging inflation. and then freight separately in the selling expense, can you just help size up each of those to your overall cost pool, so we can just understand a little bit about impact in each of those big buckets?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sure. sure, steph. so just to sort of dimensionalize how to think about our input costs and where they show up. so first, cost of goods.
when you split up, the input costs are about 40% of our cost of goods. and then just as a reminder, freight costs are in sg&a. so when you're thinking about margin impacts, that is there. so yes, i mean we touched on it, but i'll go into a little bit more detail.
we anticipated inflation in beef, which is on track in terms of what we've -- you know, it's in line with what we've gotten by it. we also anticipated packaging inflation, mainly in corrugate. and that's also reflected in our plans. the only new one that's really emerging is around resins.
and right now, the resin impact, it appears to be pretty modest in terms of how that will impact our packaging costs overall. so not a major driver, something that we're comfortable that we can absorb within the overall p&l structure and overall guidance. and then in freight, we touched on it, but i'll just go into a little bit more detail. we anticipated freight inflation, both in carrier inflation as well as fuel surcharge.
and those assumptions haven't changed versus what we had in guidance. the bigger driver is the issue that i talked about around the cost implication of our low fill rates. and that's a pretty meaningful on cost. if you look in the presentation, you'll see that that's -- you know, when you look at a 50% fill rate versus a 90% fill rate, about $0.07 a pound.
so it's pretty meaningful. the impact in q1 on a margin perspective is about 200 basis points. so we had 300 basis points versus plan and logistics, but of which 200 is driven by that fill rate issue -- sorry, versus prior year. and so it's pretty meaningful, but we do expect that as fill rates improve, it will naturally come down as we touched on.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. that's great. and if i could, just one follow-up. it also relates a little bit to e-commerce being about 6% of your business.
but as you're thinking about deploying more dollars in advertising, can you share with us a little bit about digital versus traditional mix? and then as you see e-commerce continue to climb higher, do you distort more and more toward digital activation and conversion?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. you know, it's a really interesting question. it's something we've tested our way through over the past kind of even five years on how we go to market. and we're a -- we make sure that the dollars that we're spending, we keep incredibly close track on, do an incredible amount of analysis to make sure that they're as productive as possible.
the vast majority of our spending continues to be on television. we are finding that there's some great places in connected tv and ott that we can spend dollars and they're really productive. we have nice spending in digital, but it's definitely not the -- it's the minority of our overall spend. as we do a little bit more in e-commerce than what we've done over the past year, we get a really, really good return on ad spend.
when we're advertising specifically and the dollars go to a partner that has a wafer, a customer -- consumer that order it directly. so, you know, you took into the card as an example. so as we're doing advertising in some of these different areas, we're getting really, really good return on ad spend, and we're going to continue to kind of press into that area until we see any type of diminishing returns. so i don't think it will cause a dramatic shift in what we're seeing overall because it's still a very, very small piece of the total pie for us.
but over time, we definitely anticipate potentially moving some dollars into that area.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you, very helpful.

your next question comes from the line of rupesh parikh with oppenheimer & company. please proceed with your question.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. so as you look at the april data, clearly, consumer mobility has increased. i was just curious, billy, if you guys are seeing any changes in consumer behavior or whether purchasing freshpet, have you seen some changes with the increased vaccinations, etc.?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
the data -- first of all, in the deck, we show, you know, our estimate of what april's consumption is or our sales were, and then also you see the nielsen data for the month. and so you can see we're seeing an upward trend along in terms of both consumption as well as the shipments that we're doing. the thing that's tough for us to tell is we have two things going on at the same time. advertising went on the air for us on april 19, and our in-store presentation has improved consistently throughout the month of april.
and so with those two factors, we'd expect to see continued strong upward trends in consumption. so it's hard to separate that out from anything else like, you know, vaccinations and people having more mobility. the attitudinal data we've seen, the consumer comments we're getting all suggest that the behavior is very similar. but i have to believe that psychographically, consumers are feeling a little bit more liberated.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
ok. great. and then maybe just one follow-up question. so clearly, you guys have -- you have some cost pressures in your business.
it seems like this year, you'll be able to manage through. how do you think about the pricing lever going forward? is that something maybe you'll raise that later this year or next year? or just curious just on pricing, how you guys think about that going forward.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah, rupesh, heather had made some comments in the prepared remarks that basically said we'll take a look at that, but probably later on this year. we'll look at it and see what the cost picture looks like. frankly, we have to restore our customer service and get ourselves in a good position with both our retailers and our consumers before you even think about that. and then we'll take a look at and see what the position -- you know, what the cost inflation is that we have.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
ok, rupesh. and that being said, let me add on, i think that we have done pricing in the past. we've been able to manage it very well. the business has responded incredibly well to it.
so we do know it is a lever. but as billy said, it's not something that we're -- we want to apply in the near term.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
ok, great.

thank you. your next question comes from the line of bill chappell with truist. please proceed with your question.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon there. just i guess, first question, trying to understand kind of the out-of-stocks and how we see it at retail. doing fair amount of store checks, you can find some pretty bare fridges, you can -- even as recently the past couple of weeks.
and historically, it's always -- you know, it's rare where you could find a fully stocked fridge, just because it was either growing so fast or just because of kind of customer service or getting it to the fridge levels. should that change over this year? i know you said you're going to have production up to make your sales goals, but i didn't know if the out-of-stocks would still be an issue throughout the year where you may be leaving some sales on the table.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. let me take a shot at, and scott might have some comments to add on it. but the out-of-stocks were at their very worst shortly after the snowstorms that we had in february. and whether you measure it using tdps, which is sort of a poor man's but publicly available way of identifying what our out-of-stocks are or we do some of our own internal audits.
the bottom line is we've seen consistent improvement week-on-week since that depths in february. and to the point that as of the most recent week, you know, there are still some fridges out there. and it's in certain places and certain customers and on certain skus, you'll see some spotty conditions. but we fully expect to see much better-looking fridges in the next several weeks.
and if you take a look at the tdps as a sort of a benchmark of it, last august, mid-august, when we were just the first time we sort of ran out of capacity, that was our high watermark, and we had a lot of very full fridges back then. and i'd expect us to be back at that level within the call at the next six weeks or so. and at that point, yes, you'll find some fridges that don't have all the skus all the time, but you will find largely well-stocked fridges. scott, do you have anything to add to that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. bill, we touched a little bit on it in the past. and sometimes, we look at it and i think everyone in the organization sometimes is scratching their head on how we're putting up the numbers we're putting up with some of the in-stock conditions that we have, which i think is a good signal. we have in-stock conditions at some retailers that are as low as 30%, 40%, all the way up to 80%.
but no one's even into the -- you know, we may have a couple of people that are recently getting into the mid-80s, but we're -- we have a lot of opportunity, a ton of opportunity. and i think as we continue to get the rest of the -- people want to buy certain things. if we get the rest of the portfolio filled out, i think there's really nice upside for us over the course of the year.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and you talked about kind of pushing out some of the new store openings. wondering a little bit, and i might have asked this before about innovation and, you know, even kind of sku count expansion. have you done any near-term adjustments with everything that went on in the quarter where you need to push that out even further just to increase throughput of the most popular skus?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
what we've had -- billy, do you want to go ahead?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
no, no, i was going to say go ahead.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah, bill. so we were -- a lot of our innovation this year was actually centered on lines that were not our high-capacity lines. we have a handful of smaller, more capacity lines that enable us to get some of that newer innovation out. we've been able to utilize those.
so it didn't take away from a lot of the capacity that we needed to put toward our base items. so we were fortunate with that. we did get some of that innovation out. there was a little bit of it that did kind of slide, slip, and some of it will even go to next year at some retailers.
but the majority of the innovation will go out as scheduled and as planned throughout the year.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
ok, great. and then just sneak one last. any updated kind of sense of how much the u.s. pet ownership has spiked over the past 12 months?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
we've seen so many numbers on that, just like you have as well. i will tell you, i've seen numbers that were as low as 2%, and i've seen numbers in the high mid-single digits. the best number i've seen would suggest that the pet ownership -- and i'm now speaking mostly about dogs, was up like 3%, maybe a little bit more than 3%. there was a big pull forward last year, but i don't believe the numbers that said it was a whole lot more than.
i mean if you got me to four, you know, i'd be surprised.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. yeah. the other thing on the pet ownership piece. i saw a study that was done recently that was really encouraging that not only was there some increase in tests.
there's only so many tests to go around, but there is still pent-up demand. and it still -- it seems like it's continuing. i think, hopefully, people are realizing it's pretty awesome to have a dog or a cat or a pet in your family. and so i don't think it's going away, and it may continue to grow over the next year or so.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
that's great. thanks for the call.
jeff sonnek -- investor relations
thanks, mark. bill, sorry, bill.

your next question comes from the line of peter benedict with baird. please proceed with your question.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hi, guys. i guess one question on kind of production. i know one of the slides you had in here, you had about 519,000 pounds a day as the average in april. and i think during the presentation or the call here, you spoke to some improvements coming from some of the kitchen 2.0 lines, some increase coming in kits itself.
just trying to get a sense for where you think pound production per day could be as we look out over, i don't know, maybe toward the second half of the year or the end of the year benchmark or however you want to frame it?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. i don't think -- i haven't mapped it out in terms of pounds. one of our manufacturing guys might have done that. and it's also very -- we have to be careful because when we use pounds because, you know, we bring in a lot of ingredients, and that's the way we measure the throughput, but it turns into cases and it turns into meals, ultimately, that we feed a pet.
what i can tell you is the chart that we've also included in the deck that shows sort of as you convert it into revenue, that shows what the revenue would be in each of the quarters, is probably the best indicator of what we think we're going to get. because one of the things that's going to happen as we expand the capacity, one of the lines that we're expanding the capacity on the most and where we're shortest right now is on our fresh from the kitchen line. and fresh from the kitchen is the highest price per pound of our mainstream items. and so when we start producing that, the pounds won't be as big as some of the other items, but the dollars will go with it.
and so i just caution that using pounds as the only metric to think about our capacity could become a little bit misleading as we get further into the year. but suffice it to say is we're going from where we are today, where we have all of our equipment running, we're now adding shifts. as we add shifts, we pick up capacity first on our bag line, then on our roll lines and then ultimately, we start up another line at kitchen south, which will be another bag line. so we'll see more of the mix moving near term into rolls, longer term into bags and that will impact both the pounds and the dollars.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thanks, billy. i guess the p&l, you now have the loss on equity investment line in there.
i'm not sure if you guys are willing to speak a little more about that and provide some color into that. but since it's in the p&l, i figured i'd ask.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, do you want to talk about that?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
i can.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
is that heather?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sorry, we went on mute. sorry about that. that loss there is representative of our percentage ownership in the investments that we've made reflective of that business' q4 performance, and that's basically all that we could share.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
ok. all right. that's right. and then i guess last question for scott.
with your social media video today, it's approaching 2,000 views across instagram and facebook, how is that trending relative to your expectations?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. well, we launched it around 11:00, and i was quickly told that i have no chance for any type of award from the video. so i'm a little concerned, but i'm going to work harder next time. i mean, look, peter, i think it's been pretty well-received as you kind of go through the comments.
i think, very, very well received, honestly. you'll actually see some people in there like send me a subscription kind of thing or i waited for you. i think it's been really supportive, and i think it's been supportive all the way through, and, you know, it's been -- it's been great to see. over the next kind of two weeks, this will have a long tail on it.
and we'll be putting a little bit of spend behind it to communicate it out because it's not about vanity. it's about like really trying to be transparent in communicating with our consumers and making sure that people see it. so i think we'll see some -- the numbers grow. and the people that, you know, want to hear about it will get a chance to kind of, you know, see what we're talking about.
but so far, so good.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
i think if andrew cuomo got an emmy for his covid press conference, scott, you get an oscar for that.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
you're right --
scott morris -- chief operating officer
the thing is i'm not acting. there's no acting going on. just the real deal.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
well, listen. well done on that. i think all you've been doing with the letters and now the video, it's great because obviously, it's a tough situation for some consumers, but i think it goes over well. so anyway, i just wanted to flag that for you.
thanks, guys.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
thanks.

your next question comes from the line of jason english with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hello, there. no clue what that last exchange was. it looks like i've got to go check out my myspace account and figure out what's happening on social media these days. but i will say, we are one household that is thrilled to have the other five freshpet once again on a regular basis.
but i may need to go to six different stores. so i'm very happy to see the out-of-stock situation in a better place. on to my questions, a couple of quick ones. logistics, we talked a lot about it today.
remind me, what is it -- like how big is it as a percentage of sales? and can you give us order of magnitude in terms of the impact this quarter of what it changed from and to?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
heather, do you want to take that?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. so last year -- so prior year kind of full year is around 8.5%. and, you know, all else being equal, we expect that to continue to go down the scale.
having said that, we anticipated freight inflation and fuel surcharge inflation of about 100 basis points. in q1, actually the performance was 300 basis points worse than prior year. so it's about 200 basis points impact for q1 from the fill rate issue. and if you look at the -- have a chance to look at the chart in the presentation, you can see how it moves the fill rate.
but on the cost per pound right now, we're looking at about a $0.07 per pound on cost due to the issue.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
good numbers. thank you. and i appreciate the store additions have been derailed by two things. you cited your service levels.
i'm sure covid has also been a disruptor too in terms of resets and store builds, etc. but as we think about the out-of-stocks, which arguably weren't in plan, i think you thought you'd be up and running or back to better service levels quicker than you were. have you missed any key windows? so is this just a deferral of when we get the stores? or is it possible that we just missed until next year? so we just have to move store count out of this year and into next year.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. let me -- scott will talk about the customer dynamic. i will tell you, recall when we gave our guidance, it was the end of february. so we had fairly good visibility about what the customers would be doing.
so the guidance we gave for the year accounted for any of those kinds of shifts that might have occurred. but scott can tell you a little bit more about how customers are thinking about what will come this year versus next year.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. so there's -- there are a couple of windows that we did miss because they were -- you know, they were just -- we just couldn't kind of get our -- what we needed to from a production standpoint together. you know, they're meaningful. but as billy mentioned, they're reflected in the numbers already from a store count standpoint and also from an annual revenue standpoint.
so we're -- i think we're in good shape from that. and we're already -- as people are starting to see some fill rates come back, we're sharing with them, you know, being incredibly transparent on all the information we're sharing with them: what lines we're opening when, how we're opening them up, adding the shifts. i think that they've had a lot of confidence in what we've been communicating, and we're actually back in conversations with a bunch of them on additional opportunities, which some of them will develop potentially later this year, but i think most of it will be -- will really be early next year and kind of the front half of next year. i would think that we would outpace what we've historically done, would be my guess.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
jason, i think it's also important to note that many of our customers right now are looking at, you know, year-on-year trends that are not very favorable on the rest of the pet food market. and we're growing at a very strong rate. you see there's a chart in the deck that shows literally how big we are now in grocery compared to the other brands and how much our growth rate is for the total category. and so i think if you're a customer and you're trying to figure out where you want to put your investment in the space, we are increasingly an important part of that conversation.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. you invited me to ask you a follow-up on that one. so just the same more. you said the category -- i mean, here's what i heard.
the category -- outlook for the category is not that great for the rest of the year, is what i just heard you say. a year in exception. but my question is why would that be? i mean back to the point earlier, we've got 3% more pets, they're getting larger, they're going to eat more. i get it on pet snacks where maybe people aren't as home as much.
i mean my kids are feeding my dogs treats left and right. they can't wait to get back to school and say, oh, my treat budget. so i imagine pet treat sales go down. but is there reason to be cautious on the overall category?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
the reason is that -- i'm speaking from the perspective of the retailer who saw a fair amount of their business move to e-commerce, and it didn't come back.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
so if you're thinking about how you're going to allocate your space at retail, our freshpet fridge is a really good way to invest your space.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, makes sense.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mark astrachan with stifel. please proceed with your question.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah, thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. i think i wanted to start with a follow-up to the last question. so you made a pretty, i guess, forceful statement about stay tuned on e-commerce and partners there. is there any way to think about the incrementality from an e-commerce a customer, maybe even a pure-play e-commerce customer relative to what you would do potentially in a store and how you're thinking about that in terms of flow-through in the model?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. we have done a fair amount of work trying to establish exactly what the impact will be in our business. and everything from what we can tell is in the very -- first of all, it's going to be a very kind of slow easing launch. and it's going to -- look, it takes some time for people to realize that it's available in different places, no matter where that is.
so it's going to take some time to kind of have its full impact. we think at the very beginning, it will be as much -- they'll be penetration game. but a lot of it will be kind of moving consumers from, you know, potentially from one place to another. we want to limit at as much as possible that's on our goal, by any means.
over time, we think the single greatest benefit is it will increase our buying rate dramatically. and i'm talking like a little bit, i'm talking like a multiples. because when you see someone that is on either some type of subscription or some type of, you know, consistent basis where they're getting a product on a certain cadence, the overall dollars that they spend is significantly higher. so we think it's going to open our buying rate up tremendously, and it won't be something that will just have this year's impact.
it could be also next year and even the year after impact. we have specific dollar amounts that we've kind of put into our budget that roll into our overall guidance for this year for what we're doing in e-commerce. so there's no -- there shouldn't be kind of any upside surprises if we have done our modeling correctly. and i think as we kind of get, you know, some of these launches behind us, i think that we'll be able to kind of share a little bit more detail.
at this point, i think i'm telling you probably as much as i feel like we can share.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes, that's helpful. on the buying rate, just not relating to the last question, just broadly, it was up year on year in 1q. and i guess, relative to last year, and it's always sort of been thought of at least by me, the household penetration goes up, buying rate comes down because you have people kind of coming in at a lower buying rate sampling rate, however you want to think about it. so what drove the increase in 1q? was there people kind of pantry loading from an out-of-stock standpoint? how do you think about that number over the balance of the year? and how do you think about it as well in terms of the incremental that you're talking about in terms of the products, which have been out of stock which also have a higher dollar value going forward?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. let me take that. let me take a shot at that and then scott if you want to add to it. but first of all, remember, the buying rate number that we quote in the deck is a 52-week number for the -- ending at the end of the quarter.
so the up 3% reflects the past 52 weeks. and our historical run rate has been in the, call it, you know, mid-single-digits kind of run rate. we'd like to see that number up in the 6% or 7% range. it was lower than i would have expected because of the out-of-stocks where basically consumers couldn't find the products that they were looking for.
is there any hoarding? i would say if there was any hoarding or loading up a lot by consumers, every one of those who loaded up, it was offsetting somebody who couldn't find any other product elsewhere. so i -- my sense is that as we get better in-stock conditions, you're going to see the buying rate go up in addition to the buying rate improvement that scott mentioned related to e-commerce.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok, that's helpful.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. i think, you know, as bill was saying, mark, there's a ton of like there's puts and takes on all of this. so it's like what products that we have available, what do we not have available? was there hoarding where people, some people couldn't find so they couldn't buy as much over the quarter. i think it's -- honestly, it's a tough one to read.
i would go with what the historical progress that we've made. it's probably a cleaner look. and until our kind of in-stocks get settled out over the, you know, next kind of six, eight weeks when they really get settled out, i think you'll see kind of that real consistent progression how we've modeled over time.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. i don't know if i'm full. wanted to ask maybe a follow-up related to that. have you seen any of your customers kind of push consumers into different products as a result of these out-of-stocks? and how are you addressing that if that had any impact on the business?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. you know, look, there's a handful of customers. they've done what they need to do for the business. they have consumers coming into their stores.
we don't have product, shame on us, right? we're not taking care of anybody that way, and they have pushed some people in some different directions. honestly, going through the comments today, there's not a ton of comments. i mean we usually get, you know, -- we'll get, you know, 1,000-plus comments on when we posted these notes. most of the people are cheering for us and telling us tried some other things.
i mean you can see it in some of the notes already. i've tried other things, and i'm coming back and my dog didn't like or my dog didn't eat or whatever it may be. so i think once we get ourselves set, once we get the innovation out there over the course of this year, i think we're going to see people coming -- going back to the, you know -- the , you know, the business. and it's frustrating to have some of our customers pushing people in different directions, but i understand it, you know.
and i hope they -- most of them are -- they understand the situation and they're good partners, and we'll work our way through it.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. all right. well, thanks.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of jon andersen with william blair. please proceed with your question.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
good afternoon, everybody. just a few. most of my questions have been asked and answered. on e-commerce, if you were to add a new partner, significant new partner, how should we think about the economics of that relationship? do you shoot to be agnostic relative to the overall business? or are there some distinct considerations there that you might take the incremental households, the incremental buy rate over the long term in exchange for maybe a tighter margin?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. so it's interesting. i got a -- early on in my career, i got an incredible lesson on. as you develop a piece of business, make sure it is not margin-diluted if you think it's going to get bigger over time.
and just like everything that we've done at fresh that we've really tried to be thoughtful and just do things the right way, we are margin neutral with really -- almost entirely across our business, other than europe, we are very margin neutral. i mean it's amazingly margin neutral. and we've made sure that we want to develop partnerships that are really going to be margin neutral because you can't have a huge piece of business that develops over time, all of a sudden, 10%, 15%, 20% of your business and now you've got a massive margin problem. so you created one opportunity and give yourself a giant hole that's almost impossible to unwind.
so we've worked really hard as we've developed all of our partnerships to make sure that the relationship and the margins look, you know, appropriate for our business. and it works from a value standpoint for the consumer. it works for the partner, our retailer, or e-com partners. and it works for us.
and if you can't figure out how to make it work for all three, you got to go back to the drawing board. and we've done it a lot of times, quite honestly, over the past kind of 10 years, call it. but especially in, you know, in the last moves that we make in the market, you've got to make sure that you're putting yourself in a good spot. typically, there's one way these margins go over time, and it's down.
so you got to make sure that you're putting yourself in a good position up front.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you. shifting gears, media spend. 10%, i think, last year was the media ratio.
you started out this year with 12% in q1. i understand the puts and takes around that, but it sounds like the spigot is on for the balance of the year. what's the right way to think about the media ratio for the year and the cadence following q1?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
so we -- the ratio for the year, we're targeting 12%, you know, in that ballpark is the way to think about it. and we have in the deck, we gave you a pretty clear indication of the cadence that once we're back on the air, which was in april, that the media will be on continuously for the -- basically for the balance of the year and the spending will be comparable in each of the quarters in an absolute dollar basis.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
ok. last one for me. pet specialty, you're killing it in pet specialty. could you talk a little bit about the dynamics there? is this a format or channel phenomenon? i mean the category performing well in that channel.
is it a freshpet-specific situation? and how long do you expect it to persist? thanks.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. i think that there's a few things that are going into play on that one, jon. one of them is, i think we put ourselves in a good situation from like a foundation standpoint. meaning there were a lot of stores with big fridges and a lot of stores now with second fridges, and there's been really nice expansion in pet specialty over the past year or two.
and those -- that's still paying dividends. because when we have a second fridge, it allows us to get more variety and innovation into the fridge in addition to having more inventory. so it solves a handful of challenges there. i think the other dynamic that we have seen a little bit with pet specialty is i think we are really, really suffering in a few other formats.
and i think people are making a trip, especially the more involved pet parents are making a little few extra trips to a petsmart or a petco or pet supplies plus type of store, any type of pet store, and they're finding our products there. and i think that's adding to it, too. but i do think it's a combination of several factors, good base, good foundation, innovation, and then also, i think, some people finding it where they have not necessarily seen it before. so -- and i think this is going to continue for quite a while.
i mean we also know that once people start in the spot, they're pretty darn sticky in the location where they originally found the product.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
yeah, that makes sense. thanks so much, everybody, and good luck going forward.

your next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
i had just a couple of quick ones. you might have mentioned in the beginning of the call, like what percent of your cogs is labor. but i wanted to ask again because you talk more than most of your peers about wage inflation and what it takes to get people to get to the -- come to the plants. and you're also expanding.
you have a really successful product. so i'm just kind of curious, are you seeing wage inflation rise to a level that is getting more alarming to you? or is it just kind of like mid-single-digit kind of inflation that it wouldn't necessarily on its own necessitate, you know, price changes? and then i had a quick follow-up.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
let me take that, and heather might add some commentary on how much labor is part of our p&l. but the overall piece is it's not at the alarming level. there is a more of a localized issue that we're addressing here in the lehigh valley, where the freshpet kitchens are. the lehigh valley has become a major distribution hub for northeastern part of the united states.
and so there is a fairly significant number of sizable employers who are fishing in the pond looking for warehouse labor, you know, fedex, amazon, walmart, whatnot, a lot of big warehouses. and so it means the lower end of the market is fairly overfished. and so one of the things we're trying to figure out is what does it take to get the skilled labor that we need and what are the wage rates to do that. we're competitive today.
we're attracting people. the total package that we offer people includes more than just wages. it also includes what we think is a fairly generous benefits package. we feed people and whatnot.
so it's a very good working environment. we want to win on environment, not on the wages. but it is more of a localized, in fact, the way i would describe it. heather, do you want to give any other commentary on the labor as a part of our p&l?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sure. so just to be more specific around the implication for this year. so wages are about 60% of our cogs -- or labor and overhead, i should say, about 60% of our cost of goods. and within that, of course, is wages.
we -- low single digits in terms of broad inflation. but just as a reminder, we've also increased our night check premium by $2 an hour. so we have now a $3 premium on the night shift. and that was an on-cost that we've included in our plans for the year, but certainly is an inflationary item that we've -- we've got this year.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. so inflation -- wage inflation is different in ennis, texas. it's not quite as acute?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. we're going to start doing our hiring in ennis, texas second half of this year. we'll have to see what it ends up looking like. it does feel like there's a lot of people moving to texas at this point.
but when we picked that at a site, we were very comfortable with the wages in that market. and we frankly -- i think we can get very high caliber talent at the wages that we'd expect to pay. so we're optimistic about that.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and then just last question. you mentioned that you're the top-selling pet food brand in grocery stores. very impressive.
is it similar in mass also? is that implied in those charts too? or is it a little lower than that?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
no. it's lower than that. so think of it this way is we have the biggest brand. we're bigger than all the dry dog food brands in grocery.
and the reason i called that out was that that's where some of our significant distribution expansion opportunities are. so if you're one of those retailers who have been looking at that data and say, this is where i should invest in on my space. the broader number, when you think about the whole nielsen mega-channel or including in that is mass is that we are the fastest growing, and not just in percentage but in absolute dollars. and that's the second chart that's included in that deck that shows how much our absolute dollar growth is relative to the rest of the brands in the category.
we are growing in absolute dollars faster than everybody else is.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok, great. all right. thanks, guys.

billy cyr -- chief executive officer
thank you, jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. i want to start by giving you the punchline upfront. the freshpet kitchens are delivering the increases in output we had expected and are now producing at a rate that is almost 50% above year ago. that is enabling us to refill the trade inventory that we had drawn down during the back half of 2020 and satisfy our customers and consumers with much better in-stock conditions.
we are not done refilling the inventory on all the skus at all customers, but we are getting close. we are incredibly grateful to the customers and consumers who have stood by us during the supply challenges we had over the last six months. we know it is frustrating for our customers to not be able to provide their shoppers with a high-quality in-stock conditions they pride themselves on and for consumers to have to search high and low for the freshpet products that their pets have become accustomed to. our team has done everything they could to catch up to demand under very challenging circumstances.
i can't say enough good things about the efforts of our production, sales, logistics, and consumer care team and their tenacity through the challenges of the past year. the progress we've made has allowed us to get back to doing what we do best, change the way people nourish their pets forever. our advertising is on the air, household penetration is growing. we are launching new items and our customers are planning to install new fridges, upgraded fridges and second fridges.
as a result of this progress and the strong fundamental trends we are seeing, we remain very bullish on our prospects for both this year and for the next several years. we are off to a very good start in 2021 despite the numerous challenges we face. in q1, we grew net sales 33%, our strongest quarter of growth since the third quarter of 2015. basically, we sold everything we could make in q1.
we also grew adjusted ebitda in q1 at a rate slightly above net sales growth, up 35% versus year ago. heather will provide you with more detail and color on those results. i want to focus my comments on a few of the highlights and choices we made that drove the results in the quarter and update you on our expectations for the balance of the year and early next year. i want to begin by discussing the state of our manufacturing operations.
overall, we are doing very well, delivering the commitments we had made on both our near-term and long-term capacity projects. as we have previously outlined, we made several additions to our capacity last year, including a two-shift operation at kitchens south last june and the start-up of kitchens 2.0 in october. despite those additions, our total output did not go up, i.e., we lost just as much output in our existing kitchens due to covid testing and quarantine as we gained from those incremental operations. you can see this on the chart on page 36 of the accompanying investor presentation.
in december, we made several interventions designed to correct that, and the plan is working. we are now getting the benefits of the incremental production capacity we added last year and adding more. other than the two significant snowstorms in february, we've consistently produced in excess of nielsen-measured consumption every week since january 1, have not lost any production shifts due to covid, and our april production was about 45% ahead of a strong month a year ago and more than 60% greater than was consumed a year ago. we have now demonstrated the ability to produce at a level that will support the significant growth we are guiding to this year.
we've been able to do this because of work our hr team did to bolster our staffing. we raised the wages for our night shift and recruited a flex pool of talent to both insulate us from any further covid-related absenteeism and to further expand our capacity. covid still exists in the lehigh valley community where the kitchens are located, so we are still incurring some covid-related costs. we expect that to wind down in q3 as our entire team became eligible for vaccines on march 31, and we have strongly encouraged them to get vaccinated if they can.
we have provided incentives to our team members to share their vaccination history with us, offering two incremental days of vacation and a $25 cash incentive if they share their vaccination record with us within the first two months after they became eligible, and one-day vacation if they share it within the following two months. further, while the state of pennsylvania has not allowed companies to do on-site vaccinations, we hired nursing staff to sit in our break rooms for eight hours per day and work with our team members to navigate the challenges of finding vaccination appointments. they have successfully found vaccine appointments for numerous team members at times and locations that work for them. we are thrilled with the success of this program, and our team members are very appreciative that we made it so much easier for them.
while not everyone will choose to get vaccinated, we believe enough will choose to be vaccinated to reduce our dependence on most of our covid-related interventions by the end of q3. due to our success in navigating these unusual and dynamic variables, we do not expect further supply interruptions this year due to covid. and as a result, we anticipate winding down our covid add-back to adjusted ebitda by the end of q3. we are mindful, however, that the future of covid is uncertain and there is the possibility of new variants that evade our vaccines, further government-mandated lockdowns, and new unforeseen supply chain interruptions.
we will remain nimble, always keeping the safety of our team as our top priority. and we'll communicate any changes to our expectations in a timely manner. looking forward, we remain on track to add a new production line at kitchen south later this year and another one early next year. and construction of our largest kitchen in ennis, texas is making good progress.
we remain comfortable with the timetables we've communicated previously in terms of facility start-up timing and the total production capacity each of those facilities will provide. further, when ennis opens next year, it will be another example of our ability to continually improve the manufacturing technology for freshpet, creating higher quality products at an attractive cost and in a very positive work environment. kitchens 2.0 is a major step forward for us against those metrics. ennis will be another step beyond that.
i also want to point out that we are constructing the ennis facility with environmental sustainability in mind. for example, we've already poured 3,700 cubic yards of low-carbon concrete. that is concrete that uses fly ash to lower the carbon footprint. that has saved approximately 100 metric tons of co2 emissions so far in the construction of that facility versus ordinary concrete.
we can't replace all of our concrete with low carbon concrete. but where we can, we are doing it. we are also installing a variety of measures designed to both limit our water and energy usage, but also generate clean water and energy on-site. we will provide a much more in-depth review of our entire environmental sustainability and broader esg effort this summer when we release our first esg report.
the second topic i would like to address is the composition of our growth in the quarter. as we said when we provided our guidance in late february, the year-on-year comparisons are not particularly meaningful due to the covid surge and trough in the base year. in the accompanying presentation, we attempt to provide a bit more clarity so that you can understand the various moving parts, including not only the year-ago covid impacts but also the impact of our out-of-stocks this year. the key points i would highlight are: first, the out-of-stock impact was most significant in mid-february when winter storms orlena and uri interrupted both production and distribution.
you can see this in the drop in total distribution points, tdps, monthly net sales versus a year ago in february, and our two-year stack nielsen consumption growth rate. prior to those february storms, our improving production resulted in strong january shipment and healthy consumption growth. since the end of the second storm in mid-february, we've seen similarly strong bounce back in shipments, consumption, retail availability, and our production levels. those trends continued into april with a strong upward trend in the weekly nielsen consumption through the most recently reported week.
we are now running at the consumption growth rate we need to deliver our guidance for the year. second, we successfully refilled a portion of the trade inventory in q1 and expect shipments to exceed consumption in each quarter this year. we believe that we refilled about $3 million of trade inventory in q1, and that contributed about four points to our growth rate. we would have filled considerably more, but we lost $3.5 million of production to winter storms.
so virtually all the trade inventory refill happened in march, and it is accelerating. while estimating trade inventory levels is always very difficult and imprecise, we believe that leaves another $12 million of trade inventory to fill in q2. and we have seen a significant portion of that happen in april as we've had very strong production performance. as we indicated in the presentation, our net sales in april are anticipated to be up about 42%.
while consumption in april is expected to be up by a similarly strong growth rate, please remember that we were also refilling trade inventory in the year ago. last year, we reported our total q2 net sales growth rate included 11 points of trade inventory adjustments. we expect that this year's q2 trade inventory refill may contribute to our growth rate at a level equal to or slightly above last year's adjustment. looking to the second half of 2021, i'd remind you that in late q3 and all of q4 of 2020, we could not keep up with demand, so shipments did not grow as fast as consumption and we drew down trade inventory.
we believe we will have adequate capacity this year to meet the increasing demand, and our shipment growth rate should exceed the consumption growth rate for the second half of the year. third point, despite our out-of-stocks in the first quarter this year, we continued to successfully build both household penetration and line rate in the quarter. as you know, maximizing our first-mover advantage in the fresh pet food space is a critical strategic priority for us. so our bias is always to lean in to maximize the number of households to become part of the freshpet franchise.
in early november, we delay the start of our advertising in q1 2021 to mid-february in an effort to better match our projected timing for improved retail conditions with a healthy media schedule to follow for the balance of the quarter. if we've known in early november about the production challenges we would face in late november and december due to covid, not to mention the series of major winter storms that would curtail our production and accelerate out-of-stocks, we would have made a different choice. needless to say, that was not ideal. despite that, we were still able to bring in new households at a very strong rate.
consumers saw the advertising, and we're motivated by it, driving household penetration up 25% and exceeding 4 million households for the first time. the efficiency of the spend was likely reduced from our 2020 levels. our early read suggests that it was in line with our 2019 levels of efficiency, which was still quite positive. we also built the buying rate by 3% despite consumers' inability to find our items for a good portion over the last six months.
once it became apparent that the retail conditions would not be restored until the end of april, we delayed the start of q2 advertising until april 19. while that will delay our ramp-up in household penetration gains in q2, we believe we got the timing right as we feel conditions could improve dramatically by the time the advertising went on the air. we will now be on the air almost continuously for the balance of the year, and that will provide significant momentum, particularly in the back half of the year. the third topic i would like to cover is how our retail partners are thinking about freshpet today in light of our recent out-of-stocks and the implications for fridge placements later this year and next year.
if there's anything that this experience has taught our retail partners and us, it is that freshpet has become a very important destination for pet parents. when a store is out of stock on freshpet, consumers are willing to go to a second or third store to find the product, and they call us asking where they can find it. freshpet really is that important to our pet parents and their pets. and our retail partners have noticed.
freshpet is now larger than all dry dog food brands in the grocery channel, which is where some of our biggest distribution opportunities lie. and our total dollar sales growth is now larger than the growth of every other wet and dry dog food brand in the nielsen mega-channel. while the out-of-stocks didn't always make for the most comfortable conversations with our customers, one clear theme emerged from them. they now realize that leaning with freshpet is very important to their overall success in pet food.
and many of our leading customers are now planning to lean in on fresh. in fact, eight of our top 10 customers now have significant tests or expansions of dual fridge placement, and many are planning more. but before we place new fridges, we need to be able to supply them. it makes no sense to put lots of new fridges in stores if we can't supply the fridges that we already have.
as a result of the out-of-stocks we incurred in q1, in cooperation with our customers, we delayed many of the new store fridge placements until later this year, early next year, when our capacity could support them. thus, our net new stores were only up 174 to 22,890 in q1. however, we had a strong quarter on upgrades, placing 293 of them, and a decent quarter on second fridges, placing 121 of them. this pace is consistent with the guidance we provided in february, and we are on track to deliver our full-year 2021 goals.
we expect to see a steady stream of new placements throughout this year, with the most significant placements occurring in q4 in the first half of 2022. we continue to expect to have the capacity to support a $590 million revenue run rate business by the end of this year and about $1 billion revenue run rate by the end of 2022. that will give us plenty of capacity to support the aggressive expansions our customers are contemplating. and we have shared that information with them, so we remain coordinated.
before i turn it over to heather, i want to personally thank all the investors who supported our recent equity offering. that offering is allowing us to accelerate our pace of capacity expansion, enabling us to build the capacity to support a $2 billion revenue business, and helping us achieve our goal of changing the way people nurse their pets forever. while we have lots of work to do, we are well on our way to deliver those projects. now i will turn it over to heather to provide the details on our financial results.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
thank you, billy, and good afternoon, everyone. as billy indicated, net sales for q1 of 2021 were $93.4 million, up 33% versus a year ago. actual nielsen mega-channel consumption was up 24%. so after adjusting for one less day in the quarter this year, continued improvement in the reduction of foil and the trade inventory reduction in the year ago, we estimate that four points of our growth came from our efforts to rebuild trade inventory and refill the fridges.
that is about $3 million of our net sales in the quarter. we believe we have another $12 million of trade inventory that we will refill in q2, and we are on track to do that. we believe we could have sold more in the quarter if we could have produced more. we lost about $3.5 million of production to the two major snowstorms that occurred in the quarter.
while winter snowstorms should not surprise anyone, these storms had a disproportionate impact on us because of the magnitude of the storms where we have production facilities, the fact that we had no excess capacity and neither we nor our customers had any inventory to buffer the impact. the growth in the quarter continued to be led by strong performance in the pet specialty channel, with nielsen-measured big-box pet specialty consumption up 43% in the quarter. our e-commerce business also performed well, growing 156% in the quarter and now accounts for 6.3% of sales. additionally, we had very strong performance in our international markets.
our international business grew 36% in the quarter, and we continue to see strong expense in those markets behind the advertising investments we have been making. clearly, the freshpet business model work outside the u.s. adjusted ebitda for q1 was $7.8 million, up 35% versus the year ago, slightly outpacing sales growth. the profitability would have been greater except we incurred significant freight cost increases in the quarter.
part of this was due to the freight inflation we saw coming and communicated on our february call, but a larger portion of the increase was due to our low order fill rate. due to system limitations we have in our current erp system, we don't have the ability to consolidate loads very easily when we are shipping less than 100% of a customer's order. thus, when customers gave us very large orders to meet both weekly demand and also refill their inventory, and we only had limited inventory to satisfy the order, our fill rates dropped quite significantly. the result is that we ship trucks that were half empty, driving up our freight cost per pound.
i have provided a chart in the presentation that describes how this happens and the impact that it has. this problem will be remedied as we rebuild our inventory, both ours and our customers. and customer orders better reflect actual weekly consumption. we expect that to happen gradually throughout q2.
however, the fill rates will only improve modestly until we rebuild our internal inventories on the vast majority of skus. in other words, we anticipate refilling trade inventory before we are able to completely solve the fill rate inefficiency. we expect that will likely occur sometime in q3. our new erp system will also have the capability to allocate inventory to orders before shipment, allowing for order consolidation, which will be of immense value should we ever face this problem again.
that new system is targeted to go live at the beginning of q4. until the remedies are put in place, we believe we can offset these higher costs elsewhere in the p&l and still deliver our adjusted ebitda guidance for the year, but they will reduce our opportunity for sg&a leverage gain until that is completed. adjusted gross margin improved modestly from q4, up 90 basis points to 46.7%, but was well below the year ago of 49.5%. we continue to incur the higher beef costs and higher wages, which were anticipated, but we also incurred higher unabsorbed fixed costs due to the lost production caused by the storms in february.
additionally, expanded production at kitchen south drove higher processing costs. we believe that the investments in both the higher night shift wages and the expanded production at kitchen south are paying significant dividends in terms of strong and steady production that is enabling us to rebuild the trade inventory. because there is much discussion about cost inflation in the market today, i want to comment on how we are seeing that today and outline what you can expect from us. as many of you know, chicken is our single largest ingredient expenditure, and we locked that price for the year in december at prices that are flat versus the year ago.
i have already mentioned that we are experiencing inflation in beef and freight, both of which we planned for this year, with those increases being in line with our expectations at this point. we are beginning to see some inflation in resin-based materials such as packaging. the total impact appears to be modest and manageable within the context of our guidance. we are also beginning to see evidence of labor cost inflation, but we are not expecting a significant increase this year.
we will continue to watch these costs as the year progresses before making any determination about whether we need to take any action. although if we did, it would not have any impact until 2022. media investment in the quarter was in line with our long-term rate at slightly above 12% of net sales, but below the 16.7% we had in the year ago. recall, we delayed the start of advertising in q1 to give us some time to rebuild trade inventory first.
excluding the higher freight and lower media costs in the quarter, sg&a was down 160 basis points versus a year ago, giving us the confidence that our long-term road map toward 1,000 basis points of sg&a leverage by 2025, excluding media spend, is on track. we incurred $950,000 in covid-related expenses in the quarter and have added those back. we expect to complete our covid add-backs in q3 as we anticipate enough of our teams have been vaccinated by then to roll back some of the incremental provisions we have put in place. our net cash used in operations was $5.5 million in q1.
our cash used in operations was driven by accounts receivable and inventory working capital needs due to strong net sales growth and production in the last month of the quarter. we've successfully completed our equity offering in the quarter, netting $332.5 million. our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $341 million. we spent $49.3 million in capex in the quarter.
the ennis facility is entering some of its highest investment quarters as all the site preparation is complete, foundations have been poured and steel has been going up for about a month now. additionally, our project to add a second line at kitchen south is on track to produce product by the end of q3, and the third line there will come online at the beginning of 2022. we are also taking advantage of the incremental capacity that is coming online to make some upgrades in our existing kitchens 1.0 and expect to have that work completed by the end of the year. that work will improve quality and reduce some of our labor costs on one of the existing lines.
i also want to comment on the productivity we are seeing from the new lines in kitchens 2.0. you will recall, we raised our throughput expectations for those lines when we provided our updated long-term capital plans in late february. in that plan, we acknowledge that the higher speed line and greater automation that we placed in kitchens 2.0 can deliver higher output than we included in our original projections. we are continuing to see that level of productivity as we increase the hours of production on those lines, and we are also seeing outstanding quality.
we are not on expanding the shift in that facility yet, so we have significant incremental production capacity yet to come. but is very exciting for us to realize the benefits of the manufacturing expertise we have been investing in. we believe we have created a new standard for freshpet production and look forward to sharing it with you when the world opens up and we can host visitors again. turning to our guidance for 2021.
we are reiterating our guidance for the year that calls for net sales of greater than 430 million and adjusted ebitda of greater than 61 million. in the presentation, you will see some of the many assumptions that go into that guidance and also some details on the cadence we are expecting. as we have said, the unusual nature of last year's consumption patterns and our short shipment will make the year-on-year comparisons a bit odd so we are doing our best to clarify as many of the moving parts as we can. in particular, as we look to q2, please take into account the following.
in the quarter, we expect to complete the refill of the trade inventory hole we created in the back half of 2020. however, we did something similar in the year ago, so we will not necessarily a significantly higher shipment growth rate than the consumption growth rate reported by nielsen. but based on what we are seeing so far, the consumption growth rate has been robust, so we are projecting continued strong shipments. we expect to see sequential improvement in adjusted gross margin as we continue to produce at a very high level and expect to exit 2021 with a fourth-quarter gross margin run rate higher than our full-year 2020 results.
we are still on track for the average adjusted gross margin to be flat to 2020. we will continue to experience higher freight costs due to our depleted inventory levels for most of q2 and potentially part of q3. this will diminish our leverage gains in adjusted sg&a, excluding media this year. but we expect those increased costs to be gone by q4.
we still have a very strong advertising investment in q2 as we ramp up our growth to catch up to the increased production capacity we have created. that investment will continue through the end of 2021, with comparable spending in absolute dollars planned in each of the three remaining quarters. in closing, our guidance for 2021 continues to call for net sales greater than $430 million, up 35% versus a year ago and adjusted ebitda greater than $61 million, up 30% versus a year ago. we believe our strong performance in q1, particularly in manufacturing, has positioned us well for the balance of the year.
we are producing about 50% more than we did in the year ago and we have more capacity coming online. our advertising is driving household penetration gains, and we have a strong, continuous media presence for the balance of the year. retailers recognize the value that freshpet brings to the category and are planning more and larger fridge placements. and our innovation pipeline is deep.
we have not had the luxury of all those conditions being in place, all at the same time in a long time, so we look forward to taking advantage of the momentum that provides, accelerating our growth toward our 2025 goals of 11 million households, 1.25 billion in net sales and a 25% adjusted ebitda margin. that concludes our overview. we will now be glad to take your questions. operator?

at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of rupesh parikh with oppenheimer. you may proceed with your question.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. so i guess, billy, heather, just starting out on the pricing front. at this point, any sense of whether there's any retail resistance to the price increases you guys anticipate taking? and then secondly, how do you think your projected price increases compare to maybe some of the other pet food out there?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
we'll let scott take that one.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
hi, rupesh. so we sent out a letter at the end of last week. we carefully went over this with our sales team. we have some conversations with a handful of customers.
even right as we were developing the price increase, we also looked around what we're seeing in the market. we have not heard resistance. from our understanding, a lot of people are taking pricing at this point. so i think it's something that a lot of people anticipated and expected.
the thing i want to say about the way we did it is we pushed it off as far as we possibly could. we want to take a consumer-centric approach like we do to every single thing we do. we want to make sure that everyone wins in every single thing we do, too. so we want to really avoid any pricing impact until our availability and our inventory issues were a little bit more muted and not as visible to consumers.
so we really pushed it off as far as we possibly could. and again, we want to think about what is the best way to do this for the consumer, for our customers, and then also freshpet. it's a pretty wide array on the pricing, meaning there are some items that will move maybe not at all. and there are some items that will move significantly.
and we've done this several times before. and i think at this point, we really understand the best practice on how to do this, how to minimize the impact and how to implement it where we'll realize the greatest benefit and the -- as limited impact as possible.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
ok, great. and then maybe just one follow-up question just on out-of-stocks or retail. just curious on the latest thinking in terms of when you guys think the out-of-stocks will be at levels that you guys are happy with.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
rupesh, you'll see in the deck that we published shows the tdps, which is while it's not the best measure of in-stocks, it's a reasonable measure. and the tdp data that's in there shows that the last measure was like 778. if you take our acv that we have today and you multiply by the average number of skus we had in distribution at our peak last summer, we'd have to be at like 850 to be at the same place. and you can see the slope of the line is moving up at a fairly consistent rate.
so i'd expect you to take a look at that, and you could make your own projection. the thing that's tough is the tail end is always the hardest part to get. when you're getting into smaller skus that are in -- only in specific channels, those are always really the toughest parts of it. but it'll happen sometime in this quarter.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer & co. inc. -- analyst
great. thank you. i'll pass it along.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
thanks, rupesh.
operator
our next question comes from the line of bill chappell with truist securities. you may proceed with your question.
bill chappell -- truist securities-- analyst
thanks. good afternoon.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
hello, bill.
bill chappell -- truist securities-- analyst
hi, billy and scott. just kind of following up on rupesh's question. i don't fully understand, like why not be more aggressive with pricing? i mean, all your competitors are stepping up pricing. every cpg company is passing off pricing.
you have a potential where the price gaps go away with you in some of the premium, i guess, dry dog food players. and there certainly hasn't been any real elasticity. so i understand protecting your consumer and good to consumer and all that. but i mean, why not -- this is a window that's open.
why not be more aggressive right now?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
so, bill, as you know, we have very, very aggressive penetration growth goals. and that is really fundamental to us achieving our objectives in the next several years. so the single best thing that you can make sure you're doing -- and again, i'm looking across the portfolio. so there are items again -- we will not touch a couple of items because they're the most price-sensitive.
and there are some items where we have some opportunity. we have some -- they're fairly -- we have the opportunity to take some significant room there. we will be aggressive on those items. but over time, what we want to do is we want to build a really, really strong consumer franchise.
with many, many consumers coming into our brands, into our portfolio, we want to make sure that there are items where there are features and benefits that people are comfortable and willing to pay for. and we want to go over time from a business of know-how and a business of capital investments early on to a business of scale and a really large consumer portfolio. and we feel that -- we're going to -- i mean, we put out a letter. it's going to be the most aggressive price increase we've taken in potentially ever across the entire line, but it will not be -- we're not -- our goal is not to try and get every single thing we could get.
our goal is to make sure we get what we need and to make sure that we're -- keeping us as available as possible for as many consumers as possible.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
yes. bill, let me just add to that that i don't think we've disclosed yet what the magnitude of the price increase is. so in terms of your question about are we being aggressive enough, there's two sides. there's -- one is the size of it and the second is the pricing -- the timing.
now on the size part, we haven't disclosed that. it's out with our customers. the second part is that on the timing, many of our customers require 90-day advanced notice on a price increase and so practically speaking, you won't see it until 90 days down the road. we also disclosed that we're doing erp conversion on november 1, which -- everybody always talks about those potentially creating some disruptions in the business.
so we want to get that behind us before we got in a position where we're doing the pricing. but the reality is the price increases will -- we'll get the full benefit of the price increases in next year.
bill chappell -- truist securities-- analyst
and just to be clear, you don't see nearing a price ceiling at this point?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
no.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
we don't see a ceiling pricing, no.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
not at all.
bill chappell -- truist securities-- analyst
ok. and then just one other question to you, heather, if that helps. so has there been a meaningful change in time -- in terms of the ennis or even kitchens south to kind of cost to completion or labor or potential that can add? it certainly -- construction costs have skyrocketed over the past few months but also with labor and just trying to find labor. have your calculations changed meaningfully over the past -- since you've really talked about it a few months ago?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
no. no change, bill, to our plans. the team was very proactive in terms of being able to secure materials ahead, had good foresight there. so no risk in terms of ennis phase 1 timeline at all with respect to materials or construction.
and in terms of labor, same thing. actually, the market there is a little bit better than the labor market in ennis, a little bit better than what we see in pennsylvania. and so as they start thinking ahead about having the right labor in place for the commissioning, we're -- as you heard billy talk about in our comments, we're well ahead, already hiring staff to start training. so in good shape there as well.
bill chappell -- truist securities-- analyst
great.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
yes. and, bill, the biggest piece on this change is the labor -- second wage increase that we're taking in, in our labor -- in our facilities here in bethlehem, which will be effective on 9/1. we did one in may. we're doing a second one here.
that's the big cost increase that we're seeing.
bill chappell -- truist securities-- analyst
got it. thanks for the color. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of mark astrachan with stifel. you may proceed with your question.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. i guess a couple of questions for you. one, just more point of clarification. so anything in the guidance, in the 445 -- or at least 445 million that is related to inventory fills that would have been different than what you were expecting on the last quarter? meaning that we're trying to figure out how to think about kind of the apples-to-apples sales growth.
so any change there in terms of what's embedded? and then second question is maybe a broader question, but you've had some time to reflect on out-of-stocks at this point. obviously, still not completely resolved, but more than it's been. any impact on the business as best you can tell? any impact from a retailer perspective, from a consumer perspective? one of the things that i've been hit on more than a few times by, i call it, concerned folks, i guess, is, ""hey, are we seeing any impact on demand here because scanner data is slowing?"" obviously, the comparisons are what they are. but anything you can do to discuss that, i think, would be helpful.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
yes. let me take the first part of that, and i'll ask scott to talk about the impact this has had on the -- anything related to our customers. but as i said in the scripted comments at the beginning, the size of the trade inventory hole has come out to be larger than what we thought. and while we don't have a precise number that we are putting in there versus what we've been saying before, i would suspect that the number that you're seeing is probably at least 5 million bigger than what we had previously outlined.
so when we gave our guidance at greater than 445, we did reflect on that. but the reality is that the slope of the line that we're seeing on coming -- of consumption in the nielsen data we're seeing is pretty much right on where we thought it would be. in fact, we have a chart in the deck that kind of shows you where that's falling at this point. and so it -- people who have been talking about slowing growth, i remind them that i've been telling them that this is what it was going to look like for quite some time just because of what happened in the year-ago and the odd dynamics of the year ago.
but the line is falling exactly where we thought it would be, and that's why we feel very comfortable taking the guidance up, and the trade inventory hole is a little bit larger. from a consumer perspective, you'll also see that the household penetration gains slowed in the quarter versus what our long-term run rate is. we do think that out-of-stocks played a significant role in that. we're now about a year of consumers struggling to find the item they wanted.
so clearly, we're not getting the conversion from the advertising to the household penetration because of it. but it also exposed or revealed again that when you aren't diluting your household penetration gains with significant numbers of new users that the buying rate goes through the roof. and so we had the strongest buying rate growth we've had in as long as i've been here. so i think at the end of the day, we have seen this before, that when you do have shortages like this, the penetration gains bounce back.
and so we're not concerned by it. and the mix of buying rate and penetration will probably swing back to penetration beginning in the fourth quarter of this year and continuing throughout next year. i don't know, scott, do you want to talk about the customer impact of the out-of-stocks? scott? is scott there? i guess not. scott must have dropped.
so anyway, i guess i would say that the customer feedback that we're getting is obviously, they're as frustrated as we are by the shortages. and at this point, we've communicated very aggressively with them what our plans are. and we expect that they are all waiting to see improvements in our position -- inventory position before we start putting in more fridges. but they know this is the segment to be in.
they know this is where the category is going.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
great. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of ken goldman with j.p. morgan. you may proceed with your question.
ken goldman -- jp morgan -- analyst
hi. thank you. two for me. heather, did you mention, and perhaps i missed it, how much trade inventory you're modeling in the back half of the year and what the timing of that might be between the two quarters in terms of refill?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
no. we touched on the q2 refill being $8 million. we didn't touch on -- because we don't know the full magnitude of the number, ken. so we didn't touch on a specific number for the back half with respect to that.
but we do anticipate some continued trade refill in the back half.
ken goldman -- jp morgan -- analyst
ok. but with a follow-up to that, i guess, what are you modeling in? are you modeling in a number that you think is beatable there or is conservative? because i'm just trying to get a sense, because you did raise your guidance, how much of that guidance raise was because of an expectation for increased, i guess, pipeline fill, for lack of a better phrase.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
i guess -- let me take that, ken. first of all, i think it will be skewed more to q3 than it is q4 where they -- because we're still refilling it as we speak. and we expect it to be done by the end of q3. and at the same time, we also said in the comments that q4 will be bigger than q3.
if you recall, last year, q4 and q3 were about the same size. but we think q4 will be bigger because of the heavier marketing investment that we have this year. we also have the available supply this year in q4 because we're bringing on that second line of kitchen south that comes on in september in addition to the capacity that we already have online. so when we gave the guidance at $445 million, we had a pretty good handle on where the consumption line was headed, and we also had a sense for how much of the trade inventory refills happened in q2, what we think will happen in q3.
and we're quite comfortable with the guide we gave being the sum of those two, and we'll be in excess of $445 million.
ken goldman -- jp morgan -- analyst
ok. thank you. and then quickly, you've raised your outlook for sales, obviously. you've also raised your outlook for capacity in the back half of the year.
is it fair to say that these factors are unrelated? i would assume so because your second-half shipments will still be well above your -- i think your theoretical capacity. i just wanted to make sure that it's more demand- and pull-driven and not push.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
yes. i mean, without a doubt. there's nothing that's changed about the way we generate demand. frankly, what we were updating is what we actually think those pieces of equipment can get and what our staffing will get.
as you heard, it's a rather dynamic staffing environment for us, and we've been finding ways to move our staffing around and also attract staffing that gives us a higher degree of confidence in our ability to produce the revenues that we included in the chart that you're referring to in the deck. but it is not at all driven by a push. it's all being driven by our efforts to secure the maximum supply. frankly, we've been so frustrated, ken, by our ability to get caught up.
and frankly, our customers have a reason to be frustrated as well. and this is not looking for every way in which we can get more productivity out, and we think we found some pretty good ways. we said before, too, that kitchens 2 is turning out to be more productive than we had expected. the capacity on that operation is remarkably good.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
and to actually extend that a tiny bit further, and sorry i dropped off a moment ago, folks, but capacity has been and will be probably the single biggest limiter that we have for a very long period of time.
ken goldman -- jp morgan -- analyst
understood. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of peter benedict with baird. you may proceed with your question.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
all right, guys. thanks. first, just on the increase in the revenue plan for this year. just curious if the addition of chewy played a role there or if you guys had always kind of had something in there for chewy on the initial guidance? that's my first question.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
we always had it in there.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
ok. understood. yes. and then i guess can you -- i know you're not going to frame now the magnitude of the price increase.
how about just on the wages, if you think about the two that you all have taken, can you give us a sense for how much wages may have gone up versus 2020 to 2020 level, i guess, as we look for all of this year?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
well, i'll just talk about it in terms of what the hourly wage is done. i don't want to go into the specifics of the total at this point. we might find another way to have a conversation about that. but our regular wage increase after we did some normal sensing back in may was a 3% increase.
and we realized that that was not going to get us to where we wanted to get to. so the increase that we're taking in september is much more sizable than that. it varies by level in the organization, but the headline number would be a 20% increase.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
and, peter, i think the other way to think about that is we are trying to kind of go back to principles on how we operate and think about like the business. and we believe this is a real significant investment in our company. and because we want the best quality, we want the most efficiency, we want the most effective lines possible. and quite honestly, just growth requires us to get more out of our lines, but also there are more people.
and could you imagine, if you were adding to your team and someone came in and they were there for a week, a month, three months, six months, and then they left, and you have to start over again and again? it puts a strain on the rest of the team. so we're trying to like really create a completely different approach to this and really invest in kind of the vision of where we're going.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
yes. no, it makes sense, scott. smart move and -- but no, it makes a lot of sense. so they feel -- you said dynamic staffing environment.
dynamic is an understatement. my last question is just about with the households that are being added, the millennial and the gen z households. just curious, remind us kind of what products maybe they're gravitating to any differently than maybe your legacy customers and how that maybe influences your innovation plans for the next few years. just curious how that's trending.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes. actually, that's an important question. there's some interesting data that's actually out there at this point. so it looks like more pets were added last year than any year that we've been able to kind of track back and look at.
of the pets -- so that's about -- it was about a 5% increase. it's usually like 2% increase in pets. it was like about a 5% increase. so the number that's been thrown around, 7 million more cats and dogs, right, that are kind of now with consumers versus in shelters or whatever.
of those, the biggest group that acquired pets, which logically, right, it was millennial and gen z. and also, that group is willing to spend more on pet products, and they're also more thoughtful about the products that they want. so this is kind of exactly what you're talking about. when we look across our portfolio and we think about how we're doing -- first of all, we well over-indexed with millennial and gen z.
so we really think we're a key piece of how pet foods should shape into the future. in addition to that, we're taking one of our brands. it's called nature's fresh. it's been in the natural channel.
and we are taking that brand, and we're doing every single thing we can to position that very specifically to win against millennial and gen z. it's always been g.a.p.-rated meats. i don't want to get into too long an answer. we'll talk more about it at the sustainability summit.
but it's g.a.p.-rated meats. it's actually carbon-neutral now. it's one of the first carbon-neutral pet brands out there and the largest as far as we can tell. so we've really taken a different approach.
you'll see a lot of work we're doing on overall the brand, how we're talking about it, communicating it, packaging, formulation, etc. and then finally, one of the things that we're doing where we think there's tremendous opportunity over time, we've mentioned it in the past, but we're going to -- we're launching this product called spring & sprout. it should start shipping like right in the next couple of weeks. i haven't seen it on shelves yet anywhere.
but we've announced this in the past. it is a plant-based meat product. it's a terrific product. we're really, really excited about it.
and it really addresses both ethics and meat but also environmental concerns around proteins. and we think that's going to be an important product, an important addition to the portfolio that we're building out over time that's focused on the kind of younger consumers.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird & co. -- analyst
ok, great. thanks so much for that.
operator
our next question comes from the line of steph wissink with jefferies. you may proceed with your question.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, everyone. we have two questions if we could. heather, i think this one may be best suited for you, but it's related to the one line per quarter addition in capacity.
if you could just help us think through the stairstep of how much revenue value each line could add as we think about the next six to eight quarters or so.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sure. so yes, actually, in the accompanying presentation, there's a chart that shows that continued ramp-up. but when you think about where we are headed versus the end of this year, we're adding the one line -- one additional line in kitchen south, which brings the installed revenue capacity by the end of this year to $760 million. so that's sort of the first phase of the project.
as we enter next year, we have an additional line at kitchen south that will come on actually in the beginning of q1, and that line will have revenue capacity of about $50 million. and it starts to ramp up. so starting in beginning of q2 and then each q3 and q4 will have each of the ennis lines coming on -- ennis phase 1 line coming on board with a total of $400 million by the end of 2022 in ennis. and at the same time, we'll be working on our kitchen south building 2 project.
the plan on that project is to install three lines over the course of 2023 with revenue worth about $300 million. there's some variables to those numbers. and the key is that we have new technology that we're testing. and so depending on that new technology, kitchen south phase 2 -- building 2, as well as the second phase of ennis, could be impacted with incremental revenue potential, depending on the actual outcome of the new technology.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. that's very helpful. and then just one follow-up on pricing. i just wanted to decompartmentalize the two drivers, the labor inflation being one reason to take price.
the other you mentioned was shipping inefficiencies. and heather, maybe just to talk a little bit more about the temporary nature of that. i think you mentioned as the back half progresses and as you gain efficiency, the inefficiency burden on gross margin would start to mitigate. so just wanting to understand a little bit about, are you taking price to cover both? and then once those inefficiencies roll off, you'll see a little bit of margin benefit? or do you expect this to just cover the ongoing shipping inefficiencies you anticipate in the business?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes. so i'll just describe first the inefficiencies. there's two elements of inefficiencies: one that impacts gross margin; the other that impact sg&a, where the logistics costs are in our p&l. but what emerged in q2, we described, is some temporary processing inefficiencies or temporary operating inefficiencies.
as we've been ramping up the new lines in plant 2, as you would expect, with new staff, some of those sort of getting the kinks out as you're ramping up sort of exceeded expectations. and we do have many new folks that are coming into that facility. and so there's a lot of training and learning curve that have to happen there. those inefficiencies, we expect actually by the end of this year to be self-resolved in plant 2.
the other inefficiency is in freight that we've been talking about since the beginning of the year, where our systems don't allow us to allocate inventory to orders, and transportation is planned because our fill rates are so low with a much larger expectation than has actually shipped. and so that inefficiency also -- two things will happen. one, as we improve our inventory position and have improved fill rates, that will self-resolve. but we also are building the capability to allocate inventory into our new erp.
and so that will -- by november, that particular issue will be resolved. our pricing plans are, looking ahead, are focused on where we expect inflation to be headed into next year. and obviously, there's a few variables to that. but at this point, it's really to offset the anticipated inflation, as scott mentioned earlier.
and we'll see where that lands up as we -- the big variable, of course, for us will be chicken and where we lock that pricing at the end of this year.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
and, steph, i'd add that we think that some of our cost increases are, as heather described in sort of our temporary inefficiencies. and we're not pricing for those because we think those are going to go away. what we're pricing for is the inflation that we think is not going to go away, which is basically the inflation that's due to labor, both our own internal labor, as well as the labor at some of our suppliers. and they're going to start passing that labor cost on to us, and we're already seeing it this year.
and so anything that has the labor component that's driving inflation, we have to price to cover that. but if it's our own temporary inefficiencies, we're not pricing for that. we're going to get the efficiency gains from our operations, as we've described it in the past, both from scale, as well as from moving to the more efficient lines that we've got. and then also diversifying our shipping to a second shipping point, those kinds of things are going to get us the efficiencies that we need to drive the margin.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
that's very helpful. thank you.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
thanks.

our next question comes from the line of jon andersen with william blair. you may proceed with your question.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
hi. excuse me. good afternoon, everybody.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
hello there.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
my first question is on chewy and, i guess, multifaceted. i'm curious how you think the addition of chewy will help -- to what extent will accelerate your e-commerce business and where you think e-commerce goes as a percentage of sales over the next couple of years. and then where do you think the biggest benefit will be derived? is this a household acquisition tool? is it a buy rate enhancer or some combination of both?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
so, hey, jon. it's scott. so we touched a little bit on this. we had a couple of discussions where we've touched a tiny bit on this.
but look, we think that if you broadly look at where we are today, we recognize there are definitely a group of consumers that want to be able to get products delivered to their homes in some way. right now, we have a handful of ways that you can do it. you can do the click on -- click and pick, the buy online, pick up in store. there are a handful of services.
we think that the partnership with chewy makes a lot of sense for both companies. we're really excited about it. i believe, personally, that over time, what will happen is that this will -- i think as consumers get into a regular cadence, i think that it will not only provide an opportunity for consumers that want convenience but also consumers that want a consistent cadence. so i think it will give us a great opportunity to expand buying rate over time.
so with respect to the specifics around that, we don't know. we're two weeks, three weeks into launch. it's super early. they're great partners.
they seem like -- it seems like it's going to be a great partnership and relationship over time. i don't know how it shapes, but the research we have done demonstrates that it will both open up penetration and buying rate over time. and i think there is a ton of potential there.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
ok. and have you structured your kind of the product offering and your pricing in a way that makes you channel-agnostic across the portfolio at this point?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes, we have. and it's -- one of the things like -- and i know like everyone's thinking -- like scott mentioned principles and values like multiple times here. but one of the things we have done like, and i'm serious about it, like every time i do everything, like anything we do, i really look and go, how does everyone win from this activity, right? how does the consumer win? how do our partners win, all of our partners win? how does freshpet win? and if we can't construct a way that everyone wins, we are very, very -- we just won't do it. and we're super fortunate.
we have more potential. we have tons and tons of potential, and we have so much opportunity for growth that we want to be really kind of thoughtful in the way we're constructing our business, our portfolio, who are the partners that we're working with, etc. so yes, we are agnostic, if you want to talk about it that way. but i mean, every different customer, every different channel brings different benefits.
they have different types of consumers. and we're making sure that we're kind of developing a portfolio that best meets with that consumer and what that customer is looking for.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. one quick follow-up. in the prepared comments, someone -- i think maybe billy mentioned expecting more stores and second fridges next year with supply conditions better, in-store merchandising conditions improved.
could you add a little bit more color to that? maybe it's too early to think that way, but you're up low to mid-single digits in store count in the first half of this year. do we see acceleration off of that in 2022 given the commentary? thanks.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
so yes, it's another -- it's an important question. i mean, keep in mind that the vast majority of our growth comes from penetration, which is behind our marketing advertising. that's really what -- that drives 80% plus of the growth for the business. back to the store piece, it is obviously really important.
the thing that makes our marketing more effective is the widening availability. it makes it more accessible, more convenient, and more stores. and then even the second coolers, the productivity of the second coolers has been extraordinary. the problem is we got to keep them full.
that's been our biggest trick. but adding second coolers into productive stores is really, really powerful. so the way i look at this is, rightfully so, the conversations we're having with our partners are very centered around, hey, we don't have enough product. so there has been some hesitancy to add lots of coolers.
but look, we're having a great year, like we're progressing nicely. there's a lot of second coolers that have been added. you can -- it's page 26 in the powerpoint. so we're making really nice progress.
but there are some people that are kind of slow walking. and as we have more product next year, we think that -- like we think everybody has figured this out in the last 18 months, 24 months. look at the size of freshpet, look at the consistent year-on-year growth of freshpet, look at the same-store sales growth of freshpet, look at the stickiness of the consumers that it brings in. so i think people that haven't been awakened to the potential of what freshpet can do for the category -- i think we're really there.
and i think it's going to create a tremendous opportunity for us. like we're definitely not ready -- we got to finish this year. we're definitely not ready to give numbers. but i think it's really -- it's been really encouraging.
don't know what the numbers look like next year. but it's been encouraging, and we should see, i would say, a good year on that. but going back to the first point, the vast majority of it is penetration and advertising base. we should be spending more dollars than ever next year in advertising, and that should drive velocity -- penetration, velocity, and overall revenue growth.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
thanks so much.

our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. you may proceed with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
scott, i'm glad that you've devised a win-win system for your customers and everyone. i wish you worked in the auto industry. it might help out my family quite a bit. but right now, what we know is --
scott morris -- chief operating officer
my next project.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
yes. we need to get you where you can help us out more. so i had a question on slide 17, actually. you provide your fill rates going back, i guess, this is several quarters.
and i guess what's noticeable to me is it looks like it doesn't get much past 65%. and you have a trend line moving up and to the right. a couple of questions. are these yellow dots -- is the most recent one the one on the farthest to the right? or is it somewhere else? like what was your fill rate in the quarter? and if your fill rates are kind of in this 40% to 65% range for what looks like a pretty long period, is it possible that this might be part of the nature of the business, that there's just a -- that there might be something intrinsically difficult about keeping these fringes full given the multiple steps to get product into them? just a question.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
rob, i think you're referring to the slide that says as we build inventory, fill rates go up. is that the one you're referring to?
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
yes. yes, that's the one.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
so that is data that -- the slide we used last quarter. it's not the recent -- the most recent data. we're using it to demonstrate the point. but the reality is we've operated the fill rates that were in the 90-plus percent for quite a long time until we got into covid.
so it's not -- there's nothing about this business model that keeps you from getting to full trucks. and in fact, with the new erp system, we'll be able to allocate the orders -- the inventory to the orders and we'll be able to get to full trucks. the other part of it is getting the fridges full. and what we're finding is, and it's not surprising, is that the higher the velocity of the business, the better the fridge conditions are because the stores then have more reasons, more incentive, more reminder to keep filling the fridges.
so some of our best-filled fridges are in the highest-velocity stores. so it's a learning curve when you are low volume and low velocity to get fridges full. but as you get to be a more important part of the store's volume and a more important habit, the fridges look better. 
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. but so what do those dots represent then, billy? are those quarterly results or monthly results? or what are they?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
they're just observations.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
yes.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes. it's showing the correlation of the -- one on the left is the correlation of the fill rate with our -- with inventory levels. and so you see as inventory levels are improving, the fill rate improves. and then on the right, the chart there is showing the direct correlation that we have where the cost per pound is -- goes down as the fill rate improves.
and so it's not a period of time. it's more the link of those two factors with fill rate.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
but each data point gives an instance within a day or a week?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
right. yes, yes.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. so they're very short time. ok. now i got it.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
so basically, i mean, the fuller the truck, the more cost-effective it is.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
i got you now. ok. and then a follow-up then. you talked about the erp transition in november.
it seems like a lot is happening all at once. how much inventory do you need to build up to give you cushion during that transition? because it seems like inventory is still not where you want it to be.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
yes. so i think it is -- when we do the conversion, we'll have to shut down the operation for a couple of days to implement the system, do the testing, the training, and whatnot. and we're taking advantage of that downtime to actually upgrade some equipment on one of our lines. but how much inventory you have to build? i mean, ideally, you would be in a position where you could continue to ship your orders during that time period with a high fill rate.
we think that full inventory on our business is somewhere between four and five weeks of inventory. that sounds like a lot for a fresh products business, but you have the range of brands and skus that we have across the portfolio. so you need to have about four to five weeks of inventory. today, it depends on what day you're looking at, but we probably have about two to two and a half weeks of inventory.
but we're producing -- as you saw in the other charts, we're producing well in excess of demand every week and well in excess of consumption every week. so we're building both our inventory and the trade inventory as this goes. so we should be good.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
hey, rob. and the other thing to think about is -- and i'm not minimizing it because they're big things. there is a lot going on, but we've been doing -- like there's a group of 40 people here that literally started the company, right, that started -- we all started together pretty much in the very beginning. so every three years or less, we doubled the size of the company since 2006.
so now the numbers are getting bigger and -- but we brought in like smarter people, right? bill and heather are on the phone. and i'm just focusing on the win-win-win. but in all seriousness, there's always been a lot going on. and we're not -- by no means were we perfect, but we've been able to manage a lot of it really, really well.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. all right, thank you.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
thanks.

our final question comes from the line of ryan bell with consumer edge research. you may proceed with your question.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
hi. regarding the household dynamics, you said you're seeing a slowing in household penetration sort of relative to the expectations and the higher buy rate. is the primary driver of that, that increased buy rates, is coming from just having more long-term users and fewer new buyers coming in that would dilute the buy rate? or is there something else maybe that are some of the new users that are saying -- are also buying at higher rates?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
well, you saw in the data we published earlier this year, the first part is yes. when you aren't diluting to buy the existing buyers as much, the buying rate goes up. so there's no doubt about that. and next year, with scott's enormous new marketing budget, if we start posting 30-plus percent increases in penetration, you should expect the buying rate to go down, not go up.
it's just the way the math could end up working. but there is a longer-term phenomenon that's going on, which is that we've seen each cohort that entered the franchise over the last five years started at a higher level of purchasing than it -- than the cohort that came in the year before them. so they are coming in with -- they're buying higher-value items, higher price per pound items. they're buying more of them.
they're using the product more frequently or more regularly. so we're seeing that phenomenon. there's also the likelihood there's some amount of consumer hoarding that's going on as consumers found there's a scarcity of the freshpet product they wanted. so they went in the store.
they bought it. and what that does is it gives the buying rate for some user -- lucky user found it goes up, and the penetration for the other guy goes down because they couldn't find anything. i think that's small, but it is real.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
that's helpful. and about the specialty channel, do you think that that's going to continue to deliver outsized growth? and regarding the two-year relationship, i know it's been early, but have you found anything in terms of how that's impacted your existing e-commerce user base?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
scott, do you want to take those two?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes. so on the pet specialty piece, so i don't know if you caught it earlier, but one of the things that we're definitely seeing is a lot of new consumers, very heavy millennial, gen z, they think about shopping differently and where they're shopping, how they're shopping, the types of food that they want to buy. we think that this is a trend that's driving pet specialty in general. like if you look at their numbers overall across the board in food, they're up.
they're doing nicely. and if you look at our numbers, they're nothing short of extraordinary. we think that there's like a pretty long road in front of this. in addition to that kind of that secular trend, we've also added a lot of second coolers in many of these stores, which allows for a broader product portfolio and hopefully, in many cases, a little bit more product, which makes it more available.
so we continue to -- we expect to continue to see really strong growth rates in pet for a pretty long period of time. i don't know how long, but i think it will be for quite a while. again, we're very excited about the chewy partnership. the relationship, we think there's a lot of potential there.
it's super early, and we don't -- we won't get into the specifics of dynamics between customers, etc. we just don't get into that level of data. but even if we were going to do that, it's way early, way early.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
thanks. and the last one for me, in terms of the freight cost impact that's being driven by some of the issues with the existing erp system, is there a way to give the magnitude of that actual impact that we would expect to be going away?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes. so as you heard, we talked about the freight as a percent of net sales at 11% for the quarter versus 7.8% last year. we do have freight inflation in the first half of about 10%. the way that it splits out in terms of the inflation versus the fill rate inefficiency, about 100 basis points comes from the inflation in the first half, and the balance of it is coming from the fill rate issues.
so depending on the quarter, it's somewhere between 150 to 200 basis points of an impact.
ryan bell -- consumer edge research -- analyst
thanks. that's very helpful. and that was it for me. thank you so much.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director

bill cyr -- chief executive officer and director
thank you, jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. i want to start by giving you the punchline upfront. our net sales continued to grow strongly, up 36% in the quarter. so we are raising our net sales guidance for the year.
we are now projecting that we will end the year with greater than $445 million in net sales, resulting in a growth rate of 40% for the year and a second-half growth rate of 44%. we are not, however, raising our adjusted ebitda guidance for the year as we'll use the incremental contribution produced by the higher net sales to offset some inflation and temporary operating inefficiencies we have experienced. we've announced that we will take pricing to cover those incremental costs later this year, but it won't have much impact until next year. we believe this is a balanced and reasonable approach to creating the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.
we are able to raise our net sales guidance because we've been very successful at ramping up our production, producing 44% more pounds in the quarter than we did a year ago. this enabled us to generate 36% more in net sales than the year-ago quarter while also beginning to restore our in-house inventory, adding approximately $5 million of net sales value of finished product inventory to our quarter-end inventory versus where we began the quarter. in the challenging labor market in which we are operating, that is a significant achievement for our manufacturing and hr teams. and as you will hear in a few minutes, we are taking an even more aggressive approach to our labor strategy with the goal of creating a strong, stable workforce with a distinctive career offering for our employees that will enable them to build more skills, add more value and share in the benefits of that added value.
our strong production performance is enabling us to refill the trade inventory that we had drawn down during the back half of 2020 and satisfy our customers and consumers with much better in-stock conditions. but we are still not done refilling the trade inventory. frankly, the depth of the trade inventory hole we had dug during the back half of 2020 was deeper than we had expected, and our efforts were compounded by additional obstacles downstream from our manufacturing operations in a third-party warehouse and logistics network we use. we and our logistics partners have moved quickly to resolve those issues.
but in today's tight labor market, the changes they are making will take a bit of time to fully resolve the issues. despite all those challenges, most consumers can find a wide variety of freshpet items in most stores at this point, but we still have work to do on filling out the complete assortment of skus. we are on our way, however, and our strong production performance is enabling us to rebuild our internal inventories so that we can better service our customers. as we look forward, we will post sizable gains in net sales each quarter for the balance of the year.
we anticipate that q3 and q4 reported growth will be in excess of the consumption growth rate as consumers will be able to find the items they are looking for more readily than they did a year ago. and we have a much heavier marketing investment plan for the back half of this year. that will allow us to deliver net sales growth in excess of 40% during the back half of the year and also set us up for a fast start next year. our capacity expansion plans to support that growth are on track.
we are now running the bag line in kitchens 2.0 24/7, and we'll take the rolls line in that facility to 24/7 in august. we'll be moving staffing from kitchens 1.0 to kitchens 2.0 for the ramp-up of the rolls line as the higher throughput on the lines in kitchens 2.0 make it a better use of our staffing than to have them work in kitchens 1.0. in september, we'll be starting up our second line at kitchen south with a 2-shift operation. and in january, we will start up a third line at kitchen south.
that line will also be our first test of the new cooking technology that, if successful, would allow us to produce twice as much product in a significantly smaller footprint. if that plays out the way we expect it to, it will form the foundation for ennis phase 2 and for the second building at kitchen south. finally, our construction project in ennis, texas remains on track, and we anticipate starting up our first line there in q2 of 2022. we hope to be under roof next month, which is an important milestone as it will substantially mitigate weather risk through the completion of the project.
it has been a very rainy first half of the year in ennis, but our team has still managed to get quite a bit done. additionally, we have already begun hiring team members for the ennis facility and are quite pleased with our ability to attract the talent we need. the first 10 ennis employees arrived in bethlehem in late june to begin training on our lines and will spend several months here getting operating experience. we have at least two more waves of employees who will arrive in bethlehem in the coming months.
by the time we start up the ennis kitchen, we expect to have approximately 50 experienced employees to lead the start-up between those who choose to transfer from pa to texas and those who did several months of training in pa. that will greatly reduce our start-up risk. we expect to bring on all three lines in ennis by the end of 2022, and we'll have our first line in kitchen south building 2 ready to go in q1 of 2023. in total, we'll be starting up at least one new line per quarter until q4 of 2023.
that will be eight consecutive quarters with a new line. we'll make a decision on the construction of the second phase of ennis sometime in the next six to nine months but have already done some site preparation work there so that we are ready once the decision is made on when to build it and what technology we will install there. we believe there is ample demand to support this planned capacity expansion. despite our out-of-stocks and delayed start to marketing this year, we still grew household penetration by 19% in the second quarter, and the buying rate grew at a very high rate of 12%.
as we have said many times, there is strong underlying growth in the buying rate for freshpet when it is not being diluted by so many new users. because of our delayed start to the marketing this year and the out-of-stocks, the household penetration growth was below our long-term growth rate in the quarter, but that simply exposed the underlying strength in the buying rate. we expect household penetration gains to reaccelerate in the coming months as we ramp up our marketing investment. the consumption growth was broad-based but was particularly strong in pet specialty, where it was up 57%.
our e-commerce business grew strongly again this quarter, up 46% versus a very strong quarter a year ago and accounting for 5.6% of our total sales in the quarter. the launch of chewy.com occurred in early july, so that is not reflected in these numbers. it's still too early to make any meaningful comments on the impact that chewy might have on our business, but we are encouraged by the potential. store count grew by 265 in the quarter, and we remain on track for our projected 1,000-store increase this year.
we also saw meaningful increases in second fridges and upgrades despite our supply limitations and have now exceeded our guidance for the year in both categories. second fridges grew by 510 stores to 3,108, and we upgraded 324 more stores and have now completed 3,003 upgrades cumulatively since we started the program. we are also anticipating significant increases in stores and second fridges next year based on our increased supply and rapid growth. our international business grew 48% in the quarter with strong growth in both the u.k.
and canada and has real momentum. clearly, the freshpet model is working outside the u.s. i want to briefly comment on the cost environment, and heather will provide more color on it in her comments. overall, we are seeing broad-scale inflation that is no different than what you're hearing in reports from other cpg companies.
some of the increased costs are clearly permanent, and others may be more cyclical. in either case, they will have an impact on our profitability this year, and that is why we are not raising our adjusted ebitda in line with our net sales growth. last week, we announced to our customers that we'll be taking price increases late this year. those increases are designed to cover the inflation we are seeing today and that we expect to see when our fixed price contracts end later this year.
it's also intended to cover the significant increase in labor costs we are seeing in the market. our price increases will be very noticeable to consumers because we don't do any merchandising, thus we can't reduce that. and we believe that downsizing our packages will be disruptive to consumers who expect a bag or roll to feed their pet for a set number of days. as such, we are being very thoughtful about the price increases we are taking, considering the strategic role of each item in our line, the underlying profitability, and the anticipated cost increases we are seeing.
we have a successful track record of doing this before and are comfortable doing it again. i also want to comment on one important aspect of the inflation we are seeing: labor costs. many of our suppliers are having to pay higher costs for their labor and are passing those costs on to us under the terms of our agreements with them. we also raised our wage rates earlier this year, in line with our normal annual practice.
but in light of the environment we are operating in, it is clearly not enough. so we will be raising wages the second time later this year. in doing that, we are mindful of the competitive market for labor and seek to be competitive with other employers, but our new wage program is driven by a different philosophy. we are driven by the idea that our dedicated team members deserve to have the opportunity to earn a wage that will enable them to support their families comfortably while also providing them with long-term career growth opportunities.
but it must also deliver a good return for freshpet. we are not seeking the minimum wage we can pay to get the job done. we want to create a win-win for our team members and our shareholders. that is why we treat our team members as owners and partners with us in the development of the freshpet business.
that is the people part of our pets, people, planet philosophy. the key to creating that win-win is for us to invest in the training and skill development of our team members, enabling them to add greater value to our business, and thus, justifying the higher wages that we pay. while many employers and much of the public communication is focused on the entry-level wage, our focus is on the wage we pay to those employees who are contributing at a higher level. the heavily advertised and promoted wage rates are only what you pay to get someone into your lobby from interview.
if that is where our employees' career and wage progress ends, we will have failed, and they will leave. our goal is to quickly advance their skills and ability to contribute so that we can provide them with a much higher wage. in fact, our typical production employee will see their hourly wage go up by about $2 per hour within the first six months as they progress through our freshpet academy training program and up by another $3.50 per hour within nine months after that. at that level, a typical employee who has a working spouse and up to three kids at home will be earning a wage that comfortably supports their family and significantly more than the advertised wage rates you see from many other employers.
we believe that approach delivers a significantly better return for freshpet. a highly skilled worker is dramatically more productive than an entry-level employee, justifying both the investment in their training and the wages we pay them. we also know that it is not enough to pay good wages and have good benefits. we have to treat our employees well every day.
those of you who have been to our freshpet kitchens have seen many of the things we do to make working on a cold, wet environment more comfortable. we also grant stock to every employee each year after they've been with us for at least one year. that drives the ownership mindset we seek to create. all of this is not easy to accomplish, particularly in the current environment.
challenges with child care, perceived health risks, government stimulus and an overall competitive environment for entry-level talent is particularly challenging for a company that is growing as fast as we are. we constantly need to hire and train more new employees, and the kind of work we do is not for everyone. so we have invested heavily in our recruiting team and in our training department over the past year, and we'll continue to do more. and we are starting early with our recruiting and training of the team who will start up our facility in ennis.
in total, we believe this is the right approach for freshpet and will differentiate us as an employer. finally, we will be releasing our inaugural sustainability report in about one week. we are a young company, but sustainability has been embedded in our culture since our founding. what we haven't done in the past is document our progress nor set explicit targets for our efforts.
we just did what seem like the right thing for pets, people, and planet. we realize that our investors are expecting more from us, and our sustainability report is designed to address that interest. now let me turn it over to heather for a more detailed look at our results.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
thank you, billy, and good afternoon, everyone. as billy indicated, net sales for q2 of 2021 were $108.6 million, up 36% versus a year ago. actual nielsen mega channel consumption was up 37% versus the depressed year-ago period, which was the post-covid trough. the year-ago period also included significant trade inventory refill behind the q1 2020 covid surge.
so the base-year net sales were significantly in excess of consumption. we did the same thing this year, refilling about $8 million of trade inventory, thanks to the very strong production performance. we also built our own inventory a bit during the quarter, which has helped us improve customer service on some lower-volume skus that are produced less frequently and where our service had been particularly poor. a reconciliation of the nielsen consumption to this quarter's net sales can be found in the accompanying presentation on our investor relations website.
the growth in the quarter continued to be led by strong performance in the pet specialty channel, with nielsen-measured big-box pet specialty consumption up 57% in the quarter. our e-commerce business also performed well, growing 46% in the quarter, and now accounts for 5.6% of sales. as billy indicated, that does not include any sales through chewy.com as that service did not begin until july. additionally, our international business grew 48% in the quarter, and we continue to see strong momentum in those markets behind the advertising investments we have been making.
adjusted ebitda for q2 was $10.9 million, down 2.9% versus the year ago. the underperformance on adjusted ebitda traces to both inflation and some temporary inefficiencies that we have described previously, largely in freight. freight costs were 11% of net sales for the second quarter versus 7.8% in the year-ago. a portion of this is due to freight inflation, but a larger portion is due to the systems issue that we spoke to in the first quarter, which prevents us from being able to consolidate loads when we are shipping less than 100% of a customer's order.
that issue is created by both our relatively low inventory and also by the inability of our current system to allocate inventory to shipments prior to scheduling the transportation. i have included a chart in the accompanying presentation to remind you of the impact this has on our call. both increasing our available inventory and implementing our new erp system will eliminate this issue. the available inventory will gradually improve during q3, and the new system will be implemented in q4.
the freight inflation portion will be covered via other realized efficiencies as we scale and pricing. it is also important to note that in july, we opened our new dallas dc. we are shipping a small quantity of products from bethlehem to the dallas dc to do the necessary testing and preparation for the opening of ennis next year. we are only shipping to a very small number of customers in nearby markets during this test phase, but longer term, that dc will not only enable us to have lower freight costs in a large part of the u.s., but it will provide some insulation from the labor and weather issues we have experienced in our pennsylvania dc.
again, there won't be a near-term benefit on this, but i want you to appreciate our foresight to improve our logistics capabilities as we plan to seek -- to gain significant efficiencies going forward. the other cost issues came in cost of goods sold, where our gross margin was negatively impacted by inflation, mainly due to beef and corrugate and some of the temporary operating inefficiencies we have as we scale up production. as we add shifts, there was a learning curve for our team that results in lower shippable production per hour of operation until we get up to speed. this includes higher labor costs and excess disposals of product.
we added significant production in the quarter and are still adding production hours. so we expect a portion of this issue to continue, but it becomes a smaller portion of our total operation as we scale. adjusted gross margin in the quarter was 46.1%, down from 49.1% in the year-ago quarter for those reasons. as we look forward, we expect to see more inflation as suppliers pass on their higher labor costs and we increase wages again to ensure we are able to adequately staff our operations.
our announced price increase will cover those costs. however, the impact will not be felt until next year. media investment in the quarter was slightly above our long-term rate at 12.9% of net sales, in line with the year-ago. this year's media was skewed toward the back half of the quarter, so we did not get the full benefit of the investment in the quarter.
excluding the higher freight and lower media costs in the quarter, adjusted sg&a was down 200 basis points versus a year ago, giving us the confidence that our long-term road map toward 1,000 basis points of sg&a leverage by 2025 excluding media spend is on track. we incurred $700,000 in covid-related expenses in the quarter and have added those back. we expect to complete our covid add-back in q3 as we rolled back our covid incentives at the beginning of july and vaccines are broadly available. our net cash from operations was $2.9 million in the year-to-date period ended q2.
our cash from operations was impacted by accounts receivable and inventory working capital needs due to strong net sales growth and production in the last month of the quarter. our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $280 million. we spent $68.3 million in capex in the quarter. the ennis facility is entering some of its highest investment quarters as all the site preparation is complete, foundations have been poured and steel has been going up for four months now.
you can see a picture of the current state of the ennis construction in our supplemental presentation. additionally, the second line at kitchen south is on track to produce products by the end of q3, and the third line there will come online at the beginning of 2022. we are also taking advantage of the incremental capacity that is coming online to make some upgrades in our existing kitchens 1.0 and expect to have that work completed by the end of the year. that work will improve quality and reduce some of our labor costs on one of the existing lines.
to accomplish that, we have delayed our erp implementation by one month to november 1. this will allow us to synchronize the shutdown of the kitchen to both install new equipment and transition our systems at the same time, reducing the total downtime for our operations. turning to our guidance for 2021. as billy indicated, we are raising our net sales guidance by $50 million to an updated target of greater than $445 million to reflect the strong underlying trends in the business.
this guidance implies that 2021 will be our strongest year of growth since we went public in 2014 and also implies that our back-half growth will be in excess of 44%, setting us up with considerable momentum as we transition into 2022. the growth during the back half of this year will be in excess of the nielsen-measured consumption growth as the year-ago included a significant drawdown of trade inventory due to covid-related production shortfall. we do not expect to have those issues this year. the second-half growth will accelerate as we move toward the end of the year with q4 growth and net sales greater than q3, behind increased production capacity, strong q4 marketing, and a soft year-ago comparison.
we are not raising the adjusted ebitda guidance due to the inflationary pressures and temporary operating inefficiencies we discussed on this call. once we have increased pricing in place to address those issues at the end of this year, we expect to, once again, see the leverage we get from scale show up in accelerating adjusted ebitda margin. in particular, as we look to the back half, please take into account the following. in q3, we expect nielsen mega channel consumption growth to slow until early september and then accelerate due to increased supply, driving better in-store conditions and higher media investment than in the year-ago.
we expect gross margin to decline versus the year-ago as inflation and temporary operating inefficiencies exceed the underlying process improvements we are gaining from kitchens 2.0, and our increased pricing will not meaningfully impact this year. we will continue to experience higher freight costs due to our depleted inventory levels for most of q3. this will diminish our leverage gains in adjusted sg&a, excluding media this year, but we expect those increased costs to cease beginning in november. we will have a large advertising investment planned for q3 and q4 as a match for the increased production capacity we have created.
in closing, our guidance for 2021 calls for net sales greater than $445 million, up 40% versus a year ago, and an increase from our prior guidance of greater than $430 million. and adjusted ebitda of greater than $61 million, up 30% versus a year ago, is unchanged. we believe we are well-positioned to continue accelerating our growth. we now have: production capacity to support approximately $600 million in run-rate sales and are adding one new production line per quarter for the next eight quarters with a balance sheet to support the capacity additions; a proven business model that can drive increased household penetration and a product that drives increased buying rates; more than 25,000 freshpet fridges across multiple classes of trade and in three countries with a reliable service network that supports them, plus a strong presence with a leading player in the pet food e-commerce space; significant scale in the pet category and category-leading growth that encourages our customers to put more fridges in more stores and to upgrade to larger and second fridges; and a deep innovation pipeline with the team and resources to further accelerate our growth.
we believe that positions us to win as the freshpet food segment becomes a sizable portion of the growing pet food category. that will also enable us to accelerate our growth toward our 2025 goals of 11 million households, $1.25 billion in net sales, and a 25% adjusted ebitda margin. that concludes our overview. we will now be glad to take your questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] our first question is from peter benedict with baird.
peter benedict -- baird -- analyst
ok guys. thank you. i guess first question, just not to be shorter-term focus here. but on the fourth quarter, i mean, you've played out a lot of information there.
i mean are we to read that you think the $135 million number in revenue, is that everything goes right number? or does that have some cushion baked into it, again, big growth, but just kind of curious how you're thinking about that? and then i'll have a follow-up.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
peter, it's a good question. we laid out the assumptions in the prepared comments. it assumes sort of normal conditions, what we can normally expect if there are some big hiccups in either the weather, supply interruptions that are beyond what we're currently seeing or if there were -- if there was a bigger-than-expected delay in the start-up or the ramp up of the line at kitchen south, the second line there, those would be differences versus what we've laid out as guidance. but for example, on that one, we've been successfully producing on that second line in kitchen south for two weeks now, but it's still operating at, call it, i would say, 20% of expected run rate, the run rate would have at the end of december.
so there's a fairly significant ramp that we need to go through. and that's the kind of thing that we had to make assumptions about when we were giving that guidance.
peter benedict -- baird -- analyst
ok. no, that's helpful. and then as we think about next year and i think kind of at the end there just gave the sense that the capacity or production today kind of support could directly support a pretty big top-line growth number in '22. given the cost environment and all that's going on in the business, do you think that you could grow your ebitda faster than revenue in '22? or is that a year where maybe costs prevent that from happening, just as a big picture kind of as we think about next year.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yes. obviously, we're going to play a little bit of catch up at first, where with a somewhat depressed ebitda number this year because we were behind on taking pricing because we frankly have the customer service record to support it. at some point, when you're playing that catch-up, it's going to look like you're accelerating faster than maybe the net sales line is, but you're just making up for some lost time at that point. and as we indicated in the comments, we think there's even more inflation than we're pricing for.
so we're likely to take even further pricing. and the question will be the cadence there. how fast does the cost come on versus how fast can we price for it. and that could have a fairly significant impact on whether you see the ebitda growing faster than the net sales.
it's certainly plausible that you could see that. but i'd hate to speculate until we have a better idea of what those costs look like and what our pricing scenario would look like.
peter benedict -- baird -- analyst
ok. great. thanks.

our next question is from bill chappell with truist securities.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
sorry. good afternoon. i guess two questions, both kind of regarding gross margin. first on the pricing, i'm just trying to understand for the quarter, i mean, you knew that you were not going to do take price until fourth quarter and kind of late fourth quarter three, four months ago.
and i would assume you kind of lock in a fair amount of your commodity costs at least three months out. so just what's the difference it happens in the quarter that surprised you?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
heather, do you want to take that?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes. so the hedging really for us comes around chicken. we did actually see much more accelerated inflation and bigger inflation than anticipated a number of key areas on animal proteins outside of kind of that fixed price chicken, we did see across east, turkey. and we did have to tap into some secondary suppliers where we were facing material shortage.
i mean suppliers are facing the same labor issues that everyone is facing. and so there were some instances where we had to go to a higher-cost alternative supplier to shore up that we had the materials to support production. and so we had anticipated inflation for sure. we talked about that, but it was just a lot bigger.
we also had some inflation passed on from co-packers as well as our partner, kitchen south. so it was just extraordinarily bigger than we had anticipated is really what it comes down to.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
and, bill, i would add to that is that almost every supplier today can legitimately declare force majeure and either not supply you or supply you at a higher cost, unfortunately, that's the environment that we're operating in.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
got it. and then looking forward with the understanding you're not giving guidance yet, but heather somewhat -- it sounded like you were saying is gross margins or, i guess, gross profit can return to more expected or normalized levels in the first half with pricing and everything in stock. and then the improvements off of kind of 2020 levels or 2021 levels really comes in the back half? or are you saying, ""hey, we have a further step down to take in the first half and then we have a big back half loaded."" i'm just trying to understand the cadence of how these things work.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes. i think i look at it in two parts. the variables that are still a little bit unknown is the progression of inflation into 2022. we haven't lost the biggest piece of our cost structure, which is the chicken contract that's in the works now.
and so we don't know where that piece of inflation is going to land. we obviously have some ideas, but that's still being finalized at the beginning of december. and then just across the board where inflation will fall as we enter 2022. as we talked about, we will, as needed consolate additional pricing as well.
so those two variables are more, i would say, the unknown that could move. and then the timing of that second price increase, we have to also balance as well against the first one. and so we're still working on that piece. the progress in temporary operating inefficiencies as well as getting the benefits of being fully at scale in bethlehem should really start to come in the first half.
we were surprised as part of the gross margin in q3 that we didn't improve a little bit more in terms of the temporary operating and efficiency staying at the level levels that we were seeing in prior quarters. we do have the wage investment in place now. and like we referred to, we do expect that really to help turn around those operating inefficiencies. so the combination of that unwinding in the first half of next year, coupled with growing into that at a scale is going to be a pretty steady improvement in the first half.
there are a lot of moving parts next year. so we'll be sure to give very clear guidance as we get into that phase based on the fees.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
perfect. thank you so much for the color.
operator
our next question is from jason english with goldman sachs. mr. english?
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
two questions. first, you've shown an update consumption chart from mega channels. and for the first time in a while, it looked awfully similar to the growth rates we're seeing in nielsen aoc channels. so just especially slowed quite a bit for you.
it's no longer outpacing nielsen so much. so can you talk a little bit more about what's happening there?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, do you want to take that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
sure. so over the course of the year, we have had to kind of really think about how we're producing and the cadence of what we're producing. and there was a period of time where we had a lot more inventory moving toward some of our pet specialty customers, and that really caused a significant acceleration in growth. the other thing that we're also seeing is that -- there's been a lot of pricing activity in the market, and there has been a little bit of a movement in migration in some of the consumers in some of the different formats.
we are also now at a point where, as billy mentioned, we're getting to a more steady state from our operations, and we're able to kind of fulfill kind of a more even set of our customers across the board.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. ok. that's helpful. and with profitability under pressure, it sounds like it's going to stay that way for a while, at least lower than what your is anticipating.
i'm guessing that you're going to burn through your cash even faster than what we thought. and now have settled even with drawdown debt at a higher leverage ratio. so heather, is this changing at all how you're thinking about funding the ongoing capex?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
if not, jason, i mean when we look at a pretty near-term issue that we're facing as we look at the back half of this year. and we've included a sort of a progression of the initiatives that drive the margin improvement in the debt. and when we look at q1 2022, there's a number of initiatives that really start to take shape format profitability around. and so we're pretty confident that it's temporary in nature and don't and will not impact the cash flow expectations that we have as we get into next year and continue to spend.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. ok. and all the risk. it sounded like there was more carryover headwinds into next year.
but from my heart for you is, no, no, not really at all.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
i mean we've got pricing to offset the inflation. and again, depending on where inflation starts to come in for next year, we are consulting additional pricing to offset that. but the factors that you have coming in next year, starting in q1, we've got the erp implementation, which will offset the temporary freight inefficiencies that we've been plagued with all year. so that's the first thing to come in.
we really expect to start to see the fruits of the labor investment. we're already seeing some of that, but it's very, very early days. we just implemented that on september 1. and so as that labor investment, you respect to take hold, we expect to see the improvements in really the limit on the temporary operating inefficiencies in been as well as growing into our scale.
so there's two factors there. and then longer term, we'll start to move toward the higher percentage of our mix with higher fee line. so that will continue as we expand capacity. that continues as early as q1 and out through 2022 and beyond.
so we do feel confident in that turnaround. i know it's been a lot of surprise this quarter. and with the revised guidance, but we're very confident in the underlying cost structure and turnaround and believe this is temporary in nature.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
jason, i would just add to that. jason, i would just add that we were a little bit hand strong because we had to delay taking our pricing so we got our house in order on the shipments. we're now in a much better position to at least keep the gap between any inflation we see and the price increase at a more reasonable level. there's always going to be a lead time with our customers, but we can certainly make it less than what turned out to be this time.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes, i hear you. but as bill just pointed out, the last question, you had delayed that price increase a while ago. and if not at all, it's an explanation for mrs a week this quarter. it sounds like you keep using it as the excuse for it, but i think that was exactly as planned, right?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
well, the price increase was as planned, and we went out and announced it on that timing, but the cost that we incurred in the quarter came on much more quickly than we thought. we're now in the process of figuring out what those costs are going to be for the first quarter and beyond for next year. and we're going to figure out what pricing we need to take to match it much more quickly.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. makes sense. thank you.

our next question is from brian holland with cowen and company.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
just a follow on the pricing question. was that a completely proactive move by you or a delay? or did you get pushed back from customers?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
no, this is something we did proactively. we have not been in a good spot with bill rates. you can see that the chart the $1 billion included in the deck, i think it's probably one of the pages. i think it's page 11 is really worth taking a look at.
when you're running at 40%, 50% and even into the 60% fill rates with your customers, it's really not a discussion that you really want to put forward a price increase, understandably that everyone wants us to move on those quickly. but it's not really the right time to be doing it. and then more importantly, from a consumer standpoint, we have been disappointing consumers because we haven't been in an inventory position that we would like to be in for quite a while, and we felt the right thing to do to continue to kind of have the consumer trust that we have in our brand, our portfolio, our products, is to kind of delay the pricing as much as we possibly could. so we made that decision strategically, both from a customer and a consumer standpoint.
i think as billy talked about in the script, i think if we were going to do it all over again, we probably would make the same decision. it's the right timing and it's the right thing to do for the long term of the business. now that being said, there were several things that came on quicker and more aggressively than we had anticipated in the quarter. we'll get this pricing into place.
we announced it, we'll get it into place, and we'll do further adjustments as necessary as the majority of the industry has already done. we'll get those in place in a reasonable order to get our pricing and gross profit back in a place where we're at a more steady state in the not distant future.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
ok. i appreciate the color, scott. and then if i could just tack on also a question was asked earlier about the setup into 2022 and ebitda growing faster than sales. i think the question was asked in the context of maybe gross margin.
but q4 is going to demand about 60% growth. it's going to be your heaviest q4 from the media set spend standpoint. and then you're setting up '22 and '23 with, hopefully, presumably your best capacity situation or best most margin for error. so then the other variable here is what you do with advertising, how have you lean into that.
so i'm curious what we can be looking for what you're thinking about this quarter that might help dictate how aggressive you are next year and presumably a better supply backdrop?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
let me take a shot at that, and then i'll let scott add to it. but first of all, we want to see the continued consumer movement in terms of velocity improvements behind the advertising investment and we want to start seeing the household penetration gains return to what they were. that's not going to happen this quarter. it's going to be happening in the next quarter.
we're already making the commitments for and have made the commitments for our q1 media investment based on what we know about the capacity that we have today. and as heather said, we already have operating capacity that would support growth that's more than 40% ahead of what our current guidance is for this year. so there's fairly significant capacity that's available to us in q1, and we feel comfortable spending the advertising investment to stay after that to achieve that. i would point out, though, as you grow at the rate that we're currently growing and you will quickly use up every incremental line.
and so we are actually mapping out each quarter throughout the next year of when does the line come along, what form does it make, rolls versus bags and what will our supply position be as we approach each of those windows and trying to make sure that we're in either a good inventory position or a good supply position such that we don't end up in the same spot we've been into the last year. and we already know that the first pinch will be, we can get a little tight on our roles as we watch the net start-up because the first line coming up out of ennis will be a roles line. we need that to come on in the second quarter because all of our rolling lines today are operating and they're all operating at 24/7 and we're producing every pound we can. now it's in excess of the demand.
that's what's enabled us to get to basically 100% fill rate in the last week. we need to behold that inventory supply position until we get that next line up and running. but that gives you a sense for the kinds of things we're looking at literally quarter by quarter, capacity coming online that would support the kind of advertising investments that would drive the kind of top-line growth that, frankly, we expect and i think our investors expect.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
the only thing i'd build on that is we've been playing kind of pedal break with advertising all year based on capacity. it looks like that you can start to see it, again, as mentioned, we're starting to get fill rates up. they're not perfect, but they're a whole lot better than they've been in a really long time. things are starting to like kind of come together, lines are opening up.
as they do, we'll continue to really press into advertising. this quarter will be one of the most significant quarters in advertising we've ever had behind the capacity that's coming. and it's intended to get us into a really good spot into the beginning of next year.
operator
thank you. our next question is from wendy nicholson with citi.
wendy nicholson -- citi -- analyst
hi. good evening. my first question is just with regard to october, specifically? i know you said it was on plan, but can you give us a sense for just percentage growth you saw in october, just so we have a sense of how big a nut you have to crack in november and december?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
without going into too much detail here because i haven't seen the net sales number, i've only seen a gross sales number, but let me give you a little bit of context. in 2018 and 2019, the three months of the fourth quarter, october, november, december were all roughly the same size in terms of net sales. and it just gives you a little bit of a sense for the length of the month, the shopping behavior and whatnot because we didn't do any promoting or whatnot. if we did the net sales number that we did in october of this year, and we did it against the december that we had last year, we just held steady at the same rate, we'd be up 107% in december.
so it kind of gives you a sense for how deep the hole was from last december that we're going to be lapping. so this october was up against the strongest month of last year's quarter, and it was monster bigger than november, december. and so it's not at the 60% rate. it didn't have to be they had to be at a level that if you deliver that across the quarter, we get you to a good place.
wendy nicholson -- citi -- analyst
ok. ok. i follow that. but i guess my question, one of the things i saw in the presentation, and i don't know if it's been in your previous quarter presentation, i can go back and check, is that tiny little line of the customer or the defined for the late delivery or misdelivery.
and i'm just wondering, again, it's sort of a philosophical, like i know you're making a very big promise to us. it sounds like you're making a very big promise to the retailers. and yet, i just kind of feel like just given the environment is so challenging, you're talking about not doing as much pricing, you're talking about pushing out the erp launch, so you know it's that difficult. so why set such a big bogey for november and december? because if you're setting it for us, i imagine you're setting it for the retailers as well.
and i just wonder if there isn't like i worry that you're like an old guy who keeps trying to run really fast and he keeps pulling his muscle. and he's like, maybe you should just go slower. and not to say that there isn't a speed isn't a good thing but maybe this environment and all that you're going through with covid and labor and all that kind of stuff just isn't too much because i worry that, that little thing of those customer fines for missed or late deliveries is going to grow, and those retailers are either going to say, no, we don't want a second fridge or no we don't want you in the store. is there a risk to that? or am i just overly nervous for you?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
so first of all, wendy, is a 58-year-old guy who is a runner and ran through college, that comment resonated with me. isn't too personal, and scott was a runner to when he was a hurdler,so he's even worse. but i would say, if anything, it's actually better and easier now than where it has been. so we've been working like the dickens to try to get our legs underneath us and get us to the point where our fill rates were going up.
i mean just looking at this, just to put it into perspective, this week, we have a fill rate that's ahead of where it was a year ago. our tdps are ahead of where they were a year ago. our own internal measure of retail fridge conditions is ahead of where it was a year ago, and our consumer comment on out of stock are better than they were a year ago. we are in a better position now than we were a year ago for the first time in a year and actually moving up, getting better every single week.
so we feel pretty good about the trend line and the things that are driving the trend line are we're getting much more consistent and reliable supply. so the labor investment we made, it may sound like it was good to do. it stabilized the staffing considerably getting that line up at kitchen south, and it is actually running and it's delivering what we thought it was going to deliver on the ramp-up scale we thought. so we feel pretty good about the underlying drivers, but we don't want to also lead people to think that there's absolutely no risk in here, and that's why we were very explicit about what the risks are that we thought could still be out there.
we think they're all within the realm of reasonable and planned and we're planning against sort of normal outcomes but we are in a very unusual environment. we would have never dreamed that we would have had some of the situations that we've seen over the last year, where literally, you find a critical ingredient is no longer available or you're in very short supply and you're scrambling to find a supplier they can get it to you. that's the world that we're living in. but we think we've got it hired out.
frankly, it was only eight weeks left in the year. so based on everything we know, we think we're in the right spot.
wendy nicholson -- citi -- analyst

our next question is from rupesh parikh with oppenheimer.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. so i guess, bill, just going back to your comments in the call to start, just about consumption, it was tracking in length, what you guys thought for the quarter. just curious how marketing so far is tracking versus expectations.
and as you look at the consumption data coming in line with your expectations, so i guess there really wasn't anything that surprised you even with some of the challenges out there.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
and i'll let scott comment on it as well, but i track this very closely. we've talked quite a bit about what we've labeled media efficiency and it's the conversion of our advertising investment to nielsen-measured sales and then net sales. and we've told people all along that the media efficiency was going to be better than 2019, but not as good as 2020, sort of a line that's in between the two. we actually drew a line starting on the nielsen data back on march 6, where we kind of came out of the storms of february and the world normalized at least a little bit.
and we're pretty much hugging that same line that exists halfway between 2019 and 2020 media efficiencies, and it really hasn't varied a whole lot since then. so it's delivering what we thought it would deliver. it's a little early to make comments about what we aired in october and november, december. and since we haven't done much in those months in the years past, that will be a little bit of a new learning for us.
but so far, we really haven't seen any variation. i don't know, scott, is there any other thought you'd have on that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
no. i think you got it. i mean we've tried to take a little bit of a haircut because of some of the challenges you've had with keeping fridges full-on media, but the media looks very tight to what we've expected, given that. and i think from what we've seen so far in october.
it looks like it's progressing. it looks like everything is progressing kind of as planned, and we do have a fair amount of spend left in the last 60 days here.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst

our next question is from mark astrachan with stifel.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. thanks. good afternoon everyone. i guess just building on the last question a little bit.
if you take a look at your growth versus category growth kind of in recent weeks, months, the delta has narrowed a bit. so i guess what gives you confidence that the household penetration opportunity remains the same, especially obviously, given what you've outlined in terms of the slower household penetration given the lack of availability caught up with the buying rate piece. you see generally stronger growth from competitors. and one of the things that we hear from folks, not necessarily that it's correct, but one of the concerns i think out there is he those competitors not to mention the b2c private companies seemingly doing well.
so does that all complicate kind of where the long-term outlook can be and freshpet's positioning therein?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, do you want to take that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes. so, mark, we spend every week looking at this, and i'm thinking about what's going on. fundamentally, we have not seen any changes in consumer behavior, consumer interest, the productivity of our media, the ability to grow, especially when we have product in stock, we were just talking about specialty earlier, i think when peter asked that question. i think it was peter asked a question about or actually might have been jason talking about pet specialty.
when we have product, we're seeing really nice growth and acceleration. so that's super, super important. one of the things that's really kind of important to kind of put into perspective is the majority of the growth that we're seeing in the category and from most of the competitors is pricing action. if you look at whether it's units or you look at price per pound, you're seeing pretty nice growth rates, especially in wet, 10%, 12%, 13%, 14%, maybe even a little higher cost some brands.
that looks like the pricing is 90-plus percent of that growth. so units and pounds, there has not been a significant increase. we don't have any pricing in play yet, so that's why we think that there's been a little bit of a closing of the gap more recently. now that's not to say overall category growth is still in the kind of high single digits, but a lot of that's being kind of taken offline.
so it's not as easy to see in the nielsen. so that's the dynamic we believe is going on. but there's -- when you see these consumer trends over time, there is nothing that's leading us to believe that it's anything but accelerating, especially as millennial and gen z become more of the consumer base in the future.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst

our next question is from stephanie wissink with jefferies.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
i have a follow-up question to an earlier one i'm going to ask it in a slightly different way. but maybe heather -- billy, this is best for you. just thinking about the volatility in the business. and as you look forward into '22, do you expect that the range of outcomes start to narrow or that it remains as wide as what we've seen during 2021?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
i'll talk about the consumption side of it, heather takes her comment on the adjusted ebitda side. i think what you're going to see is that the consumption is going to be in absolute terms is going to much more closely match what you're going to see as our reported sales. and so to an extent that variability will be gone, we will, of course, be lapping a year where you had significant changes in inventories, ours in the trade inventory that will make the year-on-year comparisons, what kind of fuzzy. so you're going to have to look past that and start looking at the consumption data.
but because of the position that we're going to be in at the end of this year, because of the growth that will come from the advertising, i think we're going to return to our historic pattern where if you look at the nielsen, you can pretty much get a good sense for where our absolute consumption and sales are going to be, and then you're going to have to do a little bit of triangulating to figure out what that means versus a year ago just because the year ago is going to be a little slowing. and heather what do you think about the ebitda?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean i think as we look into '22 and beyond, the tailwind for improvement start to outweigh the headwinds as we know on today. i mean, of course, the noise -- the short-term noise is coming largely from inflation ahead of pricing, which will sort itself out next year as we're a to have the first price increase take effect and then we'll see where we need to do a second. but when you think about the different drivers of improvement from a tailwind perspective, we've got our erp implementation that i referred to in terms of eliminating the freight inefficiencies, that's 200 basis points of inefficiency that we've been facing all year.
the second piece is really having bethlehem at scale with the labor investment in place. so you start to think about the elimination of the temporary operating efficiencies because we've got now the right labor. we've hired the right labor with more manufacturing experience who are then progressing through our freshpet academy and are much more skilled in terms of how perform day to day. so that's going to be a big driver of improvement.
and then as we continue to expand capacity, we continue to increase the number of high-speed lines in the overall sort of pie chart of lines. and so the majority of our production starts to be on higher speed line. having said that, there are a couple headwinds that will face along the way. so as we expand and contract in the near term, expand production with our kitchens south partner, that's going to be a headwind, and we've talked about that as being a more sort of less linear line item that sort of expand and contract over time to recite end state when we're looking at the $2 billion in capacity.
we'll start to see a continued mix shift toward bad again, that's been really constrained this year. and so we expect that mix shift to continue, and that will be a headwind. and the last piece is going to be as we're expanding our capacity in whether it's more capacity at kitchens south, but more so at it, we will have moments of undergrowth cost that we need to manage through. we'll try to be extremely tight on that, but that is another headwind that we have to manage very closely.
but again, the tailwinds are going to outweigh the headwinds. so we feel very confident in the underlying improvement going forward.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
heather, can you really quickly talk about labor? i think one of the things from your analyst day that we took away is that your new lines require a lot less manpower, a lot more automated. so as we think about labor investment over the course of the next couple of years. is it going to lessen as a percentage of your overall expense base?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
i think it will, but i think that, that takes a little bit of time to actually get there. so into near term, especially with newer technology that could be been more complex in terms of just understanding how it operates and getting the maintenance cadence right there. there is sort of a near-term investment in level that's required to sort of get that into a steady run rate. but for sure, the line should operate with less labor, less sort of production operators along the way.
we continue to focus efforts around automation. we're doing that. we're building that on the back of lion, for example, as we've been the line one in our bethlehem kitchen on backup, we'll have more automation on the back end of the line, which should save on labor. so it's going to be a function of our ability to get to a mature state running the line, the newer technology line as well as continue to drive more automation, either via retrofit or just continuous improvement effort as we go.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
steph, i would add to what heather just said is i think she's trying to walk a fine line between we may have less overall people, but the people that we have who may be paying them more, meaning higher-skilled group of people, better-trained group of people and where that nets out in terms of what it looks like on our p&l in terms of labor expense is going to evolve over time. but we're quickly realizing that there's a significant return for investments in labor and in talent, meaning hiring higher quality people and paying higher quality people more so you reduce turnover is -- we think that's a very good strategy, and that's something that we did with our freshpet academy we launched for september. the early indications are very, very positive, and we think we frankly need to keep looking harder at that in a variety of other ways to see whether there's more to get out of that strategy.

hi. thanks guys. i thought three months ago, that you had expected an exit rate in your consumption to be 35% or higher. and i think you're saying it's now 30%.
but i would have thought that with your velocity good, your fill rates improving, you've got the big advertising. i would have thought you've been able to keep -- would have been able to keep the 35% and higher. so why is it a little bit lower? is it just distribution related again?

the 35% that was out there was we drew it on the chart, it was up against the last two weeks that you're seeing in the year, which are notoriously low. and when we drew it out, we're now showing it as versus where you thought we'd be in the month of december. so it's just sort of the cadence that you're expecting to see for the last month. and if you look at the weekly, i don't know if you get the weekly rob, but there's a very significant variation in the weeklies in the month of december, and that's what that reflects.
but it's in the same ballpark. it's really not much of a difference.

our next question is from ben bienvenu with stephens.
ben bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. so i want to ask as it relates to raw materials, both to build out capacity and to build out production of product. heather, you talked about expected higher costs on chicken as you reprice in december.
in doing so, do you expect to be able to get all of the products that you plan to receive? or do you expect to still be shorter on product? and then as you think about -- if we see raw material or supply chain challenges worsen, how does that impact? how should we think about that as a potential net negative pushing back against the positive improvements in overall productivity as you scale out production to the earlier question around cash burn and kind of cash availability to expand production.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yes. let me take a shot at that. so first of all, as we've all learned that you really need to have a broad and diverse supply base in order to succeed in this environment. and frankly, we've been very fortunate that our supply chain team has done a remarkably good job of making it that we've never had to shut down lines because we could not get access to material.
we've had to scramble quite a bit in advance and get material from a greater distance and at a higher cost but we were able to keep our lines running because we had done the work to develop backup suppliers or qualify backup suppliers on many of the most critical ingredients. there's still some more of that work to be done. so as we get to be larger and larger scale, the suppliers that we come to rely on, you need to have either a bigger backup supplier or a second-tier supplier in the next, the people who may have been able to meet that need earlier may no longer be able to meet the needs that we've got. so our supply chain team has been working pretty darn hard to develop backup suppliers or second sources or third sources on the most critical ingredients.
and so far, they've been able to do it and keep our lines running. the embedded part of that question, though, is can you do it at the same cost. and that hasn't been as easy and that's certainly part of the negotiation and work they're doing. and certainly, it's one of the things that we'll factor into making a decision on pricing.
ben bienvenu -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. thanks.
operator
our last question is from jon andersen with william blair.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
good afternoon guys. a couple of quick ones, most have been asked already. on pricing, it sounds like a second price increase is more likely than not given kind of the current situation, particularly vis-a-vis chicken. so how quickly can you affect the second price increase? and do we have any risk of the kind of the timing mismatch, which seems to be playing a bit of a role in the ebitda reduction this year kind of occurring in some fashion in 2022.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
let scott take that one.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes. so we're going to try in the next couple of weeks, we should i think heather chatted a little bit about this some point the next couple of weeks, we should have a pretty good idea on several of our core ingredients. we'll know exactly kind of where they're landing. and then we will make decisions from there.
we've already started reviewing what the different opportunities are around pricing and evaluating the pricing, the different price points that we kind of potentially cross over and what we believe the impact in velocity could be. so we've done all that work. we've -- we're kind of ready for it. it's probably from when we make a decision, it's probably 120 days.
so it would be sometime in late q1 or early q2 would probably be when the second round of pricing would probably come into play. and at that point, we think not only will we be getting a little bit more normalized state, but we think some of these supply chain challenges will have moderated and we'll be operating in a much more steady state. that's what our crystal ball does.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
ok. and you've always had benefited from a very high repeat rate, i think, in the 70% range. given some of the industrywide challenges, but sort of the challenges you had given capacity constraints in whether it be fill rates, in-stock levels at retail. i mean, are you concerned about any permanent impairment to household penetration, attrition in the customer base at repeat rates fallen off? how do we think about this? is this just a transitory thing? or is there some more permanent impairment we need to consider?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
no, primarily transitory. i mean, i'm sure there's some people that were -- have not purchased us as much, we know that. and we've also seen our buy rate ironically go up because our penetration hasn't grown quite as much because we backed off of advertising, and we haven't had product availability. and there are some products we haven't had almost at all for certain periods of time.
so that's caused some of our penetration to kind of moderate a little bit, not grow as fast as we would like to see. but we think this is transitory. we've been through some things like this in the past with the business over 10 years or so. and it's always recovered really, really nicely.
and as soon as we've kind of gotten to a more steady state where we'll have product available, our advertising returns we seeing growth returning very consistently with what we've historically seen.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
maybe if i could just squeeze one more in. on the media spend rate. where do you think you end up in 2021 on the media spend rate. and it sounds like next year, you plan to lean in.
i think in the past, you said up to 12% as a media spend rate. would that be a way to think about next year? and again, where do you think you'll end up this year?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
heather, do you want to tackle this year? and then i'll talk about what we know at this point for next year?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes. i mean, in terms of this year, obviously, originally, our plan we're on a lower guide on the top line, and we brought that up. so from a percent basis, we will be off the long-term kind of 12%, both a function of the higher revenue but also a function of some refinement in the media spend that we have made through the year given the capacity constraints and some of the profit pressures. our plan for -- as we progress into next year, though, coming off of a strong q4 is to get that media level back up to the 12% sort of longer-term run rate that we would like to be at that is the plan as we go into 2022.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
ok. thanks so much.

good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the freshpet third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] please note, this conference is being recorded. i will now turn the conference over to your host, jeff sonnek, investor relations for icr.
thank you. you may begin.
jeff sonnek -- investor relations
thank you. good afternoon, and welcome to freshpet's third quarter 2021 earnings call and webcast. on today's call are billy cyr, chief executive officer; and heather pomerantz, chief financial officer; scott morris, chief operating officer will also be available for q&a. before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, management may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
these statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. please refer to the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec and the company's press release issued today for a detailed discussion of the risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. please note that on today's call, management will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures such as ebitda and adjusted ebitda, among others. while the company believes these non-gaap financial measures provide useful information for investors, the presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with gaap.
please refer to today's press release for how management defines such non-gaap measures. a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap and limitations associated with such non-gaap measures. finally, the company has produced a presentation that contains many of the key metrics that will be discussed on this call. that presentation can be found on the company's investor website.
management's commentary will not specifically walk through the presentation on the call, rather, it's a summary of the results and guidance that we'll discuss today. now i'd like to turn the call over to billy cyr, chief executive officer. 
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
thank you, jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. while it may not be obvious from the results we reported today, freshpet's consumption growth in the quarter was exactly where we expected it to be when we raised our guidance in august, and would easily support delivering greater than $445 million in net sales this year. however, supply chain challenges that impacted our equipment suppliers will constrain our q4 capacity and that is causing us to change our guidance from greater than $445 million to approximately $445 million. please don't mistake that for reduced demand because the demand was very strong and we ended the quarter with significant unfilled orders.
but we lost more than a month of production in september and october in the second line at kitchen south due to delays getting equipment through the ports. so we are not as confident in our ability to produce enough fresh pet to meaningfully exceed $445 million. that second line is up and running now, but we can't make up for the lost time. thus, we are making the small change in our guidance.
that challenge is typical of the environment we are operating in today. so our q3 results reflect some tough choices that we've had to make. in each case, the choices were driven by our goal of maximizing the long-term value of the freshpet opportunity and we were willing to make some near-term sacrifices to accomplish that. we believe that the pet food market has made a significant shift toward fresh and that it is in our best interest to capture as much of the emerging opportunity as we can and build a large, highly loyal consumer franchise, even if we have to absorb some of the short-term costs and managed through the resulting consequences.
this quarter, some of those consequences were more significant than we anticipated and more significant than we budgeted in our guidance. but that does not change how we feel about our focus on maximizing the long-term growth opportunity. let me highlight a few of those choices and the consequences we felt in q3. first, while we continue to generate strong net sales growth in the quarter, up 28% versus a year ago, we could have generated even more if we had not made the decision to invest in manufacturing upgrades, automation and much overdue maintenance that will enable us to deliver the quality and supply reliability that we will need to sustain our growth.
we estimate that we could have generated up to an additional $10 million of net sales adding 12 points to our growth rate, if we had not made those long-term investments in our manufacturing capability. to be clear, we fully anticipated making those choices when we gave our guidance at the end of q2 and still believe we are on track to deliver approximately $445 million for the year. additionally, we optimized our production planning schedule to restore customer service resulting in longer production runs and higher inventory levels. we believe it was very important for our customers to do everything we could do to restore customer service as fast as we could.
the result of that was an increase in our inventory on hand at the end of q3 of about $8 million of net sales value with the equivalent of six days versus where we ended q2. that has helped us significantly improve our customer service in october but it also reduced our net sales potential in q3 by about $8 million. there was no lack of demand that drove that inventory build. in fact, it is quite the opposite.
we did it because we had such strong demand that our fill rates in september were in the low to mid-50s and they needed to improve. fortunately, it is working, and we now fill rates in the mid-60s, and our fill rate on our roles is in the 90s. judging by the consensus net sales estimate for the quarter, we could have made those choices clearer. we fully anticipated the loss of production from the maintenance and upgrades and call those out in our presentations and q2 earnings call.
however, our estimate of the timing of when we would restore our inventory levels turned out to be incorrect as we built that inventory in q3 rather than in q4. hopefully, the materials we are providing today give you more clarity on our capacity going forward. similarly, we made a tough choice that negatively impacted our adjusted ebitda in the quarter. we delayed taking a price increase until we have restored customer service to acceptable levels.
we believe that our cost increases would be manageable until then, but that turned out to not be the case. our costs escalated much more quickly than we had anticipated and more quickly than we had budgeted in our guidance. simply put, we absorbed rapidly escalating costs without any pricing relief, which we estimate process about $5 million of adjusted ebitda in the quarter versus the results we would have had if we had taken pricing on the same timing as our competitors. as a result, adjusted ebitda was $14.6 million, down 14% versus a year ago, instead of being up 15% versus a year ago.
in total, choices like that made this a rocky quarter. but even if we had anticipated the incremental costs more accurately, i think it is fair to say that we would have made the same choices, i.e., investing for long-term growth rather than optimizing the near term. each of our decisions were part of our determined effort to build a solid long-term foundation for growth so that we could achieve our mission of changing the way people feed their pets forever. to provide greater clarity on the results, heather and i will focus the bulk of our comments on addressing the two most likely questions on many of your minds related to the results we are posting today.
first, why wasn't the net sales growth greater than 28%? and second, what drove the reduction in adjusted gross margin in the quarter? and when will it improve? i will address the first question, and heather will address the second. so why wasn't the net sales growth greater than 28% in the quarter? the answer is quite simple. as i alluded to already, that it's all our manufacturing plan could support. we had more than enough demand to sell more, but between building inventory to improve our customer service and investing in maintenance and upgrade projects our net sales continue to be limited by our capacity.
to help you understand our capacity limits in the quarter, the accompanying presentation includes a bridge from the $490 million annualized capacity we had at the end of june expressed as $122.5 million in quarterly net sales and $107.6 million in net sales we actually delivered in q3. as you will see, our capacity was constrained by a planned three-day shutdown of all of our lines in early july for significant maintenance that had been deferred due to staffing shortages during the covid crisis. we had included our decision to do that in our q2 earnings presentation. additionally, we took one of our bag lines out of commission in two steps: the first phase in late august, followed by the second phase of a full shutdown in early september so that we could upgrade and automate the line.
that line will restart later this month with new, more efficient equipment and the ability to deliver higher quality more consistently. heather mentioned this on our q2 earnings call, but we are not specific on the timing, only indicating that we would do it before the end of the year. we rebuilt our internal inventory by about $8 million of net sales value in the quarter. while we would prefer to have shipped everything we made we focused on maximizing the number of pounds we could produce to restore our internal inventories and improve customer service by doing large runs of key items.
that means that we produced enough of an item to support several days of shipments before moving on to the next item, increasing our days of inventory on hand of each item by about six days in the quarter, particularly on our roles. the result is that our fill rates have improved by 20 points since july, but we had $8 million less in net sales than we might have had. as i alluded to earlier, the timing of the inventory build is different than our expectations as we had expected this to occur in q4 instead of q3. it is for this reason that we remain confident in our full-year 2021 net sales estimate of approximately $445 million.
finally, our treat supplier had significant capacity constraints due to labor shortages, and that cost us about $1 million in net sales in the quarter. while small, we expect this issue to continue for at least the balance of this year. we are looking for some longer-term solutions to this problem. despite these limitations on our production, we still produced 45% more in q3 this year than we did last year.
that enabled us to satisfy current retail sales we fill about $8.5 million of trade inventory and rebuild some of our inventories. the result of that was 28% net sales growth versus a year ago. you will find a reconciliation of our net sales growth versus consumption and another reconciliation versus our production in the accompanying presentation. demand was strong in the quarter and in line with our expectations.
the nielsen measured consumption growth rate accelerated in mid-august as we had predicted it would, going from a low point with 13% growth versus a year ago in early august to its most recent week of 22% growth, an average improvement of about one point per week. and is on track to be more than 30% ahead a year ago by the end of december, nine nielsen weeks from now. the two-year stacked growth rate stayed consistently in the upper 50s throughout the quarter as we had anticipated it would and it is now consistently exceeding 60% and may potentially break 70% by the end of the quarter. the consumption growth in the quarter was broad-based but was again particularly strong in pet specialty where it was up 36% versus a year ago.
our e-commerce business grew strongly again this quarter, up 57% versus a very strong quarter last year and accounted for 6.4% of our total sales mix in the quarter. store count grew by 226 in the quarter to 23,381. it will take quite a finishing push to get to our 2021 target of 1,000 net new stores as customers remain hesitant to put in new coolers until we are fully stocking the existing coolers. so it will be close, but there is a chance we'll get there.
we're already well ahead of our annual targets for this year on upgrades and second fridges but still added 48 upgrades and 51-second fridges in the quarter. while this rate of additions has slowed, we are anticipating significant increases in new stores and second fridges next year based on our increased supply and rapid growth. household penetration gains were modest due to the out of stocks and advertising delays over the past year. total household penetration was up 9%.
conversely, buying rate benefited from the reduced increase in households and was up well above our long-term target at 17%. we expect those to reverse by the end of the first half of 2022. our u.k. business grew 57% in the quarter and has real momentum.
we intend to increase our investment in that market next year to capitalize on that momentum. our canadian business was constrained by supply and only grew 9% in the quarter. consumption on the other hand, continued to be very strong, with our leading customer producing sales growth of 39% versus a year ago in the quarter. our full-year 2021 net sales outlook implies that q4 will be significantly larger than q3, both in absolute terms and in comparison to the year ago.
there are four reasons for that. first, we have significant incremental capacity coming online in q4 at kitchen south that will provide a meaningful production increase versus q3. and that is a high-capacity bag line with a two-shift operation. it did get off to a slow start due to delays in getting pieces of equipment through the ports in september and early october, but it is running now.
i will provide more commentary on that and the impact it will have on our year in a few minutes. but based on what we know today, we estimate that we'll have approximately $135 million of net sales capacity in q4. a reconciliation for that versus q3's net sales is included in the accompanying presentation. this more detailed look at our capacity for the quarter incorporates all the known factors that can influence the conversion of our estimated annual run rate capacity into an actual operating plan for the fourth quarter.
second, a year ago, q4 provides a very soft comparison because last december's production and shipments were severely limited by winter storms and covid-related absenteeism. for perspective, the q4 net sales growth rate in the year ago was nine points below the nielsen consumption growth rate, indicating that we are drawing down trade inventory heavily in the quarter. while weather could present the same risk this year, last year's storms were unusually impactful in the lehigh valley, and we are hoping that we don't face the same severity this year. additionally, covid appears to be much less of a threat this year than it was last year.
third, we will record meaningful revenue from trade inventory refill in the quarter. as i indicated earlier, we largely completed refilling trade inventory on our roles in october, and that refill will contribute to our fourth quarter net sales. if our bag lines come online as expected, we will finish refilling the trade inventory on our roasted meals in november and december, also delivering net sales above consumption. we do not expect to finish refilling the trade inventory on fresh from the kitchen until early february, but will also record net sales above consumption in both q4 and part of q1 2022 on that item.
and fourth, we have our strongest quarter of marketing support for the year in q4, reflecting our improved in stocks and our desire to invest to support the rapid capacity expansions we have over the next eight quarters. historically, we have not supported the business with much marketing support in q4. so this will be a step change in our growth rate and a bit of a change in cadence versus our past practice. to be clear, we still have risks in q4, everything from the potential for winter weather that can disrupt either production or shipping to labor and transportation challenges that are plagued in the entire industry to typical production start-up issues that could impact new lines and new facilities and the ongoing threat from covid, including increased absenteeism due to positive test results in our facilities or those of our suppliers, logistics partners or customers.
we are like everyone else who produces and sells goods in america today, i.e., constantly incurring supply interruptions that require interventions by our team to keep our lines running and enabling us to meet consumer demand. as i mentioned earlier, one issue that we're already aware of that could impact our final results for the year has been the delay in getting equipment to start up the second line at kitchens south. that delay caused us to revise our net sales guidance from greater than $445 million to the $445 million we now see as a good approximation of reality. while over the long haul, these minor delays will mean very little, they are frustrating for all of us as we are diligently working to improve retail availability while simultaneously ramping up much-needed capacity to support future growth.
while not impacting this year, that delay on line 2 at kitchens south will push back the timing of the third line at that site by about one month. it had been scheduled to start up at the end of december, but the installation timetable and some of the construction work will now move the start-up date to early february of 2022. this is reflected in the capacity projects chart in the accompanying presentation. similarly, we are experiencing shortages or being put on allocation for basic construction materials that are typically widely available, such as insulation and steel studs and that has pushed our start up in ns back by about a month, but we still believe it will fall in q2 of 2022.
despite those potential short-term risks, we remain very bullish on our prospects both in the near term and the long term. that is because we are successfully putting in place the critical building blocks to achieve our long-term goal of changing the way people feed their pets forever. in the last few months, we have increased production to the point that in october, we produced almost 60% more pounds than we did last year. we did that in the face of some of the most significant labor and supply chain challenges i've seen in my 36 years in the cpg industry.
over the past six months, we produced significantly more than we sold at retail, rebuilding retail conditions and providing ample capacity to support strong growth going forward. our customers are beginning to notice those improvements and we hope it gives them the confidence to install more fridges next year. we also have projects under construction that will more than double that capacity in the next 18 months. we reaccelerated our growth rate through our investment in media with the inflection point occurring in mid-august and expect to exit this year with consumption growth in excess of 30%.
we are investing in significant q4 media for the first time because we are squarely focused on fulfilling our long-term growth goals and now have the capacity to deliver that. that q4 media will get us off to a fast start in 2022, and we have favorable year-on-year comparisons during the first half of 2022 that could accelerate our measured consumption growth rate even further. we also announced a 4.8% price increase designed to offset a meaningful portion of the significant inflation we are seeing and position us for improvement in our adjusted gross margin to ebitda margin next year. that price increase will go into effect with orders received on november 29, 2021.
we delayed taking this pricing until we can improve our customer service. for the purposes of providing you with some added context and sensitivity around the impact of pricing, if we had implemented our price increase and the timing that our competitors have taken their price increases, our adjusted gross margin would have been 240 basis points better and adjusted ebitda would have been $5 million better than our reported q3 results. and we implemented a new labor strategy built around our freshpet academy that is stabilizing our staffing and positioning us for the significant growth we have ahead. you're not out of the woods yet as it takes time for that strategy to deliver the results we need.
we were on more solid footing today than we were six months ago. our team members are getting the training they need and deserve, and we are seeing early signs of the productivity increases that come with that. each of these efforts will contribute to building a strong foundation for freshpet's continued growth. unfortunately, the fruits of most of these efforts will not be felt until 2022 and beyond when they will deliver accelerating growth with better margins.
until then, we are absorbing the many pains common to the cpg industry right now and also some of those associated with rapid growth. we do know that our shareholders expect us to continually demonstrate that at scale, freshpet will produce meaningful profit and cash flow. we try to provide the evidence of that by continually updating you on the key drivers of our efficiency improvements, including increased absorption of our g&a expense and the benefits of our more efficient manufacturing. many of those are obscured by the near-term issues.
so we'll do our best to clear the debris so that you can see the underlying performance improvements. these are not meant as excuses but are simply in effort to provide greater clarity. i will now turn it over to heather so that she can provide that clarity and give you more detail on our results.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
thank you, billy, and good afternoon, everyone. as billy indicated, i am going to address the second question that is most likely on your mind. about our adjusted gross margin performance in the quarter, and also attempt to help you see through all the noise to understand our underlying performance. additionally, i'll update you on our formal outlook for the year, including our revised adjusted ebitda expectations.
our q3 adjusted ebitda performance came in at $14.6 million, 14% below the year ago. this underperformance was driven by significant cost inflation and a continuation of the temporary operating inefficiencies that we described last quarter. adjusted gross margin came in well below our expectations at 44%, down from the 46.1% we generated in q2 and 49.3% in the year ago. in our case, and given the fluidity of the operating environment, we think it is most useful to look at variances on a sequential basis relative to q2.
those variances are as follows: first, 140 basis points of ingredient inflation and higher costs at our kitchens south partner. we saw inflation on virtually every call line that was not under a fixed price contract. and even in those cases where the price is fixed, we had numerous instances where we had to go to alternate higher-cost suppliers to get access to the necessary materials to keep our lines running at time due to sporadic shortages of some key ingredients and materials. our planned price increase is designed to offset much of these costs.
second, 120 basis points of higher labor and overhead costs as a result of our wage increase plan and some investments in staffing ahead of demand. these costs will be offset by increased productivity as our freshpet academy training plan takes hold. third, 35 basis points of higher cost between the gross sales line and net sales line due to customer fines for short shipments. these should go away when we are finally caught up on trade inventory.
these increases were partially offset by improved mix and improvements in operating performance related to quality and yields that delivered a total of 85 basis points of improvement. while not a component of cost of goods sold, as we included in sg&a, logistics was 11.6% of sales, which is well in excess of our year-ago performance and our long-term expectations. part of this is freight inflation that we are taking price to cover, but a larger share is related to shipping half-empty trucks due to our short shipments and erp system limitations. this cost will go away when we restore normal customer service later this year and into next year.
as we have indicated, we announced a price increase that averages 4.8% across the line, and it is effective with orders received on november 29, 2021. that will have a de minimis impact on q4 but it will offset a significant portion of our increased cost of goods sold and freight costs when it is fully effective in q1 of 2022. i also want to add that the inflation we are seeing has accelerated considerably since we announced our price increase in august and may require us to take additional pricing to cover it. we contract for some of our most significant ingredients in december of each year.
so we will not make any decision on additional pricing until we know what those costs will be. it would then take time to implement any additional pricing we would take. we also need to begin capturing the productivity benefits of the labor investment we announced in august, the higher efficiency from our new production line, and the reduction in temporary operating inefficiencies that have plagued us this year. we are seeing early signs indicating the potential for each of them, but i believe it will take until sometime in the first half of next year until we fully realize the potential in each of those areas.
for example, since we implemented our new labor strategy, we have seen an increase in productivity per person and per shift, and that is contributing to the record production we are seeing in our bethlehem kitchens. it is early, but the trend is clear. we now need to sustain and expand it. we also expect to see significant quality improvements from both our training program and the upgraded equipment in kitchens 1.0.
those should become evident in the first half of 2022. we have invested in the training of more than 30 of our team members who will be charged with starting up the ennis kitchen and more will arrive next month. don has been training in our bethlehem kitchens since late june and has already advanced at least one level in our freshpet academy training system and will likely have achieved another level before they go home to net. this investment will pay significant dividends when we start up the ennis kitchen in q2 of 2022.
we started up our second distribution center in dallas, texas in the quarter. we are still in the testing phase and only ship to a very small number of customers in oklahoma at this point. but once that dc is fully operating late next year, we will begin to yield significant reductions in freight and will better insulate our business from weather disruptions and labor shortages. i have included a summary of the cost savings opportunities that are underway, their potential impact, and the timing in the accompanying presentation so that you can have greater visibility on our plans to restore our margins.
we also expect to get some significant gains in operating productivity from our new erp system when it is implemented. we delayed the implementation from november to february as we did not want to risk further disruption to our customer service at a time when so many customers are making decisions on fridge expansion and immediately prior to a price increase. we believe we were technically ready for the conversion, but every erp conversion brings some degree of uncertainty and risk of supply interruption. our in-house inventories, our customer inventory and our customer service track record were not robust enough for us to absorb that risk at such a critical time in our customers' decision-making process.
we believe we will have much better inventory and a stronger customer service record when we implement the new system in february. however, it is important to note that this decision will further prolong the amount of time that we are absorbing the incremental freight costs associated with shipping less than full trough. the impact will lessen as we improve our fill rates but the impact will not be eliminated until we are fully caught up on our bag supply, which has been exacerbated by the delays on kitchen south line 2. media investment in the quarter was 6.3% of net sales, roughly in line with a year ago.
this year's media was skewed toward the back half of the quarter, so we did not get the full benefit of the investment in the quarter. we lost leverage on adjusted sg&a, excluding media, versus the year ago due to the temporary freight inefficiencies and inflation. excluding logistics, however, we delivered 150 basis points of improved adjusted sg&a leverage, excluding media, and have delivered 170 basis points of improved leverage year to date. we incurred $100,000 in covid-related expenses in the quarter and have added those back.
we have largely ended our covid add back at this point as vaccines are broadly available and we have moved to a more sustained system for protecting our team and ensuring business continuity. however, it is important to note that we fully intend to offer our employees the option to be tested for covid weekly rather than forcing them to get vaccinated. we are still determining what the cost of that program will be as osha just released the details last thursday. we will factor that cost into our budget and guidance for next year once it is understood.
our net cash used in operations was $3.3 million in the year-to-date period ended q3. our cash from operations was impacted by accounts receivable and inventory working capital needs due to strong net sales growth and production in the last month of the quarter. our cash on hand at the end of the quarter was $170.8 million. we spent $103.2 million in capex in the quarter.
the ennis facility is in its highest investment quarter as we are finishing the building and beginning to install equipment. you can see a picture of the current state of the ennis construction in our supplemental presentation. turning to our guidance for 2021. as billy indicated, we are now expecting full year net sales of approximately $445 million, which is dependent on available capacity and our success with starting up the second line at kitchen south.
october shipments met our expectations, but we will need the added capacity from the second line at kitchens south and the successful restart of the bag line in kitchens 1.0 to continue the growth in november and december. this guidance implies that 2021 will be our strongest year of growth since we went public in 2014 and also implies that our q4 growth rate will be approximately 60%. as billy indicated, the year ago december was very soft due to significant disruptions from covid and weather, and we have a very strong marketing plan in place. thus, we believe it is achievable.
we are lowering our adjusted ebitda guidance to reflect the rapid increase in inflation, the lost net sales from the delay in starting up line 2 at kitchen south, and the delay in our erp conversion, which would have offset some of the freight issues. our pricing is designed to offset these costs but it will not have a material impact until 2022. thus, we are lowering our adjusted ebitda guidance to approximately $50 million, while maintaining our strong q4 investment in marketing to get 2022 off to a fast start. in closing, our guidance for 2021 calls for net sales of approximately $445 million, up 40% versus a year ago, and adjusted ebitda of approximately $50 million, up 7% versus a year ago.
we believe we are well positioned to continue accelerating our growth but we have significant work to do to get fresh pack position for a strong 2022. the investments we are making are designed to maximize the long-term opportunity. in 2022, we will have production capacity to support a significantly larger business with an increasing mix of more efficient lines. in fact, we already have in place and are operating enough capacity to support a business that could be greater than 40% larger than our revenue guidance for 2021 if we are successful in driving a corresponding increase in demand.
the capacity and capability to invest in a very small media program at our targeted rates, significant product innovation that is capable of capturing the interest of millennials and gen z. and finally, an expanding retail footprint at some of the most significant retailers continue their expansion efforts. we believe that positions us to win as the fresh pet food segment becomes a sizable portion of the growing pet food category. that will also enable us to accelerate our growth toward our 2025 goals of 11 million households $1.25 billion in net sales and a 25% adjusted ebitda margin.
that concludes our overview. we will now be glad to take your questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions] thank you. our first question is from anoori naughton with j.p. morgan.
please proceed with your question.
anoori naughton -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. 
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
good afternoon, anoori. 
anoori naughton -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
thank you for giving us some of the details and to the risks considered in your guidance. but what gives you confidence that the $575 million is conservative enough to encompass all of the one-time-type events that have challenged you and others in the industry lately? and then what do you see as the potential upside drivers in your outlook as well?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. let me just talk about the risk profile, and then scott might just give a commentary on where the upside part of it is. but unlike most companies where demand is really the big question for them, our big issue over the last two years has not been, in fact, the last many years, has not been the absence of demand, it's been the absence of supply. and so our entire risk mitigation approach has been focused on how do we get ourselves enough supply that we can let the demand rise to where it needs to be.
and as i said in the comments, we're already running at the rate that would support the $575 million. so we feel very good about the underlying growth rate here. our big challenge is are we going to have enough capacity, and that's what we've laid out as a plan, that we have significantly more capacity than the $575 million would require. i think the proof in the pudding was in january, where we were able to take down the line and still keep up with the demand and not dig a trade inventory hole.
so we feel very good that we're managing the right element of risk here. the element of risk is not the demand side. the element of risk is on the supply side. scott, do you want to comment on the demand drivers and the upside?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah, certainly. so i totally agree with billy. i mean i think he -- what he's getting into is, for the past two years, we really have not been in a situation where we've been able to apply customers or consumers the product and the product specifically that they are looking for. and we're finally, finally, in the last like month or two, starting to see those inventories come back.
we're starting to see our situation, our appearance of retail are much better than it's been. and the question we're asking ourselves is, what would the growth have been in the last couple of years if we didn't have that situation? and we're starting to see some of these pretty enormous numbers come through, both on the -- through nielsen in the weekly data that we're seeing. and really what it comes down to is in stock. we also feel like the media performance and the advertising that we now have on air is the best we've ever had, and we know the correlation between the media and the impact on not only driving penetration but also revenue.
we're really confident in our innovation, and we're also seeing really nice steady progression in distribution. so it feels like every single thing is lining up on the business behind finally having enough inventory.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. anoori, i would just close that with the -- it is amazing. it is very -- we are in a very different position than most other companies where managing risk means you manage the net sales via the demand part of it. we think the demand is our strength and the driver and it has been.
so we're trying to manage the risk entirely by giving ourselves plenty of cushion and plenty of room on the supply side.
anoori naughton -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
that's helpful.
operator
thank you. our next question is from mark astrachan with stifel. please proceed with your question.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah. hey. afternoon, everyone. hope all is well.
i guess just directionally following up on that. you talked about, i guess, what, mid-teens 15% or so benefit from pricing this year. you're guiding to 35%. so that implies volume trends a lot weaker than where they were running.
a year ago, you talked about elasticity having not a huge impact. and obviously, everybody else in pet is taking price. so maybe if you could kind of parse those two pieces out there and why this number couldn't, i guess, be potentially bigger. i mean i get wanting to guide conservatively, but price is obviously a much bigger piece of the puzzle this year relative to what it's been historically.
so how do you think about that? and then theoretically, i guess you talked about in the presentation staff capacity, which is still $100 million plus above what you guided to for revenue. so is that something that you can potentially meet if demand is there, again, potentially to what scott was talking about in terms of kind of the perfect storm here of advertising spend and innovation, etc.? so that's a lot, but anything there is helpful.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
let me take the front part of it and tell you -- remind because we did put an awful lot into our prepared comments. but to the first part of your question about pricing, 15%, what we said in the comments was that the -- we've built into our plans that unit movement would be about 10 points below what the net sales movement -- or the measured track movement would be. so we're getting about a 10-point help instead of the 15 points that come from pricing. so that's the assumption that we've got in the plan for price sensitivity.
if price sensitivity turns out to be less than that, if it's a straight benefit to the bottom line, that would imply five more points of growth from -- purely from the pricing. scott, do you want to just talk about the upside as you see it based on the demand side of it?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
well, let me touch just a little bit on what we know on pricing at this point, just to level set everybody, if that's all right. so on dry, we're seeing between 8% and 12%. on wet, we're seeing -- and i'm talking about like where it's going to land, right? and i don't have a crystal ball, but i'm just -- from what i can see so far, it looks like it's 8% to 12% and wet is going to be 12% to 30%. as we've mentioned, we're at about 17% on the two increases together.
the first one is in place. the second one is effective as of today, and that was in the script. i think it's also in the presentation. so we have seen a couple of specific places where there have been moves on a few items.
from the first price increase moves on a few items for the full price increase already. so let me talk about the first price increase. and mark, i don't know if i can totally answer your question, but i'm going to give you pieces to the puzzle. so if you look at the first price increase, what we've seen so far, which is about 5% -- between 5% and 6%, depending on the item, it looks like there's virtually no impact so far.
now it's really hard to read because there's a lot of different drivers going on. we're getting back in stock. we also see a little bit of mix. but it looks like there's almost no price increase.
there were a few instances, as i was mentioning, where there are a few skus and are some of our top customers where they've gone ahead and moved all of it already. one of those is our six-pound chicken roll, for example. and we've seen about a 15% price increase, which would encompass the move from both the first and the second price increase of the majority of it. and that item over the course of february is up 86% in that same retailer.
so it's really hard to read, but it looks like we are moving through the pricing really, really well. but again, we don't know where it's all going to land, we don't know what's going to happen when the entire line is up, but it looks very encouraging at this point. and as we were touching on -- i was touching on earlier, from a demand perspective, it looks like consumers are waiting for us to get back in stock and get back into our products.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from steph wissink with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
thanks. thank you. good afternoon, everyone. i want to just pull on the common thread here again and try to stress test your plans for distribution.
so you talked about demand and what your anticipation is for maybe a little bit of household penetration destruction and then revival in the back half. but talk a little bit about the retailer conversations and how your commitments are in terms of fridge expansion. i think you also mentioned some larger refrigerators. just help us reconcile the guidance with what portion is unit growth, demand growth versus some incremental accessibility growth with distribution.
thank you.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, do you want to take that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. absolutely. the vast majority of our growth this year is going to come through penetration and buying rate. the biggest piece should be penetration.
the way we think about it is our advertising and marketing should drive about 80% of our total growth in the year. and some -- and then the last two pieces of distribution and innovation should be the other driver. so i would say about 80% of our total growth should come through the marketing and the advertising that we're putting in place. so it is the key driver, although we are getting more stores, and we have in the presentation, you'll see there's a lot of information, i know.
you'll see about over 1,300 new stores. you'll see significant increases in -- not only are we upgrading almost 1,000 fridges, but we're also adding a fair number, almost 900 second fridges. so all of those pieces are coming into play. and the one thing i will say is that i think we have been very transparent with the retailers and all of our communications all along the way.
we have been far from perfect, but we have delivered lots and lots of bad news. and i think we've laid out the plan that we shared with them early last year about what we're building. we're now being able to show them not only what we're building tangibly both kitchens 2.0 and what we're doing in ennis and kitchens south, but now we're actually starting to really fill trucks at different types of levels. and i think that there is a tremendous amount of confidence in working together with us to really build out the freshpet food category.

thank you. our next question comes from bill chappell with truist securities. please proceed with your question.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. 
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
good afternoon. 
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
i just want to understand, i guess, two things. one on the absorption and one on kind of the sales of refilling the shelves. on the absorption, is this, basically, you're building a safety stock and even if demand is greater than you expect, you want a high level of safety stock, which i guess could go stale throughout the year? or could that number come down meaningfully if demand goes up? and then on the revenue, in terms of filling the channel, i think we expected last quarter, your initial expectations were much higher than consumption growth as you were refilling the channels. that didn't happen because of the supply chain issue.
so i would have thought that you would have a big bump in this first quarter as you finally are refilling the fridges. is that not the case? is that just happening more throughout the year? or am i missing something? so i guess, first, help me understand the absorption and how it works through the year and help me understand the kind of the flow of revenue as you refill the shelves. thanks.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
bill, let me take the second part of your question, and then heather will answer the first part of your question. but on the second part of your question, we pretty much completed the trade inventory refill as of this week. we've been shipping very strongly. and as i indicated in the prepared comments, our net sales -- our sales to date are up about 38%.
last year's march was a little bit -- last year's february was weak. this -- last year's march was much stronger because we were bouncing back from all the storms we had in february. so you'd expect that we got some benefit. and what we're giving you is a projection for the first quarter that will kind of be online with where we want to be.
i would also just caution that we are doing -- as we said, we completed our erp conversion, and we feel very good about where we are. but we just want to give ourselves a little bit of breathing room in case there are any glitches or any issues with trucking or anything else that might happen like happened in q4. so we're trying to be a little bit cautious and conservative on it. but the trade inventory refill is pretty much done.
fresh from the kitchen was going to be the last thing we refilled, and we haven't cut a case on fresh from the kitchen in three weeks. so we've been shipping pretty full. heather, you want to take the first part of the question?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sure. yeah. so bill, it's not a safety stock. the way you want to think about it is when we call it buffer capacity, it's really stacked capacity in our cost structure.
so we're planning for staffed capacity that supports a business that could be upwards of 15% greater. so if we had no supply chain kind of operational issues and same -- continue to operate smoothly with no disruption, then increased demand can be supported by the fixed cost structure that we have in place, 15% more. having said that, in months where we might have some sort of operational disruption, and we talked about in our prepared remarks around what happened in january with omicron where we shut down the line during the month of january, that allowed us to sort of operate and support the demand that was there without disrupting customer service. and so that does eat away at that buffer.
but having said that, it allows for that disruption without missing any sort of -- missing our sales guide. so it protects on the upside. if we do have the upside, then that, of course, takes away the margin impact as well.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
so just to be clear, as we move to the fourth quarter, you would expect kind of the run rate of that absorption to be kind of low single-digit millions? is that right? i mean you're starting high and then you're kind of growing into it. you won't hold this kind of level forever.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
i mean i think we will always plan to have some buffer capacity given our level of growth. but having said that, the outcome of how this impacts the financials will depend on how things progress. if we could face margin impact and absorb -- and not absorb any of it, if every month we have some sort of operational constraints, which we don't expect to have like january, but having said that, we could also support a higher demand, and that's why we're spending on media ahead and trying to invest for that increased growth. we can absorb that with this buffer capacity as well.
so by the end of the year, it will either result in higher -- supporting higher demand, and so therefore, you would achieve a higher margin. or it would support the guide and not impact margin because we had that buffer capacity there.
operator
thank you. our next question is from robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks. i was hoping for a little more clarity on slide 37, where you show the profitability of bethlehem campus when it's $535 million in sales. and i guess that's what i'm questioning is your total company is not at $535 million yet.
so what's the sales basis for this scenario? and how do you come by these numbers that shows the cash generation?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
heather, do you want to take that?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sure. the $535 million is a capacity view of the bethlehem campus, rob. so -- and what we've done is we've taken -- and this is simply a reflection of the capacity of the facility in revenue, the cost structure related to that, which is now -- it's not fixed because we'll continue to drive efficiency initiatives and drive cost savings initiatives to even improve that. but as it stands right now, when you look at that net sales capacity with the current cost structure of bethlehem, you have a 50.2% margin.
so that's the first stopping point. then what we've done is we've taken a fair share of the sg&a expenditures to have a view of what is that -- what does the contribution of that facility look like. and again, that's the current shape of our sg&a expenditures, which we know we're working on driving further improvements via scale, via growth, leverage in g&a, as well as logistics scale. so that will even improve.
but we wanted to take sort of a stopping point to say what is this worth now, knowing that it will even get better. and that's what that margin represents.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
rob, just to clarify one point, the $535 million, as it says in the footnote down there, is a total company sales of $600 million. it would mean that if we were deciding to use all the capacity in bethlehem and source the rest of the stuff that we -- to get to a $600 million number would come from other sites. we may choose in -- depending on the mix of the products that we sell this year, we may choose to not have some of it come from bethlehem. some of them might come from kitchens south, they might come from ennis depending on what kind it is and where it is.
but at the capacity and staffing plan that we've demonstrated and proven and we're operating today, this is what you deliver at the pricing. this is at the full year -- if you had a full year of the pricing that's in place as of today.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
so it's also the full -- it also assumes all the pricing goes through as well, right?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. that's in the footnote. the full year benefit of the 2/28/22 price increase.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. so it assumes all of your pricing is offsetting the inflation, which has been substantial. that's [inaudible].
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
correct. it just results in basically a two-month correction because you didn't have the pricing in january and february, but you had the costs.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. i'll stop there. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from brian holland with cowen. please proceed with your question.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah, thanks. good evening. so just to clarify here on the guide and the $13 million to $17 million, you're front-loading your media spend. i think, billy, you mentioned potentially leaning heavier into the media spend as we go through the year.
so is the thought process here that as long as the risk factors that you laid out that are supporting the -- why you would want to have that buffer capacity in place. so -- and it comes online on time or no further delays than what you've currently projected. everything else is ok. and you're seeing the correlation between your media spend and your sales, you would lean into those -- you would lean into that excess buffer capacity in the second half of the year through increased media spend that would close the gap between your buffer capacity, which is $660 million, and we would lose the unabsorbed cost, assuming that's what you chose to do.
is that the way to think about that?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
conceptually, you're right. there's a timing issue in all those -- in that scenario that you laid out, where as we said, we're front-loading the media. it's like 65% first half, 35% in the second half. if we found ourselves running toward net sales that were well in excess of what our plan is, we would have the opportunity to add more media in the second half.
you wouldn't get as significant a benefit. it was more carrying you toward the next year, but you would have that opportunity. but there are lead times both on the media commitments, as well as on the -- making sure you ramp up all the right staffing in the right places. we will have plenty of staffing to support a significant part of that.
we just want to make sure they're also reflecting whatever the risks are that are out there, whether they're transportation risks, whether they were ingredient risks, whatever. there could always be some of those other elements that constrain us. and we just want to make sure that we have the capacity before we lean into the higher level of media.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
understood. and then just on the media spend, you mentioned international and you're attacking france into that mix now and leaning heavier into that. and maybe -- i don't know if it's possible to dimensionalize between kind of like media spend behind north america or u.s. specifically and the rest.
but if we think about that, how much are we spending on the u.s. relative to -- are we leaning in heavier there? or is that spend kind of the same [inaudible] heavier?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. it's like 90% u.s. is the way to think about it. and --
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
brian, strategically and conceptually, we source the u.s. to where we think it needs to be before we put the revenue into the other markets. but -- or to the media and to the other markets, but we have more than adequately funded the other markets. but we do not put media money into those countries at the expense of the u.s.
operator
thank you. our next question is from peter benedict with baird. please proceed with your question.
peter benedict -- baird -- analyst
guys, thanks. two questions. first, can you maybe talk about the capex budget? how do you kind of see that this year and maybe next? and how kind of the -- maybe the borrowings are going to flow? that's my first question.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
heather, do you want to take that?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i know we touched on in the prepared remarks that we're looking at our plans, and we are doing that. but from a 2022 perspective, from a spend perspective, it's largely in line with what we've shared, so just from a financial perspective. and we're reviewing the plans, as we said.
of course, as you know, from a marketplace perspective, there's longer lead times and inflation that we're facing. but our focus in looking at the refined plans is really around taking as an opportunity to look for capital efficiency and ways to optimize. and so one of the things that we are doing is looking at our existing infrastructure and how we can continue to expand on our existing infrastructure, as well as increased capacity in smaller increments. so it's all in the works.
and what you should know from a funding perspective, consistent with what we shared at icr, is that we're looking to amend our credit agreement at this point to provide the flexibility to support those plans.
peter benedict -- baird -- analyst
ok. and then just wanted to clarify kind of the cost view that's, i guess, embedded here with the inflation. are you just assuming that the costs that you exited the fourth quarter with are kind of what's going to persist for the rest of the year? is it more what you're seeing today, you're assuming continues the rest of the year? or are you assuming either any relief on the inflation front or incremental headwinds? and i understand that cost inflation is on commodities. it's on freight.
it's not a whole variety of things. but just trying to understand how you've built this plan from that perspective.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sure. so first of all, this reflects what we know, of course, exiting 2021, coupled with what we locked in, in terms of our chicken contract, which is a meaningful piece as well. it contemplates our expectations of inflation for this year, for the full year, as best we know it right now. a lot of what we buy is on a contract, but there is variability, of course, within the cost structure as we saw, of course, in 2021.
what you see in terms of margin impact is a reflection of our best expectations of this inflation, but a mismatch really around price versus inflation where the second price increase, as we mentioned, started today. so you're missing, when you think about when that comes in, it's about two and a half months of a mismatch in terms of price versus inflation.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from bryan spillane with bank of america. please proceed with your question.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, everyone. just two quick ones for me. the first one, maybe this is just -- i'm a little dense on this, but if we're looking at the $660 million, i guess, staffed capacity at q4, how much of that -- does that include both price increases? and i guess as we're trying to think available capacity for '23, how much of it has been increased, i guess, just in pure pounds versus dollars available just because you've got more pricing now contemplated than, i guess, you would have thought a year ago? so just trying to see if there's actually more pound capacity available and that there's not a risk that you can -- if you over-deliver on volume, that that creates some additional tightness in capacity.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
so it's a little bit complicated because there's a lot of moving parts in there. first, we actualized all of the capacity numbers based on what our run experience has been. the efficiencies we're seeing, the yields we're seeing. we -- that $660 million number that we had been sharing before had been prior to the assumptions for price increases.
so theoretically, there's the increased value of the price increases that would flow through. there is some mix differences because those different items, the capacity doesn't necessarily all match up with the same size of the price increases. so there's some moving parts that are in there. the broader question is, is there some risk that we're going to be tight on the pounds capacity in this plan? we think we've got plenty of headroom and we have the ability to flex the headroom quite a bit.
if you think about what we said in the prepared remarks, the first place that we could be tight is going to be on rolls. the rolls line that's coming up in the third quarter now from ennis is going to be -- we're going to be tightest on rolls when we get there. once that comes on, it is such a large increment of capacity, we should be fine in rolls for a while. the next place we're going to have capacity tightness in pounds will be on fresh from the kitchen, and that's where we'll be heavily dependent on the bag line that comes up in ennis, which will be coming up in the fourth quarter.
but we'll have lots of roasted meals bag capacity. so if the demand that comes in, as it comes in throughout the year, is on roasted meals, there's no issue with available capacity. depending on where you are in rolls and fresh from the kitchen, you could be just short of capacity coming on. but once it's on, you have -- we have more than enough pound capacity and the ability to expand that pound capacity through incremental staffing hours.
so it's a long-winded way of saying, i'm not worried about the pound side of this thing. i think that we're pretty well prepared for that, assuming we get the construction of ennis up and get it started up.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. no, that's helpful. and then maybe just one-second question, billy, is just -- can you just give us a sense or your perspective on just how competitors in the fresh segment coming into the market have impacted the demand for fresh. and i guess we've seen a lot of advertising for the farmer's dog and their social media following, right, as followers have increased substantially in the last six months.
you've got, i guess, just food for dogs now in petco with distribution there and frozen. so just trying to understand, as you see more competitors coming into the market, is it actually just expanding awareness of fresh? is it just good for the segment in general? or are you concerned at all about just the competitive dynamics heating up?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
i would say that with the world exploding in our case, and it's just making the opportunity now much bigger, but scott can give you a lot better color on it.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. so obviously, we keep a really close eye on all of this. and i think maybe the best place to answer that or start with that is, when we look at where the future state is, and you've heard us talk a little bit about that, but we believe that the future state for fresh and fresh and frozen, however people want to divvy it up, it's kind of a $6 billion kind of piece of the pie. some people have seen $4 billion, some people have seen $6 billion.
it's a very, very big piece of the category into the future. so there's a tremendous amount of potential. i mean, obviously, our goal is we're the incumbent. we think we have an incredible proposition portfolio.
we've built a -- we've been really thoughtful to try and build a really, really good business. so we've seen a lot of people come in over time. i mean there was -- i think you remember probably a few years ago, there was a $1 billion margo product, and there was a farmers market product. the frozen dtc guys have -- they've been around since like 2015 -- 2014, 2015.
pick your number. they've been growing. they've grown to well over $200 million in retail -- a retail number. so we've seen a lot going on.
and all during that time, we've been able to maintain a 25%, 30%, 35% growth rate, depending on the year. so we think there's an incredibly big tam. we know that we've been able to grow incredibly well through it. and then as we've watched some of these competitors come to market and multiple different classes of trade, typically, our performance has not been impacted whatsoever at the retailer they're at.
and we've also tend to outperform them significantly. so i mean it's interesting. i mean i think that there is a piece of business there. i think that we're going to have the vast majority of this kind of pie.
and i think that there's going to be several other people that are going to try and divvy up the smaller piece of the total market. and then the other thing i will say is what the other people have done from an innovation standpoint and how they thought about it, it's -- we have not been -- we have been paying close attention. and i think that they have uncovered some consumer opportunity, and it's something that we've been working a lot on. and we think we're going -- later this year, the work that we've done and the innovation that we're going to bring will completely upend the dtc landscape with many of those brands coming in.
so i think we're really well-positioned. i mean i know it's our company. i know i'm one of the founders. i know it's hard to not be incredibly bullish.
but i think we're in a really, really good position. and i think that those guys will make progress. i think we're just going to make so much more progress and have so much scale and so much know-how and also be fresh, which i believe is better than frozen. i think we're going to end up in a really good spot.

thank you. our next question is from jason english with goldman sachs. please proceed with your question.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey, good afternoon, folks. congrats on the capacity, for getting that rightsized. you mentioned the step-up in media to 12% of sales. can you tell us where you finished 2021 out?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
heather, do you have that?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yeah, i do. we finished '22 -- i'm just pulling it up really quick to give you more -- about 10.5 -- a little over 10.5%.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
ok. so this was the biggest year of year-on-year increase in media spend, i think, in the company's history. but you're pointing to it as a driver of the slowing penetration growth. how do i put those two?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
i mean the biggest -- scott, go ahead.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah, jason, i think it's a really key point. and the biggest challenge we've had is we've had periods where we are completely out of stock on cat food. we're completely out of stock on bags or completely out of stock on rolls. and over the course of the year, you can see those moves where when we are out of stock on those specific items that people tend to really prefer like forms, which is really the first decision that people make, we lose those people for periods of time.
now what i can tell you is when those products come back in stock, the growth rate is extraordinary and it's explosive. and i can show you -- to you like by item. so when we finally get all of our products in, i think we're going to have really, really significant explosion in our penetration. now i think it's an interesting way to look at it.
but in a way, being -- having all that adversity this past year and being able to put up the growth numbers that we put up, and it coming more from buying rate, i think it demonstrates the dedication that a lot of consumers have to our product and how they're willing to stick with us, because quite honestly, we did not -- we aggravate a lot of folks. so we're keeping a close eye on it. it looks -- it appears like we're off to a really good start. the business is responding well to media already this year.
you can see it in the growth rate. you're going to see penetration as it's always a slightly trailing indicator before we get into the data. but it looks like we're going to be back on track with our penetration growth.
jason english -- goldman sachs -- analyst
scott, in terms of back on track, you were running sort of low- to mid-teens penetration growth pre-covid. and over the last two years, so your two-year cagr, during covid is around 16%. why isn't that on track? like if -- so now i heard you cited 24% number, i'm not sure where that is, but at least on the data we're looking at, your longer-term cagr on penetration has been sort of mid-teens. but you're underwriting something above trend.
what gives you that confidence?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
let me just take a shot. i think i'm not sure what data you're looking at on the penetration numbers. but as we think about the penetration, the penetration gains were in the 20s for back-to-back years in the years '19 and '20. and when we look at it and look at the media spending and the conversion from that into [inaudible], it's been at a very consistent rate.
and consistently improving rate where the only year where we are off with is in '21, and we are off because, frankly, we'd be out of stocks. we had a better-than-expected year in '20 because of all the pandemic-related stuff, but we -- '21, the efficiency in '21 for a conversion of media into penetration was better than what it was in '19. so we saw a continued improvement. and so if you convert the media spending that we're planning this year into household penetration, we feel comfortable we're going to get back to where we were, the trend line that we were on.
operator
thank you. our next question is from rupesh parikh with oppenheimer. please proceed with your question.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. and i'll be quick here. so just in terms of the guidance, the $13 million to $17 million unabsorbed expenses, so if we see higher sales during the year, would the flow-through be higher than normal for these sales?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
heather, do you want to take that?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
rupesh, can you just clarify what you mean on flow-through?
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
yeah. so you already have these costs built into your base of $13 million to $17 million. so if you end up seeing higher sales in your guidance, would the flow-through on those incremental sales be higher than normal?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
it will be. yeah. you will just have the variable costs on there. so we will basically improve margin.
for each dollar above, you get a margin benefit because you don't increase the plant costs related to that. and that's commercialized in our slide deck as well, where you see the adjusted ebitda impact on the flow-through as well there.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok. great. and then just one more quick question. i know labor availability and freight costs were a headwind last year.
what are you guys seeing right now on the labor availability front? and then for freight cost, i know it's very volatile out there. have you seen any stabilization? or is this still hard to conclude where it's going to end up?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
i'll take a shot at that. the labor part, we think the move that we made last year is -- was the right one, and it's working. and we have seen an improvement in our retention rate or think of it as we've cut in half the turnover rate that we were seeing before. and so we feel very good about the move we made.
it's not -- doesn't mean that we're perfect. we have to stay on top of it. we also did some changes in the employee benefits that are designed to better meet the needs of the younger workforce that we have today. but we feel like that move has worked, and we're not worried about labor availability, at least not for the foreseeable future.
on the freight side, that is a tough market. we're seeing costs go up because of fuel costs, and we're also seeing the availability of trucking. it is better now than it was in the end of the fourth quarter, but it's still not what i would call a great place to be. we're far away -- we're a long way away from being in balance and stable on freight and transportation at this point.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jon andersen with william blair. please proceed with your question.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
good afternoon, everybody. most of my questions have been asked and answered. just one quick one. the new fridges for 2022 is a step-up.
it sounds like more than 3,000, whether that be new stores or upgrades or second fridges. can you talk about, first, the cadence that you expect through the year? and second, a little bit of color around where these placements and upgrades are going to be concentrated and what that typically does for you. does it drive household penetration? does it drive buy rate? what's the kind of the benefit as reflected in your primary drivers of your business? thanks.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
hey, jon. so from a cadence standpoint, we believe they're going to be fairly evenly spread through the year, more so than we have seen in certain years, but i would say fairly evenly split. we could end up like a 60-40, but it's going to be pretty darn close to kind of an even spread. where are we getting those placements? part of them are -- almost all of them are existing customers.
there's a couple of newer customers, but almost all of them are existing customers at this point where we're just expanding distribution in stores we're not. on the second fridges, those are stores that are performing quite well and are now either being remodeled or there's a situation where they deemed it where they feel like that we have the need and enough velocity and demand to add a second bridge in there. and the way we think about all of the fridges being placed, not only new but also second fridges, is we use them as a multiplier effect on our marketing on our advertising. so if we have a year where we have extraordinary -- so we think of it -- it's interesting because jason was touching on this question a minute ago.
when we think about acquiring consumers, we typically look at it from a cac basis, like a consumer acquisition basis. so what does it cost us to acquire a consumer for our business? and the range has been, call it, $45 to $55. let's just say that's the range. it's pretty close in there, depending on the year and depending on what's going on.
if we have a year where we get extraordinary placements, we have really good advertising and really good innovation, you're going to see things on the lower end. so like a $45 cac or so from an acquisition standpoint. if we didn't have any of that, you might see kind of 55% or slightly higher. now last year was an exceptional year because of the out-of-stock issues.
but that's kind of how we think about it and how it helps -- kind of think of it as a complement to the overall kind of growth on the business. again, about 80% of the growth is driven in marketing. is the marketing slightly more effective because we get a lot more fridges, there are higher visibility fridges, and we have really good innovation? so that's really kind of how we typically kind of think about building the revenue model for the business.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
that's helpful. if i could squeeze one follow-up in on innovation. billy, i think you mentioned a good slate of innovation mostly midyear. i know you're not going to talk about specific items, not asking you to talk about specific items.
but can you talk conceptually about the size of the innovation pipeline? and maybe the focus of it, type of dog, occasions, different forms, just to give us a sense for what we may be opening up here in terms of incremental tam. thanks.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
i don't think we have enough time for scott to answer that question.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
so jon, it's another one of these things where we spend a lot of time thinking about. i think we've gotten to a point where we know when we're adding innovation, the innovation is going to improve our business performance. we're not -- because -- like some people have unlimited shelves, right, or the potential of unlimited shelves. we don't.
we have our fridges, and we sometimes have second fridges. so we want to be very, very prudent and thoughtful in the innovation we're bringing to market. so when we're testing innovation, it has to be more successful than what we already have out there, and it has to bring incremental consumers into the business, into the portfolio. so that's really how we evaluate it.
so we have a -- we continue to always identify where are their gaps and where are their opportunities. one of the things we've seen is there is a lot of opportunity around site specific items, certain sizes of dogs, certain aspects around sustainability, people really interested in. we're going to do more and more around sustainability. you'll see different things that we're doing on our lines and our businesses and our products.
you're also going to see more and more plant-based items continue to come. we think there's a tremendous area of opportunity. and then finally, we know that convenience and customization is really, really interesting to a subset of consumers. and that's really what we want to tackle, and we think that we have an opportunity from a fresh perspective to do an amazing job customizing and creating a very convenient products for consumers that feel very specific to their pets.
so there's a pretty broad array. probably, i think late this year, we'll probably do a very extensive sharing session with the investor and analyst community, and we'd love to kind of share more details at that point.
operator

operator
greetings, and welcome to the freshpet fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, jeff sonnek with icr. thank you, jeff.
you may begin.
jeff sonnek -- investor relations
thank you. good afternoon, and welcome to freshpet's fourth quarter 2021 earnings call and webcast. on today's call are billy cyr, chief executive officer; and heather pomerantz, chief financial officer. scott morris, chief operating officer, will also be available for q&a.
before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, management may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. these statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. please refer to the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec and the company's press release issued today for a detailed discussion of the risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. please note that on today's call, management will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures such as ebitda and adjusted ebitda, among others.
while the company believes these non-gaap financial measures provide useful information for investors, the presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with gaap. please refer to today's press release for how management defines such non-gaap measures to reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap and limitations associated with such non-gaap measures. finally, the company has produced a presentation that contains many of the key metrics that will be discussed on this call. that presentation can be found on the company's investor website.
management's commentary will not specifically walk through the presentation on the call, but rather it's a summary of the results and guidance they will discuss today. now i'd like to turn the call over to billy cyr, chief executive officer. 
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
thank you, jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. the message i would like you to take away from today's call is that we finally have the capacity needed to support our significant growth potential and build upon the momentum that we've created through five consecutive years of accelerating revenue growth. we fully intend to take advantage of that capacity. but we've also learned some hard yet valuable lessons over the past two years.
those lessons are the foundation for the conservative planning that we've undertaken in which we believe is required in this complex and challenging environment. over the past two years, we've navigated everything from the covid crisis to labor shortages, to supply chain issues and inflation. our operations wobbled numerous times along the way, and we are keenly aware of the impact those have had on our many stakeholders, most notably our customers and consumers. we learned that in order to deliver a long-term sustainable growth freshpet is capable of, we need to do a better job preparing for and insulating ourselves from those issues.
the environment we are operating in today still has many of the issues we have faced over the past two years, albeit some are less impactful like covid and others are more impactful like inflation. but the more important change is how well we prepare for those issues and plan for new and unknown challenge. we finally have more than enough capacity and have more coming online. we have stabilized, trained and developed our workforce and we have completed our erp conversion.
further, we have strengthened our marketing programs, increased our innovation, installed more and larger fridges and built a broader and deeper management team. we have a rare opportunity to change the way people feed their pets forever and build a truly great company. to do that, though, we need to plan and prepare for continued disruption to ensure the reliability of our operations in an uncertain environment while also planning to aggressively maximize freshpet's growth potential. we believe the plan we are sharing with you today strikes the right balance between the two.
perhaps the most important decision we are making to achieve that relates to how we will manage our capacity. we successfully built enough capacity to refill the trade inventory hole we created during 2020 and early 2021. it took a long time to refill that hole, and to do it, we had to both delay our growth and increase our production to a level well in excess of demand. for perspective, in february, we produced at an annualized run rate of approximately $600 million in net sales, while our consumption run rate was approximately $490 million in net sales.
so we are currently producing at an annualized run rate more than $100 million greater than demand. that is the magnitude of the production increase we had to put in place to refill the trade inventory hole. please note that both the production and net sales numbers i just provided are at the pricing in place in february prior to our second price increase. we also have more capacity coming online throughout 2022, both in ennis and kitchens south.
that gives us plenty of headroom to grow, and we plan to use it. we expect to grow at a rapid rate, and we'll invest in marketing early in the year to drive our growth, but it will take time to fill that much capacity. so for a period of time, we will have more capacity than our reasonable and conservative assumptions would indicate you will need. and excess capacity generally means excess cost.
we debated quite a bit about the best way to manage that. we analyzed the pros and cons of delaying our capacity additions and scaling back production staffing to deliver more robust margins this year. in doing so, we are mindful of several important risk factors. first, erp conversion.
we just completed our erp conversion. and while it is going well, as anyone who has done one can tell you, there are always bumps along the way. second, construction and start-up of ennis. we are heavily dependent on the completion of the construction of our ennis, texas facility and a successful start-up, now delayed to early q3 due to construction material shortages.
as we all know, it is very difficult to get construction materials and equipment delays are numerous and lengthy. further start-ups always come with some level of risk. third, tight labor markets. we're in the midst of one of the tightest labor markets in decades.
we've worked hard to build a team of highly skilled employees and have real momentum with our training program, the freshpet academy. we are seeing the dividends of that labor strategy every day, but the labor market remains a risk. fourth, supply chain disruptions. up and down the supply chain, we are seeing interruptions brought on by everything from labor shortages to port blockages, to material shortages and even mandate and lockdown protests and now avian flu.
reliability of supply and transportation, something we used to take for granted, can no longer be assumed, and many of the shortages are unpredictable. for example, who would have thought that a canadian vaccine mandate protest by truckers would disrupt the carrot supply in the u.s.? fifth, covid. while we all hope that covid is largely behind us, and we can return to some level of normalcy, we would look foolish if our plan required that. this virus and the magnitude of its impact on families and the supply chain has constantly surprised people, and we don't want to be in that spot again.
and sixth, pricing and inflation. finally, we have taken the most significant price increase we have ever taken, and we are budgeting for a reasonable level of price sensitivity. however, if we have less price sensitivity than we have modeled, we do not want to get ourselves in a position where we cannot supply our customers and consumers reliably. alternatively, while we lock our costs on as many of our ingredients and materials as we can prior to the beginning of the year, some of them continue to flow.
the pricing actions we have taken have fully addressed the inflation we saw and anticipated at the time we took the pricing, but we continue to watch the costs. and if we see higher costs persist for any reasonable length of time, we will not hesitate to take the necessary pricing to recover those costs as quickly as possible. given those factors, we have made the decision to carry buffer manufacturing capacity this year. that is capacity that is more than we theoretically need to meet the guidance we are providing.
we view this as a very important strategic decision and the result of our experience over the past two years. we have a unique opportunity to create and define the freshpet food market and capture the lion's share of it as long as we can reliably supply our customers and consumers. failing to do so opens the door for competitors and encourages our customers and consumers to look elsewhere, squandering our first-mover advantage. that is a risk we are not willing to take.
the cost of the unabsorbed overhead created with this approach is significant in the short run, costing us approximately $13 million to $17 million for the year, or approximately 225 to 300 basis points of adjusted gross margin, but incredibly inexpensive over the long run. if that investment enables us to capture and maintain a much larger share of the emerging market for freshpet food for a long time, that investment will look tiny in comparison to the opportunity it created. this approach has already paid dividends for us. in january, we were able to shut down one production line for much of the month to absorb the higher absenteeism due to omicron and still keep up with demand rather than digging a deeper trade inventory hole and further frustrating our customers and consumers.
the result, despite all the challenges of omicron, our fill rates improved from the mid-60s in december to the high 80s last week, and our year-to-date shipments are up 38% versus a year ago. this approach also allows us to meet demand if it exceeds our projections, which is possible if we experience less price sensitivity than we planned or our advertising proves to be more effective than anticipated. finally, it can enable us to opportunistically expand distribution or launch innovative new products. if any of those generate upside volume, that would help us absorb the overhead investment we are making.
we are also convinced we will need that capacity by late q4 of this year and believe it would be counterproductive to scale back the capacity only to have to ramp it back up in less than six months. this is especially true with regard to labor as we've worked hard to recruit and train the talent needed to overcome the pandemic challenges. it is imperative that we strategically build upon our talent and labor pool, not diminish it. i suspect there are some of you who wish our capacity would be more elastic, so do i.
but when we have the only production capacity capable of producing our best-in-class products, the only flex is within our network. unlike so many other fast-growing companies who can turn on and turn off co-packers, we can't do that. we are building the largest, most efficient and most highly capable freshpet food manufacturing base capable of supporting a business of $2 billion or more. we view that as a strategic advantage, and we will need all the capacity we are operating now by the end of this year, and we'll need even more next year.
to help you understand the impact of this choice, we will be providing a margin and profit illustration at the end of each quarter and for the year that dimensionalizes the cost. as i said, it is sizable. but against the scale of the long-term opportunity we are seizing, it is a small price to pay. we will be able to continue and accelerate our momentum, restore our credibility with customers and consumers and insulate ourselves from the volatility that may be ahead of us.
with that context, let me outline some of the key points of our plan for 2022. first, we are guiding to greater than $575 million in net sales for the year. if we deliver that, we will have generated 35% growth for the year, our sixth consecutive year of accelerating growth. that net sales target is inclusive of a blended pricing impact of approximately 15%, i.e., the fiscal year impact of the two price increases we have announced and implemented, and an assumption of some price elasticity due to the magnitude of the price increases.
while we believe our brand and pet food in general are relatively inelastic, our projections assume that net sales growth will be about 10 points greater than unit movement growth. our guidance also includes an understanding of the headwind we have due to the trade inventory refill in the year ago, partially offset by the more modest trade inventory refill we are completing on bags in q1. a 35% growth rate might not sound like it is a conservative assumption. however, our year-to-date nielsens are up approximately 35% and accelerating with the most recent weeks up approximately 40%, and that is before we get any benefit from the second price increase.
further, we will be lapping an extended period of out-of-stocks and delayed marketing in the year ago for most of the first half of 2022. to deliver those net sales, we will lean heavily on our advertising program. our advertising investment is approximately 12% of net sales and more heavily front-loaded, consistent with the way we did our media planning in years prior to the pandemic. if those investments put us ahead of our plans by midyear, we would add more media later in the year to keep the momentum going and utilize the buffer capacity we have.
we are also watching the impact that the higher pricing will have on our household penetration and buying rate. we believe that we will have a short-term setback on household penetration when the higher pricing first appears on the shelf, but it will quickly turn positive as we have full distribution, a heavier media plan and increased fridge placements. the buying rate will likely benefit from the higher pricing, even if a small number of consumers choose to use less freshpet and make our long-term target more achievable. however, there will be some offset due to the rapid influx of new buyers as the year progresses.
at retail, we are expecting our customers to lean into more distribution this year now that we have ample supply to support them. we are expecting approximately 1,300 net new stores and approximately 1,775 upgrades and second fridges this year. we will be introducing a variety of new products this year, with many of them launching toward midyear or later. stay tuned for formal announcements down the road.
based on our success in the u.k. and canada, we are going to invest further in those markets through increased media to support expected distribution gains. we are also beginning phase 1 of our launch in france. we've been testing in about a dozen grocery stores in france for much of the past year and are ready to move to the next step there, expanding into a larger number of stores and beginning a media investment in several markets.
our goal is to not only make this market a success, but to also validate that our process for qualifying and launching into a new country can be done more efficiently than we've done in the u.k. so far, we feel good about the progress we are making there and have begun to prospect for our next country. to support this anticipated growth, we will be starting up several new lines this year. as i mentioned earlier, the capacity we are operating today produced at an annualized run rate of approximately $600 million in february at the pricing in place then.
however, as we grow, we will run out of capacity on some specific items by midyear, so we need to bring on new capacity to support them. in simple terms, we will have excess roasted meals capacity for much of 2022, but we'll need to add rolls capacity midyear and fresh from the kitchen capacity by q4. in total, we will have installed capacity with operations ramping up that could support almost $1 billion in net sales by the end of 2022. as we get a better idea on the actual demand and mix we will have in 2023, we will make the necessary plans to scale the capacity to better fit the demand.
that will come through the pace of adding staffing and start-up timing. however, it is important to note that we will also be doing as much to create demand to fill the capacity as we can reasonably justify. we have a unique first-mover advantage, and we want to convert as many pet parents to the freshpet regimen as possible before any meaningful competition arise. as significant as that capacity is, we know that we will need more in 2023 and beyond.
the significant increase in lead times for capital equipment and construction are causing us to revisit our capacity addition plans. we are taking a prudent approach, balancing our projected growth, the new lead times and the significant inflation in the cost of materials. the bottom line is that we aim to be as efficient with our capital as possible to meet our rising -- rapidly rising demand, and we are amending our credit agreement to provide the necessary flexibility. but let me be clear, the fundamental strategy and goals have not changed.
however, we will be putting added emphasis on projects that build on our existing infrastructure and resources and enable us to scale our production more quickly and in smaller increments. those adjustments to our capacity planning do not impact our 2025 goals to deliver 11 million households $1.25 billion in net sales and a 25% adjusted ebitda margin. rather, they ensure that we can reach them in this more fluid and complex operating environment while being as efficient as possible with shareholder capital. we remain very committed to those goals and believe the plan we're laying out today will put us well on our way toward achieving them.
before i turn it over to heather, let me briefly summarize the key points i want you to take away. first, we have finally refilled the trade inventory and have ample capacity to support reliable and consistent retail availability. this will allow us to get back to doing what we do best, i.e., drive the growth of freshpet. second, we have developed a conservative plan that is designed to insulate the business from the numerous external factors that have impacted us over the past two years and others that we may not have encountered yet so that we can maximize our first-mover advantage in this uncertain environment.
third, we have put in place the necessary building blocks to rebuild our margins, including the new erp system that is now operating, the higher pricing to offset inflation and a more stable workforce that can drive productivity improvements. in total, i believe we are very well-positioned to deliver the growth and profitability that freshpet is capable of delivering. i will now turn it over to heather to provide a summary of q4 of 2021 and the details of our 2022 plan.

thank you, billy, and good afternoon, everyone. let me begin with a quick summary of 2021. as we announced in january, we delivered $425.5 million of net sales in 2021, an increase of 33.5% versus 2020 and our fifth consecutive year of accelerating growth. in q4, our net sales grew 37.1% to $115.9 million.
adjusted gross margin for the year was 44.5%, a decline of 380 basis points. in q4, our adjusted gross margin was 41.7%, a decline of 410 basis points. those reductions were largely due to inflation and temporary operating inefficiencies we incurred as we rapidly scaled the business with outdated systems in a turbulent environment. those issues, coupled with higher freight costs due to inflation and our temporary inefficiency, flowed through to the bottom line and resulted in adjusted ebitda for the year of $43 million, a reduction of 8.5% versus the prior year.
adjusted ebitda for q4 was $9.7 million, a decrease of 25% versus a year ago. that decrease was due to the same factors plus a higher marketing investment in the quarter than in the prior year, which was 11.9% of sales, up 620 basis points from the year ago. we are not happy with those results and know we can do much better. we have taken the necessary actions to remedy the problems, but they will take time to flow through our p&l.
the actions we have taken are, first, increased pricing. we announced two price increases that, in total, will increase our pricing by 17.2% when fully in effect. the first price increase went into effect at the end of november and the second price increase went into effect today. the impact in fiscal 2022 will be approximately 15%.
those price increases were designed to cover the margin impact of inflation in our input costs, freight and labor. however, i caution that we are operating in a very dynamic environment, and those costs, particularly freight, remain volatile. if further pricing is needed, we will take it. second, implemented our new erp system.
this system will enable us to plan full truckloads rather than ship half full trucks, creating greater leverage on our freight spend. it will also enable us to implement a pricing system later this year that rewards customers who order efficiently, i.e., in full truckloads and full pallet. third, invested in training and retention. the wage investment we made last year is designed to drive higher quality operations through increased skills of our workforce, and we are seeing signs that it is working.
fourth, invested in automation and equipment upgrades. we shut down our lines last year to install some new automation and to also upgrade some of our older equipment. we have seen the benefits of those upgrades. and fifth, invested in new technology capable of increasing throughput and reducing costs.
as time goes by, a higher and higher percentage of our capacity will be comparable to the equipment we have in kitchens 2, which requires fewer people to produce more product. and we will start up our next manufacturing technology innovation in march. each of those efforts are underway and will gradually begin rebuilding our gross margin to historic run rate. while we'll still encounter some unevenness in costs associated with rapid growth and the addition of new capacity, the overall trend should be very favorable.
turning to our guidance for 2022. billy outlined our net sales guidance of $575 million and the rationale for it. i will instead focus on the cost and profitability. our first priority is to fully support our growth via a significant increase in our media investment.
we expect to spend about 12% of sales in media in the u.s., and it will be front-loaded to begin filling the excess capacity billy described. this is important so that we can jump-start our household penetration increases again. due to the massive out of stocks we had last year and the delays in marketing investments, we only increased household penetration by 6% last year, well below our long-term rate of approximately 24%. we are quite confident that our media program will restore that growth rate even in the face of higher pricing, but it will take a little bit of time.
as you also heard, we are increasing our media investment in canada, the u.k. and for the first time, in france. those efforts are part of a long-term plan to develop a robust international business and eventually have the scale to justify european sourcing. until then, those markets are investments for us with the costs well in excess of the contribution we generate, but the total cost is very manageable within our p&l and is not big enough to justify breaking it out separately yet.
we are also investing in our organizational capability so that we are prepared to support a much larger business and can continue the kinds of innovation our customers and consumers expect from us. we are adding talent, but it will be at a rate that puts us on track to deliver the 1,000 basis points of sg&a leverage we committed as part of our 2025 plan. adjusted gross margin has lots of moving parts this year. we are squarely focused on two important measures of our success, the run rate adjusted gross margin of the fully utilized bethlehem campus and the overall run rate adjusted gross margin of the business before we incur the usual start-up inefficiencies in ennis.
it is important to note that the bethlehem campus will be operating very close to full capacity this year and can provide a reasonable view of the profit and cash generation potential of freshpet at scale. we believe that is a very important proof point for the long-term value of the freshpet business. in today's investor presentation, there is a chart that demonstrates that potential. the chart shows that now that bethlehem is operating at scale, it is generating approximately $145 million of cash before media investment and the adjusted ebitda before media is 29.2%.
as a mature business, we would expect to incur some media investment, but nowhere near the 12% sales we are investing now to drive a 35-plus percent growth. a mature business would expect to spend much less. and even if you charge the full 12% of net sales in media investment to the now full bethlehem campus, the cash the campus has generated would pay for the entire capital expense to build that site in approximately two years. we believe that view provides greater clarity on the ultimate profit potential of freshpet at scale and justifies continued investment in new capacity.
and as i indicated, we believe we have significant room for further improvement by driving production efficiencies, lowering our freight costs and gaining the benefits of scale in our corporate overhead. within this year, we expect to drive improvement in our adjusted gross margin via pricing and increased mix of production on our higher-speed line and elimination of the temporary operating inefficiencies through the systems and training investments. headwinds we will face will be production plant mix, product mix and any further inflation beyond what we have covered with our pricing. the adjusted gross margin cadence will be lowest in q1 as we have very little benefit of the pricing and systems improvement and virtually all of the higher costs in the quarter.
in fact, if we had the benefit of the higher pricing for the full quarter, it would add approximately $10 million to $15 million in adjusted ebitda in the quarter. we also incurred the unabsorbed capacity costs resulting from shutting down one production line in january due to the staffing issues caused by omicron. in total, that means that we will produce very little, if any, adjusted ebitda in the quarter. margins will improve significantly in q2 as the pricing is fully reflected and our systems and talent increased efficiencies.
we expect q3 to retreat sequentially due to the impact from the ennis start-up, where we will be generating smaller volumes in advance of ramping up. with respect to q4, we are expecting even greater margin headwind as we will have two new lines operating at reduced capacity as they ramp up, but it should be better than q1. we will also begin to more fully utilize our new dallas distribution center as the year unfolds. for most of the year, that dc will be a cost headwind as we will have to ship products from bethlehem to that dc in order to have the full complement of products available for our customers' orders.
by the end of the year, though, it should be a more efficient way to distribute freshpet to a significant portion of the country. in total, we are establishing guidance of greater than $55 million in adjusted ebitda for the year. however, as billy indicated, that result is negatively impacted by several factors. they are: one, excess capacity.
we are carrying approximately $13 million to $17 million in buffer capacity cost this year. that capacity is designed to insulate us from any disruption and prepare us for the increased demand we expect by q4. this represents approximately 225 to 300 basis points of adjusted gross margin; two, temporary pricing versus inflation mismatch. our second price increase just went into effect with orders today, while our higher costs began flowing through our p&l in january or earlier.
we believe that this mismatch creates an approximate $10 million to $15 million headwind to our adjusted ebitda in the first quarter; three, adverse mix impact. all of the trade inventory refill we did this year was on bag, which have a lower margin than our rolls. the trade inventory refill was largely completed in february. so q1 will have a disproportionate mix of bags.
after that, our mix should normalize; and four, plant mix. this year, we will have a disproportionate amount of production at our partner at kitchens south until ennis is fully operational late in the year. that plant mix will flip flop for its self-produced product in 2023 as ennis gets up to scale. taken together, these variables are creating an adjusted ebitda headwind of approximately $25 million to $30 million and an adjusted gross margin headwind of approximately 400 basis points.
due to the size of the number, we will call out the impact of the buffer capacity in our communications this year so that you will have a better visibility on it as we grow into our scale. we are providing the balance of the information for perspective but do not plan on updating it on a regular basis. in closing, we believe we have constructed a plan that prudently balances the need to restore the consistency and reliability of our operations, the need to demonstrate the potential profitability of the business as it grows and also maximizes the size of the opportunity in front of us. as challenging as the past two years have been, we arrived at the place we are today with the resources and tools to fulfill freshpet's potential.
we remain very confident in our long-term goal of 11 million households, $1.25 billion in net sales and a 25% adjusted ebitda margin. and we believe we have the ability to change the way people nourish their pets forever. that concludes our overview. we will now be glad to take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of bryan spillane with bank of america. you may proceed with your question.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, operator, and good afternoon, billy and heather. hope you're well. so first, my question is really just around the revised capacity plan and the capex. i just want to make sure i understand, is the -- so what's incremental from here, so what's not yet spent and is still to come, balance of this year in the future, is that number -- i'm just looking at slide 47.
is that roughly $700 million to $800 million of additional spending from here including this year's capex plan?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
heather, do you want to take that?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sure. yes. on slide 47, the $900 million that you see there is the total of all those projects that you see under planned, core lines. so it includes all of ennis phase 1, ennis phase 2, kitchens -- the kitchens south of incremental lines as well as ennis phase 3.
so bryan, ennis phase 1 obviously started expenditures at the back half of 2020 all through 2021 and into 2022. so that number is inclusive of the total of the ennis phase 1 projects, which in the latest revision is just over $350 million. and so because of that, it's a higher number than is reflective of kind of future expenditures, if you will. so you have to net out the total of what's already spent on ennis phase 1, which is a significant portion of that number, a couple of hundred million.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. so the capital raise plus the cash you have on the balance sheet and the credit, you have enough -- there's enough capital to complete this plan? i guess that's what i was really getting after was just that.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes. there's enough capital to complete the plan. and i think the difference is that, as billy mentioned in the prepared remarks, the goal of this is to maintain a low level of leverage. and so we'll lean in less into the credit facility in order to risk manage and have a healthy balance sheet along the way.
bryan spillane -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. great. ok. i'll pass it on.
thanks, guys.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
thanks, bryan.

our next question comes from the line of bill chappell with truist securities. you may proceed with your question.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon. just kind of following up on bryan's -- billy, maybe just a little bit more of what pushed this change? was it a thought that we don't want to ever run into capacity constraints as we did last year and we need to get faster? or is there something on the demand curve where you felt like -- just trying to understand why the change now because it's obviously a big -- and it seems like a very positive change, but it's also from -- i would have thought your original plans were pretty well-thought-out as well. so just help us understand why now.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yes. bill, it's a very good question. the reality is, as you saw, we put up for growth in the first quarter at 41.5%. we've guided 35% growth for the year.
when we put out our plan for 2025 and the capital plan before, the growth rate that we were expecting at the time was in the high 20s. so we're running way ahead of that plan. and so we have to -- we want to get ourselves in a position where we're never leaving the customer a reason to go look for somebody else to supply them. and so we want to make sure we get ahead of this.
i will tell you, it's a little bit like chasing your shadow though because it seems like the more capacity we bring on, the faster we grow. and so we just want to push that as far as we can organizationally and as quickly as we can to get as far out as we can. but it's also important to note that lead times have taken -- have increased fairly significantly. so we now have to take action much sooner to build capacity that's going to come on a little bit later.
so that's really the biggest driver here, the accelerating rate of growth and then the longer lead times. once you make the decision that you have to take action based on those two phenomena, then you recognize that there are some things that we've learned, whether it's new technology, new innovation or better ways to organize our facilities. putting rolls lines in a single place and bag lines in other places makes an awful lot of economic sense, but those come on after you recognize that you're growing faster and lead times are longer.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. no. that helps. and then heather, just understanding that it is early in the year and there's a lot of moving parts, but with the quarter in kind of your commentary, trying to get my arms around maintaining kind of full-year guidance, especially on the ebitda line.
and i think what you had said was -- and i just want to confirm that there's still more kind of backfill of inventory to refilling the stores that go in 2q, so it wasn't all done in just 1q. and also, i think you had said that you could have 13.7% ebitda margins had pricing already been put in place fully at january 1. so is that all really just kind of wiped out by the incremental ukraine conflict costs? or are we just -- is this still being conservative to start the year?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
so when we talked about the q1 impact, as pricing was in the quarter, that is already reflected in our q2 expectations of margins. we did have an overdelivery in gross margin versus expectations in the quarter and that we did have obviously a stronger growth in the quarter than our guidance implied. and so that did flow through. remember, because we have the buffer capacity and when we had incremental revenue, the cost -- the labor to overhead cost is already reflected in the numbers that we had.
and so you don't get it for free, you still have to pay for the input cost, but it comes at a much higher margin. and so that was a big part of the overdelivery of gross margin in the quarter. the other assets as we did build a little bit more inventory. and so on a full-year basis, though, the expectation of that pricing was built into, of course, q2 and beyond.
and i wouldn't say -- there is obviously -- i wouldn't say from a -- we're being conservative in that we are looking at the impact that potentially will come. we're sitting on risk already with, as i mentioned in the script, that with diesel fuel at $5 a gallon versus $4. so we're watching it closely. there's likely -- if we have to end up pricing, is going to be a price in mismatch there like we had in q1, and so there is some risk in the future.
i think the other thing that's important to note from an adjusted ebitda perspective is that if, in fact, there is an accelerating growth and an opportunity to over-deliver from a margin perspective, we would look to reinvest behind having a fast start into 2023.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
bill, can i just add? i want to just add a comment on that, which is you asked if we're being conservative. we are -- i think, as heather indicated, we are very mindful that we got blindsided by some things last year, and we need to be very cautious in this early in the year. it's important for us to recognize that there's a lot of unknowns ahead of us, whether it's diesel fuel or whether it's the price sensitivity or the things that we don't even know about yet. and so that's really what's driving us.
we feel really good about our start to the year. we like all the underlying trends. we just don't want to get out ahead of ourselves again.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
i totally appreciate that.
operator
our next question comes from the line of brian holland with cowen and company. you may proceed with your question.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah. thanks. good evening. i wanted to ask, when you talk about revising the long-term capacity plan, i feel like on some level, whether it's lead times, cost, operational expertise technology, you've talked about a lot of these in one form or another.
i was curious about the competition angle, though. i guess i ask this question two ways. one, are you either aware of something new that's coming within the last few months? or are you seeing increased adoption of direct or indirect competitors that maybe increases the sense of urgency? you've talked about competition before, i appreciate that. but i just want to sort of clarify the tone there and what that sort of entails.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, do you want to take that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes. yes, sure. so, brian, i think the best comment that billy made a few minutes ago was every time we build capacity, we grow more. and i think that's really like a key part of our focus when we're thinking about what we're doing.
when we look across -- there's a lot of activity. there's a ton of activity going on, more in the pet food category than i feel like i've ever seen and i've been at it a really long time. when we look across what competitors are doing, i think it's really terrific. but we really are confident that we deliver a much more compelling portfolio of products, brands, forms, variety, at a significantly better value proposition in every single one of them in addition to having new and forward-leading innovation.
so i think we're looking at a group of people that are coming into the category that are going to raise awareness around fresh and frozen that's going to help us educate consumers. and we think we're in, by far, the best position to take advantage of that consumer change. and that's really leading the way we're thinking about building out the ability to meet the demand.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
i appreciate the color, scott. and then if i could just ask about the rollout of ennis, and sort of the callout here on construction delays generally speaking and potential impact on ennis as you get toward opening up that facility phase 1. how does that -- how do we think about that in the context of buffer capacity? it sounds like you -- it sounds like you're not -- that there's some possibility that, that could get pushed out further. does that eat up all -- the delayed start of ennis, does that eat up all and then some of the buffer capacity? i'm just trying to make sure i understand how much is sort of riding on ennis starting on time in the context of your full-year outlook?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yes. brian, the buffer capacity, ennis did provide some of the buffer capacity, and so any delays on ennis do eat into the buffer capacity because we already have the staffing that we're carrying the cost for that. but what i'd also encourage you to think about is that, one, is it's really a rolls issue, not necessarily an entire line. we really need the rolls capacity in ennis to come online in order to keep that part of the business growing.
we've got plenty of bag capacity this year. so if there is a mismatch, it's on the rolls side. and the second part of it is we also have the ability to scale it up much more quickly because i think as we've said before, and most people know, we brought the ennis production team. so the hourly laborers who are going to be starting up that facility to bethlehem, some of them have been in bethlehem since last june, so they could learn and practice on the exact same equipment that they'll be starting up in texas.
so we're going to go from start-up to a 24/7 operation very, very quickly in that facility. so while there is the risk of any -- some sort of delay, once it gets going, it goes really fast. and so we feel very good about our ability to get things done once construction is completed.
operator
our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. you may proceed with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi, billy. maybe you could clarify that last comment a little further about what's in the assumption for buffer capacity and what's not. were the inefficiencies at ennis already contemplated in that 12 to 17? or is this new plan here incremental or different from what you thought a few months ago, and therefore, it's going to eat into it? and then my follow-up is -- are you talking about relocating people, like people who were trained in pennsylvania, you want them to move to texas to work on that line? and this is a very tight labor market, asking people to move around might be complicated.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
let me take the second one, then heather will take the first one. but the second one is we actually hired people in ennis, texas, so native to that area or living in that area. and we then transplanted them to pennsylvania to be trained. so we were housing them, feeding them, transporting them while they worked in the freshpet facilities in bethlehem.
and they've been a phenomenal team to have and a really, really good effort and highly skilled people. so we will be returning them home. in fact, we already sent a few folks back in the last week, i guess it was. and more will be returning later this month.
but this is sending people back home, not trying to transplant people from pennsylvania back to texas. heather, do you want to take the first question?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes. so the buffer capacity, the way to think about it, it's actually spread quite evenly across the quarters of the year. it was large -- if you think about q1 delivery, we consumed about half of it -- a little bit less than half of it due to some of the interruptions that we had. and remember, in january, we had interruptions due to omicron where we shut down a rolls line for three weeks.
and then we also had the start-up of our new erp where we took down production for a period of time. and so about half of it was consumed via inefficiencies and then the other, more than half of it came through in building of inventory and as well as the incremental sales. so when you look it spreads fairly evenly. the phasing of it came down a little bit in q3 and q4 as sales grew quarter over quarter and then increased back up with ennis coming on.
but again, the easiest way to think about it is fairly even across the 4 quarters.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. so there's no change to the $12 million to $17 million estimate, correct?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
correct.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and also, this new plan, does it require unwinding any capital that you've put into place or anything like that? or is it really just like you're out of stages and gates and this is the stage where it makes sense to move in this direction?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
it was -- this is exactly at the right moment where we are being forced to make decisions. i think we had to like slightly undo a little bit of planning that we had done on ennis when we decided to split it into a phase 2 and phase 3 and put the rolls together in phase 2. we had already done a little bit of planning work, but there was no steel in the ground, no concrete poured or anything like that. other than that, i think everything is pretty much gone.
this was at the right moment to make the decision. and frankly, i described earlier in one of the questions that the rapid rate of growth and the extension lead times created the need to do it, but this is also the time to do it because of some of the significant choices we were making and some of the investments we were about to make.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. last clarification. the 20% increase -- maybe you answered this already, but in capacity, is that all related to price? or is there -- is it like half price, half volume of -- versus the new plan?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
no. what we did in telling you 20%, we took the old capacity plan and we updated it for the current pricing, and then it's 20% more on top of that. so the old plan was $2.1 billion. we rolled it up to $2.4 billion, and so it's 20% on top of the $2.4 billion.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
got it. all right. thank you.
operator
our next question comes from the line of mark astrachan with stifel. you may proceed with your question.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. thanks. good afternoon, everyone. i guess two points of clarification maybe on the new plan and maybe building off of one of the earlier questions.
so am i right in looking at this, if i total the capex for what's already there and what's now planned, is it not a couple of hundred million or so more than what it would have been previously? so i guess, yes or no around that? and then you touched on productivity relating to the new plan. i'm curious, what does that mean? are there potential cost savings in housing bags and rolls kind of together? it would seem sort of intuitive that's the case. do you also get some benefit in terms of revenue synergies from this as well in terms of the same sort of thinking? like you don't have to obviously shut down lines to convert over to other things that you were planning on doing. so if you could touch on that.
and then i just had a follow-up for scott around how to think about the accelerating household penetration in terms of the more recent stuff. is it folks that are lapsed consumers that couldn't find the product? is it new consumers kind of coming in and finding freshpet? anything you've seen there would be helpful.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
heather, do you want to take the first question? heather?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sorry. sorry, mark. can you just -- sorry, i got a little bit -- had a little bit of a troubled time hearing you. can you just repeat a little bit of the first question? again, apologies.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yes. i was just asking about trying to go back in my model and add up capex in terms of everything through '21 and looking at what we had from '22 on, it would seem like it's a couple of hundred million or so more than what we had been expecting prior. is that a good way to think about it, i guess, through 2020 assuming there was more that sort of way to think about it?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes, sorry about that. yes. so in 2022, we had shared that we were going to spend approximately -- expected to spend approximately $300 million, and now that's going to be approximately $400 million. so that's the first increase.
and then the subsequent years, the increase is about $300 million incremental for the future projects versus the prior plan.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
so that's $400 million total?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
right, exactly.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. ok.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, do you want to take the household penetration question?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes, absolutely. so -- yes. so we're just starting to turn the corner, and we really believe that the majority of that has to do with just having product supply in at a more steady rate than we've had. what we find is that there are people that are very either form-specific or even down to the product -- the individual product level or sku-level specific.
the biggest group that we believe that we have kind of lost some of is the occasional users over the past year. they'll come, if it's not there, they're not going to -- they may not go to another store. now the good news is of that group, they're the easiest to come back in, and they are the people that represent the least amount of volume. so we've been able to obviously grow significantly with just expanding household buy rate, basically.
so what we believe is happening, and it's hard to tell exactly, is that people are starting to come back in, the occasionals, and we are starting to add new users again into the business in our brands. we think that once we're back in stock in a more consistent and steady basis and you add the advertising plus the innovation, then we should be back nicely to seeing some household penetration growth. the one caveat on all that is, it's very typical to see when you take a significant price increase that there is a short-term dip. it looks like we've already turned from that dip, and we're already kind of starting to build on the other side of it.
but we do see -- you're going to turn some people off when you have a significant price increase. but we believe we've already kind of turned from that dip, as i mentioned.

our next question comes from the line of jon andersen with william blair. you may proceed with your question.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
hi. good afternoon, everybody. my first question is on in-stock levels. you commented that you've made much improvement there.
can you give us a little bit more detail around that, where you think in-stock levels are today? what you would ultimately want in-stock levels to be at, so we have a sense for how much more room for improvement there may be? and i think you commented on one area where there's more room for improvement is pet specialty. so a little more color around why that is and how quickly that can be remedied.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, do you want to take that? scott?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
sorry, i was on mute. sorry about that. so jon, so we have seen some, i would say, very slow, steady progress where we've had kind of one step or two steps forward, one step back at some times. you can see it in some of the data that -- in the presentation on slide 9, when you look at production.
but when we go through an erp conversion, it's a little challenging, not only to produce, but it also sometimes challenging to get as many trucks out the door as we would like. and we do see some hits in product availability at retail. so we have made overall steady progress. our good fridge inventory or conditions continue to improve other than for some small backward motions.
and -- but we have a long way to go. i think we're probably a couple of months away from being where we would be really proud and happy to have very high service levels and really good in-stocks at retail. the best in-stocks we have right now are up into the 90s. but for the most part, we're still seeing into the 70s and 80s, and pet we're seeing into the 50s and 60% in stock rates at retail.
so a lot of opportunity and just having it there consistently for consumers builds confidence and it also lets retailers get more and more comfortable with continuing to kind of move forward and expand out. so we're making progress. we have a ways to go. we really have a ways to go at this point.
but slow, steady progress. production is moving forward. we're getting more and more trucks out the door. we had a really significant record on the amount of cases we got out the door last week.
so really nice work by the team there. but i would say we have a couple more months until we're in great shape.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
in some ways, it makes the 43% revenue growth in the quarter even more impressive. second question is on gross margin. i think last quarter, you talked a little bit about puts and takes in gross margin throughout the year. i think q2 is stronger than q1, given pricing catching up with costs.
but then maybe a little bit of a sequential decline in q3 with capacity coming online. maybe, heather, could you talk about your expectations for the kind of the movement or cadence of gross margin as we move through the year?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sure. we've included an updated version of that chart in the presentation as well on slide 57. and so as i shared before on a prior question, we did deliver slightly more favorable adjusted gross margin in q1 than anticipated with the higher revenue as well as a bit of an inventory build. and so we come out of q1 with a little bit of momentum.
but having said that, the big shift in q2 comes from having a full quarter of the bigger price increase. and so that's why we get the biggest impact in q2. we maintained that improved margin into q3. it comes down slightly, and that's really as we start up ennis.
that's the impact in q3 that brings down the margin slightly and then into q4. and while we have a plant start-up add-back that we're explicit about, once we start up the lines, then we no longer add back once we have salable product. and so what you have is a very underutilized facility and lines that were starting up. and so that's the impact, which the biggest impact will come in q4.
having all of that, as i mentioned, the fuel cost impact on -- while it's obviously the biggest impact is on outbound logistics, we also are watching it closely around the impact to both inbound freight as well as our energy costs to run the facility and of course, natural gas being the key driver as well. and so there is some near-term impact that we're watching closely. we -- as we've always said, consistently, we would look to price if we believe that things are going to have -- are going to stick, and we're looking at that closely right now. and so a bit more to comment on where that impact might lie and how long that might last.
but that -- the cadence is roughly the same as we shared with that, just additional risk on fuel.

our next question comes from the line of anoori naughton with jpmorgan. you may proceed with your question.
anoori naughton -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. first, i just had a clarification question. you talked about some occasional users may be slipping.
i was curious what -- do you have a sense of what percent of the business is actually these [ stopper ] users? and of those lost users? do you have any sense of maybe where they're going instead?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, you can take that one?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes, sure. so when we get into the -- i can tell you at an overall level on the business, our heavy users represented about half of our total dollars today, ok? the occasional users are in the kind of 30% to 40% of our business, and then the last group are very, very occasional. so there is a group of the occasionals that have left. we don't have as much detail and statistics as we'd like, especially for short periods of time on this, but it's -- we can see some of that kind of in the data.
so it's hard to answer the exact specifications and the exact detail around that, to be quite transparent.
anoori naughton -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
understood. but the insight is helpful. and then my question is, in your new capex plan, when do you target having the chicken processing facility operational? and then does this change the way you'll be procuring chicken on a go-forward basis? i guess more broadly, can you just provide more details on what you think the expected benefits and savings will be from having a chicken processing facility on site?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yes, anoori, the reason for the chicken processing on site is actually to deliver higher quality. while it's likely it will give us some lower expenses because you don't have to transport the product as much, the reality is we want to use the freshest chicken possible. and so by having a processing operation on-site at our largest site gives us the opportunity to bring in the chicken, process it and then feed it directly into our manufacturing operations immediately or as quickly as we possibly can, close coupling the production of the -- or the processing of the chicken and the production of the freshpet. that's really the driver.
we don't have the ability or the room to do that in bethlehem, although the facility that does process our chicken is only about 20 miles away. so it is very, very close. and we're getting locally sourced chicken there. but we like this as an operating model.
we feel very good about that as an ongoing benefit. we would do it for the quality. the cost will be an added benefit.

our last question comes from the line of john lawrence with benchmark. you may proceed with your question.
john lawrence -- the benchmark company -- analyst
yes. thank you. congratulations, guys, on the progress. but can you talk a little bit about the erp system getting installed, getting it up and running? what have been the positives and the negatives of the system at this point? and then what do you expect over the next couple of quarters?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
heather, are you going to take that?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes, sure. thank you. so we're live successfully in our new systems. so we're really thrilled about that.
it's a big milestone, in that we fully converted to a new erp system end to end. so the scope of it was all processes. and our goal was to ensure that we could run our end-to-end business on the new system, and we successfully are. i would say the positives coming out right now is really around production, and we shared that in the prepared remarks, but the production is going quite well.
you had your expected -- call it, just getting folks trained, having the change management done. but the production floor is running really well. in fact, they're running more favorably now than they were prior to the conversion. it was just a learning curve.
we're running, like i said, the full end-to-end processes. we're still -- as you'll see, in some of our working capital figures. you'll see a quarter-end impact in our working capital with a receivables number that is higher than we would expect just based on growth, and that's a function of the erp and having to get some of those sort of the process of invoicing and all the way through on a timely basis. but again, it's all growing pains.
but we do feel confident and good about being converted to the new system, and we're coming along quite nicely.
john lawrence -- the benchmark company -- analyst
great. thanks, and good luck.

ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. i would like to turn this call back over to mr. billy cyr for closing remarks.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
thank you and our apologies to those whose questions we were not able to get to today. we're obviously on a very tight schedule with the news that we put out earlier today. i'll leave you with one thought. the author, john grogan said, ""such short little lives our pets have to spend with us, and they spend most of it waiting for us to come home each day."" and i would add to that, serve them freshpet when you arrive and will have been worth the wait.
thank you very much. we appreciate your interest and attention.

greetings, and welcome to freshpet's first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. i would now like to turn this conference over to your host, mr. jeff sonnek, investor relations at icr.
thank you, sir. you may begin your presentation.
jeff sonnek -- investor relations
hello, and good afternoon. and welcome to freshpet's first quarter 2022 earnings call and webcast. on today's call are billy cyr, chief executive officer; and heather pomerantz, chief financial officer. scott morris, chief operating officer, will also be available for q&a.
before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, management may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. these statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. please refer to the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec and the company's press release issued today for a detailed discussion of the risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. please note that on today's call, management will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures such as ebitda and adjusted ebitda, among others.
while the company believes these non-gaap financial measures provide useful information for investors, the presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with gaap. please refer to today's press release for how management defines such non-gaap measures. a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap and the limitations associated with such non-gaap measures. finally, the company has produced a presentation that contains many of the key metrics that will be discussed on this call.
the presentation can be found on the company's investor website. management's commentary will not specifically walk through the presentation on the call, but rather it's a summary of the results and guidance they will discuss today. now i'd like to turn the call over to billy cyr, chief executive officer. 
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
thank you, jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. the message i would like you to take away from today's call is that our q1 results are an early indicator of how much more resilient we are today than we were one year ago. the investments we made in our workforce and buffer capacity enabled us to overcome the challenges from omicron, industrywide supply chain disruptions, and our erp conversion and still deliver the strongest quarterly net sales growth rate since freshpet went public in 2014. that resiliency will enable us to continue our rapid growth and fulfill our mission to change the way people nourish their pets forever.
our team is quite proud of what we accomplished and the results we delivered. we overcame supply shortages and construction delays to design, construct, install, and start up the incremental capacity that has enabled us to not only meet our rapidly growing demand but to also fill the trade inventory hole that we dug over the past 18 months. we still have some pockets where our in-stocks are not where they need to be, particularly in pet specialty, where we went through a distributor change. but overall, we have our best retail conditions in almost two years, and they keep getting better.
we've also hired and trained the team members needed to produce enough freshpet to fill those fridges in one of the tightest labor markets in decades, and we continue to generate incremental demand in the face of the most significant inflation in decades through outstanding marketing, innovation and fridge placements. looking ahead, we are also keenly aware that the operating environment remains extremely challenging. the planning and skills that it took to overcome the obstacles we faced in q1 will be needed over and over again in the coming months and years if we are to sustain high rates of growth. to be successful, we will need to continue to plan conservatively and act aggressively just as we've done so far this year.
that is what we intend to do. it is in that vein that we have revisited our long-term capacity expansion plan. since we established our plan about 15 months ago, quite a bit has changed. some of the biggest changes have been, first, lead times.
lead times for construction and equipment have lengthened significantly, sometimes doubling and tripling. that puts a premium on planning and ordering ahead, but it also puts added strain on the balance sheet because we must start spending capital much further in advance of when capacity is able to begin production. on average, we are spending capital more than six months earlier than before to deliver the same capacity. second, costs.
the cost of construction and equipment has increased significantly. on average, construction materials and equipment costs are up more than 20% over the past year, particularly for those who use a large amount of stainless steel as we do. third, operating know-how. we've learned quite a bit about how to design facilities to operate more efficiently over the past year, particularly since we've been operating kitchens, too, on a 24/7 schedule for a full year.
fourth, new technology. we've been experimenting with a variety of new production technologies over the past year, some that support existing products and some that enable new innovations. we are ready to scale up some of those technologies. and fifth, competition.
the emergence of a large and growing segment of very high-end fresh and frozen pet foods has reinforced the strategic importance of ensuring that freshpet always has the best products in the market while presenting consumers with an attractive value proposition. we are ready to scale up some additional products that we believe will expand our franchise, increase our buying rate and enhance the freshpet brand reputation. to address those changing dynamics, deliver the necessary capital efficiency to justify the investments we are making and to keep up with a significant increase in demand, we established the following guiding principles: first, focus on building where our talent is based. to maximize utilization of our technical staff, we will focus our efforts on bethlehem, ennis and kitchens south, fully building out those sites.
this will enable us to maximize the potential of each site with the most efficient use of our talent. this includes innovation as we will house innovative new products in bethlehem, so that they are connected with our r&d staff. second, locate and group technology and equipment in the most cost-effective manner. as a small company attempting to meet almost insatiable demand across our product portfolio, we had to pair a bag line and a rolls line together each time we expanded.
now we are adding capacity in larger chunks and can establish buildings and operations that specialize in either bags or rolls. that delivers labor efficiency, better management and maintenance and spare parts and greater operating expertise. third, limit freshpet capital investment to assets of greatest strategic value. while we will continue to selectively build and own some of our buildings, our new plan makes greater use of our partners' capital to construct and own buildings while we focus our capital on equipment and technology.
and fourth, enable innovation. our capital plan must ensure that we never fall behind on product performance versus any relevant competitor. we believe we are the best-in-class product today, and we intend to keep it that way through a commitment to long-term innovation. applying those principles, we are making some changes to our long-term capital plan.
the key changes are: first, splitting ennis phase 2 into a phase 2 and a phase 3. the new ennis phase 2 will be dedicated to rolls lines, and we will be pulling forward the beginning of construction as well. in fact, we've already begun the site preparation work for that expansion and expect a new phase 2 to open in q4 of 2023. phase 3 will largely focus on bag lines and will be slated to open a year later in q4 of 2024.
second, focusing kitchens south on bags. we will be adding incremental bag lines to the existing building and eliminating the need to add a new building that would house rolls lines. we will ultimately house five bag lines at kitchens south, some of them using new technology with higher throughput and greater packaging flexibility. and third, adding an innovation scale-up facility in bethlehem.
we are establishing a new 100,000 square-foot facility about one-half mile from our existing campus in a leased building that we will equip with the production lines capable of producing some of our new innovative products. in total, this revised plan will deliver capacity to make approximately $2.9 billion of freshpet products, up about $500 million or 20% from our previous plan. we will also add new product technologies capable of producing new preferred products that will provide unique benefits to new consumer audiences. and the plan will deliver greater operating efficiency than the previous plan.
the accompanying investor presentation provides more detail on the projects and the returns we will get from these investments. put simply, each of these projects will pay back quickly once they are operational and fully utilized, just as the bethlehem campus is generating significant free cash flow on a four-wall basis now that it is fully utilized. we believe this is both an aggressive and prudent plan. it is very clear that the future of pet food is in higher-quality foods like freshpet.
various industry estimates have pegged the size of the category at $4 billion to $6 billion as soon as 2025, and we outlined a 25% increase in the size of the total addressable market, or tam, to 25 million households at the icr conference in january. we fully intend to capture as much of that market potential as possible. we are the category leader. we have a huge head start, and we have sizable competitive advantages.
to maintain that lead, we must always have adequate capacity, and we must always have the best products. our plan is designed to ensure we always do. so what does this capacity expansion mean for our existing 2025 targets? we are off to a fast start in 2022, and our current growth trajectory is well in excess of the rate we would need to hit our 2025 goal. but with all the uncertainty in the macro environment, we think it is more prudent to maintain our targets while we navigate through this fluid macro environment.
that said, we have great confidence in the path forward to build and serve a much larger consumer audience. simply put, this is a timing exercise. given the incremental challenges in sourcing and construction, we need to start sooner to ensure that our operational capabilities and capacity keep pace with long-term demand. for investors, we believe this capacity plan is best thought of as both an option for accelerated growth and insulation against further challenges in construction or equipment sourcing.
we are also building in some flexibility. while there are long lead times for construction and equipment, we have preserved the ability to scale back portions of the plan at various stages along the way to ensure that our capital spend is always optimized and capacity is in lockstep with our latest estimate of demand. further, we are also mindful that the world we are operating in has an unusually large amount of economic uncertainty in it. given that and the aggressive competitive posture we are taking, we will balance the capacity expansion plan with a conservative balance sheet that is designed to insulate our growth plan from the typical volatility of both a high-growth company and the capital markets.
we intend to operate with low leverage until the business is generating strong cash flow, capable of funding our capital expansion plans from operations. we believe the plan we are laying out today is the right one and will allow us to reach our long-term goals in the most efficient way possible, solving for the current environment and leveraging our growing set of capabilities. our founders bet on the future of higher-quality pet food back in 2006 with the creation of freshpet, and we asked our investors to do that when the company went public in 2014, and again, in 2017, when we launched feed the growth. we believe our long-term results have shown that those were wise investments.
we believe the plan we are laying out today will enable us to build on those results and deliver the future of pet food and a very bright future for freshpet.i will now turn it over to heather to provide a summary of our q1 2022 results.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
thank you, billy, and good afternoon, everyone. we had a very strong quarter, both in the absolute and relative to our expectations. we delivered net sales growth of 41.5% for a total of $132.2 million of net sales. that growth rate is the strongest quarterly net sales growth rate since the company went public in 2014.
for perspective, our first-quarter net sales are more than our net sales for the entire calendar year of 2016, which means we have doubled the business twice since 2016. in fact, we have doubled this business about every three years since it was founded, and that trend is accelerating with q1 of 2022 being 2.4 times the size of the same quarter only three years ago. first quarter net sales growth was broad-based across channels and product forms. the growth was most pronounced in the grocery and mass channels.
and from a product mix standpoint, our rolls and fresh from the kitchen products experienced significant lift behind improved availability. that improved availability can be seen in the gradually improving pdp throughout the quarter and into q2. pricing and mix accounted for about eight points of net sales growth in the quarter, and trade inventory refill was about four points of the net sales growth. the balance of the growth in the quarter came from volume growth.
as expected, pricing will play a bigger role in q2 than it did in q1 as our second price increase did not go into effect until the middle of march. as a reminder, our two price increases total about a 17% increase in pricing. we saw very little, if any, price sensitivity from the first price increase, but it is too early to tell how much you will see from the second larger increase. it is particularly difficult to determine the magnitude of price sensitivity we are experiencing because of the confounding variables we have, i.e., much better availability, improved distribution, and a significant increase in advertising.
we fully anticipate there will be some price sensitivity, and we've built that into our guidance for the year. it is just too early to tell how much we are actually experiencing given the rapid growth. household penetration grew only 2% versus a year ago on a trailing 52-week basis. that 52-week time period reflects the worst periods of in-stock, and is why we saw so little improvement.
however, when we look at the more recent four-week period, when advertising was on the air and in-stocks had improved, we see much stronger growth rates. in fact, the most recent four-week period was up 12% versus a year ago and is accelerated. while there might be a short-term dip due to the impact of price sensitivity, we expect to see steady progress in q2 on the 52-week measure and get back to more typical household penetration growth rates by the end of the year. as typically happens when household penetration growth slows, buying rate growth accelerates due to a smaller number of new households who come in at a lower buying rate, entering the freshpet franchise.
buying rate was up 26% in the quarter, well above our long-term growth rate of 7%. we believe that rapid growth will slow considerably once the household penetration resumes its more normal growth pattern in the 20% to 30% range. however, the increase in pricing will provide a step up in buying rate this year and will go beyond our annual target of 7% growth. net store count grew by 300 to 23,931 net stores.
we also upgraded 72 stores and placed second or third fridges in 179 stores. we expect the rate of growth on each of those measures to accelerate as the year goes on. shifting to margins. adjusted gross margin was 41.9%, down from last year's 46.7% and up slightly from q4 2021 41.7%.
the q1 performance was also better than our guidance assumed. as we shared last quarter, we had a timing mismatch between the increase in our commodity costs and our pricing actions. that timing difference created an approximate 450 basis point headwind for adjusted gross margin in the first quarter. but we will get much of that back in q2, driving a slightly better-than-anticipated adjusted gross margin in the quarter with strong production performance and greater sales leverage.
when we gave our guidance at the end of february, we had just converted to our new erp system. our guidance assumes that it would take some time to return to our previous level of production as we work through the kinks in the new system. but as the chart in the accompanying presentation shows, we bounced back quickly and even began to exceed our previous production performance. this improved throughput resulted in increased shipments and enabled our best in-stock conditions in years, helping to drive strong sales performance.
we attribute part of that strong production performance to the investments we made in the freshpet academy training program and in talent over the past six months, which delivered consistently strong staffing levels and increased operational flexibility. this is a strong proof point that our revised capacity plan will have associated advantages in terms of efficiency and throughput. the strong top-line growth enabled us to drive strong g&a efficiency gains that we reinvested in media in the quarter to drive continued top-line growth later in the year. media investment in the quarter was up 420 basis points versus a year ago to 16.3% of net sales, and that increase was more than fully offset by reductions in both logistics costs of approximately 170 basis points and by other g&a costs of approximately 270 basis points for a net reduction in adjusted sg&a of 20 basis points.
logistics cost reductions were due in part to more completely filling troughs than in the year ago. g&a costs were positively impacted by the benefits of scale that we have been gaining over time. adjusted ebitda of $5.1 million was, as expected, down versus the year ago. had we not had the timing mismatch between commodity inflation and pricing actions, adjusted ebitda would have been approximately $13 million greater and delivered an approximately 13.7% adjusted ebitda margin.
capital spending in the quarter totaled $55.9 million, and we expect to spend approximately $400 million in capital this year. this is higher than our prior planned capex spend of approximately $300 million that we previously communicated and reflects the updated capacity plan that billy shared with you earlier. operating cash flow used in the first quarter was $34.8 million, which was driven by $33.2 million of working capital. this was significantly impacted by the erp conversion which resulted in some delays in invoicing and payables, which will be reconciled in q2.
we grew $51 million on our revolver in the quarter. at the end of the quarter, we had gross availability of $299 million on our credit line, subject to various limits. looking forward, this strong start in q1 gives us a great deal of confidence in our plan for the year. net sales performance in q1 and came in about $5 million better than the 35% growth implied in our guidance, and the consumption trends we saw in april continued that momentum.
we are still learning about price sensitivity, but each week that goes by, we get increasingly comfortable that our assumptions are appropriately conservative with less risk of downside and more opportunity for upside. despite that optimism, we are maintaining our net sales guidance for the year out of an abundance of caution related to the unknowns of price sensitivity and until we have assurances that ennis will deliver the roll capacity that we need to stay on track with our plans. at this point, we believe that ennis is on track to begin producing salable products late in q3, but the current construction environment is challenging, and nothing should be taken for granted. three things need to be in place for a successful start-up.
first, equipment delivered. we are in good shape on this item as all the equipment has been delivered and is ready to install. and the equipment is basically the same as the equipment we use in kitchens 2, so we know how it works. second, staffing and training.
we have hired all the staffing that we will need for the first two lines, and many of them have been trained in our bethlehem kitchens for up to 9 months. we are in good shape on this item. and third, building completed. this is the primary element of risk and where most of our focus lies.
we expect to have dried in the building by next week, but there is still lots of wiring to run and carrier walls to erect and electronic systems to install. we believe our timetable is realistic, but material shortages are very real. and until the building is done, we won't know for sure that we can get every material, electrical component or laborer on the timing we need. net, we are optimistic but realistic about our ability to start up ennis and further support sales later this year.
while we also exceeded our expectations on adjusted ebitda, the surge in fuel prices we've experienced since our fourth-quarter earnings due to the onset of the ukraine conflict could offset that stronger performance until we either take another round of pricing or the fuel prices roll back. since we set our guidance, diesel fuel has gone from approximately $4 per gallon to approximately $5 per gallon. that impacts inbound and outbound freight costs. we are also seeing higher energy costs to operate our kitchens.
if it appears that these costs will be sustained for a long period of time, we will take another round of pricing to cover those costs as we are committed to protecting our margin. that could create another timing mismatch between increased costs and increased pricing, but it would be much smaller than the mismatch that occurred in q1 when a broader set of commodities were impacted. additionally, if we continue to deliver strong net sales performance in excess of our guidance and we have the available capacity, we will selectively reinvest the contribution from the outperformance in additional q4 media to further accelerate our growth next year. thus, we are not taking up our adjusted ebitda guidance at this time, but our confidence in our ability to meet or exceed the target is very strong.
we have updated the quarterly guidance cadence charts we provided with our initial guidance in february to provide color on these items and other items impacting the cadence we expect for the year. in closing, we are very encouraged by the strong start to the year and even more encouraged by what it says about our resiliency. but we also know that we must maintain our focus and diligence. if we do, we believe we have the capability to continue our rapid rate of growth, deliver a strong performance this year and continue on our path toward fulfilling our mission of changing the way people nourish their pets forever.
that concludes our overview. we will now be glad to take your questions. operator?

thank you. [operator instructions]. our first question comes from the line of steph wissink with jefferies. please proceed with your question.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
thank you. good afternoon, everyone. i would like to spend a little bit more time on the ebitda revision for the year. and maybe, heather and billy, if you could both talk about this, but how much of the burden occurred already in the second quarter versus what do you expect that timing mismatch to account for in the balance of the year? if i just look at that, i think it's on slide 8, that ebitda bridge, just help us break down what's already been resolved and what's still to come? and then also related to the capex to settle along the same lines, how much of the deferral has already occurred versus how much is yet to come in terms of the overall revision.
thank you.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
heather, do you want to take that?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes. so i'll start with, of course, the -- on the ebitda guide. so the reduction is approximately $7 million. the quality issue is $2.2 million.
so of course, that already has already occurred in june. -- the balance of the change coming from the missed maximum inflation versus price about $1 million of that has incurred in the first half, with the expectation and the balance of that comes in the second half. steph, can you just state on the line on the capex question?
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
yes. just the revision lower in capex. i'm wondering how much of that has already occurred versus how much is yet to occur. so the capex for the quarter, did it come in below, meaning what's left to be realized is also below? or is all of the deferral in the revision of the year in the back half?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
got it. yes. yes. so a portion of about a quarter of it occurred already in the first half that and then the balance is reductions in the second half.
the main driver of the second half shift is around the phasing of spend that we'll have around the innovation kitchen. that's the biggest driver of the shift in the second half.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. so that innovation kitchen is now going to be a 2023 event?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
most of it. yes, there'll be a small spend in the second half, but the majority will be in 2023. that's correct.
steph wissink -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of peter benedict with robert w. baird. please proceed with your question.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
hey, guys. first question, just can you give us a sense of what we should expect plant start-up costs and the launch expenses could be for the full year? i think there were around $11 million in the first half. what should we think about for the full year? and maybe just a sense for what it should look like next year?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sure. so peter, the -- well, first of all, we'll provide a very sharp clarity when we issued the revised view for q3. but for now, the best assumption is that the second half is going to be largely in line with the first half. so you could sort of double it.
what you have going on there is with the net start-up you have increase in costs, as you would expect, as we ramp up to start up. but then, of course, then starting up, we stopped adding back largely in q4. and so there's sort of the increased costs offset by that cost would have come into the cost structure anyway. for next year, it's -- we will have less start-up.
i mean we have -- we have the last line in phase 1 of ns starting up. at some point next year, again, we'll provide a revised phasing of exactly when we plan to start that up. but that's the main start-up for next year that you should expect. so a much less significant start-up impact given that ns is really fully operational.
it's just adding one last line next year.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
got it. ok. that's helpful. and then just i mean maybe -- i don't know it can help us here.
like just how you're thinking about kind of the ebitda margin flow through, kind of incremental margins on sales growth using this new method and then maybe getting past some of the noise that's out there right now in terms of just what's going on with -- in the business. is there a way to think about that? or what does your model tell you in terms of the incremental as we continue to kind of grow sales over the next several years?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
yes. so, peter, i mean, i think -- i mean, we said it in the prepared remarks that certainly, there will still be some lumpiness to this. so as we have years of a larger start-up like this year, just using -- let's just use premiering in the first half, so $20 million as a proxy. it's a big impact in plant start-up.
as you look at next year, you're going to get a really nice pickup on the gross margin coming from -- and it's being started up and running. and again, just to reinforce our most efficient and profitable facility. you're going to get a really nice benefit next year. but then the following -- and that of flow through on the higher revenue.
but then on the following year, we will be starting up things like the innovation kitchen, which will have, again, volatility that will come with that. we will, of course, provide as much visibility and foresight to that as we move through it, we'll be extremely transparent as we always are. but it will be a little bit lumpier. the longer-term road map and flow-through doesn't change.
the expectations of -- ennis as we bring on not only phase 1, but phase 1 and 2 with even greater efficiency continues to be a key driver in terms of the margin improvement, and then the continued benefits from the sg&a leverage benefits around both logistics and g&a leverage will continue and should continue to be a more consistent part of that flow through.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
ok. and then maybe if i could, just a follow-up kind of on price. and you kind of talked about how some of the cost pressures may be peaking here. we'll see if that's the case.
but how do you think about price in an environment where, let's say, the costs are starting to moderate and come down. do you expect prices will hold in this category? i know -- or do you think you're rolling back a bit? what's-how do you maybe think about that right now?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, do you want to take that one?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes. peter. so we've been trying to as we've done pricing, we've been trying to be really thoughtful as to how this is all going to land eventually. and it's one of the reasons that it's put us behind in a couple of quarters where we've been 30 or 60 days, a little bit slower to take some pricing action.
because when this is all said and done, and it's leveled out, we want to end up in a really good place. what we anticipate is many others in the category in just dry and wet food we'll use significant amounts of promotion dollars to adjust prices, both kind of in the near term and in the mid and longer term. we don't do any promotion as you know. so we really don't want to -- we want to be very careful of how our approach to the pricing where we end up in making sure that we create a portfolio of products that has really, really wide appeal to 11 million plus consumers.
and that's kind of how we've been thinking about it.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
ok. that makes sense. thanks so much, guys.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
thanks, peter.

our next question comes from the line of bill chappell with truist. please proceed with your question.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
hey there, bill.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, billy, scott. i guess, i know you are waist deep, at least in the analytics and the customer. and i think -- the concern i hear or see most is not your existing consumer base trading down because they're highly loyal and obviously, they don't want to change what their dog is eating. but it's that new consumer trading up and the worry that, that will -- the pace will slow with the higher prices than just that you're at the super premium as we go into a potential recession.
so i guess are you seeing anything from that new consumer slowing down, except for the small little spikes where you've seen some unevenness? or do you think you can hold up really well and -- you talked about growing through past recessions, but you're obviously a much smaller base at that point. so just trying to -- any color or any food you have to back that would be great.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
yes, bill, this is a topic we've been spending a lot of time thinking about and watching the data very closely. we included in the presentation today, a few slides that give you a little bit, a bit of a glimpse of what we're seeing. we did see a little bit of a slowdown in june when gasoline hit $5 as heather said in the prepared remarks. but since then, we've seen it bounce back up.
the number that we saw in the last 12 weeks, the household penetration gains have been up 19% versus a year ago. when we look at it across a variety of demographics, we look at it, small dog households, large dog households, both up, we look at it by generation. we've seen virtually all the generations are moving up. the millennials.
actually, we're moving up the most. we're getting the most traction in that group, and we look at the cross income groups. and across income groups, we are not seeing any significant differences in their willingness to buy freshpet or join the freshpet franchise. there were little bits and dips in june.
i don't want to gloss over that june was a little bit lumpier than we would like, but it came right back in july. so we're feeling pretty good about the ability to attract new users to the franchise. -- because the proposition is pretty darn attractive. but that's what our data is saying so far, and it's in line with where we'd expect to be or would hope to be.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. thanks. and then -- just kind of a minor question. i guess i'm a little surprised that diesel prices kind of impacted you intra-quarter.
i thought you had done some diesel hedges or maybe just educate me on what is hedged and what is not hedged? thanks.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
we don't hedge any diesel, but we do have some hedges on natural gas for a portion of our production facility. but even those will roll off by the end of november. so we're going to face that challenge at the end of the year. but we don't hedge -- we currently don't hedge any of our diesel exposure.
and that's certainly something as we get a little bit larger in scale in our distribution that we ought to consider. but so far, we have not.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. good. thanks.

our next question comes from the line of anoori naughton with jpmorgan. please proceed with your question.
anoori naughton -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. thanks for the question. a quick clarification and apologies if you said this on the call, but how does your new household penetration target or your metric of $4.9 million compared versus the first quarter of this year? and then my question is, what does the shape of the trajectory look like for freshpet to get that back on track with its longer-term household penetration goal of 11 million households? i believe the additional plan when you set it out was closer to 7.6% in '23, which is still sizable 50% jump from where you are today.
so i guess the cost of the question is, will freshpat need to spend more than 12% on ad spending for the next couple of years to catch up, so to speak. thank you.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
yes. first of all, we provided a comparison in the deck of the june data from the old method to the new method. so you can see the difference. i don't have the new method for the period at the end of q1.
so it's hard to say. but in total, it's like 186,000 more users in the new method and the old method. and the rate of gain over the last couple of years has been 200,000 more than what the old method would have shown. what was most intriguing about the way in which the data has come out, and we've also seen a similar piece of data from numerator.
so it kind of validates it is that our rate of growth has been more in households has been more consistent over the last two years than what they had previously projected. and it gets to your second part of your question is, what do we need to do to get to that 11 million households? the answer is we need to get household penetration growth going back up into the mid-20s, which is where we've been in the past. and the last 12 weeks were up 19%, and that includes a little bit of a dip that occurred in june. so i'm expecting as we go further toward the end of the year, you're going to see that number continue to go up and will move into the 20s numerator, which provides similar data with a larger panel is already showing us moving into the low 20s with their more recent data.
so i'm feeling pretty good about we're moving back up into the 20% plus growth rate, and we need to stay there. we need to get into the mid-20s and stay there.
bill chappell -- truist securities -- analyst
one other thing to just take into consideration is as the business gets bigger, obviously, this is a simple math that you can do. but the 12%, it starts to be -- the dollars start to be tremendous, and it allows us to basically drive more and more consumers in. if we can keep our cac in a similar range, we should be able to achieve that 11 million number fairly easily.
anoori naughton -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst
understood. and just to clarify though, you've accelerated some of your ad spending into the second quarter. so presumably, there would be very little incremental spending as move into the back half. so i guess i'm just trying to square how we'll see your household penetration start to accelerate from here if you're going to be spending less incremental dollars between move through the back half.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
yes, it's -- always remember the comparison, too. the year ago was pretty soft in this area.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes. we have a very healthy q3 advertising wise. and then as billy was mentioning, we have -- we typically have a very fairly soft q4 in advertising. look, the big thing is there is a tremendous amount of disruption in the marketplace with whether it's gas prices, fear of recession that i think the fear was may be as bad as the actual recession itself.
we can see consumers stabilizing in their behavior and their traffic into stores. and it looks like this next period, our prices are now stable, consumers are kind of calmed down, and we're going to see them go back into stores with fuller fridges than we've ever had, and we anticipate making some progress in this quarter.
anoori naughton -- jpmorgan chase and company -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of brian holland with cowen and company. please proceed with your question.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
yes. thanks. i have that effect on people. good afternoon, everyone.
so if i could ask first about maintaining the net sales guidance. given prior year track volume compares get tougher in the second half, pet specialty appears to be a drag. i appreciate that part of that is comp driven. but i'm just curious how we get comfortable because it would seem that one or both of track volume will need to sequentially get better from here, assuming price at why you get another little bump there in the fourth quarter.
but that and/or pet specialties got to get better. so can you help us understand the volume path over the balance of the year and next?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
yes. so the way i think about it is we're going to be in this summer horizontal period until probably the end of august. and then because of the media investment we made, because of the better in-stock conditions because of the purge placements that we've done, i'd expect to see it start ramping up on the consumption as you went through the fourth quarter. remember that last year, again, i hate to go back and talk about lapping them last year.
but last year, we had a disastrous july because of the warehouse issue that our third-party warehouse -- we fortunately survived this year's july and had a very strong july. and then on top of that, if you recall in the fourth quarter last year, we had the spare parts issue. that impacted our ability to ship in the end of november, december. and so while we need to see good consumption numbers and expect to see strong consumption numbers, between now and the end of the year.
there are some anomalies in the year ago that kind of give you a sense that the growth rate on a net sales basis as well as on a consumption basis where you're able to deliver the guidance. and frankly, it should give us a little bit of room.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
and then just as a follow-on to that, obviously, trade inventory, i think it was maybe like a 700 bps headwind or whatever it was in the quarter, forgive me them not looking at that site at this moment. but i'm curious if you can help remind us what that looks like in the second half of the year. what you're lapping as far as impact there? and then also on the elasticity side, i appreciate the data that you gave us, but you've also called out some nice distribution growth in the first half. so i'm wondering how you discern between kind of unit growth that's sort of apples-to-apples and what the distribution benefit is? because if you had some distribution benefit in the first half, it was -- the logic would be you might have to keep that up to make the math look the same, but maybe you can walk us through that.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
yes. i'm probably going to get lost in some of your questions there. but the best way to neutralize, brian, what you're talking about is velocity, measuring the velocity on the business. and the velocity on the businesses continue to do quite nicely even though we've been in this in this period where we had $5 gas and whatnot.
so i don't know if you've seen that. we didn't include it in the deck this time we have done in the past, but velocity in the business of dollars per point of distribution have been fairly healthy. so i think, yes, we've gotten distribution where we have more distribution coming in the back half of the year, and we're going to have velocity gains behind the advertising. so i think that all gets us to where we want to get to.
i don't know if that addresses the question or not though.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
no, that's helpful and exactly what i was getting at. i was trying to be confusing, but you got it. trade inventory was the other one there. just help us understand what.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
yes, there was trade inventory. there's fairly significant amount of trade inventory refill in the year ago. it was kind of odd. it was more skewed to the fourth quarter than the third quarter.
but even in the end of the fourth quarter, we had some drawdown when we had our supply problem. so it's going to be lumpy throughout the back half of the year. so we do need to have consumption in excess of our net sales growth to compensate for it. so there's going to have to be some over delivery, but it's not exactly clear how big that number is going to be because the trade inventory needs to grow year-on-year as well as we get more distribution and a bigger business, the customers hold three weeks of inventory and three weeks inventory is a bigger number on the 35% larger business than it was a year ago.
so there will be some trade inventory build that happens this year as well.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
appreciate it. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of rupesh parikh with oppenheimer. please proceed with your question.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
good afternoon. thanks for taking my question. so i just wanted to go back to operating cash flow. so year-to-date, you guys burned a little over $60 million.
it looks like mainly due to ar and inventory. i just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about this cash burn by the end of the year on the -- at the ocf level?
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
sure. so i think the first thing is the receivables. so it's significantly inflated all driven by the growing pains from our new erp system. basically, our inability to invoice on time has obviously caused delays in terms of our cash collection.
now, as you mentioned already on the call. we now have a solution in place that basically allows us to invoice real time with shipments as we had done previously. and so as we collect what was past due and are invoicing our clients, we expect to be back to our normal dso run rate of about 25 days based on our customer payment terms. so that's the first piece.
the other piece on working capital. on the finished goods inventory side, that is sitting on a day that is largely in line with our objectives to be at around four to five weeks of inventory on hand, and we've needed to build inventory to improve customer service. but we did have -- we are sitting on inflated raw materials and packaging inventory. in q2, that was about $5 million worth of an impact.
and that also is attributable to erp growing pain, where we needed to hold on to some incremental inventory to ensure that from a planning perspective, we have what we need as we work through. again, we have a very dedicated team in place now to finish up some of the needed post implementation solutions, but this should really turn around. and what you will see in working capital movement from here on will be driven by the growth in the business and not by the erp impact.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok. great. and then maybe just one additional question. just on the guide.
i'm just curious what you guys see now is a bigger risk for the guide for the remainder of the year.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
we think we've -- rupesh, i think we've captured -- we went through and looked at all of the inflation elements because that's the thing that caught us. i mean we're absorbing in our guidance, some of the conservatism that we built in at the beginning of the year, we absorbed it. we can't, as heather said, absorb all of it. we think we've identified and captured all the inflation that we're going to get.
but there are a few things like diesel and like natural gas that we don't have hedge positions. and if those things ran wild, that could be -- those could be remaining risks for us. not enormous, but they could be risks for us. the flipside is the same thing that we've had and we keep trying to prevent is any supply interruptions, whether it's upstream for us or it's our ability to produce and supply to our customers.
and i would include in that, we need a timely start-up of our ns facility. we feel very good about where we are, we're ready to start it up. but we need that roll line to come on to produce the product to deliver our net sales for the year. so i don't want to make it sound like we don't think there are any risks because there are, and we have to go out and manage them, but they would come on the supply.
not on the demand side, it would come on the supply side, and it would come on inflation. scott or heather don't know if you see it any differently.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
i don't. i think he's covered it fully.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of mark astrachan with stifel. please proceed with your question.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
thanks for a one afternoon. i wanted to ask about volumes. so they seem a little bit slower than at least i would have thought, inclusive of more ad spend that you said earlier in the second quarter. and if we take a look at just the scanner data of the two-year volume cagr has sequentially decelerated.
i think each period since, call it, late march, early april. so i guess i'm curious how that has stacked up versus your expectations. you touched on elasticity on the prepared remarks, but i don't think updated the actual elasticity. so if you could perhaps talk to that? and then how do you think about it if not potentially getting worse with the incremental pricing that you talked about today?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
yes. we expected, i think, as we said in the prepared remarks, we expect to go flat during the summer because it looks like 2019, and that's why we provided the three-year stack. so you could see from 2017 to 2019, we saw very consistently in the summer, consumption goes flat, whether it's people on vacation, dogs eating less. but you went flat and then you came back up again late august into early september.
and we'd expect to see that continue. we did see in june, we saw some softness, so said it about $5 gas, but we frankly also saw come back in july and saw very, very strong shipments in july. we saw household penetration bouncing back up. so we feel pretty good about the trajectory of the balance of the year.
i mean, we're all in uncharted waters, and we don't know whether there's a recession. we don't know if there's -- if the next price increase is going to be something that is the straw that breaks the camel's back. but the data we included in the deck and data that we have beyond that shows that pricing is pretty stable at this point. the sensitivity we have is about where it's going to be is what you'd expect.
after about four or five months, you'd expect to get to a fairly stable place. and so we think we know what it looks like, and we think we know what the trends look like going forward. and our shipments and order rates match up pretty well with the projections and the guidance that we're giving.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. and maybe just sticking with that, thinking about just broader strokes on affordability. so with the new price increase, i think you'll be up something, call it, high teens versus where you were 12 months ago, i guess that's roughly consistent with what we're seeing across the pet food, dog cat category. but to earlier points about potential for increased promotions coming out of this period of heightened inflation or potentially deflation at some point.
you don't promote, you're not going to do that. but if others are doing it and they promote back half of it, then how do you think about the relative affordability for the product going forward at that point.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, do you want to take that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yes. so, mark, so one of the things that we were really conscious about, and i touched on this a tiny bit with peter, but not didn't get into the details. when we -- even this last price increase and all along, we made sure that we had a handful of items that were still as affordable for everyone as possible. and we were really conscious about that.
we did it in a couple of different sizes and a couple of different product forms. so no matter where the dust settles, those products will be available to people and they have seen modest price increases, but they have not beared the brunt. they're not carrying the biggest amount of the price increases. so anyway, i think we tried to be mindful of that.
we put those in place. it will be in our six-pound chicken roll or some of our one, one and a half pound sizes. we've tried to make sure that they continue to remain accessible and affordable.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
ok. thank you.

our next question comes from the line of robert moskow with credit suisse. please proceed with your question.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. thanks. i guess i cover a lot of food companies, and i don't recall hearing any of them talk about a slowdown in consumption from $5 gas, except for maybe impulse. so can you be a little more specific as to what type of products within your portfolio felt that impact? are there some items that are more discretionary in your portfolio? that would make more sense to me than saying that people look at the price of gas and then reduce their -- the volume of consumption for their pets.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
yes. rob, it's -- what we saw was foot traffic down and what people were doing was consolidating trips. and so what we were seeing was people were shopped less frequently, and they move to our bigger sizes. and so it was -- i think it was a temporary phenomenon because if you look -- if we look at our business in july, it bounced back.
in fact, it looks like it's filling a hole that might have been created in june. and i can't put my finger on exactly how that happened or why that happened. but we look at the data on trip frequency and the size of the units that they're buying. it clearly suggests that people who are consolidating trips and buying larger sizes when they made the trips, but there was a little drawdown of pantry inventory that happened, and they're making up for it in july.
again, i don't know the psychology that works behind it, but that's what the data shows.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. and then maybe one more follow-up. you said that you increased your media spend in order to sell through price increases. is that for the benefit of the trade like do you increase the media spending to help the trade with this price increase? or is it for the consumer? because like i don't know why i'm not sure who is helping it sell through to.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
it's to make sure that as you're seeing your prices rise that you're making sure that you're keeping your growth rate intact, right? and one of the things that we looked at when we look at growth rate is we're looking at units, we're looking at pounds, etc., because dollars are a little bit hard to kind of get a handle around right now. and we've been able to see units stay in the high teens, even in same-store sales, high teens into the early 20s and similar with volume. so if you look at it that way, through this period of taking a net 17% price increase, we've been able to keep our overall kind of velocity growth strong. and actually, i mean, i look at it and i go, that's pretty encouraging, especially with what we saw in the category.
if you look at units across the category, everyone's kind of high-fiving across the type-two category, celebrating that they're having growth. but if you remove the price increase growth that they have in place, units are -- look pretty bad or volume looks pretty bad for the majority of the category. so i think that we've come out of this in pretty good shape.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. i don't know if you're making me more optimistic or less by saying that the pet food category is getting hurt, but -- ok, scott. but here's the follow-up. like you're raising pricing in the back half, so why is this just a pull forward in media? would you have to do it again in the back half?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
it's literally all we literally call it a ip and to price increase. it's 2.7%. and is what we're seeing in the back of the year. it's literally rounding if we're at $5.79, we're going to $5.99 on items.
i'm just using that as an example. so it's gap very much.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
one of the lessons that i've taken away from this experience is that we would -- we did one modest price increase than on enormous price increase and then another modest one. and the consumer could digest more smaller price increases rather than the size of the second price increase, which was pretty big because that creates sticker shock and could cause the consumer to reconsider or reevaluate, do i really need this. and as opposed to more frequent, but smaller. and for the next one, i don't think a lot of people are going to add an eyelash app, but they certainly noticed the second one.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst

our next question comes from the line of jon andersen with william blair. please proceed with your question.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
yes. thanks for the question. first question is, bill, i think you referred to providing an update at some point in the future with respect to addressable households and the -- i guess, the underlying algorithm of household penetration and buy rate. were you referring to that as being just kind of a mechanical exercise given the change in approach or methodology by nielsen or something more fundamental based on price changes, a different kind of consumer behavior or both?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
it's somewhere in between. i don't think we're going to go back and revisit the addressable market. we -- at least we haven't committed to doing that yet, but we are looking at the driver. so for example, as scott mentioned earlier, what is the customer acquisition cost with our current pricing in the market? does that change in any appreciable way? what does the buying rate look like once consumers are digesting the pricing we've got? and just reconstruct the model that gets us from where we are to the 11 million households and the $1.25 billion in net sales because as i think i said when i framed it up, i framed it up and saying, we know we're running at a rate that's well in excess of what you need to get to the target.
and the question now is, with the higher pricing and the higher buying rate, what is the composition of that going to look like? do you make any changes because the cac is higher or lower, the buying rate is higher or lower, the households are easier or harder to get. and that's the algorithm we need to put together, and we wanted to see the pricing stabilize before we made that decision.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
ok. so no change to your level of confidence in the $1.25 billion or the 25% ebitda margin. it's just kind of maybe the algorithm underneath that is what you're saying?
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
yes. that's probably the right way to think about it, john.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
ok. and then i guess, just a follow-up. i just have a broad question on direct-to-consumer. you didn't really mention at least in the prepared comments, e-commerce growth this quarter.
if you could give us an update on that? and then are you -- do you have broader plans for a direct-to-consumer offering? when might we hear about that? if so, i just want to get your perspective on that from a competitive standpoint, too. thanks.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
so we've continued to see really nice growth. it's actually -- what we consider e-commerce, which is any place someone can sit down in a computer and order our product. some of that's directly delivered and some of that's click and collect. it's actually paid, i believe, 45 and 46 in the deck, john, and i know we provide a ton of materials to go through.
but -- so that continues to grow. it's -- there's a couple of retailers that are doing like a really, really great job with this. and we're continuing to invest with them and work with them. and over time, we recognize that from a dtc standpoint, we don't believe that going direct to consumer is the right path for us, but we do believe that modifying our product portfolio and working with our existing partners is the right path.
and we feel like we've come up with kind of a new and differentiated model that will be really helpful to kind of break into that piece of the market. and i think whether it's later this year or q1, we'll be introducing some kind of a new product line in order to do that.
jon andersen -- william blair -- analyst
great. thanks. thanks, scott.

our next question comes from the line of ben bienvenu with stephens. please proceed with your question.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, guys. jim salera on for ben. i wanted to circle back to the capex guidance reduction. if we look at pushing the investment in the innovation center more into 2023, just given the overall inflation in building materials and things that go into setting up a new facility, does that $80 million, add that into the capex, i would assume that if you shifted some of that goes into the new year, but it looks like the capex cadence outside of this year is still the same $300 million, $200 million, $100 million [inaudible].
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
so with that innovation center, it literally is we were we can't get as much done as we would like to from a timing perspective. we actually think that can work to our advantage. so i think we touched on whether it's stainless steel, building materials, etc., standard deals, the amount of it we use in our equipment is pretty extraordinary. so as we look at planning that out, we may have to put deposits down at the similar timing, but we anticipate that as the markets on some of those commodities, stainless steel, for example, or some of the other building materials cools off a little bit.
we think there may be advantage in that innovation center, and we're hoping that there's additional savings through that, too.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
so to be clear, that's in the $80 million. is the assumption that some of those like core commodities come down?

$80 million is the timing and a little bit of an efficiency. as we said, we had a conservative set of assumptions. as we get further along, we get more realistic assumptions on both timing and the actual cost, and we pushed some of the projects back. it's also -- you have to know that some of this is a cascading effect where one project leads to the next project.
and so what you're seeing is we showed you capex going out through 2025, but there's some stuff that is just kind of cascading will fall back into '26 in that case. so the $80 million is a total reduction in the horizon we're showing you. some of it is efficiency, some of it is timing, but some of it is pushed out into the latter years.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. so also, i think it seems like a waterfall back out past '20. 2026 could contain some of that incremental spend of like, i think, the 100-ish on that you talked about before?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
but i think importantly -- but importantly. the capital spending that we have planned out in this revision gives us plenty of head space to grow and meet the objectives that we have.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and then just real quick on -- i know we got a lot of questions on the ad spending. but just given that there was such firm add support in the first half of the year. if the economy continues to deteriorate into the back half of the year, would you guys feel ok turning some of the ad spending back on to support volumes? or would that be something that you're more focused on margins in the back half of the year and so you'd rather take the volume hit and wait until the first quarter of next year starts to pick back up.
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
i think that we're very committed to making sure we continue delivering on the top line, and we feel very good about the plan that we've got. there's also lead times on media commitments that would make it hard to do that in an efficient manner. so we're pretty committed to delivering the net sales line, we said, but also delivering the ebitda that we've committed to. so i don't want people to get the sense that we would erode the profitability because we want -- we do know, as we said in the call, we're very focused on generating cash and cash efficiency as we grow.
and so we want to make sure we're very mindful of the investments we make and when we make them.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok. great. thanks, guys.

there are no further questions in the queue. i'd like to hand the call back over to mr. cyr for closing remarks.

great. well, thank you very much for your interest and your attention. i'd like to close with a statement in honor of olivia newton john who passed away earlier today. she said, ""the only wait i left from my dogs to which i would add if she fed them freshpet, they would be lean and the lift easier."" rest in peace.

greetings, and welcome to freshpet's second quarter 2022 earnings call and webcast. at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. a question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [operator instructions].
as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, jeff sonnek, investor relations at icr. thank you. you may begin.
jeff sonnek -- investor relations
thank you. good afternoon, and welcome to freshpet's second quarter 2022 earnings call and webcast. on today's call are billy cyr, chief executive officer; and heather pomerantz, chief financial officer. scott morris, chief operating officer, will also be available for q&a.
before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, management may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. these statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. please refer to the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec and the company's press release issued today for a detailed discussion of the risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. please note that on today's call, management will refer to certain non-gaap financial measures such as ebitda, adjusted ebitda, among others.
while the company believes these non-gaap financial measures provide useful information for investors, the presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with gaap. please refer to today's press release for how management defines such non-gaap measures. a reconciliation of the non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap and limitations associated with such non-gaap measures. finally, the company has produced a presentation that contains many of the key metrics that will be discussed on this call.
that presentation can be found on the company's investor website. management's commentary will not specifically walk through the presentation on the call, but rather it's a summary of the results and guidance that we'll discuss today. with that, i'd now like to turn the call over to billy cyr, chief executive officer. 
bill cyr -- chief executive officer
thank you, jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. the message i would like you to take away from today's call is that the dual challenges of inflation and economic slowdown, which have resulted in unwelcomed volatility in our results. have not derailed our ability to deliver our long-term goals, including significant margin expansion. during this call, you will learn that, first, net sales are strong and growing in line with our expectations, price sensitivity is modest and also in line with our expectations and household penetration growth has accelerated and is more consistent with our long-term goals.
in fact, our net sales growth is outpacing our long-term plan, which only requires a 28% compound annual growth rate to achieve our 2025 goal. second, adjusted ebitda was below expectations in the quarter due to media investment timing, inflation, logistics challenges and the quality issue we had in june. we have already taken the necessary actions to adjust for the critical issues, including announcing a third price increase. however, the cost of the quality issue and the new timing gap on inflation versus our pricing require us to lower our adjusted ebitda guidance for the year to $48 million from $55 million.
third, we are updating our capex expectations to reflect our current best estimate of the actual timing we will experience with our various capacity additions and fridge expansion projects. our initial estimates were very conservative and designed to give us significant flexibility. but now that we are more than halfway through the year, we have much greater visibility and expect that we will spend approximately $80 million less this year than the $400 million previously projected. the impact on our available capacity will be minimal and still leave ample room to grow at or above the rates we had projected.
and fourth, the underlying health of the business both its growth potential and the underlying margin structure remains sound. despite the litany of new obstacles and our own admitted missteps, we deeply believe that freshpet remains one of the best growth opportunities in the cpg space, if not the broader consumer sector. we have consistently demonstrated an ability to grow the business at very strong rates and have now done it at higher prices, improving the pricing power of the brand. importantly, our growth is the result of very solid and sustainable consumer fundamentals, including strong increases in the size of our consumer franchise at steadily increasing buying rates.
this combination is only made possible by strong satisfaction and high customer retention. retailers are responding to that strong consumer interest and now realize that freshpet is the future of pet food. so they are increasing their placements of freshpet fridges and the number of stores with double and triple fridges is expected to grow dramatically in the next year. we already have more than 27,000 fridges in stores and retailer interest is growing, not shrinking.
but the strength of our competitive moat goes beyond our retail presence as we are now building increasingly efficient manufacturing facilities that are unlike any others in the world. our existing freshpet kitchen bethlehem is operating at full capacity and producing strong cash flow, and we are about to open an even larger and more efficient facility in ennis, texas. we have consistently demonstrated an ability to capture the benefits of increasing scale in our g&a costs, and we aim to demonstrate our ability to deliver consistent gross margins as well, regardless of the operating environment. finally, with a strong balance sheet, in combination with the cash generation of the business and our credit agreement, we can support our long-term growth ambitions without the need for additional capital.
there are very few businesses that can say all that. while the past two years have presented some very unusual and difficult challenges, we have worked diligently to ensure that freshpet can achieve its potential and change the way people nurse their pets forever. for much of that time, we did not have enough capacity to meet demand. we outgrew our erp system and labor shortages plagued the business regularly, but we've solved those problems.
today, we have enough capacity to meet demand with more coming online soon. the stores are in much better shape with steady improvement in fill rates and better in-stock conditions. we have implemented a new erp system to enable greater efficiencies and our proactive freshpet academy approach to labor has turned a weakness into a strength. but it goes without saying that the backdrop we are facing today is very different than what we have experienced over the past several years, making it hard to see and appreciate those accomplishments and the potential of the business.
we have replaced a pandemic with inflation, yet we've unfortunately kept the supply chain problems that came with the pandemic. and now we are facing a potential recession. we recognize the desire and need to stay aligned with, if not ahead of the shifting macroeconomic forces. ramp in inflation and higher interest rates necessitate strengthening our focus on the cash-generating capability of the business while simultaneously delivering the long-term 11 million household prize.
while the recent challenges have caused inconsistency in our margin delivery performance, we are in a much stronger position today than we have been over the past two years with a more formidable organization that provides greater control and confidence in the long-term opportunity that freshpet presents. the new capacity plan that we outlined in may provided some early hints of how we might make better use of our cash. including a realignment of where we build various incremental capacity, the use of leases for nonstrategic assets and a focus on more space-efficient technology, but the current environment requires that we go further. there are three areas in particular that we need to focus on: capital spending; start-up expenses; and working capital.
each of these is the necessary use of cash to support our rapid growth but we have significant opportunities to improve our capital efficiency and prove to investors that freshpet can at scale and as we scale, generate significant operating cash flow and ultimately, free cash flow. key to accomplishing that will be to continue strengthening our organizational capability and processes. for example, our new erp system is operating and supporting our day-to-day operations. but we are not getting full value for its expanded functionality.
that has led to inventories that are larger than we need, less efficient use of freight and higher accounts receivable balances. we've put in place a highly focused team designed to capture those benefits, asap. encouragingly, since the quarter ended, we have implemented a more timely billing process which will dramatically reduce our accounts receivable by the end of this month. additionally, we have focused on getting new capacity online as fast as possible and that has come at a cost.
that was necessary because we are so far behind on customer orders, but stores are in much better shape today, thanks to our significant inventory improvements. as a result, we are finally in a position where we could be more prudent with our planned start-up expenses. the same could be said for capital expenses. the intense focus on getting plants built and lines installed quickly often came at the expense of efficiency.
we are adding an intense focus on adding capacity in the most efficient manner while maintaining our commitment to speed and quality. those efforts will not compromise our ability to grow, but rather they will provide added focus on the cost of that growth, ensuring that we get full value for every dollar we spend and that we time our investments to maximize the impact they can have. as part of this renewed focus on capital efficiency, you will see us change how we report adjusted ebitda. beginning with q3, we will no longer add back plant start-up expenses for the new store marketing investment.
that will provide greater clarity on our path toward generating positive net income as the business scales further following our planned capacity additions. we will provide updated guidance using this new definition at that time, and we'll also provide historical data that shows both approaches. this will create a seamless transition from the old measure to the new measure. to be clear, there are no new disclosures and our transparency will remain intact.
this is simply providing greater visibility on the cash usage and generation of the business to meet the shifting needs of the marketplace. while we fully realize this approach will create much lumpier adjusted gross margin and ebitda results. we also believe that it will allow us to demonstrate the emerging profitability of the business with greater clarity and more easily compare it to other high-growth businesses. looking ahead, we are keenly aware that our net sales are running well ahead of the pace needed to deliver our 2025 goal and that the price increases are driving up the buying rate, making that goal much easier to achieve.
we intend to revise our long-term goals by year-end to capture the impacts of the price inflation, including any impact on our ability to attract new users any loss of users due to higher pricing and the full benefit of higher buying rates. we will also need to adjust for the updated methodology that nielsen is using due to determine household penetration. that new methodology is now in place, and it indicates that we have even more users than we previously reported, about 500,000 more users. the new method also indicates that we've been adding users over the past two years at a faster rate than nielsen previously projected, adding an incremental 220,000 users over the past two years and with more balanced growth over time.
i've included a comparison of the old and new data sources in the investor presentation so that you can see those changes. before i turn the call over to heather to discuss the q2 results and our guidance for the year, i also want to make a comment on the planned start-up of the ns facility and how we think freshpet will perform in a recession. we are in the final countdown to lift off in ennis. we remain on track to start up our role line there next month and produce saleable products by the end of the month.
that will not turn into meaningful shipments until october, but it's very exciting to reach this milestone for such a pivotal project. we have begun sending the highly trained production staff back to texas from pennsylvania, and they are ready to go. all the role line equipment is installed, and we are going through our start-up checklist. additionally, much of the equipment for the first bag line has already been installed, and we remain very confident that we will be able to start that line up in q4.
once that start-up happens, it will unlock significant potential for freshpet. in addition to the significant increase in production capacity, it is designed to be our most cost-efficient, most sustainable, highest quality facility with room to grow and support an even larger business. with the first phase of that facility opened next year, we will have more than $1.1 billion in capacity available to us enough to support almost double the volume we have guided to this year. thus ensuring our ability to continue our rapid growth next year and beyond.
we've already spent the cash to create most of that capability, and we will finally be able to generate returns on those investments. turning to the impact of a potential recession on the business. i think it is safe to say that pet food is a category and freshpet as a brand should perform very well in a recession. history has shown that pet food is one of the most recession-resistant businesses as consumers are unlikely to stop eating their pet and the number of dogs in households has grown consistently through each of the recessions of the past 20 years.
while freshpet was in its infancy during many of those recessions, our track record of growth has been extremely consistent, doubling the business at every three years since its founding in 2006. further, as we have studied the household penetration and buying rate data for freshpet versus the entire pet food category during the recent period of rapid price increases, we've seen that the freshpet user base has been more committed to maintaining the freshpet habit, than the pet food category overall. while this is not the same as weathering a recession, it does speak volumes about the overall loyalty of the freshpet franchise even under economic duress. that leaves us confident that we will be able to continue our rapid rate of growth even if we experience a recession.
there's also a positive side to a recession. we believe that a short and not very deep recession could better align supply and demand for the various ingredients and equipment we buy, lowering cost, shortening lead times, and improving availability of the materials we depend on. that could lead to greater capital efficiency and better margins. in summary, the underlying health of the business is strong, and we are more focused than ever on ensuring that the business will generate the margins cash and profitability that you would expect of a company that is leading and defining the future of pet food.
we are navigating some difficult times with the ramp in inflation that the entire industry is facing, but we are engaged we are reacting, and we are improving. and once we find equilibrium with cost and price, we will deliver the gross margins that we know this business is capable of delivering. in combination with the leverage from scale that we get on our g&a costs, -- we believe we are on track to deliver our 25% adjusted ebitda goal by 2025. now let me turn it over to heather to take you through the highlights of the quarter.
heather pomerantz -- chief financial officer
thank you, billy, and good afternoon, everyone. we had strong net sales in the quarter, in line with our guidance, but the adjusted ebitda was below our expectations. a meaningful portion of this shortfall was timing of marketing spend and will correct itself by year-end. some of it was due to the cost of the quality issue we had in the quarter.
some of it was due to some logistics challenges we had in june and which we think we can overcome in the back half of the year. and some of it was due to incremental inflation that exceeded our plan and for which we are taking pricing. let me take you through each element one piece at a time. net sales were $146 million in the quarter, up 34.4% versus a year ago.
nielsen measured consumption in the quarter was up 41%. the difference between nielsen measured growth rate and the net sales growth rate is the size of the trade inventory refill that occurred in the year ago period versus what we did this year. the consumption growth rate consisted of approximately 21% unit growth and 20 points of pricing growth. while we still only have about four months of data with full pricing in effect, this balance between pricing growth and unit growth is in line with our expectations and represents very modest price sensitivity compared to other cpg businesses.
for perspective, our unit growth of 21% in the quarter can be compared to unit growth in q4 of 19%, which was prior to the price increases and 28% in q1 when we had strong distribution and advertising and the smaller of our two price increases was in effect. you should expect that we will always have price growth due to innovation and consumers moving into our higher-value items over time. so our total nielsen measured sales growth should always be a few points higher than our unit growth. driving the net sales growth was a return to household penetration gains closer to what we would expect over the long haul.
over the past 12 weeks, our household penetration has increased by 19% versus a year ago. as billy indicated, nielsen is now reporting that the size of our consumer franchise is larger than we had previously reported, and it is growing more quickly. our consumer data and the feedback we get from retailers would support that. we did see both a downturn in retail foot traffic and household penetration gains in june, when gas prices hit a national average of $5, but we are seeing a strong bounce back as gas prices are dropping again.
that did have a modest impact on the net sales in q2 as consumers seem to consolidate or defer trips in june, but our shipments in july have been strong as have consumption and household penetration gains. it is also interesting to note that the seasonal consumption patterns we are seeing this year are in line with those we saw in the pre-pandemic era, with consumption going flat during the summer months due to established seasonal feeding patterns and then growth resuming in late august. we expect to see that again this year. this suggests that consumers have returned to more normalized pre-pandemic lifestyle.
you can see this on the three-year stacked growth rate chart in the accompanying presentation, which helps smooth the volatility of the last two years and compares our performance to the pre-pandemic period. that shows our growth rate by week when compared to 2019 is extremely consistent, reinforcing the strong and steady growth of the freshpet business. we continue to get strong interest from retailers in placing additional freshpet fridges. our focus and the focus of many retailers has turned toward multi-fridge placement in the highest volume stores so that we can both expand the assortment and improve holding power.
many retailers have been waiting for us to increase our supply before they replace those fridges. that is now happening, but many retailers are running into either labor issues or budget issues that will prevent some of the more major renovations of their pet food sections that are necessary to accommodate the significant increase in space that they are planning for freshpet. that will push some of the bigger launches of multi-fridge sets into next year, so we will likely come in light on the number of upgrades and second, third fridges this year, but will over deliver by quite a bit on the net new stores because those installations require less labor and can be managed within existing retailer budget. those deferred upgrades and second fridges will likely result in a very strong first half of the year next year.
all of this has us feeling very bullish about our prospects at retail over the next 12 months or so. the adjusted ebitda was $3.9 million in the quarter, below our expectations. part of this shortfall was timing with the marketing investment in the quarter coming in at almost $24 million. spending was not incremental to the year.
it simply reflected a timing adjustment. we made this investment to help sell through the 12% price increase that went into effect in mid-march, which is when consumers were most sensitive to the price increase. based on the unit movement and household penetration gains that follows, we are pleased with the strategy and the limited price sensitivity that we encountered. adjusted gross margin was 42.4% for the quarter and was 42.1% for the year-to-date.
this is up sequentially from the 41.9% we generated in q1 but does not reflect the magnitude of the improvement we had expected our price increase to produce given our quality issues. however, when you exclude those costs, the adjusted gross margin would have been approximately 43.8% or about 140 basis points higher. the amount of affected products that got into the market and had to be retrieved was very small. but the cost of the product disposals related to the underlying production issue, some additional lab work and testing and some supplemental processing was much bigger than anticipated.
we experienced increased inflation in some input costs, mainly due to labor and energy as well as transportation cost increases at our suppliers and expect them to continue for the balance of the year. further, our cost for diesel and natural gas is well in excess of the cost we estimated when we gave our initial guidance. and while diesel has moderated recently, it is still well above where it was when we set our budget at the beginning of this year. our third price increase, which will be 2.6% and goes into effect in late september, is designed to protect our margins in the face of those higher costs, and we expect to end the year with much stronger margins and position ourselves with a much more balanced set of costs and pricing as we enter 2023.
however, the timing of the increase will create another mismatch between our cost increases and our pricing in the third quarter. in simple terms, the cost increases we have seen since we set our budget are in the range of approximately $10 million to $11 million or about $15 million on an annualized basis, and our price increase will cover less than half of that this year primarily because it won't be effective until the beginning of q4. we promised you that we would plan more conservatively this year and we did. but while we are absorbing some of the incremental costs -- we cannot absorb all of them, but we are lowering our adjusted ebitda guidance to reflect that mismatch.
we are encouraged by some emerging cost trends that suggest that inflation in the materials that most impact us may be moderating. this may be the result of the economic slowdown we have been hearing about and an early indication of the potential cost benefit we might get if we have a mild recession. spot freight rates have declined over the past three months, and we have gotten a rate reduction that begins in the third quarter. diesel costs have dropped significantly since peaking in mid-june.
while many of our key ingredients and their key inputs continue to move up, the cost of our proteins has stabilized, and there was some suggestion that they might actually provide some relief next year versus the cost we are paying this year. the underlying cost of the materials used in construction and equipment such as steel, nickel, zinc, and copper have also dropped considerably. while none of these declines will help us in the short term, they are positive indications that much of the inflation that has plagued us for the past 18 months may have peaked and that will enable us to restore our margins and complete our capacity projects with less pain. i think it is important to be cautious on this because it only takes one gulf hurricane to drive up energy and diesel cost further or another outbreak of disease to impact the bird block, offsetting the otherwise positive momentum we are seeing.
but the underlying supply and demand characteristics are improving, so i am optimistic that we will finally be able to reap the margin benefits of our price increases, or at least narrow the gap. our production performance in the quarter was strong, with increasing throughput during the quarter, which puts us in a much better position on retail availability. we achieved the highest number of total distribution points in our history during the quarter and have maintained them. as billy indicated, labor has gone up for being an issue for us to be in a real strength.
we have successfully increased the talent of our recruits, invested in their training and are now seeing significant reductions in turnover and much higher productivity. logistics costs, including warehousing, diesel and lane rates, drove approximately $2.4 million of incremental cost in the quarter. this was most pronounced in june when diesel soared to $5.81 and we also incurred higher warehousing costs. including those needed to segregate the products affected by the quality issue and the cost of starting up our new warehouse in dallas.
diesel prices and lean rates have dropped considerably since then, and we should return to more normal logistics costs in q3. a, our inability to start up our inventory allocation tool prevented us from filling trucks as we had intended. while our natural order fill rate continued to improve, our inability to fill trucks completely cost us about $1 million. we expect to continue improving our fill rate and hope to have our inventory allocation tools turned on later this year, but we will get the bulk of the benefit as our fill rates continue to improve naturally.
for perspective, our most recent week fill rate was over 80% and growing. we are continuing to deliver the leverage benefits in sg&a that our plan requires. year-to-date, our sg&a as a percent of net sales has dropped by 150 basis points, and we believe it will continue to improve as the year goes along. capital spending in the quarter totaled $39 million.
as billy noted, we are expecting this year's total capex spending to be approximately $320 million instead of the $400 million we previously projected. the delay in the multi-fridge expansion less maintenance capex and both efficiencies and timing adjustments on our larger capacity projects will free up about $80 million in cash. we are also expecting the same delays to push back some of the capex previously planned for the next year, so will not increase next year's capex, but will instead push the spending back into 2024 or later. we can do this and still deliver our capacity and fridge expansion plans without the need for additional equity.
operating cash flow used in the first two quarters was $62.4 million, which was driven by inflated receivables and inventory levels, which were the result of delays in invoicing and some inventory reporting challenges in our new erp system. and i'm pleased to say that we worked through those issues since the second quarter end. we are also addressing the inventory issues, which was caused in part by the need to hold and have a large amount of product due to the quality issue and expect to see a significant improvement in q3. that is offset in part by the start-up of our second distribution center in dallas.
we drew $27 million on our borrowing facilities in the quarter. at the end of the quarter, we had gross availability of $272 million on our credit line, subject to various women. looking forward, we continue to believe we are on track for our net sales guidance for the year. our net sales are up 38% to date.
q2 was our toughest year-on-year comparison, but we feel comfortable that we could achieve our net sales guidance for the year. we are also lowering our adjusted ebitda guidance to account for the cost of the quality issue and the incremental inflation we are incurring prior to our increased pricing going into effect. thus, we are lowering our adjusted ebitda guidance to greater than $48 million from greater than $55 million. in closing, as you have undoubtedly heard from us and others, this is a turbulent time, but the infrastructure and organizational capability we have built and the underlying strength of the freshpet brand have enabled us to continue our rapid growth, and we are very optimistic about the future.
while we continue to experience short-term hiccups, we learn from each of them, and they become less significant, and this makes us stronger as we pursue our long-term goals. we are motivated by our mission to change the way people notice their pets forever, and we believe we are on track to delivering that goal. that concludes our overview. we will now be glad to take your questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of bill chappell from truist securities. please go ahead.
bill chappell -- truist securities
thanks. good afternoon. sorry, i'm going to go off obviously what dick asked, but just a simple one of exciting on the new hires and certainly seems like solid adds. but how do the conversations go when you're attracting management when there is an active shareholder involved and kind of strategic alternatives thrown out there? i mean, how do you give them comfort and attract additional talent from here?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
bill, i provided an overall comment, but i would prefer not to talk about any of the issues related to activist investors. what i would say is that we're very happy with the quality of the talent we're getting, and they would be a very good indicator of our ability to continue to attract very high-quality talent. so i think the proof is in the talent that we've attracted.
bill chappell -- truist securities
ok. i'll leave it at that. the second, just a follow-up. on the price increase next year, i mean, i guess what we've been hearing is retailers have been, i guess, reluctant but ok with most pricing taken in '22, but there's been more and more pushback about pricing in '23.
so have you seen any of that? or is there -- has this been harder to get through than prior ones? any color there would be great.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, you want to take that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. bill, so i think we've been very open with all the retailers as we've done all the pricing over time. we've explained to them our strategy and how we're trying to make sure that we're making a handful of skus is accessible and approachable to as many consumers as possible and that we want to continue to drive the growth that they're looking for. and i think they realize and recognize that we have been very constrained and putting pricing through.
and i think when we came in with this one and explained exactly where it is, they were incredibly receptive put honestly. and i think part of it is they've seen consistent improvement in the business and the velocity growth over the year and the fill rate over the year. and i think they're also looking at what we've done in pricing and what the rest of the category has been on pricing. and we have been slightly behind what the majority of the category has done.
so i think that they feel was justified. we've had conversations with a majority or many of the top retailers and i think they've been, again, very receptive to the conversation. and we don't anticipate it being a challenge.
bill chappell -- truist securities
great. thanks for the color.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
thanks, bill.

our next question comes from the line of anoori naughton from j.p. morgan. please go ahead.
anoori naughton -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hi. good afternoon. could you perhaps parse out for us the composition of the $100 million reduction in the capex outlook? and which projects have you delayed? and how much of the $100 million now falls into 2025 versus how much reflects capital projects and savings that you found from things like lower construction cost?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
anoori, we're going to come out with a more detailed look at this when we -- our current plan is, as soon as we get todd on board and get his feet on the ground, we'll kind of restate what the long-term targets look like in light of all the inflation and the change or the impact that has had. but what i can tell you is that we took $30 million out of this year. so the $320 million previous outlook would be more like $290 million and we took $70 million out of next year. some amount of that would push back into the later years.
but because we're relooking at all the different projects, i wouldn't cast anything in stone in the out years because we're still doing a fair amount of work on what is exactly the right amount of capacity. and we also are working on some new technologies that might have some potential to alter what capacity we actually put in. so i would take the bank to bank the numbers for the next two years, meaning 2022 and 2023, and we'll come back to you probably in early january with the plans for years beyond that.
anoori naughton -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
ok. great. and then, for my follow-up, could you update us on what the expected time line is to get to full production at ennis? and where do you stand today with staffing and equipment for lines two and three?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. so we're fully -- line one, as we said in the call, is running 24/7 at this point. we have the staffing already for line two for a 24/7 operation that's all been fully qualified and trained. and that line is expected, as we said in the call, to begin running product in january, and we'll be shipping that product within one to two months after that.
and all that equipment is installed, plus or minus a little piece here or there. the third line, all the equipment exists, meaning it's all in texas, but it has not yet been installed. and we have not hired the staffing for that yet because we really need to see how the volume unfolds. but knowing we have the equipment, the installation time is obviously a lot less than construction time is.
and because we already have staffing on the ground there for two lines to 24/7 operation, it's relatively easy for us to do the staff up because what you do is you spread some of the talent you already have around and you hire the new people on to put some of them on your existing lines. so we feel very comfortable. we don't have a specific date for that start-up of that line, but i think of it as being sometime toward the middle part of the year.
anoori naughton -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
very helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of mark astrachan from stifel. please go ahead.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
yeah, thanks and afternoon, everyone. i guess, just a few questions from my standpoint. first, on the pricing. regardless of -- or not necessarily commenting on '23 outlook.
but in terms of what you've seen so far, you commented in the presentation about heavy and super heavy buyers continuing to increase. do you see any impact on the recruitment of new households or consumers from the pricing actions? do you think that what you've done in terms of limiting the lower-priced items has helped trial or has not hurt trial, maybe is a better way to put it, then i've got a follow-up, please.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, do you want to take that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
mark. yeah, so we track it incredibly closely. literally, like every couple of weeks, we're really dissecting it. where we have seen a modest, modest impact is in, i would say, on the lower income groups at this point.
but on our kind of average and higher income groups, there's literally been no impact that we've been able to see and kind of growing penetration among those groups. and i think the main reason is because the category has risen so significantly. and again, it's kind of some of the comments i was mentioning when i was addressing bill's question. but we are -- like if you look at the value of where we are versus where the category is, we've actually been almost a slight advantage to some extent.
and we want to continue to -- like continue to represent that and show that as we're doing these price increases and keeping things as affordable as we can. so we really have not seen any significant impact or slowdown. and the other thing is, when we're looking at the components of the business and the build that we have over the course of the next 12 to 18 months, and we look at all those different things stacked up, we feel really confident to be able to continue to drive penetration. and i can elaborate on some of that at some point if you're interested.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
that's great. i appreciate that. just a follow-up question would be just on the new lines and the thoughts on the lines kind of going forward, not commenting specifically on the reductions that you outlined in capex. but maybe just taking a step back, how do you think about the ability and opportunity to improve productivity of the lines that you've put in recently and we'll be putting in kind of over the next 12 months from both the ability to produce greater revenues and to do it at a lower cost?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. let me take a shot at that, and scott might want to add something. but each time we put in new lines; we obviously look for what improvements we make versus the previous lines. the facility in ennis, the lines have more automation than the lines in bethlem, the way i would describe it is if you think about the move from kitchens one to kitchens two as sort of a quantum leap forward for us.
the leap from kitchens two to ennis is the same magnitude, maybe even a slightly bigger magnitude of leap forward in terms of the automation. and so, we're expecting to be able to have higher throughput per line per hour with less labor than what we have in bethlehem. and we've documented in ethane that kitchens two operates at a significantly higher gross margin than kitchens one does. so we'd expect to see a similar kind of improvement for ennis.
at the same time, though, as you know, we've been -- we hired some people starting back in 2019 that we're working on process improvements for us. and we've got a couple of things that are starting to pan out. we're not ready to declare victory nor disclose what they are other than to say that automation isn't the only driver of efficiency gains for us. there are other possible drivers that we can get that will improve efficiency pretty significantly.
and those things are in varying stages of testing and scaling up.
mark astrachan -- stifel financial corp. -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of brian holland from cowen & company. please go ahead.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah, thanks. forgive me if you addressed this, but those start-up costs that you're no longer adding back appear to be in aggregate about $10 million above what was in my model and, i guess, $10 million or so above the first half. can you just explain what's behind maybe that uptick? perhaps your comfort that you framed it correctly for 4q and when we can expect that to roll off?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
dick, do you want to take that?
dick kassar -- interim chief financial officer
sure. the increase in plant start-up costs, we had a slight delay in getting ennis up and running. early on when we put the plan together, we expected a september start-up, and now it's squeezing toward the next couple of weeks. so a lot of people were hired earlier and they trained in pennsylvania, and they're all part of plant start-up costs.
so we -- that expense is now behind us for line one and two. in line three, we stop hiring. we haven't hired line three yet. we still have more plant start-up costs in quarter four because line two will be coming up, as bill indicated, in some time in the first quarter.
so -- and at that point in time, two lines were running. the plan is eventually to have 10 lines sitting in ennis and we'll have planned start-up cost behind each line, and now we're budgeting for it as part of our gaap reporting.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
appreciate the color, dick. and then, forgive me for peaking ahead to next year, but my model assumes you're spending less than $2.5 million on media 4q. i can appreciate why that might not necessarily have sales in 4q. but presumably, that would weigh on growth at least in 1q '23.
is that fair? and just help us understand to what extent there might be some impact as we roll into next year?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scott, do you want to take that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. so brian, historically, we have not been spent anything significant in q4 from a media standpoint. and we've been able to maintain good momentum, not only through q4 very often, but also right into q1. now, i will tell you, we're going to get started in q1 pretty aggressively right from the beginning.
the best time for us to spend media dollars is early on in the year. we get the best return on that and it helps us carry throughout the year. we also have -- i mean, there's a lot of benefits and i think kind of wind, i would say, that's carrying us. we're going to have better fill rates.
we're going to have great product innovation. we're going to have really strong distribution in addition to the media spend and strong creative and in addition to some things that we're doing that billy was mentioning on quality. i think that with all of those aspects together, i think that's going to put us in a good spot going into next year.
brian holland -- cowen and company -- analyst
great. i'll leave it there. thanks.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
thanks, brian.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of michael lavery from piper sandler. please go ahead.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you. good evening over there. just curious, as you think about florida and the hurricane impact there, it sounds like it was obviously quite manageable. but is there any -- you showed the inventory build, the trade inventory -- a little bit of a trade inventory build in the quarter.
was there much impact from the hurricane, obviously, having some homes without electricity and different in that? and if so, how should we think about 4q and pacing, your guide implies a little bit of a deceleration? is that reflected? or is it more just conservatism? maybe just help -- help us think about the fourth quarter top line.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. as bad as hurricane ian was, it did not seem to have the magnitude of the impact of the hurricanes of 2017. so there was some impact, but it wasn't as significant as the 2017 pieces. as we look and roll to q4, as we said in the comments, at the beginning, q4 just has a tougher comp than q3 does.
and so, that's what we're looking at. there's a -- we had a much stronger start of q4 last year and a little bit of a catch-up versus the q3, we had a warehouse issue in the beginning of q3 last year. and so, q4 had a little bit of benefit from that. so it's just more of a tougher comp that we're looking at as we head into q4.
and we're also, as you remember, we took a price increase in september. so we just want to see how everything settles through. we have another price increase coming in february. we just wanted to get a good handle on it, but as dick said, we feel very good about where we sit right now for q4 and frankly, are very bullish on where we're going to start the year next year
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and just a follow-up on your slide in the presentation about some of the working capital you've got what looks like erp driven improvement there. it sounds like you've characterized some of it as needing to catch up to kind of get to a normalized level, but is there more upside in terms of that improving even further? just trying to understand how to model some of the working capital piece as we think about the balance sheet.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
i'm going to have dick in a second. let me -- but let me just say that we think there's still more room on the receivables. and certainly, there's a fairly significant amount of room, we believe, on the inventory side as well. but dick, do you want to give them the details?
dick kassar -- interim chief financial officer
yeah, we're running with $40 million finished goods. so we had -- so that's about 1.5 weeks more than you would prefer more or like four weeks of inventory versus six weeks. we've also brought a lot of ingredients upfront and the recent -- our department did a great job trying to get a little bit ahead of rising costs. so when you look at our ingredients level and our finished goods level together with packaging materials is kind of in a $60 million range.
our finished goods probably should be about 1.5 weeks less. and as we get ennis up and running and we have two warehouses and we -- our distribution support each warehouse, our inventory will come down to about four and a half weeks of finished goods. the ingredients is really just dependent on how the market looks and what kind of positions we want to take.
michael lavery -- piper sandler -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of robert moskow from credit suisse. please go ahead.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, thanks. do you have any color for us on what to expect for plant start-up expenses next year? and is it fair to say that it's going to be pretty constant for a while, while you're continuing to build out? and then, i had a quick follow-up.
dick kassar -- interim chief financial officer
i'll take that, billy. the plant stock expense this year was related to two lines coming on and also the actual plant being built. so early on, we were looking to be finished earlier in the year, and it's now coming in, as bill indicated, in the next couple of weeks. we already have the two lines staffed.
the next line that we haven't hired yet. but we do have to hire 90 days in advance, so we can train people and get them in-house. but the building and all the expenses associated with the building prior to those first two lines coming up have been -- it was a charge. so you're going to pay for all the utilities and everything else associated with the building the security and everything.
and as new lines come up, that basis -- that base has been covered by the two lines. and as the third line toward the 10th line comes up, each line will have less of a hit as you allocate it across the number of lines in place.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. well, maybe i'll follow up on that. the second question was, in the past, you've said that it's been very difficult to get your full selection of products into the fridges and stores and have them be filled on a consistent basis. where do you think you're at in that journey? i haven't heard about it lately and i want to know -- i heard your fill rates, but i'm not sure about your -- getting that full selection in.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. let me take a shot. you'll see in the deck that we attach, there's a chart that shows what our tdps are, which is not a specific measure of in-stocks, but it's the closest measure you can get from the publicly reported data, and it shows we're at an all-time high. if you break decompose that into the acv and the average skus in distribution, it's like 15 skus in distribution on a 60.3% acv or something like that.
so it's good, but there are still a couple of holes that are sporadically empty that it's just -- we've got to get the right product produced at the right time and in the right warehouse and there's just a logistical challenge for us that we've got to work our way through. but we're getting better every week, and i would hope that once we get these lines and up and running shipping that problem is invisible. but i would point out that our in-stock position today is better than it's been in years, and our fill rates today are on par or better than most of our leading competitors in the pet food space.
robert moskow -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of peter benedict from baird. please go ahead.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
all right, guys, thanks for taking the question. first, just on the efforts to enhance margins. you talked about fixing some costs for next year. can you give us a sense, billy, for maybe the visibility you have into kind of improved profitability next year, just simply based on stuff that, i guess, falls off from this year that you've already locked in? that's kind of my first question.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
think of it this way, peter. we talked about this year having a $19 million gap at the scale that we have in net sales this year, which is sort of the timing mismatch. we expect to have a very minimal timing mismatch in 2023 because of the pricing actions and the commodity purchasing management that we're doing today. so you can take a significant portion of that away.
you can also take a look at what happened. we described the issues in logistics, it's costing us $20 million at this year's scale. i'm not going to say that it's all going to go away all-in-one fell swoop. but as dick said in our comments, our fill rates are consistently getting better.
we're running in the high 80s, and so we're taking away a significant portion of that inefficiency that we had, and we expect that once we get that second dc up and running, in dallas with a full line of items produced locally, meaning in texas that we end up cutting the miles pretty significantly. so there's a big opportunity there. the cost on the quality side, we've got some things that we're rolling out now that we're not ready to describe the benefit of them. but the opportunity pool is of the same size as the opportunity pool was on logistics and the commodity mismatch.
and we think we can make a meaningful dent in it probably more toward the back half of the year than versus the first half of the year.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then, i'm just curious, it looks like still 1,400 locations that are coming on this year. just curious, your conversations with retail partners how those are going right now? what you think the momentum is as you look into next year? is adding a similar amount of good assumption? or what's the view there?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
i think we're going to have a strong back of the year here, and i think we're going to have a very good year next year.
peter benedict -- robert w. baird -- analyst
all right. fair enough. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of up from rupesh parikh from oppenheimer. please go ahead.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. just one question. just on your consumption by channel. so big box pet pretty significantly sequentially.
so just some more color there in terms of what's happening and then how you guys think about the recovery there or the strong potentially stronger growth going forward in that channel?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. so we have never quite smoothed out. there's a couple of factors going on. we have never quite gotten the supply chain as smooth as we would like.
we went a little longer and had some additional product shorts than we have had in a couple of other channels. but i would say the biggest single factor there has been, i'd say, the channel has been slightly slower from a growth standpoint and a traffic standpoint. and i don't know -- i'm not -- i don't know the exact dynamics, but i don't know if it would as gas rose, people were making fewer trips and we've seen some data around that. and i think it maybe had a disproportionate impact on the pet channel.
we've seen these things cycle through over time. i think that the work that in, and i think the work that the channel is doing overall, we will see this kind of move through and get to a more normal balance and growth in that channel over time. now, the important thing for you to take into consideration is today, pet specialty is 14% to 15% of our sales. i have not looked at it in the most recent period, but it's definitely a smaller piece of business but obviously a very important one that we want to continue to develop.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
ok. great. and then, maybe one additional question. just given some of the, i guess, concerns in europe, just any update in terms of what you're seeing in the u.k.
market as well?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. our business in the u.k., as you know, is very small relative to the u.s. business. it's more in the exploratory phase.
we are obviously very mindful of the very rapid inflation that exists there. and so, we are taking pricing there and have taken pricing there. we'll also see that. while we don't have a huge cost base there because our product is produced in the u.s., we will have wage inflation for the team that we have there as well that's going to have to keep up with the market.
but in terms of the consumer dynamics there, so far, they've been holding together pretty well. we haven't seen any significant negative impact on our business trends but recognize we're a relatively small scale there and sort of in the ramp-up phase. so i'm not sure we would necessarily see it the way someone who has to give any more scale would see it.
rupesh parikh -- oppenheimer and company -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of ben bienvenu from stephens. please go ahead.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
hey, guys. good afternoon. jim salera on for ben. i wanted to ask a question on the in-stock rates.
as you guys get the operations side buttoned up, does that have a noticeable impact on the velocity with your retail partners? and then maybe as like a part two to that question. do your retail partners have a certain velocity threshold that they want to hit before they'll put in a second or a third fridge?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
so i'll answer the -- let me answer the velocity one first. so 10 years ago, we were actually below the average for the category and especially on like a sales per linear foot is a very often metric. we actually literally go down to the inches when we look at our fridge, we are actually typically in the top 20% of the category at this point. we're typically the leader in the category from a velocity standpoint.
so we've well overcome the velocity hurdle that we had years and years ago because we have consistent store sales growth. so i think that has not really been a challenge. so the other part of your question was like we have not had full fridges for a very long period of time for -- it's been almost three years since we've had really full fridges with every product in there. and we're still kind of into the -- we're in the 80s at this point.
we should typically be -- we used to be years ago, best-in-class in the high 90s, and that's what we would expect to be going back to over the course of q1. when we see that -- when we're in stock on all of our items every single day, there will be a factor where that being -- having full fridges, there will be a significant kind of benefit to sales in a real kind of multiplier effect on our efforts across the board. so it's probably -- we need to do -- so i would like to do some additional math before putting a pump out there on that, but we have seen it over time that as we have continue to get better fridge fills, it does help velocity by five points.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
i would just add one point to that, which is that we also have this phenomenon where one of the items that has been most frequently shorter is the one where we had the quality issue in the end of q2 and that has thus been in the shortest of supply as we've kind of worked our way through all the challenges that come in the wake of that. when that is out of stock, consumers trade down to our roasted deals item. when it gets back in stock, they trade back up. so we may see the same unit purchases, but we see higher dollars per pound or higher total dollars as a result of getting us fully in stock.
so there's a trade-up phenomenon that happens for us when we are fully in stock.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
and that's not our credit or fresh from the kitchen item bill's referring to.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
got it. maybe if i can ask the second part of the question in a different way. do your real partners have any key metrics that they look at when you're looking to add a second or a third fridge to a kind of clear before you get the green light for that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
you know what the single biggest one has been over the past 24 months or even longer. it has been -- there's no way when i have half empty fridges that you can ask me to add another fridge. and i think now that we -- they start to see really strong, very consistent progression, which is what we've told them time and time again, what we were going to do as we laid out these plans, i think that there's real confidence and comfort in adding additional fridges. that has been -- that has been the single biggest governor on us adding significant numbers of fridges.
and we're now at a point where when you start to hit going from the 50s to the 60s to the 70s and now in the 80s, and they literally are seeing these new lines come up and start to operate. it gives them great confidence to be able to add additional fridges.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. and if i could just ask one housekeeping question, and i apologize if i missed this somewhere in the slide deck. what was advertising spend in the quarter?
dick kassar -- interim chief financial officer
you can see in the deck, it's imputed in there on the sg&a side.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
ok, $14 million.
dick kassar -- interim chief financial officer
yes.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
$14 million, is that?
dick kassar -- interim chief financial officer
yes. that's right.
jim salera -- stephens inc. -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question is from the line of jon anderson from william blair. please go ahead.
jon andersen -- william blair and company -- analyst
thanks. good afternoon, everybody. i wanted to ask -- billy, you referenced competition in the prepared comments. and i was wondering if you could talk a little bit more broadly about competition.
you mentioned one new entrants, i think, in the refrigerated space in store. what are you seeing on a direct-to-consumer basis? and as you bring up this kind of the new capacity and, i guess, some of the capability challenges, should we expect kind of a renewed effort in direct-to-consumer from freshpet?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scott?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah, so i'll jump in on that. john. so i think here's the best way for -- there are a lot of folks coming into this space and kind of how you want to define it and look at it. there's been a lot of folks that have entered retail that have frozen cooked items and some people that have come into fresh.
so if i add all of that together, and i think, john, we've shared a slide once before with you, and i just updated it. if you add all of the competition and all the activity together, it looks like a lot. but we're still 96% of the sales in fresh and frozen cooked foods. so we are -- we're by far like the enormous piece.
and we've been maintaining share there. so i think we're really proud of the results there. and look, we know over time that there is a real chance that competition continues to make progress. we think the end state of this category, as we've talked before, is in the many billions of dollars in the $4 billion or $5 billion range, and we know we're not going to be alone in that.
but our goal is to have as much share as we possibly can of that $4 billion to $5 billion. and i love what gatorade is done after 30 or 40 years. and i think that would be our target too. so i think that's one of them.
on the dtc piece, we recognize that there is a really interesting market. there are a group of consumers. now, it's a small group, but it's an important and high-value group of consumers that really appreciate not only customized but also very convenient meals that are coming to their homes for their dogs. and we are -- we continue to evaluate that and look at ways that we can make our product even more customized and more convenient.
and i think we'll continue to update people over time. i don't think we're quite ready to share exactly what we're looking at. but i think we have a solution that utilizes our best assets and capabilities to give a consumer a great proposition.
jon andersen -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. and just a follow-up. i think in reference to the 2025 plan in the prepared comments, it was mentioned that you have a lot of confidence in the sales target for 2025. i didn't hear -- i don't think -- i may have missed it, any reaffirmation of kind of an ebitda margin target? any thoughts or willingness to update that?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
well, john, what we were trying to say was we freely recognize that because of all the inflation that we've had in the past year and the impact that it's had on buying rate, potential impacts on household penetration or customer acquisition costs and then also on our margin structure. we didn't really want to address the net sales, ebitda margin in 2025. we'll come back and do that in january and kind of level set from what we see at that point. but we didn't want people to think that the change in the capex spending we were doing was going to, in any way, impact our ability to get to that number.
and so, that's what we are trying to say is we're just trying to make sure people understood that capex changes are not going to impact our ability to get to the $1.25 billion.
jon andersen -- william blair and company -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of cody ross from ubs. please go ahead.
cody ross -- ubs -- analyst
good evening. thank you for taking our questions. i just want to focus a little bit on gross margin here. you called out inflation and quality issue as two of the leading headwinds to gross margin in the quarter.
can you quantify the impact on the quarter? and when do you expect the quality issue to no longer be a headwind?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
dick, do you want to take a shot at that?
dick kassar -- interim chief financial officer
sure. yeah, we've never broken out quality before. but we certainly suffered consequences from a margin standpoint, not only for the quarter, but year-to-date, we did disclose, i think, in the last quarter, $3.5 million for one of our role issues. and we're working on improving the quality.
as billy described earlier, we have some some strategies going on, and we feel good about how they're going to impact the latter part of 2023. so i'm not so sure i really want to break that at this point in time.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. i wouldn't break it out and just to add to what dick said, we're pretty comfortable that the impacts on quality, which is you're growing at our rate, and we are the pioneers in this space. we will find issues before anybody else will because added scale, things that happen at a smaller chance of happening will show up at some point. our challenge is to minimize the size of the impact whenever something does show up that we had not properly anticipated.
so that means make it less time, impact less product results in less disposals. our roles are very robust. we feel very good about that. the focus is on making the bag products as robust as they can be.
cody ross -- ubs -- analyst
and then just switching gears a little bit to fill rates here. you mentioned fill rates are in the high 80s right now. what are your biggest challenges today? and when do you anticipate bill rates going back to normal levels? i think i might have heard 1q '23, is that correct?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. the biggest impact on the fill rates in the like literally in the immediate moment is just getting caught up on our fresh kitchen product, which is where we had the product quality issue earlier this year. it's taken a while to kind of sort our way through that and get caught up. we are starting to make fairly significant progress on that.
so i see that closing and may even close by the end of this year. but as we've said all along, rolled capacity has gotten tight, and we needed the ennis line to come on in order to ensure that we could keep up with the demand on our roll side. so as long as ennis production goes at the rate at which we're hoping it will go, we should be able to fill any of those holes that we'll have on the roles. and as scott said earlier, i feel pretty good about our total capacity position as we head into q1.
i mean, it should get progressively better from where we are now in the mid- to upper 80s. but as our standard -- our markets to be well above 95%, we think we'll be there in q1.
cody ross -- ubs -- analyst
great. thank you for that. i'll pass it along.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of peter galbo from bank of america. please go ahead.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, guys. good evening. thanks for taking the questions. i'll be pretty quick.
i guess, billy, i just kind of want to clarify the timeline with todd and dirk stepping in, later this year, it seems like maybe you're thinking about reassessing and presenting something to us in january. but i just wasn't sure if with them coming on. is that really enough time to assess or reassess if plans need to be adjusted? or is there maybe a more extended timeline once they come in to reevaluate?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
yeah. it's a good question. our current target is to do it sometime in january, would be a logical place for us to do it, but we aren't going to do it if we're not ready. having said that, the work has already started and it's well along at this point on all the pieces that we need to put together because the rest of the team has been working on this for some time.
but we do want to make sure that the new talent has a chance to get in, kick the tires and fully bet it. dirk starts this coming monday. so he'll get his arms around the work pretty quickly. one of the things i would point out about these two new hires is, in both cases, they're ready to go on day one.
this is not a new industry. it's not a role that they haven't played before. they know most of the key players involved in the industry. so they're going to hit the ground running from day one, and we feel very good about it.
todd starts on december 1. that doesn't mean we won't be feeding them lots of information between now and december 1, so that he is fully up to speed and ready to go on december 1. so i feel like we're giving ourselves room, but we will not come out with something unless they've had a chance to wrap their arms around the sections that they have responsibility for and feel good about what they're communicating because we want them to make the same level of commitments that we make.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
ok. no, that's helpful. and then, dick, if i could just ask two really quick clarifying questions. i think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that gross margins were roughly $5 million under what you would have thought.
i think that was a price cost comment that maybe would catch up in 4q. i just wanted to clarify that. and the lower capex spend that you guys are talking about for this year and next year, obviously, some of the projects, but is there any impact just on cooler placements as a result of that lower capex? or is it solely kind of on production side?
dick kassar -- interim chief financial officer
yeah, it's production sites, not on coolers. and in the margin, we said we had a 2.6% price increase effective the first week of september, but by the time it ships. so it will impact the 2.6% will pick up for the whole fourth quarter, which adds about 130 basis points against fourth quarter sales, which is part of it. and we do have some commodities that have moved in our direction.
so we feel that the margin improvement in the fourth quarter should pick up nicely.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
am i just -- am i correct in thinking that the $5 million -- that you were like $5 million behind price cost, though, in the third quarter, is that what you had said earlier?
dick kassar -- interim chief financial officer
yeah. and if you think about it, the 2.6% impacted it along with some onetime issues in disposals and quality.
peter galbo -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. thanks very much.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of connor rattigan from consumer edge research. please go ahead.
connor rattigan -- consumer edge research -- analyst
thanks for the question. just one for me. so i was hoping to touch on the trip consolidation and pack mix issue that popped up last quarter. so from the data we've seen, it appears some of that may still be going on despite meaningfully lower gas prices versus last quarter.
have you seen any improvement or, i suppose, a return to normalcy on that front with the consumer returning to their typical shopping habits and smaller tax sizes?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
scot, do you want to take that?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
sure. sorry, i missed a bit of it somewhere in there. it was about focused on pack sizes and return to pack sizes, is it right?
connor rattigan -- consumer edge research -- analyst
yes, that's correct. foot traffic. talking about foot traffic and people tax sizes as a result of that.
scott morris -- chief operating officer
yeah. so there has been a -- it's really been interesting to watch. there's a pretty amazing dynamic going on in the category where people have been -- so here's what we've been seeing. in the category, we're definitely seeing where people are trying to stretch things a little further as much as possible.
. there are -- there have been some pack size changes. there has also been some trade down from one item to another item within a brand. we have really weathered this quite well. i mean, amazingly well.
and i think it's given us increased confidence of what the portfolio is capable of. and i think it's given us really strong confidence in doing the pricing again next year. i'm not saying this is a we can be -- we can -- we don't need to be really diligent and thoughtful about it. but we really have not seen the impact in the rest of the category, and we consistently look at growth rates and -- not only in dollars but also on pounds, equivalized units, etc.
and it just gives us, i guess, really good confidence going into the changes we're making with the other components we have helping the business continue to progress forward.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from the line of john lawrence from benchmark. please go ahead.
john lawrence -- the benchmark company -- analyst
yeah. thanks. hey, guys. billy, would you comment just a minute on the decision today on the capex? am i reading it right that as you look at the margin improvement plan as you go toward '25, does this allow pushing out some of those projects a little bit? will that allow that margin to expand a little bit earlier, maybe in '23, '24 without the dilution from the projects, is that fair?
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
we're going to go into the detail on the projects probably when we roll out the longer-term plan. but part of what we figured out how to do is take some of the innovation projects that we're working on, and we found a more efficient way to produce them that requires us to spend less capex upfront. and to the extent that that has an impact on margin, that would flow through. but i would say that the margin piece in the capex, while they're obviously related when we're not using adjusted gross margin.
but on an adjusted gross margin basis where we don't include depreciation, i don't think there'll be a whole lot of connection, that would be the expert on that. i think, though, that what you're going to see going forward is the more of our volume that we can have loaded into the ennis facility, the more margin improvement you see on the total business. and so, as we look at how we lay out the capex plan and the resources, our is to put as much volume in that facility as we possibly can because it is the advantage facility from a margin perspective. and our capital spending plans will mirror that.
dick kassar -- interim chief financial officer
on a gaap basis, you would suffer depreciation on that $100 million, assuming it was completed by the end of '24, would have hit '25 and now pushing that out does help on a gaap basis but not on an adjusted gross profit basis.
john lawrence -- the benchmark company -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. good luck.
operator
our next question comes from the line of corey grady from jefferies. please go ahead.
corey grady -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. thanks for taking my questions. i just want to ask two quick follow-ups. first on pricing, do you expect to be in line with the industry or taking another round of pricing? and then have you seen any change in the industry in terms of promotionality?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
it's interesting. i was literally just looking for motion, and i was waiting for promotion to start getting more aggressive. it really hasn't moved at all. i'm back, it actually looks like it might have contracted a tiny bit across the industry.
and again, when i'm looking at it, i'm looking at wet and also in dry foods. so it's not a direct competitor, obviously, but they are calories in the category. so we haven't seen that action come out yet. when we do take our next price increase, we will still be below what most of, i would say, the wet part of the category has taken and will be in line or a bit above some of the dry.
and there is a pretty big range by manufacturer on what the pricing has been from what we've been able to see. we're just looking at retail prices, but there's been some pretty dramatic moves on a lot of brands here. so i would say we'll still be -- we'll be below wet even when we take this price increase and then in line or slightly above a couple of the dry brands, but in a good spot, really in a good spot overall.
corey grady -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then, i just wanted to follow up. so the update on your heavy and super heavy users.
you've talked about 25% of freshpet customers using fresh kind of the full meal replacement in the past. can you give us an update on what percent of your customers use freshpet as a meal replacement?
scott morris -- chief operating officer
i have not -- -- billy, it may have been in one of those decks. i do not remember -- i may be able to find it, but i do not have it off the top of my head, quite honestly. it's something that we -- i don't think it's changed. go ahead.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
when you reported on a sales basis, so what percentage of our sales are from people who are doing that, it's north of 50%. but when you look at it as a percentage of the universe, it's a smaller percentage.
corey grady -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. and now i would like to turn the conference over to mr. billy cyr, chief executive officer, for closing comments.
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
thank you very much for your interest. we feel very good about what we've delivered, and we feel like we have delivered a strong on-plan quarter. we look forward to continuing the strength for the balance of the year. i want to leave you with one thought as i always do.
according to canadian author and history in charlotte gray, a dog desires of section more than is thinner, well almost, to which i would add, if you feed them freshpet, the dinner will win hands down. thank you very much, and we look forward to following up with you later. thank you.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, greetings, and welcome to the freshpet inc. third quarter 2022 earnings call. [operator instructions] as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. it is now my pleasure to introduce you your host, jeff sonnek from icr.
please go ahead.
jeff sonnek -- investor relations
thank you. good afternoon, and welcome to freshpet's cuts third quarter 2022 earnings call and webcast. on today's call are billy cyr, chief executive officer, and dick kassar, interim chief financial officer. scott morris, chief operating officer, will also be available for q&a.
before we begin, please remember that during the course of this call, management may make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. these statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements. please refer to the company's annual report on form 10-k filed with the sec and the company's press release issued today for a detailed discussion of the risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made today. please note that on today's call, management will refer to non-gaap financial measures such as ebitda and adjusted ebitda, among others.
while the company believes these non-gaap financial measures provide useful information for investors, the presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with gaap. please refer to today's press release for how management defines such non-gaap measures. a reconciliation of non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with gaap and limitations associated with such non-gaap measures. finally, as previously disclosed, during the second quarter call, beginning with this third quarter of 2022, the company is no longer adding back net start-up and launch expenses in this definition of adjusted ebitda.
the company has provided those costs in the table at the end of its press release to assist in our analysis of the results under both methodologies. additionally, the company has produced a presentation that contains many of the key metrics that will be discussed on this call. that presentation can be found on the company's investor website. management's commentary will not specifically walk through the presentation on the call, rather is a summary of the results and guidance they will discuss today.
additionally, we'd ask that your questions remain focused on the performance of the business and the results in the quarter. management will not discuss or speculate on other topics beyond what is being reported here today. with that, i would like to turn the call over to billy cyr, chief executive officer. billy? 
billy cyr -- chief executive officer
thank you, jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. the message i would like you to take away from today's call is that we had a solid, on-plan quarter and that we are taking concrete steps to deliver on the enormous potential of freshpet by addressing the most critical issues we outlined in our september organization change announcements. those actions include: one, continuing to drive the strong and consistent top line growth that freshpet has demonstrated for the past six years. we delivered 41% growth in the latest quarter and are on track for our sixth consecutive year of accelerating growth.
we are also well ahead of the pace needed to achieve our 2025 net sales goal of $1.25 billion. second, executing on our operational improvement plan to drive margin expansion, in particular, the quality, logistics and commodity cost management issues. i will provide more detail on our actions and progress on those in a few minutes. third, aligning long-term growth with prudent capital expenditures.
our goal is to build a very large and comfortable cash buffer in order to optimize our liquidity and financial flexibility. we've made good progress on this so far, and we are fully confident that we have adequate resources to meet our growth goals with the cash we have on hand, available credit and the cash flow from operations. i will touch on that in more detail in a few minutes as well, but the headline is that we are now projecting that our capex spending over the two-year period of 2022, 2023 will be reduced by $100 million versus our last projection with no change to our near-term growth or our 2025 net sales targets. additionally, i want to highlight that we are rapidly building the organizational capability needed to deliver the results we need.
today, we announced two important additions to our team. first, todd cunfer will be joining freshpet on december 1 as our new cfo. todd is a proven public company cfo with experience in a high-growth food business. he has been the cfo of simply good foods for the past five years and delivered exceptional performance there.
prior to that, he worked in a wide variety of finance roles at hershey for more than 20 years. we are thrilled to welcome him to our team. we are also welcoming dirk martin to our team as vp of customer service and logistics. dirk is coming to us from lamb weston where he managed a large network of third-party distribution centers and a complex supply network of both brokered and direct freight in the u.s.
and abroad. in total, he has spent more than 20 years in supply chain, inventory management and logistics roles in a variety of industries and brings much needed expertise to our team. dirk will begin a freshpet this coming monday. now, let me turn to the results for the quarter.
i will start with a few key highlights of our strong top line performance. as i said, our net sales growth was 41% in the quarter. this was driven by 37% growth in nielsen-measured consumption and approximately 4% growth from our efforts to replenish trade inventory. we built market share in all classes of trade and are now the #4 brand of dog food in the nielsen mega channel and closing in on no.
3 and no. 2. we are also the no. 1 brand of dog food in grocery despite having only 70% acv distribution in that channel.
freshpet velocity, i.e., dollars per point of distribution in grocery, is now 50% greater than the second highest velocity dog food brand. that makes freshpet an incredibly valuable brand to retailers. according to scanner data, unit growth in the quarter was approximately 18%, and with the remaining 19 points of consumption growth coming from price increases. price sensitivity has stabilized behind the large price increase in february at levels that are considered very attractive in the world of packaged goods.
we've just begun to see the third much smaller 2.6% september price increase show up at retail, but have not seen any indications of significant price sensitivity behind that increase and don't expect to see much. as anticipated, household penetration continued to grow now that we are back in stock and media is on the air. in the most recent 52-week period of nielsen household panel data, freshpet household penetration was up 14% and buying rate was up 19%. it will take some time for the rolling 52-week measure to reflect our improved growth rates, but we are well on our way.
it is also interesting to note that the rate of growth among heavy and super heavy users is even stronger, suggesting that we are succeeding at converting more households to using freshpet as the main meal item. going forward, we will be transitioning our reporting to data provided by numerator as it provides a larger panel with more in-depth demographic information and provides better coverage of all channels. we will reconcile the old reporting and the new reporting when we make that transition. now, i'd like to turn to the operational plan to drive margin expansion that we've outlined previously, with particular focus on logistics, commodity cost management and quality.
let me start with our commodity cost management. as a reminder, this issue has been the result of a mismatch between the timing of when we incur increased input costs as compared to when we can pass on those higher costs to our customers. in 2022, we estimate that lag cost us approximately $19 million. given the magnitude of this headwind, our entire organization is focused on this and it is an area that we have already taken some action on.
in the near term, we've gotten closer to our suppliers so that we can better understand the variables driving their costs so we can better anticipate cost increases. additionally, we put in place a more rigorous system of tracking underlying cost drivers, adjusting the frequency and duration of our supply commitments and are working with our suppliers to find ways to create greater cost certainty that works for them and for us. we are already in discussion with some potential partners about hedging a wider range of our commodity costs and have locked 75% of our natural gas exposure for next year and are looking at other items such as diesel. in total, we have contracted for inputs totaling 25% of our costs already and expect to have significantly more committed prior to the beginning of the year.
the point is that we are seeing headwinds sooner and using that information to take more timely price increases. as a result, we have now taken a hard look at our anticipated cost for 2023, roughly two months sooner than we have in previous years and have concluded that the basket of input costs will go up in the near term. and in response to that work, we've already announced a 5% price increase to go into effect in early february. that increase is designed to protect our margins and to greatly reduce the impact of any timing mismatch.
on logistics, as i mentioned previously, we've just announced the hiring of a new vp of logistics, who has extensive experience with the cold supply chain in the u.s. and abroad during his time with lamb weston. his focus will be to help us more efficiently grow into our expanded distribution network and drive out the elevated costs we have absorbed over the past year. additionally, we are making good progress with the start-up of our second dc, but do not expect to see the benefits of that until sometime in late q1 of 2023 or early q2.
in the area of quality, i don't want to go into too much detail because we view the improvements we make in this area to be highly proprietary in a source of long-term competitive advantage. but i can say, we are already rolling out one new technology we developed over the past three years that we believe can make a sizable impact and have two more under development. improvements in this area will take time but will also provide a meaningful extension of our formidable long-term competitive moat. in addition, we have very strong candidates under consideration for the new leadership roles in this area.
in q3, our quality costs, i.e., disposals and secondary processing costs, both declined versus q2, the disposals cut in half, and we're off to a good start in q4. we see this as a big opportunity for both cost improvement and proprietary advantage and are resourcing it as such. the accompanying presentation contains details on these efforts and a few additional efforts we are undertaking to enhance margins. in summary, we have a deep appreciation for the importance of rebuilding credibility with you and our team's ability to execute on our operational plan to drive margin expansion will be a primary proof point.
i want to impress upon you the focus and determination we have. we have made good progress on each of these efforts since we identified them early in q3. we have lots of work left to do. the path is clear, and we are doing that work.
now, i'd like to discuss how we are aligning our net sales growth goals with prudent capital spending to grow capacity. let me start by providing some context. our primary motivation over the past several years was to build as large of a consumer franchise as possible before competition arrived. we described this as a land grab, and we were determined to get as big as we could, as fast as we could.
and while this is no easy task in a normal operating environment, it was made doubly difficult by the pandemic and the related supply chain and labor issues for the past three years. over the past year, however, that situation has begun to change. while we have continued to increase our scale, the latest competitive entry from a leading competitor and with the support of a very large retailer has made a little progress. we're out selling that competitor 7-8:1 in the stores where both our brand and theirs is distributed.
this provides another proof point for how significant our competitive advantage is and how much of a head start we have. executing a freshpet food program is extremely difficult. we've learned that the hard way at times, but our potential competitors also have to contend with a complex moat that we have created over the past 16 years, which covers the formidable combination of manufacturing know-how, fridge placement and management, fresh food distribution and more. in that context and with the successful completion of the ennis facility, we are well positioned to balance growth and margins with our increased scale and do so within a prudent financial and investment framework.
as a result, we are revising our expansion plans and can smooth our capex spend to enhance liquidity and financial flexibility, while achieving our robust growth expectations. we have already shifted a few projects that we believe we won't need until further down the road. we aren't ready to provide the full impact of those decisions yet, but we can say that our expected capex spending this year and in 2023 will be approximately $100 million less than we previously anticipated, with a $3 million capex reduction in 2022 and $70 million next year. as noted, importantly, we remain confident in our 2025 net sales target.
we have the resources and capacity to achieve that target, and we believe we are well on track to deliver it. for perspective, with ennis up and running, we will have enough installed capacity to support more than $1 billion in net sales before any of the technology previously mentioned were added investments in capacity. finally, before i turn it over to dick to provide more detail on the quarter, i want to comment on the start-up of our ennis texas kitchen. we are already producing very high-quality roles on our first line.
we will be able to ship those roles once we have completed our final validation on the building security and process controls. our priority there is to produce the widest range of skus rather than the maximum volume because that enables us to make full utilization of our dallas dc. to date, we have qualified 12 skus, and we will continue our projected ramp-up, which is on track having already shifted to 24/7 production on the roll line. for context, that is about six months faster than we were able to hit that milestone in kitchens too.
the number of skus we have qualified is similarly ahead of the pace we have delivered on previous start-ups. that is largely due to the extensive planning and training we did in advance of this start-up, including the significant investment we made to train our production team in pa for up to a full year. the second line in ennis, a bag line, will begin test runs in january, about one to two months later than previously indicated, and we expected to begin shipping product about one to two months after that. this added time is designed to ensure that we have completed the optimization of the rolls line start-up, where we have a greater need for the capacity.
we have adequate bag capacity in our system to meet the current level of demand, so this delay will not impact our growth. however, it will delay the full utilization of the dallas dc until later in q1 or early q2. once those two lines are operating, we believe that we will have enough capacity to fully support our growth for 2023, enabling us to provide exceptional service to our customers and consumers and support the aggressive growth plans we are aiming for in 2023. we also believe that at scale, ennis will be our most efficient plant.
the ennis facility has the capability to have higher throughputs with less labor and longer run times as a result of greater automation, some technology improvements and through enhanced sanitary design. additionally, the on-site chicken processing will offer improvements in quality and cost versus what we experienced in bethlehem. in summary, we are seeing evidence that the foundation we have laid over the past year is paying dividends and will continue to do so in the coming months and years. we have our largest and most efficient capacity project completed and it will begin shipping product in a week or two.
that gives us a long runway for growth and margin expansion. we have started up our second dc, which will ultimately shorten the distance our product travels to customers and reduce our freight costs. we've restored retail conditions. and the household penetration growth is on track to support our long-term net sales goals.
we have proven that freshpet has the pricing power needed to offset rising costs and still deliver strong growth and will ultimately produce attractive margins. we are executing on a multifaceted operational improvement plan to drive margin expansion over time. we are also taking a more prudent approach to capex and and have reduced expected capex spending substantially. we are tracking the caliber of talent we need to address our challenges and support our growth, and we have strong support from our customers and consumers.
we are improving the quality of our execution and look forward to demonstrating the cash generation that this business is capable of delivering. that is what we are focused on. now, let me turn it over to dick for a more detailed review of our financials, including a discussion of the change in the reporting method. dick?
dick kassar -- interim chief financial officer
thank you, billy, and good afternoon, everyone. let me start by outlining the change in our reporting method before i share the results. as we indicated last quarter, we will no longer add back plan or launch expenses in determining our adjusted ebitda. it is important to note, however, that these changes do not reduce the data that we make available.
our published financial results always quantified all of the elements of the new adjusted ebitda definition. we are simply changing the definition of adjusted ebitda to bring greater focus on our cash generation capability. since it's the first quarter of good new definitions, i'll try to bridge the measures for you as we go along. in that context, quarter three was a solid on-plan quarter.
net sales grew 41% and we are now 39% of the year ago for the year-to-date. under the new definition of adjusted ebitda, our adjusted ebitda is $3.5 million since we have not added back the $8 million of planned start-up expenses and $1.5 million of launch expense for a total of $9.5 million that we incurred in the quarter. we incurred a total of just $1.2 million of such costs in the year ago period. we added 374 new stores in the quarter and are on track to add 1,400 stores this year.
while it does not impact our launch expense, we also added 408 new upgrades and 382 second, third fridges for the year-to-date. adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 34.5% under the new method, 530 basis points lower than it would have been under the old reporting method. as you know, in quarter 3, we had significant preproduction expenses in ennis, texas, and we will have those again in quarter four as we ramp up production on multiple lines and multiple items. we experienced significant inflation in cost in the quarter and have now taken price increase to cover those costs.
however, we did not take the pricing soon enough to deliver the gross margins we should expect in a more stable market. that mismatch cost us approximately $5 million or 340 basis points of adjusted gross margin in quarter 3. as billy indicated, we have already announced another round of pricing to offset the higher cost we anticipate in 2023. while we anticipate that our chicken prices will be flat to slightly lower next year, other costs, including energy, packaging and grain-based inputs, are expected to go up in the near term.
so we are proactively taking the pricing now to avoid another significant pricing mismatch. that price increase will average about 5% and will go into effect with orders on february 6, 2023. we continue to drive g&a leverage in the third quarter, generating 220 basis points of adjusted sg&a leverage, excluding media and logistics. this is consistent with our long-term trend in our 2025 goals.
our logistics costs in the quarter continued at an elevated level as we've been both starting up a second warehouse where we incur significant costs to move product between warehouses and have been unwinding some of the warehouse congestion created by the product quality issues we had in quarter two. that situation is now improving quite a bit. freight rates have dropped and our fill rates are now running in the mid- to high 80s. so we expect to begin seeing improvement in logistics scores going forward, beginning immediately in the fourth quarter.
however, until ennis is producing the full range of both bag and roll skus, we will incur above average freight costs until we can fully utilize the new dallas distribution center, which is like to occur in quarter one or early quarter two of 2023. we invested $73 million in capital in the quarter and expecting to spend a combined total of $520 million over full years 2022 and '23. and year-to-date, we have spent $168 million of that total. the performance of our erp system continues to improve, and that has resulted in a reduction in working capital.
while inventory levels are still higher than we would ultimately like them, our receivables improved by $14 million or approximately 10 days of sale. operating cash flow used in the first three quarters was $54 million. we did not draw on our borrowing facility in the quarter. looking forward, we continue to believe we are on track to meet or exceed our net sales guidance for the year.
our net sales were up 39% year-to-date through quarter three. we have a much tougher compare in quarter four than we had in quarter three. but overall, we feel very good about where we are in net sales. similarly, we are reaffirming our previous underlying guidance, but adjusting the guidance to reflect our new accounting method for determining adjusted ebitda, which now includes the impact of $29 million of start-up planned expenses and $4 million of launch expenses.
subtracting this $33 million of expense from the $48 million underlying guide, you arrive at our new adjusted ebitda guidance, which reflects the new reporting method of greater than $15 million. in closing, we remain very optimistic about freshpet's future. we have strong demand, significant new capacity in state-of-the-art facility focus on improving logistics, quality and commodity cost management and strong retailer support. we appreciate the support we have received from our investors and look forward to creating significant shareholder value in the years ahead.
that concludes our overview. we will now be glad to take your questions. as a reminder, please focus your questions on the quarter and the company's operation. operator?
