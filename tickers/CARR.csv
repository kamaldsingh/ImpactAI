good morning, and welcome to carrier's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. this call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available to download from carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.
i would like to introduce your host for today's conference, sam pearlstein, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
sam pearlstein -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, and good morning, and welcome to carrier's fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. with me here today are david gitlin, president and chief executive officer, and patrick goris, chief financial officer.
except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a non-recurring and/or nonoperational nature often referred to by management as other significant items. the company also reminds listeners that the earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. carrier's sec filings including forms 10-k, 10-q and 8 k provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements.
this morning we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020, discuss the full year 2021 outlook and will leave time for questions at the end. once the call is opened for questions we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up to give everyone the opportunity to participate.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our president and ceo, dave gitlin.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
okay, thank you, sam, and good morning, everyone. i'll provide a quick summary of our fourth quarter performance on slide 2 and patrick will provide more color. in short, no surprises. sales were up 2% on a reported basis flat organically as residential hvac remained very strong with a 25% year-over-year increase.
we produced $453 million of adjusted operating profit executing on the cost actions that we planned and communicated including accelerated growth investment, incremental public company costs and some one-time items that patrick will cover. and we are very pleased with our free cash flow generation in the quarter. excluding the beijer tax payment of $272 million, we would have exceeded our forecast by about $100 million. importantly, we continue to consistently execute on our long-term strategic growth agenda while maintaining strong traction on our carrier 700 and g&a cost reduction initiatives. all of this positions us well for 2021 and beyond.
turning to slide 3. before we dive into 2021, let me provide a broader look back at 2020. i look at 2020 as both a foundational and a transformational year for carrier. with the spin from utc, it was clear that we had a unique opportunity to create tremendous value, but to do so we needed to create a new carrier. we started with our culture and took an intentional and deliberate approach to launching the carrier way. our culture reinforces our value and is centered around customers, agility, innovation, talent and winning, and the energy level within carrier is tremendous. in addition to culture we have invested in and promoted existing employees, while infusing the team with key outside talent who have brought fresh perspectives and proven leadership.
we also launched several new initiatives designed to further enhance the agility and effectiveness of our organization. for example, we launched carrier excellence, our new operating system, carrier alliance, our new supply chain program and we undertook a holistic and structural approach to driving sustained g&a reductions and simplicity across the business. we put a disciplined process in place to drive $600 million of recurring cost savings over three years, carrier 600, and given our strong progress we recently increased our target to $700 million under the renamed carrier 700.
we also dramatically improved the balance sheet since then. we now have increased financial flexibility to invest in growth, execute bolt-on m&a and return capital to shareholders. in december, we announced a 50% increase in the dividend and today we announced the share repurchase program. and we leaned in to becoming esg leaders committing to significant, achievable and important goals such as by 2030 reducing our customers' carbon footprint by more than 1 gigaton and achieving carbon neutrality in our operations, commitments that are not only good for the environment but also good for business.
we also made progress on our profile commitment to improving our diversity representation and creating a truly inclusive culture, and we've reframed our focus to position carrier as a growth company. while the covid pandemic in 2020 presented unprecedented challenges, it also served to reinforce our position as the world leader in healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions. with this as our enterprise strategy, supplemented by our three-pillared approach to driving sustained growth, we are confident in our top-line opportunities for 2021 and beyond.
slide 4 shows the flywheel that i used in our last earnings call to help explain how our key focus areas will drive shareholder value. as covid shined a light on the criticality of healthy, safe and sustainable buildings and cold chains, we acted on our ambition to become a world leader in both. there has been a tectonic shift in how business, government and society value the safety of indoor environments and the importance of robust systems for distributing food and medicine. there has also been a ground swell of recent focus on sustainability, all of which represent opportunities for carrier's business now and in the future.
on the building side, we introduced new products like our opticlean unit that time magazine recognized as a top innovation of 2020. more recently, as part of our healthy home strategy, we introduced an air purifier for the home. this is our first direct-to-consumer product focused on improving air quality and we also are now selling carrier 1-inch filters directly to consumers. overall, we have over $100 million of orders for healthy building products and services and have a pipeline of more than $200 million.
the next milestone is the release of a new digital solution that we're calling upon that will work with building management systems to provide visibility to indoor air quality and other key healthy building indicators. using machine learning, this solution will connect to building control systems and auto mitigate deficiencies. the overall goal is to work with our customers to give their patrons and tenants confidence to reenter indoor environments. as an example, we recently signed a sponsorship with the american hotel & lodging association, where carrier will help define the ahla safe stay guidelines for guests and staff around indoor air quality and contactless solutions, and then we'll play our part to help hotels implement those solutions.
on the refrigeration side, we continue to see traction on connected cold chain offerings that address the critical challenges inherent to food and pharmaceutical distribution. sales at our industry-leading cargo monitoring sensitech business were up about 10% in the fourth quarter and we enter 2021 with the backlog that is up over 170% over the same period last year. and we continue to push for adoption of our cloud-based lynx platform that we are co-developing with aws to extend our current digital offerings.
our growth levers are further fueled by delivering against our three strategic pillars. first, in terms of growing the core, we can say with confidence that we gained share in many of our core markets. we met our objective of adding over 500 sales and sales support people invested over $400 million in r&d, enabling us to introduce over 120 new products last year. we continue to have key new wins. our team never needed to be pushed to win, just given the freedom and the investments needed to get back to our market-leading roots. we also continue to push our product extensions such as vrf and geographic coverage with a focus on increasing sales in china. our third pillar, growing services in digital, has yielded very strong initial results as we push our business models to focus more on recurring revenues.
to kick start progress we focused last year on our conversion rates that is, converting new oem units coming off warranty to long-term agreements. we started the year at 20% conversion rates. we committed to end the year at 30% and we did. going forward, our focus will be on overall coverage that is of our overall installed base of chillers in the market, how many of those are under some sort of long-term agreement. today we have coverage of about 50,000 units, and our plan is to increase that by about 10,000 units per year. we have similar objectives in other parts of our business as well.
increased coverage is enabled by digital solutions. our truck/trailer segment launched esolutions 2.0 with a web-based dashboard that provides critical fleet information, enhanced visibility, and improved geo-fencing. and in f&s we launched our edwards est4 network fire alarm and emergency communications platform to tie multiple remote buildings together to provide more flexibility and cost-effective solutions to our customers.
we also continue to invest in and grow our alc building automation and controls business, where customers have embraced our open architecture solutions. 50% of our 2020 sales in that business came from recently introduced products, and we are complementing that with continued investments in our channel and field network.
from its culture and our growth mindset, we are taking a very disciplined approach to capital allocation. in the span of just nine months we reduced our net debt from about $10 billion to approximately $7 billion and ended the year with over $3 billion of cash. our balance sheet improvement now opens the door to bolt-on m&a. our acquisitions will align with our focus on healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions, and more broadly with the three pillars of growth that we have laid out.
before i turn it over to patrick, let me give you some color on how we're thinking about 2021 on slide 5. our outlook for the year reflects our objective of being a consistent mid-single digit organic growth company. we expect sales to grow 6% to 8% and that includes 2% tailwind from fx, and with strong conversion we expect adjusted eps to increase by about 14% at the midpoint. we'll continue to invest in growth while we project improving margins by about 70 basis points, and producing strong free cash flow of about $1.6 billion.
while we are starting this year with continued uncertainty around the global economic recovery as the pandemic continues to impact people and economies around the world, we are optimistic that the uncertainty will subside as we get into the second half of the year following more widespread vaccine distribution. the good news for our first half is that our backlog is solid given the strength in orders in 4q that has continued very well into january. as we get into the second half of the year, we expect some of the businesses that were acutely challenged by the pandemic to start to recover particularly in retail, hospitality and small to medium size businesses.
so with that, let me now turn it over to patrick. patrick?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, dave, and good morning, everyone. good to be with you on the call today and very excited to be part of the carrier team. i've spent the last two months gaining a deeper understanding of our strengths and the opportunities we have in front of us. i see tremendous opportunities to create value given our focus on innovation, accelerating profitable growth, driving internal efficiencies, free cash flow generation and capital deployment and portfolio management. i will sharpen this focus and drive execution. so we can continue to deliver long-term superior financial returns to shareowners. let me share some detail around the quarter.
please turn to slide 6. as dave discussed, q4 was broadly in line with our outlook. as you can see on the right side we exceeded the outlook we gave you in october for sales and adjusted operating profit. sales of $4.6 billion were up 2% versus the prior year and flat organically. currency was a 2 point tailwind for sales in the quarter about $100 million but with little profit contribution. the sales growth was driven by continued strength in our residential hvac business, which was up 25% in the quarter. we saw continued sequential improvement across our other businesses.
as expected, adjusted operating profit of $453 million was down versus the prior year as carrier 700 cost savings were more than offset by the reversal of some temporary cost actions related to covid-19. we expect $75 million of investments, about $25 million of incremental public company costs and about $50 million of one-time items in the quarter. these one-time items were about $20 million higher than we expected and included a pre-spin vendor contract termination and legal and related costs.
free cash flow of $38 million in the quarter included $272 million in tax payments related to the sale of the beijer shares. we anticipated $50 million to $60 million of that from the september sale but the remainder associated with the december transaction was not captured in our october outlook.
moving on to the full year. sales of $17.45 billion were above our most recent outlook of about $17.3 billion due to currency translation. full-year adjusted operating profit was $2.23 billion just over our october guidance. and excluding the tax payment for the sale of beijer shares, we would have exceeded our free cash flow target by about $100 million.
let's now look at how the segments performed starting on slide 7. hvac organic sales were up 4% in the quarter driven by the 25% increase in residential. as expected, field inventory levels have now normalized and we should see more typical growth trends in that business going forward but recognize there will be a much easier compare in the first half versus the second half of 2021. commercial hvac sales were down mid-single digits organically. light commercial was down 10% and continued to lag but the rate of decline improved sequentially.
turning to refrigeration. sales of $949 million were down 3% on an organic basis but improved sequentially. this was by far the best quarter from a year-over-year perspective for this segment. organic sales of the fire & security segment also continued to improve sequentially in q4 and were down 5% compared to last year. we saw a 6% decline in the products business and a 2% decrease in the field business. within the product businesses, which represents about 60% of this segment sales, residential and commercial fire continued to be solid while access solutions in our industrial businesses remained challenging.
now let me review the order activity we saw in the fourth quarter because that is important to understand what is driving our 2021 outlook. as you can see on slide 8, our residential and light commercial businesses continued to see strong orders driven by residential. we intentionally worked with our channel partners to exit 2020 with more normalized inventory levels. backlog in residential is up almost three-fold compared to a year ago and puts us in a solid position for shipments in the first half of 2021. commercial hvac orders were about flat compared to last year and we exited 2020 with backlog up mid-teens year-over-year.
for refrigeration, order activity for the truck/trailer business continued to improve sequentially. north american truck/trailer orders were up well over 100% in the quarter and europe was up about 10%. container orders up almost 50% pointing to a recovery in 2021. commercial refrigeration orders were up mid-teens organically as the business is also seeing pent-up demand. strong order intake and backlogs exiting the year positioned the refrigeration segment for the strongest growth of the three segments in 2021.
order intake for our fire & security segment also continued to improve sequentially. product orders were down low-single digits. like prior quarters, industrial end markets and global access solutions remain weak. field orders were up low double digits year-over-year and we exited 2020 with record backlog for installations in this business. overall, a generally improving order trend gives us confidence in our ability to deliver solid growth in 2021.
please turn to slide 9 as i walk you through our 2021 outlook. based on current exchange rates we expect reported sales to be up 6% to 8%. we expect organic growth of 4% to 6% and a currency translation tailwind of about 2%. we expect hvac and fire & security organic growth to be low to mid-single digits and expect refrigeration to be up low-teens. we expect adjusted operating margin to expand by about 70 basis points at the midpoint to around 13.5%.
we expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 25%, 1 point lower than last year. and adjusted eps is expected to be between $1.85 and $1.95. this represents about 14% eps growth at the midpoint. we expect about $1.6 billion in free cash flow, which represents about 95% conversion despite higher capital spending and about $100 million more in interest payments.
moving to slide 10. let's walk through the pieces in our 2021 adjusted eps bridge. adjusted eps growth will come almost entirely from operational performance as the increased volume converts to earnings. core earnings conversion, which excludes the impact of currency, the 2020 beijer sale and the 2020 q4 items is about 30%.
we anticipate additional benefits from carrier 700, of about $225 million in 2021 and expect the absence of covid-related inefficiencies and disruptions in our factories and supply chain to benefit us by about $125 million. offsetting that is about $200 million of cost containment snapback and about $150 million of planned incremental investments.
we previously talked about the three-year plan as a $100 million of investment in each year of 2020, 2021 and 2022. we are accelerating some investments into 2021 and therefore, currently expect incremental investments in 2022 to be only $50 million. we expect the net impact of pricing and input costs to be neutral for the year. interest expense will be a headwind in 2021. we raised most of the debt in late february 2020, so we did not have an entire year's worth of interest expense last year.
lastly, we currently have some restrictions in our debt covenants on the total number of shares we can repurchase and so while we target repurchasing about 5 million shares in 2021, the average number of shares used for eps in 2021 will still be above 2020 and so that represents about a $0.02 headwind '21 versus '20. page 16 of the slide deck includes some additional items related to our 2021 outlook.
let's shift focus to the balance sheet and our leverage profile on slide 11. carrier completed the spin in april with substantial leverage. since that time we've been able to reduce leverage significantly through strong free cash flow performance and the sale of our stake in beijer. we repaid the entire $1.75 billion term loan in the fourth quarter and net debt to adjusted ebitda improved from about 3.4 at the time of the spin, down to about 2.8 at the end of fiscal 2020.
we expect 2021 year end net debt just north of $6 billion, which would bring our net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio closer to 2.1 by the end of 2021, that is assuming no impact from potential acquisitions or divestitures. the bottom line is that we are in a much stronger position today given the improved health of our balance sheet, which provides more flexibility with respect to capital deployment.
that takes us to slide 12. during 2020 it was clear that the focus had to be on reducing leverage. as we enter 2021, we plan a more balanced capital deployment while remaining within our overall capital structure of an investment grade credit rating. we expect 2021 capex to be about $375 million. dave talked about some of our priorities with respect to inorganic investments. we're not putting a dollar amount placeholder here, but we will be opportunistic on bolt-on m&a that help achieve our strategic objectives and meet our financial criteria.
we plan to reduce debt by $500 million in 2021 and in light of our pending redemption we will not have any debt maturing until 2025. in december, we announced a dividend increase, and we now expect 2021 dividend payments to amount to about $425 million. and today, the board authorized a share repurchase program of $350 million and our outlook for '21 incorporates repurchasing about 5 million shares this year.
before i turn it back to dave let me just add that the volatile quarters in 2020 should lead to some unusual comparisons in 2021. we expect strong double-digit organic growth in the first half of 2021 and closer to flat organic performance in the second half, given the residential comparisons. in addition we expect the first quarter to have the lowest incremental margins for the year, probably in the high-teens due to having more buyer income in last year's q1 than other quarters, a larger currency conversion headwind and some prior year deferred comp favorable items.
with that, i'll turn it back to dave.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
okay. thank you, patrick. our results demonstrate that we successfully navigated through 2020. we remain focused on driving key strategic growth initiatives alongside aggressive cost actions that will fuel future investment and innovation.
our balance sheet improvement provides additional flexibility to create shareholder value through bolt-on m&a, dividends and share buyback. all of these factors combined with the tailwinds from important mega trends position us well for strong top and bottom-line growth in 2021 and beyond.
so with that, we'll open this up for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from stephen volkmann with jefferies. you may proceed with your question.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. thanks for taking the question. hoping you can just talk a little bit more about the commercial hvac business, obviously strong backlog headed into '21 but orders kind of flattish, maybe you can give us a little bit more color either by market or by type of product or anything to sort of give us a sense of the cadence on commercial hvac? thank you.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. good morning, steve. yes, we are pleased with the backlog being up in the mid-teens. but clearly there are some watch items there. the abi being at about 43 in december, it has been below since -- 50 since april, so we have a watch on it. remember that commercial new construction is about 15% of our overall business. the things that give us a lot of confidence are some verticals remained very strong globally, data centers, warehouses, education, healthcare have all been strong. number two is, we are seeing traction in our whole focus on indoor air quality, healthy buildings. we have a pipeline of $200 million there.
so it's clearly a watch item, particularly north america. i was pleased. china has continued to be strong. europe, we actually saw coming back. you may recall, earlier in 2020, i felt like we weren't gaining the share in europe that we had been in north america, china. the team made a number of changes in europe and we're seeing traction there. so signs of life in europe, orders were up about 5% there in the fourth quarter. asia pacific actually showing a bit of strength toward the end of last year for the first time in eight or nine months. so signs of progress, but clearly a couple of watch items probably the biggest being north american new construction.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and do you feel like people are able to get out into the field now and do more of the kind of service, maintenance, upgrade stuff that is probably sort of represents pent-up demand for '21 or is that still on the come?
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
no, we do. the good news for the aftermarket is that we actually come in. hvac services backlog ended the year up about 20%. so we are seeing people get out there, even in europe, where it's a bit spotty and some markets are more closed than others. even though they've been distributing the vaccine in england, we still see some pockets have closed down locations there, same with germany. but by and large, we are getting our field support and our technicians out into building certainly in the united states. so we're looking at double-digit hvac aftermarket growth in 2020, and it will be fueled by folks getting back into the buildings.
stephen volkmann -- jefferies -- analyst
super. thanks. i'll pass it on.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, steve.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from joe ritchie with goldman sachs. you may proceed with your question.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everybody.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, joe.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hey. can you guys maybe provide a little bit more color around the $50 million charge that you took this quarter and then whether all of that been through on hvac margins this quarter?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, joe, patrick here. so really one big item as part of those one-time items is a -- as i mentioned, vendor contract renegotiation. think of it as a pre-spin contract that we had from under the utc umbrella. we think we can do better than that specific contract, so we decided to terminate it. there were costs associated with that, that we incurred in the quarter. we will benefit from that in future years and the mpv obviously was positive on that transaction, that was by far the biggest item within the $50 million. and i would say that, clearly hvac had the biggest part of that one-time cost of about $50 million in the quarter. so clearly hvac's margins were impacted by that more than the other segments.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, that's helpful, patrick. and maybe my just -- my one follow-up, maybe just sticking with hvac margins. i think that, that was probably the area where we're hearing the most from investors today. can you guys just kind of parse out what really kind of happened within the quarter outside of this one contract because margins still would have been down outside of you seeing growth in the quarter and i recognize that you spent about $75 million in investment. but maybe just kind of parse out, what were the kind of the key drivers for the margins in hvac this quarter?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
sure. so within hvac, currency helped us, currency translation was a tailwind on sales of about $40 million. but basically with no operating profits did contribution. we did see a benefit of the higher volume, particularly in resi, which was up 25%, mix was actually a headwind in the quarter and actually that relates to commercial hvac.
the applied equipment piece of commercial hvac returned to growth. we saw that up low single digit, which is a good thing. we saw good growth in china. we have not yet seen service and aftermarkets return to growth. service and aftermarket was down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. they tend to have better margins. now, the good thing is backlog for service and aftermarket was up double-digits for us in the quarter. so that bodes well for future periods.
other items that impacted the hvac margins in the quarter, one, you referred to investments. investments were up $75 million in the quarter for the overall company, hvac saw the vast majority of that. and so, that together with the one-timers that i referred to earlier is really the story around hvac margins. for next year, we expect for the full-year hvac margins to be close to 16%.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, joe.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from nigel coe with wolfe research. you may proceed with your question.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks. good morning, and, patrick, good to hear your voice again.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, nigel.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
[technical issues] so i think we just kind of addressed the hvac margin issue quite well. when you say the vast majority of the investment spending, are we talking about like over $50 million of that $75 million would have been within that segment. just trying to size the impact of that investment spend.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. north of that $50 million would have impacted hvac, nigel.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
and then the nature of the investment spending, is it primarily headcount spending and i'm wondering if it's the case with that $150 million, if it's mainly just the annualization of whatever has been spent in the second half of this year?
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. nigel. good morning, nigel, it's dave. yes, recall that we really look at our investments in three categories. we said that we'd add -- the first is selling and sales people. we said we'd add 500 sales and sales support people last year. we ended up adding more like 550, and a lot of that we started to see in the fourth quarter.
we also invested in r&d, that was a big chunk of it. we had tapped the brakes a little bit on some of our investments in 2q. we started to release it in 3q, into 4q. so we did accelerate r&d investments and also the third piece is digital, a little bit less than the r&d side but we're going to come out with some new digital products here at the beginning of the second quarter especially tied into healthy buildings. so we really try to lean forward because that's what we see is one of the most transformational opportunities.
it has to be -- it has to do with the digital offering that's going to be an extraction layer that has -- that gives customers visibility into things like indoor air quality. so we really accelerated some of our investments there in the fourth quarter.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
and then, nigel, the -- of the $150 million about half of it would be carry over from investments made late in 2020.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
thank you. my question is on service attached initiative. you point toward the significant increase in the installed base of chillers being serviced, what is driving that uptick? what are you doing differently today that you weren't doing this time last year? and then secondly, as part of that would you be pointing toward double-digit service growth going forward?
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
well, certainly we feel positive about double-digit service growth in '21 and we'll have to see as we get into '22 and beyond. but you look at that, we have a relatively small percentage of our say, chillers under some form of long-term agreement, it's less than 25%. and the reality is, it should be something that's exponentially higher.
one of the ways to do it is having those chillers be connected. so we are going out of our way to add edge devices to the chillers, so we can have more of a two-way communication with the customers, so we can not only do things like diagnostics and prognostics but other value-added services such as energy efficiency through making the devices connected.
so connecting the devices is one, adding the salespeople is another key one. one of the reasons we were successful in our conversion rates last year was simply putting people in the building, working with the building operator to say while the -- while it's under warranty or while it is under an agreement with someone else, there is value-added services that we can provide. so increasing our sales forces in a very targeted way. so for example, in china at some of the tier 2 cities, in the north america at some of the under-served regions that we have today, so really it's a lot of blocking and tackling. i am very confident in the double-digit aftermarket growth this year.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thanks, again.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeff sprague with vertical research. you may proceed with your question.
jeffrey sprague -- vertical research partners -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, jeff.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, jeff.
jeffrey sprague -- vertical research partners -- analyst
good morning. i was wondering if you could address a little bit more, what you're expecting on the price cost side, was it an issue in the quarter? you did go through a lot of the margin dynamics in q4, but i don't think you mentioned price cost, but more importantly, as you look forward into 2021, what do you see and what do you have modeled?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, jeff, for 2020, price realization was really about flat. obviously for '21 we're very closely monitoring commodity prices especially steel, copper, aluminum. we expect price to offset commodity inflation in 2021. we announced our price increase during the normal cycle, which is early in our first quarter, and then from a blocking or locking point of view currently over 75% of our 2021 requirements are locked or blocked. if prices stay high of course, this could be a watch item for 2022 but we'll be continuing to look at this closely and looking of course, at continued recovery through pricing as well. so overall neutral for fiscal '21.
jeffrey sprague -- vertical research partners -- analyst
and i'm also just wondering kind of new co-independent carrier, you provided in the appendix kind of the outlook on corporate expense and the like. are we largely at run rate though coming out of q4 on public company costs, anything that's left over on tsas that sort of thing, maybe you could just address what if any kind of nuances or headwinds we should be thinking about as you kind of get into your full -- first full independent year here?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, jeff, i think this will be de minimis in fiscal 2021. there might be a little bit in the first quarter but really not a big number for the full year.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
and i would add, jeff, that look we've been clear that our g&a is just too high. so it's -- we have a very structured focus around taking g&a out. it's not something that you can kind of do the right way overnight. what we're trying to do rather than just give kind of headcount targets or things like that, we're trying to make structural changes.
we have a leader that reports to me. eva azoulay is leading a whole low cost center of excellence approach. we're outsourcing some aspects, we're moving some of the work to low cost coes. and we're really trying to reduce our g&a in a structured way. '21 is a lot of putting that in place. so we'll start to see a lot of the benefit of it as we get into '22 and beyond. so our g&a should come down for sure and $100 million of the carrier 700 is g&a, so we expect to start seeing that drop through certainly as we get into '22.

thank you. our next question comes from steve tusa with j.p. morgan. you may proceed with your question.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
hey, good morning.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
good morning.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning, steve.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
can you just clarify what the raw material impact is, just so we have an idea of what those two components are? just following up on jeff's question.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
for the full year we see...
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
yes.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, we see a headwind of several tens of millions of dollars.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay, got it. and then what is carrier's 700 ultimately come in at for the year on the benefits side?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
carrier 700 came in at $250 million in fiscal ' 20. we expect that in '21 to be about $225 million.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
okay, got it. and then just one more on resi. you said your backlog was up like 3x, is there any buy in there ahead of those price increases that's influencing that number, i mean that just seems like a pretty big number for december -- the year-end december 31st.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. certainly, we were pleased with backlog coming in 3x higher than it was at the same time last year, steve. what we've really worked very purposely on with our distributors is to make sure that we were trying to match our flow to them with their movements at the dealer base. so as patrick said, we had sales in the fourth quarter up 25%, movement from the distributors into the dealers was about 20%. inventory was up around 10% coming out of last year into this year, so fairly normalized.
we saw order strength continue to be very, very strong in january. now, part of it is that -- you know that we have a good position with new home construction, that was up about 8% last year. we expect it to continue to be strong this year but we're working very closely with our channel partners to make sure that we're giving them what they need, when they need it, and there's just a lot of demand in the system but we're trying to modulate that to make sure we're there to support them, so they can support the dealer network.
steve tusa -- j.p. morgan -- analyst
got it. okay, thanks for the info.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

thank you. our next question comes from jeff hammond with keybanc capital markets. you may proceed with your question.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
morning, jeff.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
so slide 10, great color on the different moving pieces in cost. just wondering how you think of cadence for investments and you gave good color on incrementals on 1q, just how some of those moving pieces impact kind of cadence and incrementals as you kind of move through the year?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, jeff, i think from an investment point of view you can expect that to be fairly even throughout the year in 2021. from a incremental point of view, as i mentioned, q1 a little weaker than the other quarters.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
okay, and then just on kind of the first half, second half, i understand -- i mean i guess, things have been -- were improving through 2020 but outside of residential being so strong in the second half, where else do you see quote tough comps to kind of get you to that flat dynamic in the second half?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i think, it's really driven by residential in the second half. so obviously, we had a very strong resi second half in 2020, with very high growth rates. as we lap these, some of those headwinds get offset by what we expect to be a pickup in light commercial, commercial hvac in our fire & security business. and so that's really the -- what we're counting on in the second half of the year that is a recovery related to covid that helps offset some of those headwinds in resi.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
yes, jeff, i'd add that i think we really view this as a tale of two halves. you look at the first half, we're coming in with very strong backlogs. orders, patrick mentioned, were up 15% in the fourth quarter. some were quite high like in our transport refrigeration business, very strong there. so we like our opening backlog position. orders continue to be very strong in january almost across the portfolio, so we expect that the backlog in orders to carry us through the first half. clearly you have the comparison but as you get in the second half, there is pent-up demand in some of the key verticals that have been acutely challenged.
so our light commercial business we start -- we would expect to see recovery as we get into the second half of this year. you start looking at some parts of our fire & security business that were hurt by small and medium-sized businesses and the impact of retail and some of the big-box retail impacts that we've seen. so we expect that first half carry through with backlog, second half as economy start to reopen in there is a pent-up demand we expect that to give us some lift in the second half. tough compares but progress in some acutely impacted verticals.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
okay, if i could sneak one more in. just sell-in versus sell-through your sense for residential as you look at your independents or just kind of what your distributors are telling you what sell-through was in 4q?
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
well we looked at -- we were looking at 20% movement in 4q from our distributors into the dealers. so we were trying very hard to really match our sell-in and sell-out. it was a little bit higher on what we sold to them and what they moved out but not materially. so there is significant demand in the channel. i would say that one thing that is positive is that we have gained share.
it's always complicated when you look at share on a quarter-to-quarter basis with all the different moving parts on selling either direct to dealers or selling through independent distribution. but if you just step back and look at 2020 as a whole, our resi sales were up 10% and you're looking at probably a market that was up 7% to 8%. so we feel positive that we're gaining share the right way. our partnership with our distribution partners has been very positive. new construction is -- new home construction has been positive. so we feel positive about where we are and where we're going on resi and we're trying to be very careful to not get out over our skis ourselves or our distribution partners.
jeffrey d. hammond -- keybanc capital markets inc. -- analyst
great. thanks a lot.

thank you. our next question comes from deane dray with rbc capital markets. you may proceed with your question.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you. good morning, everyone. and, dave, congrats on being named chairman.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, deane. appreciate that.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
first question for patrick. you don't often hear about covenants that restrict buybacks. i know it does happen but the expectation if you're going to be at 2.1 net leverage by year-end you would think those covenants would not be in play and maybe they can get rolled back, i know you negotiated covenants last year might just be an opportunity as well.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. under our current covenants we have those restrictions and those remain there till the end of the year. we could decide to renegotiate them. the other factor that's at play here is that our current capital structure. we're kind of growing into our existing credit ratings. and so, by the end of the year, our capital structure will be much more aligned with our existing credit rating. and so, this would not be the time to buy back significantly more shares as we're trying -- as we are still working our way into our existing credit rating. and so, that's the other element that's at play here, deane. we could renegotiate it but there is still the credit rating that's in play as well and it's clearly our intention to remain a solid credit rating company.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
appreciate that. and just if you could expand on the opportunities in bolt-on m&a, it's interesting the covenants don't restrict that, it would appear, just what's the final look like especially like across the product lines?
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
deane, we're in the process of building up that pipeline. we've had some that we've been working, we're adding more to the pipeline. so it's something that as we continue to look at the portfolio, there are still some things that we would say that we're assessing whether or not they would be of more value in the hands of others. and then, we look at our overall strategic priorities, healthy, safe and sustainable buildings is a big ecosystem, the cold chain is another ecosystem, our three pillars of growth.
we want to grow the core, we want to look at adjacencies, we're underrepresented in china, we're underrepresented in vrf, so those are areas. and anything that builds out our services and aftermarket offerings as we continue to shift to recurring revenues. so we have some things in the pipeline that we've been working. we're trying to add to that pipeline as we go.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
that's helpful. thank you.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer

thank you. our next question comes from vlad bystricky with citigroup. you may proceed with your question.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
vlad, are you there?
operator
your line is on mute. please unmute.
vlad bystricky -- citigroup, inc. -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys. sorry about that.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
no problem.
vlad bystricky -- citigroup, inc. -- analyst
so lots of great color on the quarter as always. one thing that was a little surprising is, looking at the order trends it looks like apac outside of china was actually stronger than china in terms of orders. can you talk about what drove that strength in apac outside of china and how you're thinking about the sustainability of the strong order growth in the apac region?
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i would say that the whole southeast asia is -- it's still fragile. i mean, it actually caught us a bit by surprise because it had been quite negative in the second and third quarter. even places like india we started to see traction, other places singapore, australia. hong kong is still a mixed bag because of a multitude of reasons there but we were pleasantly surprised by some of the traction we started to see in parts of asia outside of china.
and look china has just remained just continuously strong really across the portfolio. on the cold chain side, both in commercial refrigeration and transport refrigeration. overall look at carrier, our china -- in the fourth quarter china sales were up 10%, orders were up about 5% in china particularly strong in refrigeration, where it was up about 20%. so we remain very, very bullish on china overall and it was nice to see progress in southeast asia. but it's still a watch item. we got to see more vaccine distribution in places like india and then we'll get more confidence on the sustainability.
vlad bystricky -- citigroup, inc. -- analyst
okay, great. that's helpful. and then just thinking about the '21 free cash flow outlook, can you just maybe help to level set us in terms of how you're thinking about the seasonality of free cash flow in 2021?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, vlad, we would expect and which is typical for our business at the first quarter would be our weakest quarter of free cash flow. and at the second half would generally be stronger than the first half. so generally q1 would expect to be our lowest quarter of free cash flow followed by stronger quarters and a significantly stronger second half than the first half. and that's of course related to some of the seasonality in our business, especially in...
vlad bystricky -- citigroup, inc. -- analyst
right.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
in hvac.
vlad bystricky -- citigroup, inc. -- analyst
right. so more typical seasonality we'll see.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
correct.
vlad bystricky -- citigroup, inc. -- analyst
that's helpful. thanks. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from julian mitchell with barclays. you may proceed with your question.
julian mitchell -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
thanks, good morning. maybe just trying to hone in a little bit on the q1 context and understand that in general this year's seasonality may be a little bit different at least on earnings if not cash flow than the normal, so any extra color on that? but if i start with q1, you've mentioned the high-teens incremental that compares with i guess the full-year guide of more like 25%. for revenues in q1, should we be thinking that sort of up high-single digit and so you end up with about 50 bps of margin expansion against 70 bps for the year as a whole, is that roughly the right framework?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, we do expect double-digit organic growth in the first quarter and we do expect margin expansion as well in the first quarter. and as i mentioned earlier, we think that the timing of the investments is pretty even throughout the year.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
and also, julian, again because of the strong q4 orders that continued into january, our coverage for q1 is solid. so we feel positive about that.
julian mitchell -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
thank you very much. and then, just thinking about the free cash flow guide for the year as a whole, understood the context on seasonality that you just provided, patrick, but for the year as a whole if i back out the beijer tax payments it looks like you're guiding for around flattish operating cash flow year-on-year in '21.
just wondering about any moving parts within that, you'd have that $100 million interest expense i think called out, maybe help us understand what you're dialing in for the working capital scale of headwind?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. actually, so for the full year, free cash flow we expect it to be about flat year-over-year. you -- obviously, adjusted net income is expected to be up year-over-year, that's a tailwind there. there are two items that are large offsets, you mentioned one of them.
interest payable is -- we will be making extra $100 million of interest payments and then capex we expect also to be up about $65 million. and so, that offsets most of the adjusted net income. we do expect working capital overall to be a slight tailwind. on the headwinds associated with free cash flow we expect comp and benefits to be a little bit of a headwind there in fiscal '21 but those are the biggest pieces. it's really higher adjusted income offset by $100 million extra interest payment and $65 million additional capex and then some minor items...
julian mitchell -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
great. thank you.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
...that would make it about flat year-over-year. thanks, julian
julian mitchell -- barclays investment bank -- analyst
perfect. thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from gautam khanna with cowen and company. you may proceed with your question.
daniel flick -- cowen & company -- analyst
yes. hi, guys, this is dan on for gautam. thanks for the question. could you discuss how you see permanent restaurant and brick and mortar closures impacting the near term versus longer term fire & security demand if that has any impact on your long-term view of that business? thank you.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i look at it, the -- it impacted kidde as we start to see some of the brick and mortar. we saw very strong e-commerce sales in our residential smoke detector business but we did see an impact on more of the brick and mortar piece of that business. so we are expecting, with the vaccine distribution, some recovery there as we get into the latter part of 2021.
another piece of the business is some of the security portfolio that -- some of that piece of that business is tied a little bit more toward smb and small and medium-sized businesses. so if you take our s2 business, for example we start -- we would expect to see that to start open up with pent-up demand with the smb side of the business as we get into the second half of the year.
daniel flick -- cowen & company -- analyst
okay, so you would expect the pent-up demand aspect to be stronger than say, like, i don't know, what do they say like one-third of restaurants may have closed permanently now?
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean, i think -- look, the restaurant closures i mean, it's something that we watched not only for our fire & security business but our light commercial business. we look at that business that was down 10% in the fourth quarter and we have that business up mid-single digits this year. so we do -- clearly there has been a big impact on that whole industry. but we do expect to see some pent-up demand as people start to reenter society in the second half of the year.
daniel flick -- cowen & company -- analyst
okay, that's really helpful. thanks.

thank you. our next question comes from josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley. you may proceed with your question.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys.
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, josh.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
hey.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
dave, first question on service versus equipment in commercial. i think maybe relative to some of your peers out there, this looks a little bit more sanguine on service and saw equipment kind of lagging behind, you seemed to have a bit of the opposite experience but i know you're still sort of working your way up the curve on service market share.
is there something about either the timing of being able to actually schedule that or the nature of the service you guys are winning that would suggest that there is sort of a lag? just curious that building access phenomenon i suspect is kind of similar for everybody and that seems to be impacting you more, but you're doing better on equipment. a lot of moving pieces there, but i guess it kind of comes down to how do you feel about either timing or kind of the nature of service maybe versus the broader market?
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
yes. on the equipment side look, we've added the sales people, we've introduced some new products. it's not really putting a new machine, a new construct in place. it was really accelerating doing what we know how to do with more focus and energy. so the ability to turn that in an effective way has been positive and a bit easier than it has been on the aftermarket for us because it hasn't traditionally been as big of a focus area for us as it has been perhaps for a couple of our peers that have done well in this area.
so i would say, on the aftermarket, we added a new head of aftermarket, ajay agrawal. he has been working tightly with the new heads of aftermarket that we put in place and the bus and the bu president. and now, we put in place a playbook that we know works but it's not a playbook that you can affect overnight. so adding the sales and sales support people, adding a bluedge tiered offering, adding digital offerings that can really differentiate the overall offerings. so a lot of this playbook of how we think about pricing parts and how we can provide more value-added services to our customers, that playbook is in the process of being rolled out.
but when we talk about a 20% increase in our chiller coverage this year, that's a pretty big percentage and a lot of 2020 was putting that foundation in place. 2021 for us is the show-me year and now we got again go realize a lot of that foundation that we put in place last year.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, and then on the portfolio side, clearly asset prices are high out there. i know parts of fire & security namely chubb got a peek under the hood a couple of years ago now, what's the appetite to maybe explore some dispositions just given your multiples are fairly high in the marketplace?
david gitlin -- president and chief executive officer
look, we've -- we said consistently that we would be very objective as we look at our current portfolio and that's continued. we started that process day one and that's going to continue really forever. so we look at all aspects of the portfolio whether they're worth more to someone else than they are to us and whether they fit in our long-term strategy and that applies. i mean, you mentioned chubb, it applies really across the board. so we will continue to assess. we will continue to do what's right for our shareholders.
if we make that determination we will look at what to sell and what's the right time to sell. and then, the exciting thing for me is that we now have the balance sheet flexibility to start looking more aggressively at bolt-on m&a. so we're hopeful to see some of that in '21 as well.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
all right. thanks, guys.

operator
good morning, and welcome to carrier's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. this call is being carried live on the internet and there is a presentation available to download from the carrier's website at ir.carrier.com.
i would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, sam pearlstein, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
sam pearlstein -- vice president, investor relations
thank you, and good morning, and welcome to carrier's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. with me here today are david gitlin, chairman and ceo; and patrick goris, chief financial officer. except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a nonrecurring and/or nonoperational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items.
the company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties. carrier's sec filings, including forms 10-k, 10-q and 8-k provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. this morning, we'll review our financial results for the first quarter and discuss the full year 2021 outlook, and we'll leave time for questions at the end. [operator instructions]
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our chairman and ceo, dave gitlin.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, sam, and good morning everyone. starting on slide two with an overview of the quarter. q1 was a great quarter for us and an early indication that a global economic recovery is under way. areas of our portfolio that have been performing well have continued to improve, and those businesses and verticals that were acutely impacted by the pandemic are showing early indications of recovery. overall, volume came in stronger than we planned. reported sales were up over 20%, including organic growth of 17% driven by another very strong quarter in north american residential, which was up 50%. we also saw strong growth in commercial hvac and transport refrigeration.
all of our segments contributed to the organic growth in q1 as the organization continued to execute well on our growth initiatives, including the aftermarket, which grew close to double digits. notably, compared to the first quarter of 2019, we grew sales about 6% organically. this was coupled with strong order trends leading to a healthy backlog at the end of the quarter. orders were up over 30% compared to last year, driving the organic backlog up 13% sequentially and up close to 20% year-over-year.
we produced $608 million of adjusted operating profit, up approximately 40% year-over-year. given supply chain constraints, we are incurring some additional inflationary pressures and higher logistics costs and meeting customer demand. we are working to mitigate these headwinds through additional cost and pricing actions. finally, i am encouraged by our free cash flow generation in the first quarter. though we do not expect to regularly adjust guidance for the full year after just one quarter, we are increasing guidance on sales, earnings and free cash flow given our stronger-than-expected q1 results and confidence in the macro trends that we're seeing.
we now expect reported sales to grow 7% to 10%, including a 2% tailwind from fx. we expect adjusted eps to increase by about 20% at the midpoint, and we are increasing our projected free cash flow for the year by about $100 million to about $1.7 billion. slide three shows the flywheel that i've used in prior earnings calls to explain how our key focus areas will drive shareholder value. in the upper left, we continue to ensure that we drive a performance culture. we are now one year into our journey as a stand-alone public company, and we are building momentum.
we started off by putting a playbook in place and a year later, i can say that we are a fundamentally different company from our culture, to our strategy, to our targeted investment prioritization, balance sheet and capital position. carrier 700 is the cornerstone of our unrelenting focus on cost reduction, and we achieved about $60 million in q1 in a tough environment. increased input costs and -- are putting pressure on our $225 million target for the year, so we are driving additional cost and price actions to offset the unplanned headwind.
also, core to our new culture is a focus on profitable growth. we are gaining traction on all three pillars of our growth strategy. we are gaining share across the portfolio helped by innovation arising from our increasing r&d spend from $400 million in 2019 to about $475 million this year and an additional 600 sales and sales support people that we've added over the past nine months. regarding aftermarket and digital offerings, we are gaining significant traction as we push our business models to focus more on recurring revenues.
we are on track to deliver double-digit aftermarket growth this year, and we continue to expect a number of chillers under contract to increase from 50,000 to 60,000 this year. increased service coverage and traction on our blueedge offerings are enabled by our digital solutions that we are implementing across all of our segments. lastly, we continue to take a very disciplined approach to capital allocation, which patrick will cover. we also said that we would continue to invest in solutions for healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions and inorganic growth, both of which i'll discuss on slide four.
in q1, we had over $80 million of orders for healthy building products and services, and we currently have a global pipeline of sales opportunities of more than $500 million. we created a new healthy building solutions organization under ajay agrawal leadership with a seasoned team dedicated to this effort. we also introduced differentiated sought-after offerings and we're energized by this week's release of our new digital offering called abound. it is all about giving customers confidence to reenter crowded indoor environments and providing a healthier indoor experience.
abound gathers performance data from disparate systems, sensors and sources and presents it in a smart, simple interface. it gives a clear view of building systems and sensor performance data and identifies and helps to address anomalies. this solution is not a simple rebranding of digital offerings that we had in our portfolio. it is an open architecture saas, cloud-based platform and acts as an intelligence layer interfacing with not only our automated logic controls platform, but also with third-party building management systems and sensors throughout the building.
we have had pilots under way with key vertical customers in the office building space, the educational sector and the sports and entertainment vertical. those have gone tremendously well. a huge vote of confidence is that we signed a deal to support the atlanta braves as they start to welcome fans back to truist park. abound will monitor the indoor space covering a range of food and beverage locations and club spaces for guests.
as a saas platform, abound is expected to drive more recurring revenues, including subscription and services and also to help pull through additional carrier equipment sales. we are seeing equally strong progress on our other key ecosystem of focus, healthy, safe and sustainable cold-chain solutions. sensitech, our cargo monitoring business, had a record q1 with sales up 16% due in large part to demand related to the distribution of covid vaccines. similar to abound, a key differentiator is our cloud-based digital offering that we are building in partnership with aws called lynx.
as a key launch customer, seacube recently selected the lynx fleet solution to deliver enhanced digital capabilities for 2,000 refrigerated containers. and finally, on the right side of the chart, we highlight our inorganic growth progress. we were very pleased to announce our agreement to acquire giwee, which we refer to by its brand name of chigo. this acquisition will help accelerate our growth in the attractive variable refrigerant flow and international light commercial markets, which have consistently had outsized growth rates over traditional markets.
with the acquisition of chigo, we will own important brf technology, design capabilities and low-cost manufacturing that we can scale globally. we expect to close the transaction with a majority shareholder in 2q and we are excited to welcome the chigo team to the carrier family. we also continue to add and promote superb talent as we lean into the deployment of the carrier way. as an example, we recently welcomed jennifer anderson to carrier, leading corporate development, strategy and serving as our chief sustainability officer.
she will help drive another key strategic focus, esg. esg remains a very important focal point for carrier as we work toward delivering on our 2030 commitments. we are tracking to our commitment of reducing our customers' carbon emissions by more than one gigaton, as we introduce more energy-efficient and electric solutions. last week, carrier improved to a top quartile score with sustainalytics, and we are now number five within the building products category out of 129 companies. and we also continue to make good progress on our d&i initiatives. our number of diverse executives has increased significantly since 2015, and we are leaning in to making sustainable changes to ensure that we have a truly inclusive culture.
with that, let me turn it over to patrick.
patrick goris -- finance
thank you, dave, and good morning, everyone. please turn to slide five. as dave discussed, q1 was a great start to the year. sales of $4.7 billion were up 21% versus the prior year. currency was a four-point tailwind for sales in the quarter, about $150 million. on the top line, we saw a return to year-over-year organic growth in almost all of our businesses in q1, and all three segments exceeded their organic growth expectations for the quarter. organic sales growth of 17% was significantly better than we expected, and march was particularly strong across our businesses. adjusted operating profit was up 39% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded 170 basis points.
strong sales growth and benefits from the carrier 700 were partially offset by investments. results also included some higher freight costs and a product trouble issue at a minority jv. price/cost in the quarter was about neutral. earnings conversion was better than the high-teens i shared with you in february driven by the stronger-than-expected sales performance. we delivered 21% conversion despite the onetime items we previously discussed. the loss of buyer-related income, the impact of deferred and equity compensation and lower conversion on currency. excluding these items, conversion was about 30% in the quarter. free cash flow of $131 million in the quarter mainly reflected better-than-expected net income and improved working capital performance.
during the quarter, we repurchased about 976,000 shares at an average cost of $38.40 per share. let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on slide six. hvac organic sales were up 25% in the quarter, driven by the 48% residential growth. distributor movement was very strong at about 20%, and we believe there was some earlier-than-expected seasonal inventory build in the channel. commercial hvac sales were up in the mid-teens organically. strong growth in applied & service more than offset continued lower volume in north america light commercial, which was down mid-single digits.
light commercial order rates were up over 10% in the quarter, and field inventory levels are down over 30% compared to last year, positioning this business for a strong q2. the hvac team expanded margins by 240 basis points, driven by growth in residential and in services. the segment remains on track to generate about 16% margins this year. over to refrigeration on slide seven. sales were up 19% organically, as the cyclical recovery in transport that we've seen in orders has started to materialize in sales. transport refrigeration was up 22% in the quarter, driven by over 40% growth in container and truck/trailer recovery, particularly in europe and asia.
north america truck/trailer grew high single digits with each month improving. commercial refrigeration grew low double digits as pent-up demand and reopenings in europe drove strong growth. margins were up 50 basis points in the quarter compared to last year. we continue to meet customer demand, but are incurring some higher costs to do so, including airfreight. we expect operating margins to improve as growth in the higher-margin north america truck/trailer business accelerates.
flipping to slide eight. organic sales at the fire & security segment grew 3% and both the products and field businesses grew at similar rates. within the products business, which represents about 60% of this segment sales, residential and commercial fire continued to be solid, while access solutions in our industrial businesses remain challenging. of note, the product business saw a significant pickup in the month of march, leading to a strong end of the quarter. our field business, chubb, generated organic sales growth of about 4%.
the growth was largely driven by europe and other, and order rates were strong, especially in asia. as you can see on the slide, chubb booked its largest installation order ever. strong carrier 700 performance helped drive a 220 basis point margin improvement in this segment. now let me review the order activity we saw in the first quarter on slide nine. as you can see, our residential and light commercial businesses continued to see strong demand. backlog in residential is up sequentially and is still up almost threefold compared to a year ago and puts us in a solid position for shipments entering q2 and the cooling season.
commercial hvac orders were up high-teens compared to last year and backlog increased over 10% compared to the last -- compared to last quarter in that business. for refrigeration, order activity for the truck/trailer business continued to improve sequentially. north america truck/trailer orders were up well over 100% in the quarter, and europe was up over 50%. strong order intake and backlogs exiting q1 should position the refrigeration segment to achieve closer to high-teens organic sales growth for the year. order intake for our fire & security segment also continued to improve sequentially.
product orders were up 5% year-over-year with a strong end to the quarter, especially in residential and commercial fire. like prior quarters, industrial end markets and the hospitality vertical remain weak, but comparisons get better in q2. field orders were up about 15% organically as activity begins to pick up in europe and against an easier asia comp. installation orders were solid, and we continue to have a record backlog. let's walk through the eps bridge on slide 10.
as i mentioned, q1 eps of $0.48 was $0.13 higher than prior year, and the growth comes largely from operational performance, as you can see on the bridge. strong sales growth is the main driver here as well as carrier 700 savings of about $60 million. operational performance was also impacted by some of the headwinds i referred to earlier, including higher freight costs and the product trouble at a minority jv. while inflationary pressures continue, we're working to offset this through additional cost and pricing actions.
we recently announced a second price increase in our residential hvac business for june as well as an increase in transport refrigeration, and we're implementing similar actions in other areas of our portfolio. the loss of buyer-related income and the year-over-year impact of deferred and equity comp was about a $0.03 headwind in the quarter. all the other items on the bridge are pretty much in line with what we expected, except for the favorable tax item, which will carry through the year. let's move to slide 11, updated outlook. based on stronger-than-expected q1 performance and an improving outlook, we are increasing our organic sales outlook from a range of 4% to 6% to a new range of 5% to 8%.
a bit less than 0.5 point of the incremental organic growth represents incremental pricing actions we already have or are taking to offset higher input costs. we continue to expect price/cost to be about neutral for the year. we expect our adjusted operating margin now could be a bit over 13.5%. the q1 favorable discrete tax item means that our full year tax rate should now be around 24% rather than 25%. this all leads to an adjusted eps outlook range of $1.95 to $2.05, a $0.10 improvement at the midpoint from our initial guidance.
our updated outlook does not include the chigo transaction. finally, as dave mentioned, we now expect free cash flow of about $1.7 billion. slide 12 shows the bridge for the $0.10 improvement in our adjusted eps outlook from the midpoint of our prior guidance to the midpoint of our current guidance range. the biggest driver is the operational conversion on the additional sales volume. lower interest expense and the tax item are each adding about $0.02. over to slide 13, where i'll reiterate our capital allocation priorities for 2021. there are no changes to our priorities since the q4 call, but you have started to see us execute on some of these items. during q1, we paid down $500 million of long-term debt and with the transactions that have closed or have been announced to date, capital deployment on m&a will exceed $200 million this year.
last week, we declared a quarterly dividend. and on share repurchases, we are making progress toward our target for five million shares this year. before i turn it back to dave, let me just reiterate that the volatile quarters in 2020 should continue to impact the comparisons in 2021. we still expect strong double-digit organic growth in the first half of 2021 and closer to flat in the second half given the residential comparisons. we expect about half of the full year earnings to be in the first half. so a good start to the year puts us in a position to raise our full year outlook across the board.
with that, i'll turn it back to dave.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, patrick. we are pleased with a very strong start to the year. though much work remains to be done, we are confident in our raised guidance for the balance of the year. with that, we'll open this up for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question will come from the line of julian mitchell from barclays. you may begin.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
hi. good morning.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
maybe -- good morning. i just wanted to circle back on the margin guidance. so you did a low 20s incremental margin all in, in q1. it looks like the guide for the year maybe embeds similar to that figure. so i just wanted to understand sort of as you look out over the balance of the year versus q1, it sounds like price/cost isn't very different from the first quarter, but refrigeration margins should improve. so maybe help us understand some of the other moving parts around maybe the phasing of cost savings and investment spend over the remaining nine months.
patrick goris -- finance
yes, julian, patrick here. maybe i'll answer it as follows. reported conversion in the first quarter is about 21%. for the full year, we expect reported conversion to be closer to 25%. adjust that for buyer and currency and the onetime items from last year, we get to 30% for the full year. we expect reported conversion to improve from here on out. and so in future quarters, we expect that conversion to improve from the 21% up. and for the full year, as i mentioned, closer to 25% earnings conversion reported operationally closer to 30%. in terms of the investments, we did about $40 million in the first quarter. i think it will be pretty much evenly split throughout the year.
and so i don't expect big swings from an investment point of view throughout the quarter. i think you also asked about the input costs compared to our prior guidance. in our prior guidance with several tens of millions of dollars of incremental headwinds from inflation in the current guide that went up by another $70 million or so, so $70 million. and our current guide assumes that we're offsetting that with about $70 million of incremental pricing. and so from a timing point of view, for the full year, price/cost will remain neutral. in the second quarter, that may be the one quarter where price/cost is a little bit unfavorable.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
and then maybe secondly, just focusing on that refrigeration segment. the incrementals, as you said, were weighed down a little bit, perhaps in the first quarter, some mix and supply chain issues. maybe help us understand how quickly those improve over the balance of the year in terms of getting that refrigeration incremental up.
patrick goris -- finance
yes, julian. so within refrigeration, which had a good sales growth quarter, the growth was, as we said, particularly container, international truck/trailer, commercial refrigeration, those carry lower margins than our highest-margin north america truck/trailer business. we expect north america truck/trailer would actually perform -- was up high single digits in q1. we expect that growth to accelerate from here on out. and so for refrigeration, we expect the earnings conversion to improve from here on out. we expect the margins to improve starting in q2. and for the full year for that segment, we expect segment margin to be about 14%.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
great. thank you.
patrick goris -- finance

our next question will come from the line of andrew obin from bank of america. you may begin.
andrew obin -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, good morning.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
patrick goris -- finance
good morning, andy.
andrew obin -- bank of america -- analyst
just a question on the sales guidance and the organic increase. how should we think about the impact of recent price increases? because the scope of price increases that we saw i think march was, i think, 5%, 7% across the industry in resi and applied. and it seems that most of them will become effective in may and june. so how do you incorporate that in your outlook?
patrick goris -- finance
yes, andy. so we have announced price increases in -- throughout our businesses. the timing at which and the exact yield of that, of course, is always a little bit different than the actual announced price increase. the way you can think about this is of the 1.5 point increase in organic growth for the full year at the midpoint, so going from 5% organic growth to 6.5% organic growth at the midpoint. a little less than half of that relates to incremental pricing.
that gives you, give or take, $70 million, 7-0 million, of incremental pricing that we've assumed in our current guidance, which offset the $70 million incremental headwind on input costs that i referred to earlier. the balance of the increase in organic growth for the full year is really in hvac, both resi and commercial. some of that, of course, includes that price and in transport refrigeration. those are the areas where we've really pushed up our outlook for the year in terms of organic growth.
andrew obin -- bank of america -- analyst
that was a great answer. and the second question i have for you was the recent stimulus bill, i think you guys have highlighted, trane has highlighted, we've heard it from other folks. a lot of money is going to schools, i think, something to the tune of $67 billion a year for the next three years. i think last stimulus, 70% of this might ended up being spending on capital projects, right? there's this designation that it should go for air quality improvement, ac system improvement. when we talk to the folks in the industry, people have a really hard time getting their hands around what it actually means. i know that it hasn't been too long, but do you guys have a framework of how to think about the impact of this money in the school vertical, a, this year? and what does it mean for demand for hvac refurbishment, upgrades over the next two years?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, andy, we think it's significant. you look at the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, $130 billion of that went toward school reopening. and then if you look at the president's new proposed infrastructure build, the american jobs plan, it includes an additional $100 billion for schools. so how and when that gets spent will remain to be seen. obviously, it needs to flow from the federal to the state to the local school districts. but it's significant because the gao had a report that said 40% of the school districts have insufficient hvac. so when you look at that potential $230 billion of spend, we think a material amount of that will go toward upgrading the hvac systems because it's long overdue and it's needed.
k-12 is an important part of our business. it represents about 10% of our sales in north america in applied and light commercial. we've come out with very targeted kit offering, which makes it easy for the 16,000 school districts across the country to make a selection and move quickly to implement it. we have a dedicated sales team. we have innovative solutions that we've now come forward with things like abound in our opticlean solutions. and we also think it's important because these are sustainable solutions. so how it plays out this year and next, you will have to see the specifics, but we do think this will provide us with multiyear tailwind for our hvac business. opeartor, next question.
andrew obin -- bank of america -- analyst
sorry.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
go ahead, andy.
operator
thank you. our next question will come from the line of josh pokrzywinski from morgan stanley. you may begin.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hi, josh.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
dave, so maybe just first question on residential. you mentioned the strong sell-in, sell-through still good, but not quite as high. backlog still high. so maybe that the channel was still low, but how are you thinking about 2q here? can you guys match sell out in 2q? or is inventory for your distributors brimming to the point where maybe they need to destock a little bit?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, 2q, josh, still feel strong. we came in with a nice backlog into 2q. we do think that it's going to be hard to track quarter-to-quarter. you almost have to step back and look at the full year. i think what we're going to see is normal growth rates for the year with abnormal calendarization. so what we saw in the first quarter was sales up 50%. and what we're looking at for the first half is sales probably up around 35% in the first half. and then given the very difficult compare given the strength we had in the second half of last year, the second half is probably down closer to 20%. so we're raising -- we had originally thought the year would be low to mid-single digits.
it's clearly looking like it's in the mid-single-digit range for the year, which is not an abnormal kind of year. what's really encouraging is that movement was very strong in the first quarter. it was up over 20%, and movements continue to be strong here in 2q. now the inventory levels, as you said, they're higher than normal. they're at 30% year-over-year. but having said that, if movement continues to stay at the pace that we've been seeing it, we think that we would end q2 inventory levels probably 10% to 15% higher than 2019, which is a better compare, which is not completely abnormal.
housing starts continuing to be very strong. they'll be up 11%, 12% this year, and we're seeing continued pent-up demand. and a lot of the strength we saw or at least a material amount of strength we saw in the first quarter was furnaces, which would not really indicate for a lot of prestocking and inventory. so look, we're going to have to keep an eye on it, of course, because third quarter was up 50%, fourth quarter up 25%, this quarter up 50%. but we continue to take share, we continue to support our customers, we continue to see strong movement. so we feel well positioned certainly in 2q, and then we'll have to see how the rest of the year plays out.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. that's helpful. and then i guess just thinking on carrier 700, and you guys are in the midst of a pretty substantial transformation across the board, including in trying to build out a service organization. i think that comes at a point in time where maybe there's some bottlenecks out there whether it's finding new suppliers for sourcing initiatives, hiring folks, training them up. anything that you're seeing out there that maybe kicking some of those initiatives to the right, simply because it's hard to onboard new suppliers, new technicians, whatever it is across the board?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
no, josh. those are not -- i mean, look, there's challenges on carrier 700, but it's not driven by the ones you mentioned. clearly, we're seeing inflationary headwinds coming our way. commodities, we're seeing some headwind there. of course, input costs from our tier one, tier two suppliers, we have to manage that. logistics remain a challenge. and frankly, we have to manage productivity because there are some labor shortages in places like our collierville, tennessee factory, where we're in the process of hiring a few hundred people there and we got to keep up with not only the short-term demand, but the sustained demand that we see coming over the coming quarters.
so there's challenges out there. i'm really proud of the operations team. i think they're managing it best-in-class, but it's certainly not without its challenges. but i think the things you mentioned were actually tried to get out in front. and one of the things that i think has helped us is as we saw this demand coming, we actually prestock some inventory. patrick and i authorized a bit of inventory in december and then in january to make sure that we had parts that we were going to need some buffer stock in the face of a lot of the demand influx that we were anticipating.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
got it. good call on that. appreciate the color. i'll get back in line.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks. good morning, everyone.
patrick goris -- finance
good morning, nigel.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
so the commercial hvac growth of mid-teens wouldn't have been something we have probably guessed coming into the quarter. and that's with like commercial down mid-single digits in the u.s. so i'm just wondering can you just maybe just dig into the next level in terms of the moving pieces within that mid-teens. and then you talked about light commercial accelerating in 2q on a much, much easier comp. maybe just talk about how you see commercial evolving over the balance of the year.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. let me start on the applied side. we were very pleased with that mid-teen growth we saw in -- on the commercial applied side. obviously, china had some easy compares, but sales up there. sales in china were up over 100%. we were pleased with the growth in europe. europe was up in the mid-teen range. north american equipment was a watch item. we did have a couple of very short-term issues in one of our factories that probably is a short-term issue. so we'll catch up with that here in 2q.
so north american equipment for us was actually down a bit. and the aftermarket in north american was up double digits. so i think the north american equipment is poised for a nice recovery, especially when you look at the abi, the architectural billing index. we looked at 11 months below 50%, and it got as low as 29%. but now we've been above 50%. and in march, it was at 55%, which is very, very good level. so of course, a big leading indicator of commercial construction activity. so we're very encouraged about what we're seeing in the applied space in north america, especially in the verticals like data centers and warehouses, education, which i mentioned on the stimulus package and then healthcare. so -- and we continue to lean into aftermarket growth, which we anticipate will be up double digits and the backlog is strong.
light commercial, it was down a bit. it sequentially improved from the fourth quarter. so every quarter, light commercial has been getting better. but as restaurants and retail start to open up, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing with order trends. so it's really set up for nice growth. we were thinking that light commercial would be up mid-single digits. it's probably going to be up around 10% this year. and what we're seeing in light commercial is strong order trends. we're seeing improved backlogs. i mean it's not -- it's obviously a very easy compare, but the backlog is up 100%. and what's really encouraging is field inventory levels are down. they're down about 35%. so it's set up for a nice rebound as we get into 2q and beyond.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
amazing. amazing. that's great detail. and then on the chigo acquisition. so congratulations on sitting in the vrf white space. but what's the plan? are you going to globalize that product and bringing it to the u.s.? and then how does the chigo fit in with toshiba, your ownership with toshiba?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we look at chigo as a first step of many. you look at the entire vrf space and international light commercial, we see that as a $25 billion market out in 2025. and the reality is, if you look back in 2015, vrf, i mentioned this in the prepared remarks, but vrf was half the size of the traditional chiller market, and now they're about the same size. so you can imagine the cagr for vrf is exponentially higher than some of the other markets. and the issue that we had is we really did not -- we didn't have design capabilities, and we were not really a manufacturer. and that's not what we are as an oem. we're not a distributor.
so this was one of the few but important plays that we could make to become a design and manufacturing vrf player with a great operation there outside of guangzhou in china. so very, very pleased. it gets us to become a more meaningful player. we've been clear that we do have partnerships with folks like toshiba, with midea that we're very proud of. i mean these go back decades and they're great partners. are there opportunities to more optimize those into win-win relationships? we frankly believe that there are, and we're in very constructive discussions with those partners, but we see the chigo acquisition enabling that to not only be a play for china, but for it to being a global play.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst

our next question will come from the line of jeff sprague from vertical research. you may begin.
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst
good morning everyone.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning, mr. sprague.
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst
yes. i've gotten two spragues this earnings season. it's my italian roots -- my italian roots are coming through. it's the ballot. a lot to cover. i guess what i'd be interested in, maybe just, dave, circling back to kind of the healthy buildings dynamic, can you just elaborate a little bit more on how you're actually kind of defining that? does that pipeline mean it's kind of around the abound opportunity? or just kind of flush that out a little bit for us how you would differentiate the pipeline there versus what you're seeing kind of maybe in the core business.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, jeff. the way we tried -- we try to take a very strict and disciplined definition, which is these are sales that we would not have gotten prior to the focus on really healthy buildings. so a lot of the iaq-type offerings that really became much more prevalent when the pandemic hit, we really put that in the healthy building $500 million pipeline that i talked about. so examples would include opticlean. we have orders for more than 30,000 opticlean units, and we put that in the healthy building category. when we sell upgrades that are really driven by filtration or uv lights, we put that in there.
and we're really, really excited about the new abound offering. bobby george and the team have been working on this with almost a skunkworks-type group over the last six months or so to come out with a differentiated digital offering. and that will be a big enabler for healthy buildings because what it will do is it will make it visible to the end consumer, how safe and healthy is the indoor environment. we think about it like an intel inside strategy where you started to have end consumers ask for certain chips in their pcs.
what we're going to see is certain consumers having expectations that before they make a restaurant reservation or go into a commercial office building or come back into crowded indoor spaces, they're going to have an expectation that they can see the health of the indoor environment and that the building manager is taking steps to mitigate any anomalies with that. and that's exactly what abound will enable. so we will put a balanced subscription sales in the healthy building category as well.
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst
yes. well, that was the second part of my question. you talked a little bit about chiller service attachment, which may be kind of part of this equation. but are you seeing a different kind of service attachment rate with these offerings? and i guess, you kind of alluded to even some new evolving business models there. maybe just a little more color on that.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
we anticipate so, jeff, but it's too early to say. i mean we really -- we've been working for the last few months in the first quarter on pilot projects with a commercial office building. we were very excited with the atlanta braves and welcoming -- as they welcome fans back to truist park, that was a really profound win for us that we're excited about. we worked with a school -- a k-12 school outside of atlanta as well. so we've really been proving out the technology. we made it an official offering earlier this week. so it's too early to say in specific response to your question. but it's clearly, we have this tiered blueedge offering. and we believe abound will drive more recurring revenues through subscription sales, but also pull through more ltas and more of our elite blueedge offerings and equipment sales.
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst

and our next question will come from the line of deane dray from rbc capital markets. you may begin.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
good morning everyone.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning deane.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i just want to follow up on jeff's line of questions there. just to clarify the definition of the indoor air quality. is the -- all the school upgrades of the hvac systems because that is a covid-related concern and probably would not have had the kind of focus had there not been the pandemic? are you including that in indoor air quality opportunity?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. we'll base it more on the offering that we provide as opposed to the driver behind it. so if we go to a school district and what ends up happening is it's a much more of kind of an energy-efficient play, which is what we do all the time. and the modernization is more around energy efficiency. we probably would not put it in that healthy building category. but if the offering is driven by the underlying premise of driving more healthy and safe indoor environments, yes, we would put those in.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
okay. good. so that's helpful in terms of framing what's in that indoor air quality pocket. and then second question is, i know it's relatively small, but it did get called out is this operational issue at a minority-owned jv. just if you could flush out what the issue was, and does it broadly put the spotlight on carrier's portfolio of minority jvs? and what's the approach and time frame to address that the number of them there? and how might that get rationalized?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, on the second part of your question, deane, yes, i mean, one of our big themes for carrier since we spun has been focus on simplification. so if you think about our jv portfolio, we started with 40 minority jvs, and we'll end this year closer to 32. so we have been taking a very clinical approach to reducing the number of jvs for various reasons. there are some that really pose risk, but not a lot of value to the overall business. so we have reduced some of those.
and then there are some that we still have that we are in discussions to reframe them a bit, especially if it's in a very strategic area for us, and we're not consolidating sales or ebit, that's an area that we're in discussions with our partners on. with respect to the specific product issue that wasn't one of our minority jvs, i wish i could say that. in things we control, we've never had our own product issues. so we're not disparaging the jv because of that one issue, but it does highlight that we do want to have more controls in place in some of our critically strategic areas.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst

joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning everybody.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning joe.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. since we're on the topic of healthy buildings, i may as well ask the question as well. the -- so it seems like you've grown your opportunity. i think you highlighted $500 million this quarter. i think it was $200 million last quarter. but it seems also like the opportunity is pretty broad-based. so just any commentary around like where you're really seeing the uptick. and then also $500 million probably isn't the stopping point. i guess how you're thinking about the addressable opportunity for you guys?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, we think, joe, that the opportunity is significant, and it's broad-based across a number of verticals. so clearly, education, k-12 is a key focus area, but even universities. we've been in discussions with universities as they look at -- they're very -- they have a very broad footprint at most of the universities in the united states, but globally as well. health care and hospital is a key focus area for us as well. commercial office buildings as people reimagine the future of work and various models there. they do want to make sure that as people come back into the office to providing a safe indoor environment.
stadiums, i mentioned the deal with the braves, but we are optimistic that, that would be the first of other deals we would do. so anywhere where you have kind of people in a somewhat crowded indoor environment, they're starting to be more discussions. i had dinner with a friend who owns restaurants a couple of weeks ago, and he wants to add opticlean units for his various restaurants. so we're seeing a lot of interest. the question we get a lot is going to be how sticky is it? we know that sustainability is a sticky theme. in healthy, once the pandemic is more under control globally, well, healthy buildings be a thing of the past.
and i think that especially when you think about our abound offering, that is one of the keys to really making sure that this is a sticky trend for years to come, because what it's taught us is that covid isn't the first airborne-transmitted disease and it won't be the last. and people are much more in tune with having safe indoor environment. so to make it visible to them and then how you ultimately use ai and ml to anticipate and correct any deficiencies with indoor environments, i do think this is a trend that will withstand the test of time.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
that's helpful color, dave. and then maybe my follow-up for patrick. you gave a lot of details around the guidance for the year. i guess if i try to look at it, it looks like slightly differently. the first quarter came in much better than expected at the segment level, i think about $100 million better. the guidance for the full year only kind of implies like maybe even half of that at the segment level. and so i guess i'm just trying to understand like the conservatism that's baked into the rest of the year versus like what you expect from incremental headwinds for the rest of the year.
patrick goris -- finance
yes. i think, joe, the way you can look at it is, as always, one element is within residential hvac. we mentioned that some of the strength we've seen, we believe, could have been some of the acceleration of the seasonal inventory build. so that would not necessarily change the full year outlook for resi, although we did raise resi a little bit for the year, but not as much as the h1 beat. the second element, this is for fire & security. we saw a very strong end to the quarter in march. and so it's quick-turn business.
we have not updated our full year outlook for that segment at this point. and so we're taking another card there. in terms of profitability, full year, as i said, $70 million more of price, offsetting $70 million more of a headwind and then a little bit more volume leverage from what we raised. we did dial in a little bit more of the air freight costs as well for the full year. so that's kind of the -- a little bit more detail and color around the full year outlook.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. thanks, patrick. appreciate it.

our next question will come from the line of jeff hammond from keybanc. you may begin.
jeff hammond -- keybanc -- analyst
hey, good morning.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
patrick goris -- finance
good morning, jeff.
jeff hammond -- keybanc -- analyst
just a clarification on north america applied. how much of that was that watch item more the supply issue versus kind of demand still being choppy there?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
no. it had nothing, really -- we did is we transferred over on 3pl and we made it -- we had a couple of issues as we did that. so it was a very short-term issue, which is now behind us.
jeff hammond -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. and then any supply chain issues leaking into the transport piece? we've heard a lot about just truck, but anything you're seeing in transport?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i mean the supply chain issues are fairly broad-based. i mean there are electronic issues, there are raw material issues, even things like resins that we put into our injection molding process. we have to work with a couple of key tier one suppliers in our transport refrigeration business that are key watch items. so i think the team is managing it well, but there are some things that the team is having to do. in some cases, airfreight over ocean, which we would have done in the past. so it's not without its cost and challenges. but just like the rest of the portfolio, i'm really, really proud of how the team is working with the supply chain to manage them, but there are certainly issues that the team is battling every day.
patrick goris -- finance
and, jeff, we're meeting customer demand. we're just having a little bit more input costs in doing so, including freight.
jeff hammond -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. great. and if i could just sneak one more in. maybe just we're kind of through a lot of the pandemic reopening, demand seems to be inflecting here. and just beyond maybe just the minority interest stakes, how are you thinking about portfolio reshaping at a bigger level in some of the businesses that maybe don't fit longer term?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, look, we said that we would take a very clinical and structured review of our existing portfolio. and i can assure you that we started that on day one, and that's something that will continue forever. so we continue to look at every aspect of our portfolio and put it through a rigorous set of lenses to determine, is it the right kind of area for us to invest and improve? or is it worth more in the hands of someone else and we would use those proceeds to invest elsewhere? so we continue to look at all aspects of our current portfolio. we're very, very energized by the playbook we have in place. we have great confidence, as does our board and our strategic road map.
we have our three pillars of growth funded by carrier 700. we had these two big ecosystems we're focused on, healthy, safe and sustainable building and cold chain solutions. so we'll continue to look at rounding out those portfolios. we put our toe in the water with a bolt-on m&a with chigo, and we'll look at -- obviously, we're looking at others as we go forward. and then we, of course, know there's more transformational opportunities out there in the portfolio, but we're really energized by our ability to execute on the strategic road map that we have in front of us.
jeff hammond -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. fair enough. well, thanks guys.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you.

our next question will come from the line of steve tusa from jpmorgan. you may begin.
steve tusa -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, steve. good morning,
patrick goris -- finance
good morning, steve.
steve tusa -- jpmorgan -- analyst
what was price and cost in the quarter for you guys?
patrick goris -- finance
what's about neutral, steve?
steve tusa -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and actual price, the actual price capture?
patrick goris -- finance
a little bit -- well, less than one point in the quarter itself is actually was -- in the quarter in q1 itself, it was less than 0.5 point. for the full year, it will be a little less than one point for the total company.
steve tusa -- jpmorgan -- analyst
yes. okay. got it. and you were neutral on commodes, ok. when you talk to the channel, and i know we kind of talk to your channel as well, obviously. but when you talk to others in the channel, maybe outside of watsco, what are they saying about what's actually happening on the ground? the sell-through is pretty good. is there a little bit of catch-up from people not being able to get product last year, so they kind of scheduled it for the spring? i mean what's -- what are you hearing from like some of your key contractor customers?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
what we hear from really both our distributors and our contractors is that demand is strong. that it's real demand and that they're pushing for the right mix from us so they can support the customers. obviously, new construction continues to be extremely strong. and then what you're seeing is we had anticipated that in previous down cycles, what you would have seen is more repair over replacement. we actually haven't seen any of that. we've actually seen a lot more replacement of entire units, entire condensing units or entire systems. and i think it's because -- partly because there's more stay at home and partly because there's more liquidity in this down cycle than we saw in previous.
so people are prioritizing the spend they have on their homes, and we're also seeing people buy a lot of new homes. and often when you buy a new home, one of the things you do in your inspection is look at the hvac system. so that's probably driving some of it. but what we're hearing, we were actually on the phone recently last week with a key distributor down in the texas area. and they said that they're very encouraged by what they're seeing from their contractors. they're encouraged by carrier's ability. it's not that we haven't had our hiccups, but our ability to support them, and i think that's helped some of the share gains that we've seen. and we'll have to see. obviously, there's inventory out there in the channel, but we'll have to see. if movement can continue to be north of 20%, then it's an encouraging sign.
steve tusa -- jpmorgan -- analyst
and you mentioned share gains. would you at the margin -- given everybody else is kind of raising price dramatically, i mean, would you at the margin make targeted efforts with price to allow distribution to kind of go after some share in local markets, selectively?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
we've been consistent on the price that i think others have announced. we came in with a price increase coming into the year. we announced for resi up to 7% increase in june. so look, there's clearly inflationary pressures on there on our side, and we really have no choice but to raise prices, not only in resi, but across the portfolio. and i think customers expect it. so we'll be doing that. and i think it seems like from what i've read from our peers that, that's an industrywide phenomenon.
steve tusa -- jpmorgan -- analyst
is there any way where price is down? that's my final question, sorry.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
no.
steve tusa -- jpmorgan -- analyst
okay. great. thanks a lot.

gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
yes. thanks. good morning.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
patrick goris -- finance
good morning.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
yes. i want to ask about the competitive environment. last year, we had a couple of resi competitors that couldn't produce to meet the -- goodman, for example. lennox mentioned on their call that they've seen some issues among resi competitors as well. and i was curious, are you guys seeing that? and if so, kind of how is that manifested in your orders? if there's any way to quantify it?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. look, we will never comment on a competitor. we have a tremendous amount of respect for our competition. and i think we all go through various challenges during different times. so i think that we're all experiencing various challenges. i think our operations team has gone a great length to support our customers. and i think that because we did prestock some inventory anticipating the ramp, i think that's helped us.
i know our team has been working around the clock to support operationally. we've tried to be very strategic with our supply chain and our own operations to have some level of redundancy. so if there is an issue in one place, we can ramp up somewhere else. so we're not, by any means, flawless. we have our challenges, but i do think the operational performance has helped us pick up a bit of share along the way.

2021-Q2,CARR,2021-07-29 09:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to carrier's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. this call is being carried live on the internet, and there is a presentation available to download from carrier's website at ir.carrier.com. i would like to introduce your host for today's conference, sam pearlstein, vice president of investor relations. please go ahead, sir.
samuel pearlstein -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, and good morning, and welcome to carrier's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. we appreciate your flexibility in accommodating the earlier start time for the call.
since we plan to discuss the chubb transaction as well as the second quarter earnings, we have more flexibility if the call runs a little longer. with me here today are david gitlin, chairman and chief executive officer; and patrick goris, chief financial officer. except as otherwise noted, the company will be speaking to results from operations, excluding restructuring costs and other significant items of a nonrecurring and/or nonoperational nature, often referred to by management as other significant items. the company reminds listeners that the sales, earnings and cash flow expectations and any other forward-looking statements provided during the call are subject to risks and uncertainties.
carrier's sec filings, including forms 10-k, 10-q and 8-k, provide details on important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. this morning, we'll review our financial results for the second quarter, discuss the full year 2021 outlook and the agreement we announced tuesday to sell our chubb business. we will leave time for questions at the end.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to our chairman and ceo, dave gitlin.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thank you, sam, and good morning, everyone. it is great to be hosting this call from the carrier-cooled new york stock exchange, and we appreciate the support that we've received from the team here. please turn to slide two.
before we discuss the second quarter results, let me address the press release that we issued tuesday announcing that we signed an agreement to sell our chubb business to api group for an enterprise value of $3.1 billion. to be clear, carrier's global fire & security products business is not part of this transaction and remains an integral part of carrier's portfolio and our healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building strategy.
we committed at our investor day last year to objectively assess our portfolio and do so through a rigorous application of our strategic and financial priorities. within our fire & security portfolio, our products business is differentiated with leading market positions and attractive margins. chubb is an industry leader with 13,000 employees that do a great job with installation and maintenance supporting our customers but it is an agnostic business that does not pull through our products and yields lower margins.
we concluded that chubb is more strategic to api group than it is to us. divesting chubb will significantly simplify our business. chubb represents over 20% of our employees or less than 10% of our adjusted operating earnings. selling chubb will increase our focus on our core businesses and enable us to reinvest the proceeds consistent with our capital allocation priorities to create long-term shareholder value. patrick will discuss in more detail, but our capital allocation priorities have remained consistent: funding organic and inorganic growth, dividends and share buyback within a solid investment-grade credit rating.
our intention is to use the cash proceeds and excess cash on the balance sheet for acquisitions, buybacks and debt pay down over 12 to 18 months to help position the company for strategic growth and to generate attractive shareholder returns. the net result will be a new, more focused carrier with more product differentiation, faster revenue growth, higher margins and higher returns on invested capital. this was an important deal for carrier, and i want to thank our team and advisors for their tremendous work. now turning to our q2 results on slide three.
q2 was another strong quarter for us. our growth continues to be fueled by broad economic momentum, our position at the epicenter of important secular trends and the benefit of our strategic investments. managing the surge in growth has strained our extended supply chain, but our teams are navigating those challenges well to support our customers.
you see our progress reflected in our 2q results. organic sales were up over 30%. particularly encouraging was that the growth was strong across our portfolio and that we even grew 7% versus 2q of 2019. orders were up about 35% organically compared to last year, driving our backlog up 8% sequentially and up over 20% year-over-year, positioning us well for 3q and the second half of the year.
we produced $821 million of adjusted operating profit up over 70% year-over-year. and consistent with what we said during the april earnings call, q2 incremental margins improved sequentially from q1. free cash flow continues to be strong with first half free cash flow up more than 30% over the first half of last year. given our first half performance, strong backlog and expectations around the balance of the year, we are again raising our full year guidance for sales, earnings and cash.
we now expect organic sales to grow 10% to 12%, adjusted eps to increase by about 30% compared to last year, and we are increasing our projected free cash flow by $200 million to about $1.9 billion. now turning to slide four. we remain confident in sustained growth in our end markets and that our new operating system, culture and team performance position us well to lead within our space.
key secular trends are likely to propel sustained growth for our industry. with people spending 90% of their time indoors and increasingly returning to their offices and recreational activities, we see more spend being allocated to the health, safety, comfort and intelligence of indoor environments of all types, from homes to schools to hospitals to commercial office buildings.
likewise, the need for safe cold chain solutions has been intensified by the focus on vaccine distribution and the increasing global middle classes demand for more fresh produce and other refrigerated products. and of course, the need for sustainable solutions. given that the building sector contributes about 40% of carbon emissions and food waste contributes another 10% to 15%, we are confident that spend on sustainability will continue to drive demand for our green solutions.
we, therefore, remain laser focused on healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions, and we are leaning into those trends by executing on our three pronged growth strategy: growing our core, expanding product extensions and increasing recurring revenues through digitally enabled aftermarket offerings and we are seeing strong progress, as you can see on slide five.
we have booked $250 million in healthy building orders year-to-date, and our active pipeline sits at $500 million. we are confident that spend on healthy buildings is not only sticky but that it will accelerate as building owners will play both defense and offense on behalf of their occupants. defensive spend is largely focused on defending against the spread of airborne illnesses. for example, 40% of classrooms in the united states have insufficient ventilation and studies show that better ventilation and filtration materially reduced the spread of microscopic particulates like covid and other illnesses like the flu and common colds. building owners are also starting to invest in better ventilation to play offense.
recent studies have shown that people performed twice as well when the indoor environment is optimized. high co2 levels, which can occur in crowded classrooms and offices with poor ventilation have been proven to impact brain-based skills while better ventilation and filtration significantly improved cognitive function. because of the many benefits of healthy indoor air environments, our goal is to make indoor air visible. so good air quality becomes as important and expected as safe drinking water. abound is a key enabler to make that happen.
we received favorable feedback from our key launch customers, which include a commercial office building and an elementary school, and we have deployed it in our company headquarters where we have been demonstrating its power to customers. we are now leveraging our global sales force to deploy abound and have had significant interest from marquee customers.
in addition to abound, we recently launched a wifi-enabled carrier home air purifier with a hepa-level filter as one of our latest healthy home offerings. we have now sold over 38,000 opticlean units. on k-12, we have a dedicated team offering catered solutions to our customers, resulting in sales to about 15% to 20% more school districts so far this year compared to last year as part of what we expect to be a significant opportunity over the next few years.
similarly, our connected cold chain offerings are gaining traction. our cloud-based digital lynx offering that we are building in partnership with aws was recognized by fast company as one of 2021's world-changing ideas. in the container space, we are adding connectivity for thousands of units each month and now can support mixed fleets carrier and non-carrier, thereby increasing our recurring revenues and reducing our customer maintenance and logistic costs.
we had significant lynx wins this quarter with truck/trailer, including 1,700 more trailer refrigeration units for prime and a three year supply agreement with u.k. grocer sainsbury's for all of its truck and trailer transport refrigeration equipment. cortix is carrier's ai and iot platform that offers predictive insights, recommendations and autonomous actions to optimize equipment performance and building operations while minimizing our customers' energy consumption. currently, over 220,000 pieces of equipment are connected to cortix. digital solutions are helping to drive increased aftermarket and recurring revenues.
aftermarket sales for carrier were up about 20% in q2 over last year, all helped by our differentiated blueedge tiered offerings. our attachment rate in commercial hvac was more than 35% in q2, and we are on track to add another 10,000 chillers to long-term contracts this year from about 50,000 to 60,000. likewise, in our refrigeration business, our europe truck trailer business sold nearly 6,000 blueedge service agreements in the first half of the year.
in addition, our fire & security segment continues to expand our key digital offerings. earlier this year, lenels2 was featured in the apple worldwide developers conference, and we're excited to work with apple on providing bluediamond mobile credentials in apple wallet, on iphone and apple watch. as employees come back to office buildings, this work can increase the profile of access control solutions that help reduce touch points, enhance occupant experience and increased confidence in indoor environments. so very significant progress on healthy, safe and intelligent offerings and recurring revenues and on slide six, you see similar progress on our focus on sustainability. in short, we are committed to providing environmentally sustainable solutions and our performance over the past year reflects just that.
we are on track to meet our commitment of reducing our customers' carbon emissions by more than one gigaton and ensuring our operations are carbon neutral by 2030. electrification and energy efficiency are major focus areas for us. commercial heat pumps in europe and residential heat pumps in north america were both up 20% to 30% in the quarter. electrification is equally critical to our refrigeration business. interest in our vector ecool unit in europe remains high and our backlog continues to grow. this is the only 100% electric trailer reefer unit in the market today.
our efforts in helping customers reduce emissions and creating more energy-efficient solutions are starting to be reflected in some of our external ratings, including improvements in both our msci and sustainalytics scores in the past year.
as you can see on the slide, we are now considered a leader in the industry. so great progress on esg, which is a fundamental aspect of who we are. so before i turn it over to patrick, a word on a leadership change that we recently announced. in a couple of weeks, tim white will join us as president of our refrigeration segment.
tim has been running ge's multibillion-dollar onshore wind business for the americas region, and he ran key p&ls within collins aerospace that included electric systems, environmental control systems and engine control systems. he is the perfect leader to take this well-positioned business to the next level as we focus on electrification, digitalization and sustainable solutions.
i also want to thank david appel for his tremendous leadership of the segment. we are fortunate to have david moving to paris where our commercial refrigeration business is headquartered to provide the focus that, that business needs to improve operational, strategic and financial performance. we appreciate david taking on this critical assignment. so with that, let me turn it over to patrick.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, dave, and good morning, everyone. i'll start with comments about the quarter and the outlook and then provide additional color on the chubb transaction. please turn to slide seven. as dave mentioned, q2 was a good quarter with sales, operating earnings, adjusted eps and free cash flow all exceeding our expectations.
sales of $5.4 billion were up 37% compared to last year. currency was a five point tailwind for sales in the quarter or about $200 million and acquisitions, that's mainly chigo, added another point of growth. given the impact from covid last year, this quarter obviously had an easy comparison. nonetheless, organic sales growth of 31% was significantly better than we expected across all our businesses.
adjusted operating margin expanded over 300 basis points to 15.1%. strong sales growth and benefits from carrier 700 were partially offset by investments and higher input costs. as we expected, price/cost was negative in the quarter given the timing of price and cost increases, much stronger-than-expected demand, combined with supply chain challenges negatively impacted factory efficiency. it also meant material purchases went beyond block positions. and as a result, we bought some materials and components at spot prices and utilized expedited freight. i'll address our outlook for the balance of the year with respect to price and cost in a few slides, but i'll share that we already announced additional pricing actions to offset rising inflationary pressures throughout our supply chain.
reported earnings conversion of about 24% improved sequentially, and excluding currency and acquisitions, conversion was in the high 20s. free cash flow of $482 million in the quarter reflected better-than-expected net income and was similar to last year's second quarter despite $180 million of higher interest and tax payments. finally, we repurchased about two million shares at an average price of $44.33 during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to about three million shares.
let's now look at how the segments performed, starting on slide eight. hvac organic sales were up 32% in the quarter with nearly 35% residential hvac growth. as we previously said, we expect that residential field inventory levels to finish approximately 10% to 15% higher than the end of q2 2019. strong distributor movement of over 20% compared to last year led to field inventories ending the quarter only 7% higher than at the end of q2 of 2019, a much more balanced inventory level. north american light commercial business saw a significant rebound with sales up over 60% in the quarter. light commercial field inventory levels are now down just 3% year-over-year.
overall, commercial hvac sales were up about 20% organically. hvac team expanded margins by 300 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong growth across all businesses in this segment, including services. the segment remains on track to generate about 60% adjusted operating margin this year.
moving to refrigeration on slide nine. sales were up 38% organically as the cyclical recovery in transport that we see in orders continue to convert into sales. transport refrigeration was up over 40% in the quarter with very strong growth in both global truck/trailer and container. our sensitech business continued to benefit from the vaccine rollout and was up about 20% in the quarter. commercial refrigeration grew about 30% as reopenings in europe drove strong growth.
margins for this segment were up 320 basis points in the quarter compared to last year, mainly as a result of the higher sales. we continue to meet customer demand but are incurring higher costs to do so, including air freight. we expect operating margins to improve in the second half as the higher-margin north america truck and trailer business recovery continues. given the higher input costs, we now expect full year 2021 operating margin for this segment to be in the mid-13% range, a little lower than we previously expected.
moving on to slide 10. organic sales at the fire & security segment grew 25%, and both the products and field businesses grew at similar rates. within the products business, which represents about 60% of the segment sales, residential and commercial fire continued to be solid. given the easier comparisons, access solutions returned to double-digit growth our industrial businesses were up high single digits.
in industrial fire, we saw the recovery for upgrades and retrofits begin in marine services and in the oil and gas markets. higher sales and carrier 700 performance helped drive a 140 basis point margin expansion in this segment. with the higher sales outlook and the timing of price and cost actions, we expect higher margins in the back of the year compared to the first half of the year and overall margins to be in the mid-13s for the year.
now let me review the order activity we saw in the second quarter on slide 11. as you can see, our residential and light commercial businesses continued to see strong demand. backlog in residential is up sequentially and points to a better second half than we previously expected. commercial hvac orders were up over 30% compared to last year, and backlog increased almost 20% year-over-year and up mid- to high single digits sequentially from last quarter.
for refrigeration, order activity for the truck/trailer business continued to improve sequentially. strong order intake and backlog exiting q2 should position this segment to achieve the expected high teens organic sales growth for the full year. order intake for our fire & security segment also continued to improve sequentially. the product orders were up a bit over 25% year-over-year, especially in residential and commercial fire. field orders were up 25% to 30%, organic.
i'll skip slide 12. so let's move to slide 13, our updated outlook. to be clear, we will include chubb in the outlook until the transaction closes. based on stronger-than-expected q2 performance and higher backlogs, we are increasing our organic sales outlook from a range of 5% to 8% to a new range of 10% to 12%. a bit more than half a point of the incremental organic growth represents incremental pricing actions we already have or are taking to offset higher input costs versus our april guidance. last quarter, we said material and component input costs were about $120 million or so higher than 2020. we now expect those input costs to be up an additional $125 million.
we intend to offset this through additional pricing actions. we recently announced the third price increase in our residential hvac business for september as well as a third price increase in transport refrigeration, and we are implementing similar actions in other areas of our portfolio.
our new outlook includes $125 million of additional pricing compared to our april guidance. for the full year, we expect price cost to be neutral though we expect it to be a modest headwind in q3, offsetting higher input costs with incremental pricing on a dollar-for-dollar basis protects profitability, but of course, hurts reported margin and conversion.
despite these cost inefficiencies, we now expect to deliver an adjusted operating margin of over 13.5% for the year, better than our previous outlook. another way to think about the outlook is that the revenues are now expected to be about $1 billion higher than the april guide. of that, about $125 million is priced to offset increased input costs and about $200 million is acquisition-related sales with little profit contribution this year.
the conversion on the remaining $650 million to $700 million of sales approaches the 30% we would normally expect. this all leads to an adjusted eps outlook range of $2.10 to $2.20, a $0.15 improvement at the midpoint from our prior guidance. we also now expect free cash flow to be about $1.9 billion, up $200 million from our prior guidance.
slide 14 shows a bridge for the $0.15 improvement in our adjusted eps outlook from the midpoint of our prior guide to the midpoint of our current guidance. the biggest driver is the operational conversion on additional sales. moving over to slide 15. i'll provide more details regarding chubb's transaction.
you can see a brief profile of chubb on the left side of the slide. we expect revenues for chubb to be about $2.2 billion this year with high single-digit operating margins. excluding chubb, carrier's operating margins would be about 50 to 100 basis points higher, free cash flow conversion about 100%, and we would also expect to have a higher growth and modestly higher return on invested capital profile. the remaining fire & security segment will include a portfolio of differentiated, high-margin businesses with leading positions in their respective markets. sales would be about $3.5 billion and operating margin in the high teens.
with respect to transaction details, the enterprise value is $3.1 billion, and net after-tax cash proceeds are expected to be about $2.6 billion. as part of the transaction, about 2/3 of carrier's total pension and post retirement assets and liabilities will be transferred to api. that is over $2 billion and significantly simplifies and derisks our balance sheet. related to the pension, we expect most to all of our noncash, nonservice pension benefit on the income statement to go away. while this generates about $70 million in annual earnings, we do not believe it represents any economic value. as customary, the sale is subject to a consultation process and regulatory approvals. expected close is late q4 2021 or early q1 2022.
as to the use of proceeds, we intend to use the approximately $2.6 billion in net proceeds as well as available excess cash for a combination of acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. we expect to delever by about $750 million post transaction to maintain our leverage profile commensurate with the ebitda reduction. we have a growing pipeline of acquisitions that align with our strategic priorities, and our board just approved an incremental $1.75 billion share repurchase authorization.
we will be flexible between share repurchases and acquisitions, and now expect 2021 repurchases to exceed the five million shares we previously discussed. in closing, we had a good first half with strong double-digit organic growth. congratulations to our team in supporting stronger-than-expected demand in a very challenging supply chain environment.
with our performance so far, along with a solid order activity and backlog growth, we feel confident meaningfully raising our full year guidance. and the chubb transaction simplifies our portfolio, enhances management focus, creates a more attractive company profile and generates cash to reinvest in higher share owner value-creating opportunities. with that, i'll turn it back to you, david.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks, patrick. we are very pleased with our performance as we are now halfway through 2021, and we remain confident in our team's ability to navigate supply chain challenges to support our customers and drive continued results in 2h and beyond. with that, we'll open this up for questions.

[operator instructions] our first question comes from jeff sprague with vertical research.your line is open.
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst
hey, thank you. good morning everyone.
unidentified speaker
good morning.
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst
yeah, good morning. congrats on getting chubb off the board. just a couple of questions around that, and patrick alluded to it a little bit on the repo comment. but just kind of wondering how actionable some of the redeployment might be prior to the actual close of the deal, whether you have the appetite maybe to even get a more of a running start on share repo or some of the m&a that you're talking about in the pipeline possibly happens relatively quickly.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, jeff, a couple of comments. one, i would say that what we're looking at from an inorganic growth point of view and the acquisitions there, i would say that is really unrelated to the timing of the chubb proceeds.
as we look at what's in the pipeline and actionable, we will go after those opportunities prior to any potential proceeds. frankly, we -- given the amount of cash we have on the balance sheet, we may not need those chubb proceeds. in terms of share repurchases, the prior guide that we provided you was about five million shares this year. at this point, we probably think it's going to be somewhat closer to $10 million -- 10 million shares not dollars.
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst
great and then also just thinking about maybe strategically the fire -- the remaining fire & security field assets from here. although chubb didn't pull through as much as you would have liked, i think it pulled through some and i'm just wondering how you might be reorienting your fire & security offering, pulling it through hvac channels and that sort of thing to really kind of augment the overall package that you're trying to push forward here.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, jeff, we have a healthy channel. i mean chubb was one of our many distribution channels. so it was -- it's an important piece of our channel, but it was agnostic just as other parts of the channel would be to us. so when you look at our fire & security segment, call it, $5.5 billion, you got a couple of billion with chubb that was in the single digit -- high single-digit range for ros and then the remaining $3.5 billion of products you have highly differentiated products, #1 or #2 in all of our segments. it fits well with the whole healthy building trend and the other parts of the hvac portfolio and the ros is close to 20%.
so very, very strategic, something that we really want to lean into and i think that martin franklin and the team over at the api group will really take what's a great business with chubb to new levels. we had a choice should we kind of make the investments to take the margins higher of chubb or let someone else do it and redeploy that capital for parts of our portfolio that are more core and more differentiated, and we elected to do the latter.
jeff sprague -- vertical research -- analyst
great. thank you.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer

thank you. our next question comes from nigel coe with wolfe research. your line is open.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks and good morning everyone.
unidentified speaker
good morning.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
congrats on getting chubb booked in carrier as opposed to utx. i don't think greg hayes would given you the money, david. just to clarify on the proceeds. so the way that it was framed earlier this week was $2.9 billion of cash, gross cash and then $0.2 billion of liabilities. but you're talking about $2.6 billion of net kind of cash proceeds. so i just want to confirm the tax leakage is $0.3 billion. that's the first part of that question. and then secondly, how is the cash conversion for chubb been over time? i'm thinking here about things like pension funding and the like.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, nigel, patrick here. maybe i'll give you a walk of the $3.1 billion for chubb, $2 billion to $2.6 billion the estimated net cash proceeds to us. so at the $3.1 billion deduct from that assumed liabilities and other adjustments to the buyer that gets you to $2.9 billion, which is probably the number that you've seen in some of the press releases that went out from the buyer.
and then from the $2.9 billion to the $2.6 billion, it's mainly taxes on a transaction because we are booking a gain, but it also includes some of the fees associated with the transaction. so that's the kind of the walk of the $3.1 billion to the $2.6 billion.
in terms of free cash flow conversion on chubb, actually, chubb was one of the reasons why our key cash flow conversion for the overall company was less than 100%. and part of that, of course, gets back to the noncash, nonservice pension benefit we saw in the income statement. that's about $70 million on an annual basis. we don't attribute any economic value to that. that headwind called on free cash flow conversion will go away.
i would also add that from an overall company perspective, whether it's from a working capital perspective or an roic perspective, chubb was below the company average. and so without chubb, all of these metrics, we expect them to improve, including, of course, our operating margin.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
right and sticking with chubb for my follow-on question. anything to think about from a stranded cost perspective for remainder of fire & security and any impact to the tax rates going forward?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
we don't expect a meaningful change on the tax rate going forward versus where we are today. and then stranded costs would be de minimis. when i say de minimis $0.01 or less. and obviously, we will do our best to make that go away.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
thanks patrick.

thank you. our next question comes from joe ritchie with goldman sachs. your line is open.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. good morning guys. congrats on chubb as well.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
joe, we can't hear you all that well. can you try and speak up?
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
joe, we can't hear you all that well. can you try and speak up?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, much better.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay. great. so first question, i guess, maybe just use of proceeds. obviously, you've highlighted the buyback. i'm just curious, from an m&a standpoint, as you think about the portfolio today, where would you prioritize potential m&a in the portfolio today if you were to go down that path.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
we are going to go down that path, joe. we've been clear that in terms of capital allocation, our priorities, our organic and inorganic growth, as patrick said. of course, we'll do share buyback and debt pay down, but we've been trying to really aggressively build the pipeline.
we start from our strategic mission, which is to be the world leader in healthy, safe, sustainable, intelligent building and cold chain solutions. so whatever we look at needs to really tie into that overall north star that we have.
we've been clear on our three strategic pillars of growth. we want to strengthen and grow our core. so that would be keeping it right in the center of the fairway. product extensions and geographic coverage. you saw us put our toe in the water on vrf with chigo, and that would be in the category of a product extension and then enhanced aftermarket and digital capabilities.
so you'll see us really leaning into a focus on recurring revenue. so we're still starting to build that pipeline and we're excited to really start to play more offense. and i should mention, by the way, when we talk about capital allocation, of course, as patrick mentioned, the dividend as well, which is obviously a part of our priorities.
joe ritchie -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. that makes sense, dave and i guess, maybe my follow-on question. clearly, you guys are dealing with inflationary pressure as is every company that we cover and handling it well.
i guess as you kind of think about the framework for 2022 and potentially the stickiness of some of those price increases, if we were to get into a more benign inflationary backdrop, what does that kind of mean for your margins if we do get more benign inflation?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, joe, patrick here. i'll take that question. it's -- i think it's fair to say that we probably spend more time on price/cost for 2022 than we do for 2021. and so first of all, this year, as you know, we're benefiting from some block positions. and so next year, when those roll off, we do need additional price to offset that. that's why we've announced additional price increases, our third price increase across our segments this year.
and so for next year, of course, we will focus on making sure that those price increases stick that we do get the yield, if price cost remains neutral next year, which frankly is our intention to be at least price/cost neutral for margin, of course, that's a little bit of a headwind. but of course, we always target to do better than that. and if that were the case, that it could benefit our margins. but our first priority is ensuring that price/cost next year remains neutral.
nigel coe -- wolfe research -- analyst
got it. okay. thank you both and congrats again.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
thanks joe.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer

thank you. our next question comes from julian mitchell with barclays. your line is open.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
hi, good morning. maybe just a couple of questions on the core business. i heard your guidance on revenue for the year on refrigeration organically. just wondered if you could put a finer point on the assumptions for hvac and f&s, apologies if i missed it. and within hvac, what are you assuming for second half residential revenues at this point?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, if you go through the -- you look at the portfolio and patrick could jump in as well. we increased overall sales, as you know, for the year, our organic is now up 10% to 12%. so hvac is going to be higher -- for the full year, up higher than 10%.
resi, we see up in the low teens. prior, we had been thinking year-over-year, it would be up low to mid-single digits, but we see resi up low teens and we're very encouraged by light commercial, it's probably up closer to high teens and applied is very strong, probably up in the high single-digit range and then refrigeration is likely to be up in the high teens for the full year, and then f&s is high single digits.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
perfect.. thanks very much and then just my follow-up question would be around you mentioned price cost in the profit bridge, also what's happening with m&a and fx. just wondered if there was any updates around carrier 700 savings in aggregate and also investment spend. and realizing seasonality has sort of messed up a bit for obvious reasons, anything you'd call out third versus the fourth quarter?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes. so julian, for carrier 700, you probably recall that we are targeting $225 million this year. at this point, and given that carrier 700 is a net number, i.e., it takes into account some of the headwinds from input cost inflation. we think that the carrier 700 savings this year will be somewhat closer to $150 million. and so that's a $75 million less due to higher material and component costs. and as i mentioned earlier, we intend to offset these headwinds as well as some other headwinds such as airfreight with incremental pricing actions in the balance of the year.
julian mitchell -- barclays -- analyst
great, thank you.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer

thank you. next question comes from steve tusa with jpmorgan. your line is open
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
steve, you there?
steve tusa -- jpmorgan -- analyst
hey, guys. sorry. sorry about that. good morning.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning
steve tusa -- jpmorgan -- analyst
can you maybe just talk about the resi markets and dave, kind of what's your view around the status of like the cycle. there's been a lot of debate around, i guess, machines running more. i think the inventory is probably less of an issue, less of a debate now, obviously. but what's kind of happening at a kind of the end market, kind of the end demand level in the state of the cycle? what's your opinion there?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure, steve. we were pleased that in 2q movement remained strong, which is obviously something that we're tracking very, very carefully. so we thought that our inventory levels at the end of 2q were going to be up 10% to 15% versus the same time at the end of 2019, which is an indicator we have been watching closely. and inventory level in the field for us ended up only up 7% versus the same time in q2 of 2019.
and you look at a collection of factors that are driving the strength that we're seeing. housing starts, it's going to be up 13% or so this year. we are seeing people obviously buying and selling more homes. and one of the things that happens when you buy a home is sometimes you replace the air conditioning system. so i think that's a driver.
there's been a lot of talk about work from home, of course, but i think it's -- without being too quantitative about it, it just seems that units are running hotter and longer getting more cycles on them, and that has to be contributing to some of the strength that we're seeing. and we benefited from share gains. i mean we're up -- if you look at the last 12 months, you really can't measure share one quarter at a time, but you can look at -- over the last 12 months, our share is up over 200 basis points.
and it's a combination of converting dealers, but also i do believe that our operational performance, even though we have been far from flawless has helped us, albeit, frankly, at a higher cost, but we've gone out of our way to support our customers. so i think, steve, you put that all together and as we start looking ahead, we want to -- we expect that when we come out of this year, our inventory levels should be in balance. we're going to carefully watch movement. we have announced our third price increase effective september 1 this year, which was really focused on 2022 as we announced that.
and housing starts, we'll have to see how that plays out. the estimates are all over the map, but maybe around that to flattish for right now, but we'll see how that plays out. and then we'll start to see some perhaps early buy because of the 2023 change. so you put that all together, i think we're trying to stay very close to our distributors, keep inventory levels in check and continue to support our customers.
steve tusa -- jpmorgan -- analyst
is there a chance that you have a down year at any time in the next couple of years?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, there's a chance of anything. i mean you know, steve, it's a short-cycle business and that we're coming off some very -- we're coming off a lot of strength. but right now, we see between the pricing, the underlying factors that we've been seeing, orders have remained strong. i mean we're very well booked not only for 3q, we're booked into 4q. and we see that we're very, very well positioned in the high-margin resi business.
and the nice thing with our portfolio is that light commercial remains strong, the applied business, we look at abi indicators, which give us confidence around the coming months and years around the applied business, aftermarket growth. the whole portfolio, one of the things that i was particularly pleased about for 2q is that every part of the portfolio showed strength. so working hard in resi, well positioned there. there's a lot of things to like. and then we have the rest of the portfolio that looks positive as well.
steve tusa -- jpmorgan -- analyst
got it. and then sorry, one more, what were applied orders up in the quarter?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
i think 20% or 30%. let me -- before i answer it, we try to get a cheat sheet to help you here.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
about 30%.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, 30%.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
right, across all regions, basically. actually, very strong double digits across all regions, north america, emea and china, all up over 20%.
steve tusa -- jpmorgan -- analyst

thank you. thank you. our next question comes from tommy moll with stephens. your line is open.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
unidentified speaker
good morning tom.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
i want to talk to your incremental margins. if i'm interpreting your guide in the script correctly, it looks like for this year, on a reported basis, we ought to land somewhere between 20% and 25%. but patrick, i think i hear you saying operationally, you're still high 20s or 30s. so if we could just confirm those. but then also as we look into 2022, is there any reason we shouldn't continue to see that roughly 30% conversion and then in terms of the operational side.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, tommy. so your understanding is correct. so we expect reported conversion to be between 20 and 25 and operational or core conversion to be in the high 20s. and the difference between the 2 is really fx, which is about a 4-point headwind for the full year on conversion. and then the chigo acquisition, the first year with a lot of revenue and given some of the onetime costs, not a lot of earnings contribution yet.
and so that's really the walk between the low 20s and the high 20s from an earnings conversion point of view. and then, of course, what i'm not taking into account here is that as we raise price just to offset some input costs, that's somewhat of a headwind as well.
for next year, we're really not at a point where we can talk a lot about next year. what i can say is that, and i mentioned this before, we have a really strong focus within all 3 segments in ensuring that we take pricing actions now to offset any material cost and other inflation that we see in our businesses.
and so -- if we are successful doing that, and i'm very comfortable with that, then of course, we would expect an earnings conversion next year that would be in line what we do this year. the biggest driver, of course, will be what are the levels of organic growth. and that is not something we're ready to talk about at this point.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
fair enough. thank you for that. that's helpful. i wanted to follow up on blueedge. good to see the attach rate on chillers up to, i think, over 1/3 in the second quarter. as we move forward from here toward your target of 50%, i think, longer term, what are the levers you're pulling in the business? is it hiring more sales people? is it tweaking the incentives for your existing sales force? what are the things you can do to drive that number higher? and then assuming you hit that 50% range at some point in the future, is there any way to frame up what the impact could be in terms of your hvac growth rate or margin?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes, tommy. well, look, in terms of the aftermarket, i mean, if you turn the clock back, we were in the 20%. we targeted 30% attachment rate last year, which we achieved. and it was nice to see the attachment rate in 2q for our chiller business up over 35% in 2q. and i think it's a combination of what you said. we've added more feet on the street.
we've added salespeople. we've added more structure and thought around our ic structure globally. and i think digital enablement is a big factor. you look at providing more prognostics and diagnostics and more digital differentiation is a big factor to create the kind of stickiness with our customers that really help differentiate us. so it's focus and it's those various things.
and then in addition to attachment rate, we're very focused on overall coverage because attachment refers to you sell a chiller, it comes off the warranty period, are we signing a long-term agreement. and our expectation is that we do.
so i'd like to get that to 50% as soon as possible, then ultimately, even higher because that's just how we run the business. our other focus is overall coverage. we talked about going from 50,000 chillers that are covered by a long-term agreement to 60,000.
we're on track to do that. and that goes beyond the initial sale that goes into units that are out in the field that we're converting them to long-term agreements covered by carrier. so very pleased with the aftermarket growth. we make more money in the aftermarket than we do in the upfront equipment sales. so it will be margin accretive as well.
tommy moll -- stephens -- analyst
thank you both. ill turn it back.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer

thank you. our next question comes from andrew obin with bank of america. your line. is open.
andrew obin -- bank of america -- analyst
yes, good morning.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
andrew obin -- bank of america -- analyst
so you highlighted k-12 opportunity in your slide deck. anything at this point that you can quantify in terms of impact from the stimulus money that's already there. can you see any discernible impact in the channel on what's going on from the money from the government?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. we're encouraged, andrew. you look at the stimulus bills that have been passed over the last 18 months, you combine all those together, and there's been $190 billion that's been allocated to school reopenings, that k-12 space. and that is, we expect a real meaningful amount of that to go to hvac.
and what we've done is put a dedicated focus on this effort through a sales force, through incentives, through a lot of structured intensity around making sure that we get our fair share of that. and look, there's 16,000 school districts in the united states. when we look through the year-to-date, our k-12 vertical is up 15% to 20%, and we think it's directly correlated to the additional funding that is in that space.
and i think with this new infrastructure bill, of course, we'll see how that plays out once it goes over to the house, but we expect more money to be allocated to schools. but also when i see infrastructure bills, it actually plays very well for our strategic focus, healthy buildings, especially in school.
sustainability, there's going to be funding in there for things like sustainability for airports, that's exactly in our wheelhouse and then intelligence and our ability to use our abound system for both healthy and sustainable solutions in things like the schools and in airports, in infrastructure, i think, will be a really good opportunity. so we're encouraged by the infrastructure and the overall stimulus bills.
andrew obin -- bank of america -- analyst
thank you and just a follow-up question. how do you guys think about carrier 700 program in a highly inflationary environment, right? because if inflation continues in the next year, sort of the framework becomes less meaningful, right, just because you get penalized for the inflation, which is not really in your control. have you had the conversation with the board about maybe changing some of the metrics? or you think inflation goes away and we are back on track?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
andrew, what i would say is that in the current environment with higher input costs or in higher inflation, it really only enhances the focus on driving cost out throughout our supply chain, actually, within our ops organization, which was already very focused on driving our cost. we're just setting up a tiger team, adding additional people to get incremental cost out. and frankly, in addition to that, it just enhances our focus on what we can do on the g&a side as well to get incremental costs out.
and so yes, carrier 700 is a net number. but i would -- i'll be very clear to say this does not at all negatively influence our focus on it. we're more focused on it than before. same thing within our manufacturing facilities, a lot of focus on what we can do there also from an automation point of view, given that, as is well documented, we're not the only company that has some challenges with some localized labor. and so i'd say we're comfortable there that the focus will continue.
andrew obin -- bank of america -- analyst
i appreciate it thanks so much.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer

operator
thank you. our next question comes from jeff hammond with keybanc. your line is open.
jeff hammond -- keybanc -- analyst
just back on commercial, i think you called out light as being up 60%. can you just talk about what was going on there? and was that just a comp thing? or -- and then it seems like the applied back is maybe a little longer dated, just how that flows in.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
jeff, light commercial is very encouraging. clearly, easy comps. but when you're up 60% year-over-year, there's underlying strength there. we see it not only in the warehouse vertical, but it is an indication that things are reopening. you see it in retail, you see in restaurants. and it's clearly been one of the beneficiaries of the spend on k-12.
about half of our spend on k-12 is light commercial, the other half applied. so i think we benefited from that spend. we're also gaining share there as well. we've seen nice share gains probably in a similar range to what we've seen on the residential side over the last 12 months.
so the thing that's particularly encouraging about light commercial is that the field inventory levels are in check. they're low despite the strong sales, down only a few percent year-over-year, which means that there's not inventory in the channel. and as demand continues to increase and we continue to go to great lengths to support our customers, we feel quite encouraged by what we're seeing in light commercial right now.
jeff hammond -- keybanc -- analyst
and then just i think the chubb decision is a great one. but just kind of thinking about near-term dilution, the thought that between buyback and m&a, you can cover that up eventually? or do you think there's a transition into '22 where there's a little dilution. thanks.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
yes, the way we're thinking about this, first of all, we have capital available to us. i mentioned the cash on the balance sheet. we mentioned the proceeds. and so we will be focused on putting that capital to work in the best and most strategic way for us. and so think about -- we're looking at the next 12, 18 months that we're focused on redeploying capital. we're not going to get rushed into making any bad decisions or acquisitions that we will regret. but we think about a 12, 18 months' time frame to kind of make that up.
jeff hammond -- keybanc -- analyst
okay. great. thanks a lot.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from gautam khanna with cowen. your line is open.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
yes, thanks. good morning guys.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. it would indicate that the life expectancy would be with the fact that units are running -- putting more cycles on them than previously, and i do think that they're running hotter too. so i do think there's clearly indications that the overall life expectancy in terms of the number of years is going to be shorter as you put more cycles on it in a shorter period of time.
so we're working internally to dimensionalize that better than we have in the past. so we're doing the data assessment on that. but i think anecdotally, i can tell you with high confidence that the life expectancy does seem to be coming down.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
any order of magnitude on how much it may be coming down 20%, 30%?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
i'm hesitant to say because when we do say it, i want to make sure that we've gone deep on the data assessment of that. chris nelson and justin keppy and the team are looking at that and it really is critical not only so we can answer your question more specifically, but for our planning purposes, we actually -- we came into this year underestimating our demand, and that's driving a lot of -- we're doing a lot of hiring that we didn't anticipate doing.
so we need to get as precise on that answer for you and for ourselves as possible, but i'm hesitant to throw out a number on this call until we've gone deeper on it. but we will be coming back to you on that shortly.
gautam khanna -- cowen -- analyst
okay and then just a follow-up on the commercial hvac demand, up over 20% in aggregate. any sense for how much of that is sort of a catch-up of deferred replacement last year, if you will, sort of any slice of what's the underlying demand versus a catch-up, if you will.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
well, what i'd say is that what's really encouraging about commercial hvac is you look at abi, the architectural billing index, and we did go through a stretch where it was quite well -- quite low, many months where it was below 50, which obviously we want higher than 50 as an indication of strength. and it was 57 in june. it's the fifth straight month that is higher than 50 and i think it's a combination of probably catch up the things that were put on hold and new construction that is now being built in anticipation of the economic momentum we're seeing more globally.
we've had some key wins recently and not only things like data centers and warehouses, which generally were strong throughout the pandemic, but commercial office buildings, we've had some nice wins there, both in our hvac business, but also in our controls business. and of course, in fire & security.
so education, healthcare, commercial buildings, there's a lot of indication that it's pretty broad-based. and one thing that we found particularly encouraging was it wasn't a u.s. phenomenon. europe, was quite strong. your orders in europe were up over 50% in the quarter, and part of that easy comparable part of it is you're seeing some real pent-up demand there. and then, of course, it's not only applied, but our focus on aftermarket, which was up 15% in just hvac alone in the quarter. so some encouraging signs.

thank you. our next question comes from deane dray with rbc capital markets.your line is open.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
thank you. good morning everyone.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
good morning.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning deane.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
i'd like to circle back on price cost this quarter for patrick, some more specifics. i know the policy, the practice is to lock in your input costs as best you can, 100% for the current quarter, but you said you did have to go into the spot market. was that strictly a function of increased demand above expectations? or were there any supplier issues in, let's say, steel or copper?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i would say, deane, it's really mostly driven by the much stronger demand than we expected. that is the main reason. in addition to that, of course, i would say the -- what we call tier 2 is playing a role as well. i think some of the component, the electronic components, particularly in our fire & security business, and we've seen that as well spot prices as well as some expedited trade. and so that's really the main driver.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
patrick, i'd rather hear you talk about a price increases on those -- or the cost of those components rather than supply issues. so are there any supply chain disruptions on anything electronic printed circuit boards and so forth?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
i would -- clearly, there are some issues, but i would say that they are spotty. we continue to meet customer demand. are there pockets where we are a little late in some instances? sure. but by and large, we are managing our supply chain really well, and we are managing customer demand.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
what i'd add, dean, is that i have to give our kudos to the operations team who literally are working around the clock. so we have 24/7 coverage where we have folks spanning both sides of the world managing these challenges.
they're real. they're acute. we came into the year thinking our sales will be up mid-single digits. now it's going to be up double digits. so what that means from practical terms is that you're adding 2.5 million manufacturing hours, you have to go aggressively hire talent and demand.
in places like tennessee, we're competing for talent with amazon and fedex. so our operations team is dealing with challenges every day on the supply chain labor and really doing a phenomenal job to go to great lengths to support our customers.
so i think we'll get out in front. we're doing a lot of things to make our supply chain more robust, with more automation, more dual sourcing. but it's not for the faint of heart. there's real challenges that the team is addressing every day.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
yes. that's all good to hear and then second question, abound has come up a couple times on the call. and i know it's still in a pilot program. but dave, could you take us through at a high level the economics of the platform, the percent of recurring revenues. and from the industry feedback that we've heard, the competitive advantages really has a lot to do with the open architecture and maybe you can address that as well.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
sure. thanks, dean. it's -- for us, abound is really a long game. it's saas-based, so it's all recurring revenues. it's going to be a subscription model. it will be margin accretive. but the real focus of abound is making indoor air quality visible. so we started with a commercial office building customer outside of the d.c. area.
we've had it running in a k-12 school outside of atlanta. we've gotten great feedback because as people come back to the office, as people go back into -- as people are going back into school in the spring, you can go into the school library and you have a dial that shows you that the air quality is good. and it gives you confidence as you go back into these indoor environment.
so i don't want to oversell like how many we've sold. what it is, is early phases. we've been working with the atlanta braves in truist park. we have it running in our corporate headquarters in palm beach gardens, florida.
we've had a number of customers, very high-profile customers coming through and really trying to understand it, understand how it works not only for the tenants, but for the building operator. and i think it's going to be transformative.
early phases, as you said, from a differentiation perspective. it is open architecture. it interfaces with other control systems. so it's not a proprietary that will only work with our alc controls business. and i think it's one of the key enablers to making the whole focus on healthy and sustainable buildings sticky over the long term.
deane dray -- rbc capital markets -- analyst
all good to hear. thank you.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, dean. and maybe before we take the next question, from a modeling perspective, i thought i'd add that we expect for the balance of the year and particularly q3, we expect q3 sales and adjusted eps to be very similar to our q2 performance and so that might be helpful as we do the models.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from john walsh with credit suisse. your line is open.
john walsh -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning everyone.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
john walsh -- credit suisse -- analyst
appreciate all the details as usual. i wanted to come at the kind of input cost question a little bit differently. i was just curious if your best estimate on when you kind of hit the peak pressure either for ros or supply chain availability or labor? just curious if we've already hit it or if you're expecting it in the coming next quarters?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
that is a very good question. and i think the key takeaway that we have as a management team is our need to be able to be flexible and adjust quickly, whether it's from a supply chain management point of view or what is from an ability of passing through prices to our customers to ensure that we remain price/cost neutral.
and so of course, we've seen a tremendous increase in input cost. i mentioned that for the year now, we're sitting at about $250 million of input costs. early in the year, it was several tens of millions of dollars. and so i'm not ready to call it this is it, we've seen the peak. but what i can tell you is that this is probably one of the most watched items within the company.
we're doing, as we always do. at certain times, we block in positions for commodities for next year. and so that is happening per our practice. and as i mentioned, probably the most important thing is our ability to remain nimble and to flex our supply chain and to pass through pricing. dave, any..?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. the only thing i'd add, john, is that at the end of the day, we control the controllables. so we are -- that third price increase, you saw it in resi, it's across the portfolio. there's really no part of our portfolio that has not been aggressive, not only announcing price increases, but realizing price increases.
and then on the cost side, patrick said it earlier, but it's across everything that we can control, including g&a, and we've set up this carrier business services to really have a picture of tetra model as we move stuff to low-cost centers of excellence on the g&a side.
we're being aggressive in the factories, aggressive on supply chain. look, steel is very high. so we got to keep a close eye, i mean, $600 a ton up to 2000 in the united states. so clearly, we would hope and expect that starts to modulate a bit.
and then copper has been hovering. so we've been taking some blocking positions there. i think patrick and i have become more aware of commodity pricing than we ever thought we would on a daily basis. but we're watching it, and we'll see how things continue to play out.
john walsh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. thanks and then maybe just a follow-up. it seems to suggest on the residential side. new homeowners might be using the home purchase event as a way to replace the system before it goes end of life. curious if on the commercial side, you're seeing any change in behavior from the customer. if they're proactively upgrading systems either for an esg commitment or for a wellness commitment versus kind of letting everything run to almost a failure before they replace the system?
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
yes. i think we're seeing -- and that's one of our biggest focus areas is modernizations and trying to proactively work with customers to replace systems before their end of life. and you can make a business case just on sustainability alone. if you look at the savings you can get and there are some government incentives. but as you move to more sustainable chillers then you can get very significant savings and also help customers hit their own esg targets.
our customers are no different than us that they've been very public about some form of carbon neutrality, many of them, and we're helping them not only get to their commitments, but help quantify for them how they're getting to their commitments by an early replacement of a chiller and it also ties into healthy. i think light commercial and applied customers are going to great lengths, many of them to put in more healthy solutions. so we're seeing some upselling in healthy solutions there as well.
john walsh -- credit suisse -- analyst
great. appreciate you taking the questions. thank you.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer

thank you. we are taking our last question from josh pokrzywinski with morgan stanley.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, thanks for fitting me in guys.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
hey, josh.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
good morning.
josh pokrzywinski -- morgan stanley -- analyst
good morning. so on the carrier 700, i think a couple of questions have sort of picked around the edges of this. but patrick, on the 225 kind of going to 150 using your definition of net, you spelled out the incremental price that's in guidance. i think you had $75 million of headwinds in the 225 definition, but an extra $125 million of price. so maybe on more of kind of a double secret net basis, you guys come out ahead. is there another item we're missing? or is they are on the more fully netted number, a little more positive?
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
actually, josh, it's a good question, and i recognize that sometimes it could be a little confusing. the way you can think about it is versus the prior guide carrier 700, as i mentioned, is worse by $75 million. that's mostly input cost on the material side. in addition to that, which is not part of carrier 700, we have additional plant inefficiencies, actually inefficiencies from last year from covid that we thought would get better and they're not getting better or not -- they're not getting better to the extent that we expected. that's $25 million in addition to the $75 million. and then the other part of this $25 million of higher inbound freight costs, including air freight. that gets you to $125 million offset by the $125 million in price.
and so there is no net benefit. of course, the objective is as we catch up price/cost that going forward, we're nowhere soft and it becomes a little accretive. but for this year, it is a net zero. got it. got it. that's helpful. i appreciate that detail. and then just on resi, maybe a finer point question but hard not to notice that the comp does get almost 60 points harder 2q to 3q. so any commentary you guys can give us on how july ended up, i think, would be helpful in calibrating that.
david gitlin -- chairman and chief executive officer
go ahead.
patrick goris -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
look, july has continued where june left off. so we're very well booked for 3q. i mean obviously, as you get into 3q, the orders compares, you would expect them to be down year-over-year, but you're still seeing healthy order rates if you look at versus historical levels. so right now, we feel certainly balanced in our guidance for q3.
i mean, remember, we had been saying that we thought the first half would be up 30, second half down 20. what we're now saying is that the first half was up a lot more than we thought. and the second half is probably down closer to 5% to 10% year-over-year.
so we're keeping a close eye on it. the number one thing we keep watching is movement and the movement continues to be very strong from our distributors to our dealers. so we'll keep a close eye on that, and we're working distributor by distributor to make sure that we're managing with them in a very collaborative way their inventory levels.
