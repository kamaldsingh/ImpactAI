good afternoon, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the cytokinetics second quarter 2020 conference call. [operator instructions]. at the company's request, we will open the call for "," after the presentation.
i would now like to turn the call over to diane weiser, cytokinetics senior vice president of corporate communications and investor relations. please go ahead.
diane weiser -- senior vice president of corporate communications and investor relations
good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on the call today. robert blum, our president and chief executive officer, will kick off the call with an overview of the quarter and our recent progress. then fady malik, our evp of research and development, will provide updates on key developments for omecamtiv mecarbil, our cardiac myosin activator being developed under our collaboration with amgen, and the expanded and accelerated development plan for ck-274, our next in class cardiac myosin inhibitor. next, stuart kupfer, our svp and chief medical officer will update on recent progress with ck-274 and redwood hcm as well as ck-274, our additional cardiac myosin inhibitor.
then robert wong, our vp and chief accounting officer will provide an overview of the quarter; and ching jaw, our svp and chief financial officer, will discuss our updated financial guidance in the context of recent corporate development activities before robert blum provides concluding thoughts on the company's outlook and expected key milestones for the remainder of the year.
please note that portions of the following discussion, including our responses to questions, contain statements that relate to future events and performance rather than historical facts and constitute forward-looking statements. our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. additional information concerning factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in our sec filings. we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after this call.
and now, i will turn the call over to robert.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, diane, and thanks again to everyone for joining us on the call today. it was a productive second quarter, and the momentum continues into this third quarter. many of you have had the opportunity to participate in calls relating to our licensing collaboration and royalty monetization transactions, followed by our investor and analyst day event last month. we shared a lot of information on those calls just a few weeks ago, so we'll try not to be too repetitive today. there's no doubt that this is truly a transformative time in our company's maturation, and i couldn't be more proud of the high level of strategic execution demonstrated by our leadership team.
the combination of licensing, royalty monetization and equity capital market deals we transacted fortifies our expected cash balance sheet at year-end to over $500 million and ensures our strong financial position as we approach top line results of galactic-hf, one of the largest phase iii global cardiovascular outcomes trials in heart failure, which is being conducted by amgen under our long-standing collaboration. these deals considered alongside our previously announced renegotiation of our astellas agreement enables us to continue readiness and implementation activities related to the potential commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil as well as concurrently planned for the advancement of ck-274 and reldesemtiv, all within the context of our vision 2025.
in addition to having the opportunity to co-commercialize omecamtiv mecarbil in partnership with amgen, these recent deals enable us to continue to control the development of ck-274 and reldesemtiv to an expanded set of pivotal clinical trials while retaining full rights in north america, europe and japan for our shareholders. it's particularly gratifying when our r&d strategies can synchronize with and enable the corporate development and business development strategy. cytokinetics continues to leverage our innovative science through partnerships to maximize opportunities across the breadth and depth of our pipeline of investigational medicines focused to muscle biology.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to fady to elaborate on key developments for omecamtiv mecarbil and ck-274.
fady i. malik -- chief accounting officer of research and development
thanks, robert. we and amgen made significant progress during the quarter despite the coronavirus pandemic. as we previously explained, we are in a fortunate position with the conduct of galactic-hf, given how advanced we are in the trial conduct. amgen adapted the conduct of the trial to enable delivery of investigational product to patients home and the conduct of study visits and to conduct study visits remotely for collection of study endpoint. as a reminder, none of the trial's main endpoints, including heart failure events, tv death or collection of the kansas city of cardiomyopathy questionnaire at week 24 are dependent on patients physically visiting clinical trial sites. now as we approach the completion of the trial, amgen in collaboration with cytokinetics continues to work steadfastly on trial closeout activities.
the trial remains blinded as final events continue to accrue and we head toward final data collection and database lock. we expect to soon accrue the final event to close out galactic-hf in q3, and we remain on track to report top line results of galactic-hf in q4. regarding meteoric-hf, the second phase iii trial of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure, i'm pleased to say that despite the suspension of enrollment earlier in the quarter due to the coronavirus pandemic, we resumed screening and enrollment in june into partnership and in partnership with our clinical trial sites. out of the nine countries participating in meteoric-hf, four are actively recruiting, and we expect the remaining five to come online later in the third quarter.
we now have approximately 75% of our targeted 92 sites activated in the united states, canada, france, germany, italy, hungary and the netherlands. recruiting is resumed, and we're very grateful to our clinical trial site personnel for their collaboration to ensure the health and safety of trial participants through the conduct of this trial. as we have stated, results from meteoric-hf are not on the critical path to submitting regulatory filings for the potential approval of omecamtiv mecarbil. and instead, if the findings for meteoric-hf are supportive, it would be included in a supplemental filing following the potential commercial launch predicated on expected results from galactic-hf. we now expect to complete enrollment of meteoric-hf in early 2021.
given the growing health economic certain of heart failure worldwide, we remain enthusiastic about the promise of omecamtiv mecarbil. the novel mechanism of action of our potential medicine works in an entirely different way from currently available therapies and has the potential to become foundational to standard of care. of note, during the quarter, the fda granted fast track designation to omecamtiv mecarbil, which may potentially lead to an expedited review. we also collaborated with amgen and servier of preparations for a potential marketing application dossier for omecamtiv mecarbil and prepared for possible meaning of regulatory authorities as may be requested to discuss phase iii trial results and potential marketing applications.
turning now to our cardiac myosin inhibitor program. it's an exciting time as we expand and accelerate this development program. as robert mentioned, regarding the licensing collaboration and royalty monetization deals with sishen, pharmaceuticals and rtw investments, they enable us to develop ck-274, in multiple indications in parallel as well as across a wider span of geographies. in terms of specifics regarding the development program associated with ck-274, these deals provide support to conduct a planned phase iii clinical trial of our next in-class myosin inhibitor in patients with obstructive hcm in north america, europe and with our partner in china, promptly after we have results from redwood hcm and receive feedback from regulatory authorities.
our current goal is to initiate a phase iii registration program for ck-274 and obstructive hcm in late 2021, and we are working with our new partner, duchenne to enable concurrent development in china. in parallel, we're planning for the conduct of clinical trials of ck-274 in nonobstructive hcf, hcm and in a subgroup of heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction, or hfref also in the 2021 or 2022 time frame. to sum up, the deals in july reinforce our commitment to rapidly and broadly advance our cardiac myosin inhibitor program with the intent to potentially deliver the next in class medicine that can meaningfully impact the underlying challenges of patients suffering from hypertrophic cardiomyopathies and hfpef to the hypercontractility of cardiac muscle.
now i'm going to turn it over to stuart to provide an update on redwood-hcm as well as our plans for phase i study of ck-271, our second cardiac myosin inhibitor.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president and chief medical officer
thank you, fady. i'm pleased to report that following the brief suspension in enrollment due to the coronavirus pandemic during the second quarter, we resumed screening and patient enrollment in redwood-hcm in collaboration with our cro and clinical trial site partners. as you know, redwood-hcm is the phase ii clinical trial of ck-274 in obstructive hcm. we activated many sites in the second quarter and expect to have approximately 25 of the 27 total sites activated and enrolling patients in the u.s. and europe by the end of q3.
screening and enrollment have increased recently, and we're glad that the ongoing preparatory work that went on behind the scenes during the brief trial suspension is paying off. while the trial was not enrolling, sites were still being activated, patients were identified and screening visits were scheduled through coordination between our cros and the sites. we're now seeing new centers enrolling patients and some sites have multiple patients in their screening queue. we plan to enroll 18 patients in the first cohort and we expect to have data to inform progression to cohort two by the end of this year.
during the quarter, we and others were pleased to see results of explorer, a phase iii clinical trial read out positively which provides encouraging validation for the mechanism of cardiac myosin inhibition in patients with obstructive hcm and affords optimism for an impactful new potential therapy for these patients. as good students of clinical development, we have an opportunity to apply lessons from explorer to our clinical development program and further advance the field as we progressed ck-274, and obstructive and nonobstructive hcm as well as in a subgroup of hfpef patients with hypercontractility of cardiac muscle.
given the potential advantages of ck-274 as a next in-class therapy, we have an opportunity to improve upon the safety and efficacy profile observed in explorer. moving to our additional cardiac myosin inhibitor, ck-271, following the recent setback due to a resurgence of coronavirus cases in the vicinity of our phase i site, we now plan to begin screening in the first cohort during this quarter. as a reminder, the primary objective of this first-in-human phase i study is to assess the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single ascending oral doses of ck-271 in healthy adult subjects.
finally, cytokinetics was pleased to support the patient-focused drug development meeting for hcm patients hosted by the ate cna. this important meeting shed light on the extraordinary burden of disease and the challenges patients endure on a daily basis. there is no doubt the unmet need for new therapies to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is great, and we applaud the hdna for bringing this issue to the forefront.
and with that, i'll turn it over to robert wong, who will provide an update on our financials.
robert c. wong -- vice president and chief accounting officer
thanks, stuart. i'll first provide an update on cash, revenue and spending, and then ching will review our progress toward corporate development strategies. more details on our actual results for the second quarter are included in the press release which was released earlier this afternoon. we ended the second quarter with approximately $213 million in cash and investments. our revenues in q2 2020 came from our strategic alliances with amgen and astellas.
for amgen, we recognized revenue associated with their reimbursement of our development expenses related to meteoric-hf. for astellas, we recognize revenue for their reimbursement of expenses related to our scientists engaged in collaborative research. our second quarter 2020 r&d expenses decreased to $21.8 million from $24.0 million in the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower spending related to our neuromuscular development activities with the completion of fortitude-als in 2019 offset by increased activities related to redwood-hcm in 2020.
more than 50% of our r&d expenses were attributable to our cardiovascular programs as expected given activity for meteoric-hf and the cardiac myosin inhibitor program, and the remainder of our expenses were attributable primarily to our early research activities. our second quarter 2020 g&a expenses were $14.2 million, up from $9.8 million in q2 2019 due primarily to higher personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and higher outside services for pre-commercial activity.
and now ching will review progress in connection with corporate development strategy.
ching w. jaw -- senior vice president chief financial officer
thanks, robert. as we have discussed, we have been working with our management team and our board over the past year to ensure that our financial position is solid as we transition the company into a fully integrated biopharmaceutical organization. with our recent business development, royalty monetization and equity offering transactions we are well positioned financially to operationalize the fund to operationalize and fund near-term to midterm projects and initiatives.
to recap our cash position, we ended the second quarter with $213 million cash and will add $160 million of additional capital upon closing of the modernization of mavacamten royalty, plus $90 million in additional capital available at our option from the rtw transaction. in addition, we raised approximately $190 million through our recent equity offering, net of expenses. we expect to end 2020 with more than $500 million in cash plus committed cash subject to closing conditions. the company also updated financial guidance for 2020. we still anticipate cash revenue will be in the range of $18 million to $22 million and operating expenses will be in the range of $120 million to $130 million.
however, we have narrowed our range for projected full year net cash utilization to be $110 million to $115 million. while we will not give formal guidance for 2021 until our q4 earnings call, we expect to end this year with more than $500 million on the balance sheet, which we anticipate will represent more than three years of forward cash, even as we expand the development program for ck-274 alongside plans to co-promote omecamtiv mecarbil with amgen.
if results of galactic-hf are positive in q4, we can anticipate milestone payments over the next 12 to 18 months. plus upon its commercialization, royalties on tier worldwide sales of omecamtiv mecarbil outside japan that might exceed 20% with a lower royalty rate in japan. the recent transactions we completed further enable us to leverage our partnership with amgen to build our commercial business. and in parallel, we have the capital to expand our biopharmaceutical research platform with the goal of doubling the size of our development pipeline over the next five years, as we have outlined in our vision 2025.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to robert blum.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ching. it was indeed a productive quarter, and we continue to build momentum into the second half of this year. to pick up on ching's earlier comments regarding the potential commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil, amgen and cytokinetics expect to leverage the strengths of both companies to educate the heart failure community about potential clinical effects and the economics of omecamtiv mecarbil and how it may be positioned in the continuum of care. through our co-promotion with amgen, we expect to conduct a coordinated field deployment strategy leveraging a reach and frequency approach in institutional accounts in north america.
toward that end, we recently conducted analyses relating to the united states heart failure institutional care market segment including potential target account assessment and prioritization for our planned commercialization. we also continue to conduct commercial readiness activities in collaboration with amgen in preparation for the commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil, including market research related to product branding elements, potential positioning, physician preferences and potential customer accounts.
and finally, we continued our collaboration with providers and healthcare systems to generate health economics and outcomes research related to the healthcare costs associated with the treatment of heart failure patients. regarding heart failure education, as we discussed at our recent investor and analyst day, we initiated a disease state education program to educate the heart failure community on the unmet needs of heart failure patients and explain how contractility drives cardiac performance in hfref. and importantly, the commercial operations we're building to support omecamtiv mecarbil funded largely by mgen can be leveraged to commercialize ck-274, if successful in north america and europe.
and furthermore, our recent transactions with rtw and [indecipherable] pharmaceuticals accelerate our development programs and expand our geographic reach, while preserving opportunities for further leverage through potential additional partnerships. finally, in the second quarter, on the neuromuscular front, we continue to prepare for the potential advancement of reldesemtiv to a phase iii clinical trial in patients with als, and we engage with clinical experts and patient advocates and help technology assessment organizations to secure feedback on endpoints and other matters relating to the design of the trial.
we also received advice from ema through protocol assistance for the phase iii trial. and also during the quarter, we announced a continuation of our long-standing partnership with the als association in the fight against als. again, further evidence of our steadfast commitment for this courageous and inspiring patient population. in summary, cytokinetics is well positioned to continue to execute against our vision 2025, as we look forward to what we believe is a transformative time in the company's maturation, leading into the end of this year and our expected results in galactic-hf in q4. now let me recap our expected milestones for 2020.
for omecamtiv mecarbil, we expect top line results from galactic-hf in the fourth quarter, and we expect enrollment in meteoric-hf in patients with heart failure to be completed in early 2021. for amg 594, the phase i study of amg 594 is now complete with data analyses ongoing. amgen and cytokinetics are discussing next steps in the development program. for ck-274, we expect to complete enrollment in the first cohort of redwood-hcm and to have data to inform progression of the trial to the second cohort by the end of 2020.
for ck-271, we expect to initiate a phase i study in q3 2020. for reldesemtiv, we expect to continue to prepare for a potential phase iii clinical trial and registration program in patients with als. and for our ongoing research, we expect to continue research activities directed to the cardiac and skeletal sarcomere and our other muscle biology research programs, and we expect to continue research in collaboration with astellas directed to the discovery of next-generation skeletal sarcomere muscle activators through 2020.
and operator, with that, we can now open up the call please to questions.
 :
operator
[operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of dane leone with raymond james.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
hi. questions. so maybe starting with me, we've gotten questions from the investment community post the deal on 274. just trying to think strategically from your point of view, as you advance 271, how you would manage two assets with similar moa in the clinic at the same time and how they might differentiate on indication if you've thought that far ahead? and then the second one for me would just be anything you can give us for setting the table on the redwood-hcm readout for cohort one by the end of the year. and how you think about the key data points that you'll be looking at that you would want investors to focus on as well?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll start and then turn it over to fady, and maybe fady will turn it over to stuart. we've got two questions there. one, with regard to 271. so as has been our history at cytokinetics, and you're just getting to know us a bit, but we've always been advancing lead compounds, backups, follow-ons and diversify both chemical and pharmacokinetic space for mechanism of action that we look to bring through clinical research. that's why we call it clinical research because, obviously, there's opportunity to expand and diversify.
with regard to ck-274, we're committed to, as you've heard, obstructive and non-obstructive as well as we're considering pep and as far as ck 271 is concerned, it really depends on the profile. things will learn about ck-274, but also ck-271 that may enable us to consider a broader development program. we're also advancing other compounds from the same program, different mechanisms, different properties, such that we might expect to see other compounds enter the clinic. so i'll let that be enough for me and maybe ask fady to elaborate and also answer your second question relating to what data we'll look at redwood in order to inform the second cohort.
fady i. malik -- chief accounting officer of research and development
i think you covered the first question, robert. 271, i think that's the data come out of its phase i trial. and as we start to see more data on 274, we'll begin to form strategy with those two compounds. with regard to redwood-hcm, maybe i'll turn it over to stuart, who's been very closely seeing overseeing the progress of that study and to discuss what our strategy will be toward the end of the year in terms of data and next steps.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president and chief medical officer
thank you, fady. so as we mentioned, we plan to have results of cohort one by the end of the year. the main objective of this study is really safety and tolerability. so we'll be primarily focused on those safety endpoints. but strategically, we're very very much focused on this individualized dosing strategy that we've incorporated into the study design. because there will be quite a spectrum of disease severity in the population we're enrolling. so we anticipate depending on patient's individual pathophysiology or severity that the doses may vary and depending on the individual patient.
but in terms of pharmacodynamic endpoints, we'll be looking at improvement of the left ventricular outflow tract gradient that in this patient population contributes quite substantially to heart failure symptoms and poor cardiac function as well as looking at signs and symptoms, other pharmacodynamic endpoints like nt pro b&p. so the totality of the data from the study then will give us a readout on the range of doses we're studying in cohort one. and then those data will inform progression to a higher dose range that we're planning in cohort two.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
great. just one clarification on my first question, sorry. i think investors are just trying to understand whether there was anything preclusive legally within the rtw agreement from 271 being developed in the same indications. sorry, i would just want to clarify that.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sorry, there's nothing in our agreement that includes our ability to develop ck-271 as we see fit. so we have no intention right now right now, ck-271 still needs to be characterized in phase i as does ck-274 in phase ii. so our goal is to be advancing multiple compounds forward as i mentioned, and we'll learn about these compounds physiochemical properties and otherwise, in order to ensure that we can lead in this space across different types of indications, different types of subtypes of patients, etc. so to your question, no, there's nothing that precludes us.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
excellent. thank you so much.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from the line of jeff hung with morgan stanley.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, thanks for hey, thanks for taking the questions. you indicated that amg 594 phase i is complete. when might one month data from it? and are you likely to move forward in only one indication? or is it likely that you'll proceed in parallel with multiple indications like ck-274? and then i have a follow-up.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
yes, very good question. so we're right now in the process of receiving and evaluating and analyzing those data, and that's a process that is really just at its beginnings. as far as phase ii indications are concerned, we're thinking broadly here. we've been undergoing an exercise that includes market research and working with key opinion leaders, clinical assessments, clinical trial design, endpoint evaluation all sorts of things that might inform a broad development program that could be encompassing of many different indications, recognizing that as a cardiac muscle activator, there are many different directions we could go, both that address large market opportunities as well as what might otherwise be referred to as more specialized care segments. so we're thinking about that with amgen in a way that we'll probably have more to say about all this later in the year. but in the meantime, it's still at the paper and pencil exercise level.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
and so when you said later this year, is that when we might see aspects of the phase i data? or
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i suspect that as we'll make certain decisions, we'll be in a position to share data that could be supportive of those decisions.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. great. and then as a follow-on to the previous question, i recognize you still need to characterize ck-271 in humans. so maybe if you can talk about the differences in the profile from the preclinical data between ck-271 and ck-274?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
adi, do you want to take that?
diane weiser -- senior vice president of corporate communications and investor relations
i can take that. yes, i mean, preclinically, ck-274 and 271 have similar mechanisms of action, primarily there are differences a little bit in terms of the steepness of the exposure response relationship between two molecules and also their pharmacokinetics are a bit different preclinically as well, which is the reason that we advanced it and to get a little diversity of pk and pk/pd in the clinic and use that to inform advancement of our this mechanism of action in patients as well as provide the opportunity to split indications or other things that you might think about.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks, sir.
operator
our next question comes from the line of jason butler with jmp securities.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
looks like we might have lost, jason, maybe he can go back in the queue, and we can go to the next one.
operator
your next question comes from the line of charles duncan with cantor.
charles duncan -- cantor -- analyst
hi, robert and team covid be darned. you guys have made a lot of progress. congratulations. i had a quick question on omecamtiv timing and then on strategy. first of all, regarding omecamtiv timing, fady did a great job laying out kind of what to expect. but i'm kind of wondering in terms of assuming success in galactic, when would you anticipate being able to file an nda? is all the cmc done? would you anticipate being able to conduct a meeting, a pre-nda meeting with the agency before, say, mid-first quarter of next year?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
adi, i'll turn that over to you, and i'll elaborate afterwards.
fady i. malik -- chief accounting officer of research and development
sure. charles, i think i can say that amgen and cytokinetics have been preparing very aggressively for in the past couple of years for a potential nda filing. so everything has been accelerated to shorten the time as much as possible between trial results and the filing of an nda. so i think you would see a the results are supportive and the path forward clear. i think you would see us moving forward to an nda filing quite early quite rapidly. there isn't really anything i would say that is other than the results that needs to be in our hands in order to progress and nda filing.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
yes. and just maybe to elaborate a little bit these work streams, to fady's point, have been going on for quite a while, and both companies working diligently on preparing study reports and ensuring that they all get quality controlled. it's not just for what would be the u.s. filing, but also outside the u.s. and i think this is a credit to the collaboration that we've been engaging very proactively in these work streams, recognizing we do want to move swiftly to enable potential approvals. the drug has a fast track designation, as you know, and that could be enabling of a faster review time as well. so all these things are aligned with expectations that we need to be in a position to be ready to co-commercialize as soon as possible in 2021.
charles duncan -- cantor -- analyst
okay. and that's very helpful. and then quick question on strategy in asia. i know you updated the partnership a couple of years ago to include japan. but i can't recall what is the plan for other asian countries, such as china. can you provide color?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so the collaboration we have with amgen is a worldwide collaboration includes china. it previously excluded japan. but as you mentioned, in 2013, it was expanded to include japan. so now it is truly worldwide. and not just between amgen and cytokinetics, but with our consent, amgen also provided a sublicense to servier in europe and other commonwealth independent states to be enabling of what will be the muscle pardon the pun of servier in order to be a commercial partner in areas where they have specific expertise.
our role in co-commercialization is a global role. it's a worldwide role. it spans all countries, and that's under the commercialization oversight of a joint commercialization committee, our co-promotion role is a north american role and where we will have sales and marketing people focused will be in north america, our royalty is earned on worldwide sales. i hope that helps.
charles duncan -- cantor -- analyst
okay. it does. i like to pin last question for ching. ching, you were laying out cash position at the end of this year. and i'm not sure if you misspoke or i misheard, more likely the latter that at the end of 2021, you may also end the year with $500 million, and i'm assuming that includes some assumption about milestones and perhaps even royalties. is that was that the case? or did i miss here?
ching w. jaw -- senior vice president chief financial officer
no, charles. but what i heard what i said was we will end 2020 was more than $500 million. i didn't say anything about 2021.
charles duncan -- cantor -- analyst
okay. that's clear. but you did mention milestones and potentially royalties in the next 12 to 18 months, correct?
ching w. jaw -- senior vice president chief financial officer
yes. that is correct. and that's associated with omecamtiv mecarbil. if galactic were to be positive.
charles duncan -- cantor -- analyst
got it. thanks for the clarification.
ching w. jaw -- senior vice president chief financial officer
thank you, charles.
operator
our next question comes from the line of joseph pantginis with h.c. wainwright.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
hello, joe.
joseph pantginis -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
hello, guys, this is emanuela calling for joan gene. i have a couple. i was wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the results of the analysis you are the marketing analysis you are performing and there commercialization activities and with like, i guess, i'm trying to understand within the heart failure population, which segment of patients, you are targeting first and who is going to get the who is going to get to accounting first.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so there'll be a time when we can be more specific and elaborate on this. but in a general sense, what i can say is the following: that we're looking at where cytokinetics a company with more limited access to capital and resources can put forward a commercial organization that can be highly effective to drive the business and in institutional care segments where there is high-volume heart failure. and some of these are accounts that might be unique to cytokinetics, some of them might be ones that are shared with amgen, but we're looking at this from a strategic standpoint, where do we think we can be most impactful for the opportunity in terms of education awareness and pull-through and where might they also provide advantages and pay dividends down the road for us in connection with our interest with regard to ck-274.
where similarly, it's a concentrated customer care segment where there's high overlap with heart failure high-volume centers and where these centers of excellence will be treating a majority of the hcm patients. so we're looking at that nexus, if you will, between heart failure and hcm in order to drive our strategy, albeit recognizing that there's still work to be done between us and amgen to align and agree on next steps with regard to our copromotion, and that's something that we're discussing with amgen with the goal of having more granularity and clarity on all of this by the end of this year.
joseph pantginis -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
got it. and regarding speaking of amgen, i saw on clinicalcarrier.gov that amgen has opened a post-trial access study. where the country's access will be provided to patients who participated in galactic-hf. metal is not active yet. but i was wondering if this is a follow-up like a kind of a longer-term follow-up trial like i was wondering what you're trying to achieve with the longer.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
yes so this is a strategy that i'll ask fady to speak to and elaborate on, obviously, this is something that is dependent on results from galactic as those will be known in the fourth quarter?
fady i. malik -- chief accounting officer of research and development
yes. yes. there are certain countries in the world where post-trial access is mandatory for patients that are enrolled in clinical trials in those jurisdictions. and so we have a post-trial access program that is being put in place to roll those patients into it after they completed galactic and if the results are supportive of continued dosing. it's not necessarily intended to be a worldwide study across every single country, but will be confirmative those countries where it's a requirement.
joseph pantginis -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
operator
our next question comes from the line of ted panta with piper sandler.
ted panta -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thank you very much. sorry about the noise in the background. thanks ching for the update on cardio. i'm going to ask about resentis and just see if we can have any update there or what the latest is with seeking with astellas.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
was on mute. so it's a very good question. and as we've been consistent across different communications, it is the case that we continue to prepare for a potential phase iii trial and as we mentioned, a lot of activities during the second quarter in recognition of that. i'm very pleased with the feedback we're getting from both fda and ema, which is very aligned with the trial design and endpoints that we have in mind we circled with htas in europe in order to get a sense of how they value these endpoints in accordance with a potential trial, all these things are pointing to the fact that where we to do a trial, it would be received well by the als community, and it's one that from a practicality standpoint, design, time line and budget, we have our arms around.
but recognizing that we haven't committed to do the trial yet as we've indicated, that's going to be awaiting seeing the galactic results in order to really understand what's our runway, what's our cost of capital, what's our ability to finish what we start. and that continues to be a trial that we would like to do if we can and recognizing all things considered, but one that we have not yet committed to.
ted panta -- piper sandler -- analyst
i can appreciate that. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. your next question comes from salim syed with mizuho.
dennis bing -- mizuho -- analyst
hi.this is dennis bing on for salim. congrats on all the progress. i have two questions, if i may. the first question is on galactic. so around half the galactic patients have a history of ischemia. and i guess the heart presumably should have less functional tissue. and like even after revas, i feel like it should have less functional tissue. so i guess what data have you seen that gives you the confidence you'll be able to show the same clinical benefit in this group? and then my second question is on hcm specifically. how are you thinking about the opportunity in europe/how does the ema think about the phase iii endpoints? and is something like peak vo2, like at the right endpoint?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i think i'll ask fady to answer both of those, please.
fady i. malik -- chief accounting officer of research and development
sure. the with regards to the first question, the data that support and effecting both ischemic and come from in from cosmic, where you look effective omecamtiv mecarbil in those patient subgroups. and what you essentially saw were very similar effects on the measures of improvements in cardiac function, the changes in volumes, changes in nt-probnp.
while there are fewer muscle cells potentially in patients that have ischemic cardiomyopathy, just you have to recall, there is generally still lots of viable myocardium, myocardium that is left percher and gets bigger. and so they can still augment their function in response to drug like omecamtiv mecarbil. and we've seen that also in earlier trials, specific cosmic. so i think there is the rationale to expect benefit in both types of subgroups. can you repeat your second question, please?
dennis bing -- mizuho -- analyst
yes, sure. i guess the hcm opportunity in europe, like how are you thinking about it in terms of phase iii? how does the ema think about phase iii endpoints is something like pdb two like a proper endpoint?
fady i. malik -- chief accounting officer of research and development
it's a good question. and i think from it's still a bit early for us to comment on what ema may think about endpoints in phase iii. we're planning we have engaged them initially, and we plan to engage them more deeply in the coming months. we plan for phase iii that would be conducted both in europe and the u.s. there's clearly a guidance that comes out of your functional improvements in patients with heart failure or atm or certainly approvable end points and it's maybe a question of how you define function or simple. and right now, i think we're still in the phase of learning what their vision or what their opinions on that are.
dennis bing -- mizuho -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] thank you. next question comes from the line of chad messer with needham.
chad messer -- needham -- analyst
thank you, ed. hi, thanks for taking my question.congratulations on all the recent progress. i mean, given the time and effort it took to get here, i would already have been static just to be on a call one quarter away from omecamtiv data, but have you guys so well positioned with the rest of the pipeline going into that is truly fantastic.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
known us for a very hlong time, chad, so it's gratifying. i know to be able to share this with you and looking forward to the results later in the year to be sure.
chad messer -- needham -- analyst
likewise, maybe a bigger picture question on your vision 2025. part of that is to not kind of stop at the programs you've been talking about today, but keep going and having 10 drugs in development by then, which given how prolific your drug discovery engine has been, it's aggressive but certainly feasible. and i know in your corporate deck, you kind of talk about branching out away from your focus on contractility to muscle energy and metabolism. we learned a couple of weeks ago that you've been working on inhibitors of skeletal protein pericytes, all the [indecipherable] stuff. can you maybe speak broadly to some of these areas? and what kinds of conditions you can address by going after new biology?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
it's a very good question. and i'll start but better for you to hear from fady on this. we've taken an approach, and you've known us for a long time in this way where we never wanted to be a company that was going to pivot on new product one indication. and it's taken us a very long time, obviously, to get to where we are now. but at the same time, we're enabled both financially and operationally and with a pipeline to be able to build, we hope, a very sustainable and durable business that grows with the science and continues to innovate and bring forward new medicines.
with that said, it's important to be self aware and to understand where we think we can have a competitive advantage and be leaders. and that's where we've pioneered and continue to lead in the area of contractility of muscle, which by itself has afforded us a very broad pipeline, which could go well beyond even the indications we've been speaking about for the compounds that are in clinical trials, reldesemtiv by itself could be a pipeline in and of itself. and to this point, we've really been focused to, as you know, als and possibly sma but we also want to make sure that we're constantly listening to the marketplace as well as patients, and that's where we think we've established a leadership position as it relates to the biomechanics of muscle that extends also to how muscle is a pivot point in energetics growth and metabolism and other indications, but still should remain within our cardiovascular and neuromuscular vertical.
so we're going to continue to invest in pipeline, cardiovascular and neuromuscular. and as we spun out, as you saw, another company recently based on things we discovered, those are going to be more tangential and more going to be monetized in other ways in order to be enabling of our leadership in these verticals. now with that said, we have to be thinking biologically as well as from the marketplace, and that's where fady and his colleagues have put together a very good road map as we move beyond the contractility of muscle to include mitochondrial biology, maybe he can speak to some of those thoughts and ideas as we are thinking about where we go from five products in development to as many as 10 development programs by 2025.
fady i. malik -- chief accounting officer of research and development
thanks, robert. chad, it's a very good question. and as robert said, we've been leveraging the biology of the sarcomere for nearly 20 years now and have developed a pipeline of activators of cardiac muscle, inhibitors of cardiac muscle activators of skeletal muscle and the that pipeline is maturing in the clinic. there are certainly other opportunities within the sarcomere, and we'll continue to take advantage of our leading expertise in that muscle structure.
but we have a lot of programs in that area now. and as we're thinking of how can we move to another important feature of muscle, which is how does muscle generate energy and your muscle is chock-full of mytochondria, critical for heart health and skeletal muscle health. obviously, mitochondria not muscle specific, but there's certainly muscle specific applications of mitochondrial biology, and we're going to we've already been doing this for a while. we'll begin to so begin to see some programs emerge from that space in the coming years.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
and chad, just one other point to mention is that we'll continue with what has been the hallmark of our productivity to look for those kinds of measures that we can observe preclinically and through the clinic pharmacodynamic leg that can read on function and because we believe that's important to inform what ultimately will matter to patients. as we think about function and performance, quality of life and health span this is where our muscle activators, our muscle inhibitors, these drug candidates read on not only morbidity and mortality, but things that ultimately will define help span especially as play to an aging demographic, and that's where we see our business constantly evolving.
chad messer -- needham -- analyst
yes. no, that that's great. and it's really good to see you guys thinking so strategically and being in such a good position to sort of plan ahead for many years of progress. by the way, it's hauntingly familiar this idea of spinning preclinical compounds into a new company that you incubate in exchange for equity and royalties? i have the sneaking suspicion, this is this is something that could work out for you.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
well, thank you for noticing, but it does play into our corporate development strategy that there are things that we should be doing and things we can always be doing ourselves but that's not to say that there aren't opportunities to monetize them down the road.
chad messer -- needham -- analyst
again thank you, sir.

our next question comes from the line of jason butler with jmp securities.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
hi. or maybe no. jason, can you hear us?. it sounds like we might have lost him again.
operator
okay. and there are no further questions at this time.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
okay. well, thank you. thanks very much to everybody on the call today. thank you for your continued interest in what we're doing. and obviously, this past quarter was, i think, some of the best evidence yet of our ability to execute in alignment between our r&d strategies and our corporate development strategies from the standpoint of financial engineering and also operationalize to enable what we think will be an expansion and acceleration of our development programs, still maintaining good fiscal discipline, good cash runway and also ensuring that we can build our pipeline.
we're coming into the second half of the year with expected results from galactic-hf in the fourth quarter. obviously, we're very optimistic and hopeful as that will be further transformative for our business. we look forward to keeping you updated on that progress. and with that, operator, we can conclude the call.

operator
good afternoon, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to cytokinetics third quarter 2020 conference call. at this time, i would like to inform you that this call is being recorded and that all participants are in a listen-only mode. at the company's request, we will open the call for questions-and-answers after the presentation.
i will now turn the call over to diane weiser, cytokinetics' senior vice president of corporate communications and investor relations. please go ahead.
diane weiser -- senior vice president, corporate communications & investor relations
good afternoon and thanks for joining us on the call today. robert blum, our president and chief executive officer will kick off the call with a recap of our top line results from galactic-hf and an overview of our progress during the quarter. then fady malik, our evp of research and development will provide perspective on the top line results, what we can expect from presentations at aha and update on meteoric-hf, the second phase iii clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil.
next, stuart kupfer, our svp and chief medical officer will update on recent progress with ck-274, our cardiac myosin inhibitor, which is a subject of redwood-hcm as well as ck-271, our additional cardiac myosin inhibitor. then, robert wong, our vp and chief accounting officer will provide a financial overview for the quarter and ching jaw, our svp and chief financial officer will discuss strategic planning and our financial outlook before robert blum provides concluding thoughts on the company's path forward and expected key milestones for the remainder of the year.
please note that portions of the following discussion, including our responses to questions, contains statements that relate to future events and performance rather than historical facts and constitute forward-looking statements. our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements.
additional information concerning factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in our sec filings. we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after this call.
and now, i will turn the call over to robert.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, diane. and thanks, again, to everyone for joining us on the call today. i'll begin with our most recent news. a few weeks ago, we were pleased to announce top line results of galactic-hf which demonstrated treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil achieved the primary composite efficacy endpoint of the trial and demonstrated statistically significant effect to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death or heart failure related events compared to placebo in patients treated with standard of care and with a p-value less than 0.05.
galactic-hf is a large scale, over 8,000 patient international trial. the first phase iii trial to test this novel mechanism, and admittedly, we and amgen swung for the fences with this phase iii outcomes trial and the overall development program for omecamtiv mecarbil.
we had hopes of hitting a home run for patients with heart failure by decreasing heart failure events, reducing cardiovascular mortality, improving quality of life, and extending patient's stamina and endurance.
while results from galactic-hf may have fallen short of our most ambitious expectations by missing on the first secondary endpoint of cardiovascular death alone, we believe the result, as already communicated, put us in potential scoring position by hitting on the primary efficacy endpoint and by demonstrating balanced safety across treatment arms.
considering the novel mechanism of action of omecamtiv mecarbil and the scope and scale of galactic-hf, having enrolled patients in 35 countries both inpatients and outpatients and patients well maintained on standard of care, we believe there is a lot more to the results of this trial as will be illuminated by the presentation of the primary result at the upcoming aha scientific sessions next week.
already, galactic-hf has revealed to be a very important clinical trial for heart failure patients and the heart failure community because we now have evidence that increasing contractility can safely improve meaningfully relevant outcomes important to physicians, patients and payers. and of course, this is an important outcome for cytokinetics and our employees and shareholders. a major event for us in fact, having committed over 15 years to the clinical development of omecamtiv mecarbil, and more recently the commercial readiness for the potential launch of our first-in-class cardiac myosin activator.
we are now immersed in ongoing analysis of data from galactic-hf and discussions about potential next steps with amgen as well as with members of the academic executive committee of the trial. together, we're continuing to conduct pre-specified and supplemental analysis suggested by the top line results in preparation for the late breaking presentation to be given by dr. john teerlink at aha as well as other activities to follow. we look forward to our ability to discuss these results in more detail very soon.
following dr. teerlink's presentation at aha, cytokinetics will convene a publicly available investor and media call with dr. teerlink and others from the executive committee of the trial to review the results in the context of the high clinical unmet need for patients with heart failure as well as the growing economic burden of the disease.
recognizing we can't say too much more prior to the presentation at aha, fady will review the top line results in a moment and put them into the context of the trial design. he'll also provide an update on progress in meteoric-hf, the second phase iii clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil.
turning to our cardiac myosin inhibitor program, we continue to make progress and look forward to advancing redwood-hcm to its cohort 2 by year-end. much like in heart failure, hcm patients are in great need of novel therapies to address the underlying contractile dysfunction of their disease and we're working with urgency to progress our program on the heels of our licensing deal with ji xing pharmaceuticals and our royalty deals with rtw. stuart will provide more details on progress of this program in a moment.
and finally, during the third quarter, we continued readiness activities in preparation for the potential start of a phase iii clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with als. and to remind you, we've communicated that we would make a decision regarding potential advancement of reldesemtiv to phase iii following the review of results of galactic-hf and that decision has not been made. it's still forthcoming.
we will have more clarity on our plans following the presentation of results of galactic-hf at aha as well as upon conclusion of ongoing internal planning and budgeting and also discussions to be convened with our board later this quarter.
and with that, i'll turn the call now over to fady to elaborate on developments related to omecamtiv mecarbil.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
thanks, robert. i'd like to express my thanks to the research & development team as well as all of our colleagues at cytokinetics for their commitment to the program over these years and commend our colleagues at amgen for their conduct of galactic-hf in collaboration.
and as we announced a few weeks ago, the result of galactic-hf show that treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil achieved the primary efficacy endpoint and demonstrated a statistically significant effect to reduce risk for the composite outcome at the time to a heart failure events or cardiovascular death whichever occurred first compared to placebo in patients treated with standard of care.
heart failure event was defined as an urgent clinic visit, an emergency department visit or hospitalization for worsening heart failure, leading to treatment intensifications beyond changed oral diuretic therapy. the hazard ratio for this benefit was 0.92 with a p-value of 0.025. no reduction in the secondary endpoint of cv death was observed. adverse events, including major ischemic cardiac adverse events, were balanced between treatment arms.
additional pre-specified and supplemental subgroup analyses are ongoing and may suggest one or more populations in which the effect of the drug may be larger than in the overall population. given the size of galactic-hf, some of these subgroups are quite sizable and in of themselves are larger than many contemporary heart failure trial.
i'll remind you that we enrolled a broad and heterogeneous patient population, including patients within and outside of the hospital and patients with lower blood pressures and reduced kidney function than is customary in many trials that preceded galactic-hf. we look forward to the upcoming presentation that john teerlink will give virtually on november 13th and expect to expand ourselves on our -- in this initial presentation in the weeks and months to come.
while the opportunity for omecamtiv mecarbil in light of these top line results may be different and perhaps not as broad as we had anticipated, we believe its novel mechanism drug candidate that improves cardiac contractility may play an important and complementary role along other therapies to increase cardiac function and performance as well as to reduce heart failure hospitalizations and events. these remain a high unmet clinical and economic need, despite the availability of standard of care therapies.
we also look forward to learning about the effects of increasing cardiac contractility in patients with heart failure through the addition of omecamtiv mecarbil standard of care as being -- as is being studied in meteoric-hf, the second phase iii trial of omecamtiv mecarbil that continued during the third quarter. meteoric will provide insight into another key aspect aimed at improving the lives of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction that is exercise capacity.
exercise capacity is recognized by the fda as appropriate to demonstrate benefits and in conjunction with the efficacy and safety data we've seen thus far from galactic-hf, meteoric-hf may elaborate further on the potential benefit of omecamtiv mecarbil. during the quarter, meteoric-hf continued enrollment in north america and we saw enrollment accelerate in the eu during the summer and fall months.
all countries involved in the trial have screened patients and nearly all are randomized patients. we recently surpassed the 50% mark for the target number of randomized patients and are grateful to our participating sites for the momentum we regained after reopening the trial to enrollment following the pause earlier this year due to the covid-19 pandemic. as you all know, conditions remain unpredictable but we are optimistic that meteoric-hf will continue to enroll well over the coming months given [technical issues] implemented.
i'm pleased to share that during the quarter, the data safety and monitoring committee or dmc for meteoric-hf met to review data generated thus far and recommended the trial continue as planned with no changes to the protocol. we expect to complete enrollment of meteoric hf in the first half of 2021. we remain enthusiastic about the potential for omecamtiv mecarbil to provide new mechanism therapy to the physician's armamentarium to address the progression of heart failure. and, importantly, reduced the cycle of hospitalizations and rehospitalizations that plagued patients' lives at significant cost to hospitals and payers.
we will be considering next steps together with amgen in the coming weeks and months and continue to believe that increasing cardiac contractility with omecamtiv mecarbil may represent a novel strategy to complement standard of care therapy in managing patients still a risk despite standard of care therapy.
and now, i'll turn it over to stuart to provide an update on our cardiac myosin inhibitor program.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president, chief medical officer
thanks fady. [technical issues]
diane weiser -- senior vice president, corporate communications & investor relations
i'm sorry to interrupt, stuart. i think that we'll have fady pick up. there seems to be some major static on your line. fady?
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
alright, i'll start. so let me start with an update on redwood-hcm, the phase ii clinical trial of ck-274 in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. i'm pleased to report that in october we completed enrollment of cohort 1 in redwood-hcm. to remind you of the trial design, in a blinded manner, patients are randomized in a 2-to-1 fashion to placebo for escalating doses of ck-274. daily doses of five, ten or 15 milligrams are employed in cohort 1, with dose titration individually determined on the basis of achieving specific echocardiographic target.
overall, the treatment duration is 10 weeks and will support assessments of safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics responses. we expect the last patient to complete dosing in this fourth quarter and to inform progression to cohort 2 by the end of the year with full results available by mid-2021. we are well positioned to initiate cohort 2 with the majority of sites activated in north america and key countries in europe including spain, the netherlands, and italy.
investigators and study teams remain enthusiastic to participate in this trial to characterize the benefit risk profile of our next in class cardiac myosin inhibitor and we look forward to further engaging with them.
in terms of what you can expect from our communications when we progress to cohort 2, since the trial will still be ongoing and treatment assignments not fully un-blinded, we anticipate providing the doses selected for cohort 2 based on experience in cohort 1, and perhaps directionality on aggregate data.
ultimately the goal of redwood-hcm is to determine the optimal dosing regimen of ck-274 for a phase iii clinical trial on the basis of pharmacodynamic effects, such as reducing left ventricular outflow obstruction as well as the safety and tolerability profile of ck-274. our goal remains to initiate a phase iii registration program for ck-274 in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in late 2021.
i'm pleased to report that during the quarter, the data monitoring committee for redwood-hcm convened a meeting and after a review of the data thus far, the data monitoring committee recommended the trial continue as planned with no changes to the protocol.
also, during the quarter, we made progress with our new partners, the ji xing pharmaceuticals. we are proceeding to ready for the start of clinical development of ck-274 in china that would enable china to be part of the pivotal phase iii clinical trial. we believe that enrolling patients in -- we believe that enrolling patients from china and a potential international registration file may confer key advantages for a potential global registration program with ck-274.
in parallel, during the quarter, cytokinetics continued planning for the conduct of clinical trials of ck-274 in potentially other indications, such as non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in the subgroup heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction or hfpef. we look forward to sharing more regarding our potential plans for ck-274 in these areas in 2021.
during the quarter, we also initiated a phase i study of ck-271 our additional cardiac myosin inhibitor. as a reminder, the primary objective of this first in human phase i study is to assess the safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single ascending oral doses of ck-271 in healthy adult subjects. we're on track to complete the study during this fourth quarter.
finally, during the quarter, we're proud to provide a $1 million grant and enter a four-year partnership with the hcm registry, a global registry of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy focused on improving predictive measures of risk for complication and identifying biomarkers associated with adverse clinical outcome. the registry has been funded to date by the national heart, lung, and blood institute, part of the national institutes of health and is being conducted by the university of virginia and the university of oxford.
as an industry sponsor, cytokinetics will join the hcmr steering committee in an observational capacity. our long-term commitment to this important initiative is aligned with our dedication to outcomes research along with our own drug development in the interest of patient-centric engagement and improved health band.
and with that, i'll turn it over to robert wong, who'll provide an update on our financial, robert?
robert c. wong -- vice president, chief accounting officer
thanks fady. i'll first provide an update on cash, revenue, and spending; and then, ching will review our strategic planning and financial looking forward. more details on our actual results for the third quarter are included in the press release, which we released earlier this afternoon.
we ended the third quarter with approximately $451 million in cash and investments. this balance does not include $85 million which is expected upon the closing of our sale of a royalty on myokardia's mavacamten to rtw investment. our revenue in q3 2020 came primarily from license revenue for the rtw transaction and from our strategic alliances with amgen and astellas.
our third quarter 2020 r&d expenses increased to $24.2 million from $20.2 million in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to higher spending related activities associated with redwood-hcm as well as readiness activities for a potential phase iii trial of reldesemtiv. more than 50% of our r&d expenses were attributable to our cardiovascular program, as expected, given activity for meteoric-hf and the cardiac myosin inhibitor program. and the remainder of our expenses were attributable primarily to our early research activity.
our third quarter 2020 g&a expenses were $12.3 million, up from $9.8 million in q3 2019, due primarily to higher personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation.
and now, ching will review our strategic planning and cash runway through year-end.
ching w. jaw -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, robert. as we have shared previously, we conduct a strategic planning process every summer in preparation for a presentation to and discussion with our board in early september. for 2020, the focus of our strategic plan was on scenario planning for potential outcomes of galactic-hf. the results of galactic-hf aligns with one of the scenarios we discussed with our board and i'm pleased to share that we have an operational plan in place to move the program and the company forward.
as we, together with our partner amgen continue to analyze data, we will evolve the operational plans to ensure that we allocate the appropriate resources to support the potential plans for omecamtiv mecarbil at the right time. as we approach year-end, we remain in a strong financial position as a result of several transactions we executed this summer.
the series of licensing, royalty monetization, and equity financing deals now ensure we have ample cash runway to prepare for potential commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil to advance the development plan for ck-274 and to potentially conduct a phase iii clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with als, which is a decision that has yet to be made and will follow ongoing discussions later this quarter.
as a reminder, we executed a series of transactions with affiliates of rtw investments lp and ji xing pharmaceuticals limited related to ck-274 whereby cytokinetics will receive a combination of committed capital funding and sales proceed of up $250 million and is eligible to receive up to $200 million in milestone payments, plus royalties on future sales of ck-274 in certain asian countries. we also raised $189 million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering in july.
to recap our cash position, we ended the third quarter with $451 million in cash and now anticipate ending 2020 with more than $500 million in cash plus committed cash, subject to closing conditions of royalty monetization portion of the rtw transaction.
we believe that our cash balance then will represent at least three years of forward cash based on our 2020 spending. in addition, we have an additional $90 million available to draw upon at our option for the further development of ck-274 per the rtw transaction. as is our practice, we will provide 2021 guidance in concert with our q4 earnings in early 2021 with the goal of deploying capital prudently against executing our vision 2025 and ending the year with more than three years of forward cash.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to robert blum.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, ching. i'll end this call where i begin it, that is, we're gratified to have recently shared results from galactic-hf the first large-scale phase iii clinical trial, demonstrating that omecamtiv mecarbil reduced risk for the composite outcome of cardiovascular death or heart failure related events compared to placebo in patients treated with standard of care, and with a p-value less than 0.05.
this is indeed an important event for the heart failure community and for cytokinetics. we believe that our cardiac myosin activator has shown to increase cardiac performance and function and to reduce related clinical event in a landmark clinical trial with adverse events balanced between treatment arms. we believe it thereby has the potential to offer physicians and their patients a welcome addition to manage the clinical and economic burden of heart failure and we look forward to the sharing of additional result to the aha.
now we're discussing potential next steps with amgen. in addition, we may hold meetings with clinical experts as it could inform our further conduct of market research and health economics and outcomes research and other commercial analyses that may better inform a potential path forward. we look forward to sharing more as we know more.
you heard from fady about progress with our cardiac myosin inhibitor, so i won't repeat that. but i will say, on the neuromuscular front, as you heard today, we continued in the third quarter, certain readiness activities in preparation for our potentially starting a phase iii clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with als.
we've maintained that this decision is dependent on what scenario we find ourselves in regarding galactic-hf and what our cost of capital is at that point in time. now that we have more visibility we're discussing the path forward as a leadership team internally and with our board and with the goal of making that decision whether to proceed by year-end.
finally, during the quarter, we once again demonstrated cytokinetics' commitment to the communities we serve by renewing our partnership with cure sma to increase education, awareness, public policy and fundraising for spinal muscular atrophy as well as announcing the third annual cytokinetics communications fellowship grant program intended to support increased capacity in communications, awareness building and community engagement in heart failure hcm, als and also sma.
to summarize, we're approaching the final months of 2020 with continued focus and optimism toward our diversified pipeline, our research portfolio and our commercial prospects.
now, let me recap our expected milestones for the remainder of 2020. for omecamtiv mecarbil, we expect results from galactic-hf to be presented in a late breaking clinical trial session at aha scientific sessions in this fourth quarter next week and we expect enrollment of patients with heart failure in meteoric-hf to be completed in the first half of 2021.
for amg 594, we expect to continue discussing next steps in the development program with amgen. for ck-274, we expect to have data from cohort 1 of redwood-hcm to inform progression of this phase ii clinical trial to a second cohort by the end of 2020. for ck-271, we expect to complete the phase 1 study in the fourth quarter of this year. for reldesemtiv, we expect to continue to prepare for a potential phase iii clinical trial and registration program in patients with als.
and for our ongoing research, we expect to continue research activities directed to the cardiac and skeletal sarcomere and our other muscle biology research programs and we expect to continue research in collaboration with astellas, directed to the discovery of next-generation skeletal sarcomere muscle activators through the end of this year 2020.
and operator, with that, we can now open up the call please to questions.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from salim syed from mizuho.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello salim.

hello robert and hello fady and team. just three from me if i can; two on omecamtiv and one on ck-274, and thanks for all the color. robert, you mentioned that you're in potential scoring position for omecamtiv. so i'm just curious if you've actually met with the fda or shared the data with them and if there are any gating factors to submitting a regulatory application for approval there?
and then, just a couple for fady. fady, i know you can't speak to the data that we'll be getting at aha, but perhaps in theory, is there anything here that we can bring into the mechanism as it relates to the in-patient population, why this drug may actually work better in in-patient population versus the outpatient which would be the opposite of what we've seen in paradigm and dapa trials. and then on -- one on ck-274. can you just clarify if we'll be getting lvot gradient data on the cohort 1?
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
sure. good questions. i'll start with the first one. and no, we haven't had interactions with regulatory authorities. we and amgen have a lot of work to do around analyzing the data in order to understand a path forward. it would be premature to have any such discussions.
fady, do you want to pick off the next two?
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
yeah, i'll take the next one. with regards to your question about in-patient and outpatients, we haven't really pointed to any directionality in those two subgroups. those data will be presented at the aha. i can't really expand on them.
in regard to ck-274, we won't necessarily present quantitative data with regards to the lvot gradient, but we may -- we may discuss just some directionality there. remember, the first cohort is just starting at the lower dose is meant to tell us what the lowest starting dose would be and so obviously we're not expecting to reach maximal pharmacodynamic effects in the first group. so i think quantitative data more appropriate to wait till we've completed the study.
salim syed -- mizuho -- analyst

your next question comes from dane leone from raymond james.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello dane.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking the questions. congrats on the update. i want to -- i guess first just kind of clarify as the line was cutting out a little bit around redwood, to start. so just to make sure we're all on the same page here, the first cohort is fully enrolled and when will the last patient be have 10 weeks of follow-up. and is that why you would wait for -- before discussing or starting enrollment into cohort 2? and then, what's your projection in terms of enrollment on cohort 2. i know you're rehashing some of those but [technical issues] difficult to share some of that.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
sure. yeah, as i said, we completed enrollment in cohort 1 just at the very beginning of the quarter. so we'd expect all the patients to be through the 10 weeks before the end of the year. the second cohort, we expect should enroll much faster. we have all this -- we have many more sites activated they'll have the opportunity to pre-screen patients and get them, hopefully arrange for their visits and things. covid-19 remains a wildcard, but so far i think sites are well prepared and hopefully we'll see them continue to stay open through the winter months.
the data that inform the transition from the cohort 1 to cohort 2 won't necessarily include every single patient in cohort 1 but will include a substantial fraction of them, enough so that we can set dose for the next group.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
and dane, about the second cohort and -- we'll just say that during the time that the enrollment was interrupted, fady and his team were able to add a whole bunch of centers onto the trial such that we now can expect more centers to be enrolling patients than we need patients in each cohort. so that second cohort should enroll substantially faster than the first one, we would expect.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, thanks for that clarification. just one more on that topic. the data -- so, you will not be blinded to the data that's informing the start of the second cohort. you're just not going to kind of discuss it in granularity or -- sorry, i was trying to understand that comment in terms of what -- of how the un-blinding works between cohort 1 and then moving into cohort 2?
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
yeah, the teams will not be un-blinded to patient level data. we'll have summaries at our aggregate data so that we can look at the effect of the drug on ejection fraction, the effect of the drug on the left ventricular outflow gradient as well as adverse events as they may have occurred over the course of the trial that will help us set what doses we want to plan on for cohort 2.
the data monitoring committee will have un-blinded data, but obviously they will review those in confidence and they will validate choice of doses that the blinded analysis suggests. hopefully that helps.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
okay. yeah, sorry just a really dumb question, why does cohort 1 need to stay blinded once it completes 10 weeks of dosing?
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
so the reason it stays on blinded is because the trial, obviously, is not complete. the placebo group in cohort 1 is going to be combined with the placebo group in cohort 2 to from an integrated placebo group. so remember we're randomizing this trial in a 2-to-1 fashion. so 12 patients on ck-274, six on placebo in cohort 1; and then another 12 on active and another six on placebo in cohort 2.
combining those two groups then gives us 12 placebo patients, 12 active patients on the lower doses, 12 active patients on the higher doses. and we just think it's better trial conduct to leave it blinded to individual patient drug assignments until we've completed and un-blinded the entire study.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, so essentially the data for cohort 1 that you would discuss before year-end or around year-end would be an integrated data set of all patient's, placebo and/or active drug or were you referring to kind of high level data for actually the cohort that would be on active drug? i guess that's where i'm totally confused about?
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
yeah, i think dana, we haven't even seen the data. so i don't want to get in the details of exactly what we intend or construct in a press release. the statements that we made just point to directionality, did we see the lvot gradient start to decline? did we have patients that had to discontinue drug to -- with regards to ef below 50? things like that. i don't think we're going to get into specific numbers because we won't have un-blinded the data. we will not have the appropriate comparator which is a combined placebo group. you can't calculate the placebo-corrected change from baseline if you don't have the placebo group, for instance.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
right. but you are -- the data you're talking about would actually be for the active drug not placebo group. i'm just trying to understand whether it's mixed together in what you're saying?
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
we will -- we will be reporting the data presumably that we think are the active group. that's correct.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
okay, understood. thank you so much.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
thanks dana.

robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer

robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer

pete stavropoulos -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
well, congratulations on the galactic study and all the progress made in the quarter.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
pete stavropoulos -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
i have a couple of questions. can you discuss the patient population of meteoric and how it compares to galactic and how could the study help to differentiate ome relative to other drugs in the space.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
good question. so, meteoric is enrolling patients who are outpatients and who are not as believed to be at risk given they had not been admitted into the hospital with the diagnosis of acute heart failure within one year as the inclusion criteria for galactic required.
so these are more stable outpatients. they have to be able to perform an exercise protocol, obviously, as well. so they're perhaps not as high risk or lower risk than some of those in the galactic trial. but still, these are patients with heart failure and low ejection fraction systolic dysfunction. and what was the second question?
pete stavropoulos -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
how can it help to differentiate ome relative to other drugs in the space?
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
oh, yeah. so that's a very good question. as we approached this phase iii clinical trials program, we being cytokinetics together with amgen, we thought about ways that we could differentiate from standard of care, as well as a potential new medicines that were on the horizon. and it would be a real distinguishing feature if we had a drug that was increasing cardiac performance and function and also extending time to exercise fatigue or increasing endurance and stamina.
currently there aren't heart failure drugs that can do that and that would be a meaningful distinguishing feature for a new medicine in heart failures. so that's why we set about to do both the large outcomes trial and this trial meteoric. and we look forward to the results from meteoric next year.
pete stavropoulos -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
okay. and one more, for the galactic results, how should we think about the risk reduction observed relative to other recent studies in heart failure. and do you believe that the -- that ome could be competitive in the space.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
it's a tough question to answer. in the absence of you're seeing the full results, as you will see next week at aha. but i would caution you to think about these medicines as all directly substitutable one to another, because they're not; different mechanisms different trial designs, it's really not an apples and apples comparison. i get the fact that wall street would like to line them up, but i don't think that's so feasible given the unmet need that still exist with standard of care and that's where i think once we have presented the data next week, we can speak to your question a bit more constructively.
pete stavropoulos -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
all right, thank you. and just by some chance, do you believe covid may have impacted those numbers on the secondary endpoint on the key one.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
i don't think we have any reason to believe that right now. but of course, we're still doing additional analyses but i don't see that that's contributed to anything that we know of today.
pete stavropoulos -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
okay, thank you and congratulations again.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer

hanna, we're having a hard time hearing you. there's a lot of static on your line.

hanna -- morgan stanley -- analyst
correct, yeah. and then -- yeah.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, i think it's way too premature to talk about filings strategies or anything of that sort. let us complete the analyses, let us discuss these matters with amgen. you'll see these results in some more detail next week. and frankly, there'll be more analyses that will still follow and other activities. and i think any conversation about regulatory strategy should wait on a lot more work that needs to be done.

your next question comes from jason butler from jmp securities.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello jason.
jason butler -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking -- hey, robert. thanks for taking the questions. two quick ones. first of all, can you just remind us of your cost obligations for omecamtiv from now through to approval? and then secondly, for amg 594 just give us -- remind us of the -- what you had hoped to learn from the phase 1 study pk-pd parameters and how that's reading on what the potential pharmacological attribute to the program -- product would be and the indications therefore that you -- that could potentially read on.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
i'll ask ching to speak to the first question on cost we may be incurring with regards to omecamtiv and then maybe i'll ask fady to speak to the second one.
ching w. jaw -- senior vice president, chief financial officer
yeah so, jason, hi. i think you're referring to the conduct of the meteoric trial. according to the agreement, amgen is paying all of the out-of-pocket costs and amgen and cytokinetics each will fund 50% of the fte related cost. that's per the agreement.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
and jason, i'm sorry, could you repeat your second question?
jason butler -- jmp securities -- analyst
yeah, fady on 594, what you'd hope to learn from the phase i program, how you're thinking about the pharmacology of the compound and how that could read on potential indications?
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
yeah, i think with the phase 1 program, we want to look at the pharmacodynamic responses when increases dose and compare that to what we've seen with omecamtiv mecarbil. so are there any pharmacodynamic differences? we believe there are, given the preclinical characterization that we've made. but it takes a fairly detailed and meticulous phase 1 trial to put that all together.
so what we hope to do is understand how they may be differentiated and then whether that leads -- is a basis for continuing to advance 594 into indications that are different than where we might apply omecamtiv mecarbil.
jason butler -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay, great. thanks for taking the questions.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
sure. good talking to you jason.

your next question comes from emanuela branchetti with h.c. wainwright.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello.
emanuela branchetti -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
hi guys, and thank you for taking my question. okay, this question has already been asked, but i'd try to ask it in a different way. i know you kind of disclose obviously the data, a lot of information about the data, we are going to see at the ash, but maybe you can provide a little bit of color or try to with regards to how do you envision the path forward for omecamtiv, meaning we are going to see data possibly showing differences in different sub population of patients.
i was wondering if any of these scenarios would require additional studies to be conducted with omecamtiv. if there is adequate stability on that? and also how we should look at the relevance of meteoric in relation to the data that we are going to see at the aha?
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
so, i appreciate you're trying to ask a question a different way, but i'm not sure i'm going to be able to give you much of a different answer. it's better that we have this conversation after the results are presented and we can be more forthcoming about what the data say. but keep in mind that galactic as an 8,000 patient clinical trial and we've already published on the baseline characteristics, teaches us a lot about heart failure and where -- there still remains high unmet need and where omecamtiv mecarbil they have differential effects in different large pre-specified subgroup.
so there is a lot still to be learned, still a lot of work to do in order to understand what could be next steps and we want to do right by our commitments to amgen to have those conversations together and understand together what should be the next step. so i apologize, i don't think i can do better than that. i hope you understand and let's have these discussions again down the road.
emanuela branchetti -- h.c. wainwright & co. -- analyst
yeah, sure i understand. and just to clarify, you mentioned that you are going to have a call after the aha presentation. i'm not sure i understood correctly, is this call is going to be the same day of the aha presentation or it's going to be in the future?
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer

your next question comes from ted tenthoff with piper sandler
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello, ted.
edward tenthoff -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi guys, how are you? thanks so much for the update. it's still an exciting year, to say the least. i'm looking forward to more data next week. most of the questions have focused on the cardiovascular side, so i'll ask one from the muscle side, but can you give us a little bit more of a sense in terms of what goes into the decision whether to progress on reldesemtiv?
and the reason i ask this is, it seems to me like the primary gating factor should be whether or not with data support, then this is a drug. and if it is, then it seems to be worth pursuing. so i want to make sure i understand sort of how you guys are framing or prioritizing that decision? thank you so much.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
good questions, ted, and you're right. to be clear, as we've communicated several times, our first priority is to ready for the potential commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil. our second priority is to conduct development programs plural [phonetic] with ck-274 in order to make sure we expand upon of the opportunity there in hcm as well as other indications. and then we need to make sure that we can finish what we start, if we were to go forward with reldesemtiv.
so we spent the better part of a year analyzing the data from the phase ii study, having conversations with fda and ema, interacting with hta's in europe and payers, doing a whole bunch of market research and other things. we had to renegotiate our deal with astellas in order to be able to understand what would be their commitment in funding, and we had to discuss with academics what would be a potential phase iii trial that could serve as registration and talk to fda and ema about that.
so that takes time and all of that is important alongside of what does the phase ii data teach us about a path forward in phase iii. all of that comes together in terms of our ability to conduct an affordable trial and also make certain that it's not subtracting from the other things that we're doing and that's conversations we still need to finish internally and with our board, but we'll get there and we'll do that this quarter. and we want to understand much more our cost of capital and that's in part going to be informed by how we might proceed with regard to omecamtiv mecarbil, given what we know from galactic.
so all those things factor together. i hope you understand. the trial itself, if we were to do it is a trial that would be perhaps in the range of $35 million to $40 million as would be conducted over a couple of years. so amortized over a couple of years and we already have commented that astellas would be funding about a third of that.
so the trial would not be all that expensive relative to our current operating burn. but we still need to make sure it doesn't subtract from the other things we need to be prioritizing as well. so that hopefully is answer to your question. does that help?
edward tenthoff -- piper sandler -- analyst
very much. so, robert, thank you very much.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from graig suvannavejh average from goldman sachs. please go ahead.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello graig. graig, are you there?
graig suvannavejh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yeah, hey. so sorry about that. i'm here robert. sorry about that.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
hi graig.
graig suvannavejh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
hi, how are you? thanks so much for taking my questions and congrats on the progress that you've been making. just several questions if i could. fully realizing that we still need to see the aha data, which is coming relatively shortly. i'm curious if -- a couple of things, one is, have you had the opportunity to discuss with amgen the data or is that something that is going to happen post the presentation of the data at aha with the follow-up being in terms of being able to communicate to the market what's next, either from a regulatory perspective or from a commercial perspective, when should we expect to hear such an update. is that something that perhaps is a first half of '21 event? is it a by the end of the year event. so let me stop there with that question.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
yeah. so we have had many, many, many, many meetings with amgen, but they are been focus to the data and they are being many pre-specified analysis and going through those analyses inform other supplemental analyses that are also being generated and prioritized. so, the conversations we're having with amgen are very focused to understanding the results from galactic and everything else that you're asking about would have to come later and only can be really initiated once we have our arms around the data and a sense of how they may be viewed by the heart failure community starting with aha next week.
but then obviously there would have to be a bunch of market research and other heor and another analysis that i mentioned in my prepared remarks. so it's hard to say right now, whether that's weeks or months or whether that's this year or next year. and i would just ask that you permit us to continue those activities with our partners at amgen and we'll give you clarity once we have clarity.
graig suvannavejh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
very much appreciated. thank you very much for that. my next question is, just given at least what we've seen thus far and in terms of galactic and the results on the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints. how should -- how do you think we should be thinking about a drug with such a profile and giving both you and amgen full credit for swinging for the fences with the trial.
but given the profile that we're seeing thus far. and again, not knowing what the fuller profile will look like with aha, but without a mortality benefit. i guess my question is, how are you thinking about that commercial opportunity versus if you did have a mortality benefit?
and then second of all, have you done market research around, with payers in particular, how they view the value from a payer perspectives, what a drug like omecamtiv irrespective of whether there is a novel mechanism of action or maybe that has to be contemplated. how do you think payers think about that? i think we've heard some feedback from kols that they sometimes are getting difficulties getting reimbursement for drugs that are beyond kind of the triple kind of regimen gold standard. thanks.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
yes. so it's a good question. obviously the heart failure landscape is evolving quite rapidly and we have new medicines that are being made available, but these work by different mechanisms and they were studied in trials that are different one to another. and even with these drugs one sees that the unmet need here is quite high. you're talking about morbidity and mortality. that is higher than most cancers and for which there is a, not only major clinical unmet need, but a very, very significant economic one, incredibly costly to medicare and other payers.
so based on what we've already top lined, you can see that we have a drug that is safe. we have a potential drug here that is increasing cardiac function and performance and that addressed and reduced clinically meaningful outcomes.
now granted it did not achieve an effect on the cv death alone, but i think it's going to be important to understand which patients did benefit more which ones perhaps less. and in an 8,000 patient trial you've got ample opportunity to do that with pre-specified subgroups and that's ultimately where i think physicians and payers might consider new mechanism drugs.
you look at victoria-hf and merck and bayer are quite bullish on the prospects for vericiguat which demonstrated in victoria-hf clinically meaningful reductions in outcomes, not unlike what we've already top lined, but for outpatients with worsening outcomes and that drug is going to be reviewed with priority review by fda and has a pdufa date coming up in q1.
so things like that will inform ultimately how the armamentarium for heart failure may continue to evolve and i suspect that given the high unmet need and the high economic burden that they'll be places for these various medicines as adjacent to one another, complementary to one another.
and you're right, not all of these will be used as foundational care in all patients, but there are meaningfully important subgroups and cohorts that are not well served and that's where i would suggest, once we can share our results and do the work we need to do, that having that conversation down the road could perhaps be fruitful.
graig suvannavejh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
thank you. and if i could just squeeze in one last question, it's about redwood and you might have touched on this before, so apologies if i missed this. but in terms of what would be the bar for success. what do you think would look good in terms of the redwood data? thanks.
robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
fady, do you want to take that, what would look good with regard to the redwood data.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
i can. stuart is on the line i think maybe if you want to try and take that stuart. have you solved your audio problems? you're on mute still.
maybe i'll try that. so the -- i think what we would expect out of hopefully the first group of patients is to begin to see productions in their left ventricular outflow gradient and to see that the drug is well tolerated. that's really all you can expect from what the first dosing group of a study that's designed to have a lower dose group and higher dose group. and obviously we -- what will inform progress to phase iii and doses that we selected for final doses for phase iii will be the second cohort as well.
graig suvannavejh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
okay, thank you and congrats again.

robert i. blum -- president & chief executive officer
hey gil.
gil blum -- needham & company -- analyst
hey. sorry if -- i might repeat some questions here, i was a little late. so first off, i don't know if you guys talked about a potential subgroup analyses. is there any chances we'll see any regional assessments of galactic-hf patients because we recently saw some weird looking data from other studies where -- that you showed very different outcomes in u.s. versus ex-u.s.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
yeah, those are among the pre-specified subgroups, so those data will be presented.
gil blum -- needham & company -- analyst
excellent. and kind of a follow-on on that, do you feel that considering galactic top line, does this put more emphasis on data that's going to come out of meteoric. and how will the data coming out of meteoric influence potential further development and kind of give us an idea of how omecamtiv functions?
fady i. malik -- executive vice president, research & development
you know meteoric won't finish enrolling until the middle -- until sometime in the first half of next year and the trial alone actually complete till the end of next year. so i don't think meteoric is relevant to our deciding to move forward with the data in galactic. and i expect long before we have data from meteoric that we'll have devised and decided what to do with regards to the galactic data.

robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, diane, and thanks again to everyone for joining us on the call today. as we begin 2021, i hope you and your families are healthy and well, while we are all still in the throes of the covid-19 pandemic. despite the challenges of stay-at-home orders, clinical trial interruptions and restarts and transitioning relating to our longest-standing development and commercialization collaboration. we entered this year at the forefront of muscle biology research and with the most advanced pipeline in our company's history, a strong balance sheet and are now preparing for engagements with fda toward what may be our first potential nda filing and as may set the stage for our first-approved medicine. following the positive phase iii clinical trial results from galactic-hf, our immediate priority is to secure fda feedback in order to provide clarity for potential regulatory submission of omecamtiv mecarbil in the united states in the second half of 2021. we expect to meet with fda in the next few weeks, simultaneously, we will complete ongoing work streams focused to product, market and the sales analyses to inform development of our go-to-market strategy and commercial readiness activities in the first half of the year. as we announced at the end of 2020, worldwide development and commercialization rights to omecamtiv mecarbil and ck-136, formerly known as amg 594, are reverting to cytokinetics. while this was unexpected, we believe it affords cytokinetics freedom to operate as we chart our own commercial path forward and lay the groundwork for the cardiovascular franchise plans we unveiled last summer at our analyst and investor day.
with this in mind, we also expect to engage in business and corporate development activities this year to seek commercialization partners in asia, in europe and possibly for co-promotion in the united states. these activities are already under way as we begin our outreach campaigns and ching will elaborate on our overall corporate development approach in a moment. additionally, this year, we will continue to prioritize the development of ck-274 and our next-generation cardiac myosin inhibitor. in december, we announced that we completed an interim analysis of cohort one of redwood-hcm, our ongoing phase ii clinical trial of ck-274 in patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. that interim analysis informed progression to cohort 2, which opened to screening in december. and i'm pleased to announce today that we have now fully enrolled cohort 2, and we expect to have top line results from both cohorts by midyear 2021. as the year progresses, we'll articulate our plans to advance ck-274 potentially into phase iii in the second half of the year. stuart will provide details on the interim analysis and how we're currently thinking about the continuing development program. though our priorities in 2021 will be focused to our cardiovascular programs once we have clarity on our go-to-market strategy with omecamtiv mecarbil and progression of ck-274 to phase iii, will then consider opening courage-als to enrollment. that is our planned phase iii trial of reldesemtiv in patients with als as may further expand our late-stage pipeline. our research engine continues to be productive despite the challenges posed by the current pandemic. thanks to the dedication of our scientists, we anticipate advancing additional compounds potential development candidates emerging from research into development in the coming one to two years. we expect to leverage our leadership expertise in muscle contractility to expand into other aspects of muscle function as may extend to the potential treatment of other serious yet adjacent diseases and conditions, and we'll have more to say about that later in the year.
2021 has the potential to be a transformational year for cytokinetics as we prepare to potentially submit our first nda that could lead to the commercialization of our first medicine to treat patients with heart failure. and as we've articulated in our vision 2025, which we introduced early last year, our goal over the next five years is to achieve potential regulatory approvals for at least two drug candidates arising out of our pipeline and to drive toward sustainable product-driven revenues, while we, in parallel, double our pipeline of development programs and also plan to expand our discovery platform beyond muscle contractility. based on our strong performance in 2020 and momentum already in 2021, we believe we're well on our way.
with that, i'll turn the call over to fady to elaborate on developments related to omecamtiv mecarbil.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
thank you, robert. in november of 2020, the results of galactic-hf, our phase iii trial of omecamtiv mecarbil, were presented at the american heart association meeting and subsequently published in the new england journal of medicine. since we've reviewed these results in some detail already, i'll start with a recap of additional analyses that the executive committee chair, dr. john teerlink, presented at the global cardiovascular clinical trialist fourm, or cvct meeting, in december, and provide some perspective on the patient population and may benefit most from treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil based on these data. as you'll recall, the primary results from galactic-hf demonstrated a statistically significant effect of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil to reduce the risk of the primary composite end point of time to first heart failure event or cardiovascular death compared to placebo in patients treated with standard of care. while no reduction in the secondary endpoint of time that cardiovascular death was observed in the overall population, the statistically significant primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in the overall trial population, comprising over 8,000 patients, enrolled in 35 countries around the world. the effect of omecamtiv mecarbil was consistent across most prespecified subgroups with potentially greater treatment effect suggested in the over 4,000 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to the median of 28%.
the supplemental analysis of the slower ejection fraction subgroup presented at cvct showed that this potentially greater treatment effect in patients who received omecamtiv mecarbil was consistently observed in patients with characteristics that may indicate more advanced heart failure status such as being hospitalized within the last three months, having new york heart association class iii or iv heart failure, having higher nt-probnp levels or having lower blood pressures. and when you look at the absolute risk reductions in these large prespecified subgroups, are quite meaningful, ranging from 5.2% to 8.1%. additionally, an analysis of the relationship between ejection fraction when it examined as a continuous variable, and the hazard ratio for the primary composite endpoint in galactic-hf suggested a potentially greater treatment effect of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with increasingly lower ejection fractions. given the primary effect of omecamtiv mecarbil to increase cardiac function, it stands to reason that patients with lower ejection fractions drive greater benefit. these results are important because they know -- we know that these sicker, more advanced heart failure patients continue to have substantially elevated risk despite receiving standard of care therapy and based on the progressive nature of the disease, they're frequently unable to tolerate guideline directed medical therapy as their disease worse. these are often the most challenging patients to treat, and they can be often hospitalized and rehospitalized. so picture is beginning to emerge that suggest that omecamtiv mecarbil may provide a new treatment option for this critical population of more severely ill heart failure patients. and biologically, it stands to reason these patients with more impaired systolic function may benefit more from this novel mechanism therapy overlaid to the standard of care.
unfortunately, these patients are not on cod and may represent more than half of the three million patients living with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction today. these patients often land in our hospitals, increasingly contributing to both a clinical and economic burden on our system. we have few treatment options available as their disease progresses despite current medical therapy. since reporting the results of galactic-hf, we've had the opportunity to engage with nearly 200 healthcare professionals, including leading heart failure opinion leaders, investigators and community cardiologists. the consensus feedback has been positive and supportive of our seeking regulatory approval based on the results of galactic-hf, the safety profile of omecamtiv mecarbil and the unmet need among the more advanced heart failure population. the last quarter also saw significant actions by the fda within the heart failure arena, and we're encouraged by the recent expansion of the label for novartis's entresto and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction as well as the recent fda approval of vericiguat, or vercuva. we believe these developments reinforce the significant unmet needs in heart failure despite the availability of guideline directed medical therapies. and we believe these developments could augur well for omecamtiv mecarbil, given its novel muscle-directed action and the results from net galactic-hf observed on top of standard of care.
as we've indicated, cytokinetics is committed to advancing omecamtiv mecarbil as a priority in 2021. and along those lines, we are now scheduled to have our first regulatory interaction with the fda before the end of this quarter. we look forward to providing updates on this and future regulatory interactions as well as to confirm our anticipated timing for a potential nda submission to fda in the second half of 2021 as we conduct these regulatory interactions and complete our ongoing transition activities with amgen. in parallel, we're continuing to conduct meteoric-hf, which is not on the critical path to nda submission, and we expect to complete enrollment in the first half of this year. finally, within our cardiac myosin activator program, we will also regain development and commercialization rights for ck-136, previously referred to as amg 594, our first-in-class cardiac troponin activator. and follow-up to amgen's phase i study, we'll be evaluating what further phase i studies may be required in order to advance this drug candidate. but as robert mentioned earlier, omecamtiv mecarbil remains our higher priority for 2021.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to stuart, who'll provide an update on our cardiac myosin inhibitor program.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president and chief medical officer
thanks, fady. at the end of last quarter, we progressed redwood-hcm to cohort 2, following a positive interim analysis. redwood-hcm was designed to evaluate the potential benefits of our next-generation cardiac myosin inhibitor, ck-274, in patients with disruptive hcm and symptomatic heart failure. to remind you of the trial design, patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to placebo or ck-274. once daily doses of 5, 10 or 15 milligrams or placebo were administered in cohort 1, with those titration individually determined, on the basis of achieving specific echocardiographic targets. dosing adjustments were made every two weeks over a 6-week period, and the overall treatment duration was 10 weeks. the interim analysis of data from cohort one showed that patients experienced substantial reductions in the average resting and less ventricular outflow tracked radiants. these clinically relevant decreases in pressured radiants were achieved with only modest decreases in average left ventricular ejection fraction. importantly, there were no dose interruptions due to ejection fractions falling below 50%, which was a prespecified safety threshold. the pharmacokinetic profile was similar to that observed in phase i in healthy subjects. in addition, the safety and tolerability data were supportive of continued dose escalation with no serious adverse events attributed to study treatment as reported by the investigators. based on the december review of interim results from cohort 1, the steering committee and the data monitor committee of redwood-hcm recommended that the trial proceed to cohort 2, and i'm pleased to announce that we've now completed enrollment in the second cohort.
patients in cohort two are being treated with escalating doses of 10, 20 or 30 milligrams or placebo once daily. we expect to report top line results from the trial midyear with full data to be presented at an upcoming medical meeting this fall. as we await results from redwood-hcm, we are already preparing for the initiation of a phase iii pivotal trial in patients with obstructive hcm, with the goal of starting this trial before year-end. we recognize the urgency to bring novel medicines to patients with hcm or whom there are no disease-modifying therapies to inhibit the underlying hypercontractility, that is the hallmark of the disease, and to improve quality of life and functional capacity. upon receipt of the phase ii results, our goal is to conduct end of phase ii meetings with fda and ema in the second half of the year to enable the start of phase iii before end of year. our objective for phase iii is to evaluate the effect of ck-274 on patients' symptoms and function as well as to understand the long-term safety profile of ck-274. toward that end, we will soon begin enrolling patients from redwood-hcm in an open-label extension trial. first, enrolling patients who have completed participation in cohort 1, and then rolling over current patients in cohort 2. similarly, patients participating in our phase iii pivotal trial will have the opportunity to enroll in the open-label extension trial. the long-term follow-up of patients will not only contribute to our understanding of the efficacy and safety profile of ck-274, but will also facilitate an assessment of the potential effects of ck-274 on reverse remodeling, evaluated by cardiac imaging. lastly, our collaboration with ji xing has made rapid progress toward our shared objective of enabling the potential inclusion of china in a global phase iii clinical trial, ck-274, in patients with obstructive hcm. the ind submitted in china for our phase i study of ck-274 has been approved, and the study is anticipated to start during the first quarter. as part of the overall cardiac myosin inhibitor development strategy, we also continued to assess ck-271, our additional cardiac myosin inhibitor during the quarter. we now understand the pharmacokinetic profile of ck-271 based on a single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers.
while the data are supportive of continued development, we are prioritizing the rapid advancement of ck-274 and expect to have clarity before year-end on phase ii plans in another indication such as nonobstructive hcm or a subgroup of heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction. in the future, we may consider advancing ck-271 in an alternative indication outside of the scope of ck-274. this is the upside of one of the key hallmarks of our r&d strategy to develop backup, follow-on and next-generation compounds to maximize our options and increase probability of success.
and with that, i'll turn it over to robert wong, who will provide an update on our financials.
robert c. wong -- vice president and chief accounting officer
thanks, stuart. i'll first provide an update on cash, revenue and spending, and then ching will review our financial and corporate development strategies looking forward. details on our actual results for the fourth quarter 2020 and are included in the press release, which we released earlier this afternoon. we ended the fourth quarter with approximately $501 million in cash and investment. this balance includes $85 million, which was received in connection with the closing of our sale of a royalty on mavacamten to rtw royalty holdings designated activity company. our revenue in q4 2020 came primarily from our strategic alliances with amgen and astellas and also from an earned milestone payment. our fourth quarter 2020 r&d expenses increased to $29.2 million from $18.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to higher spending for our activities associated with redwood-hcm and readiness activities for a potential phase iii trial of reldesemtiv. more than 50% of our r&d expenses were attributable to our cardiovascular programs, as expected, given activity for meteoric-hf and the cardiac myosin inhibitor program, and the remainder of our expenses were attributable primarily to our early research activities. our fourth quarter 2020 g&a expenses were $13.9 million, up from $10.6 million in q4 2019 due to higher personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation and higher commercial readiness spending.
and now ching will review our 2021 financial guidance and corporate development strategy.
ching w. jaw -- senior vice president , chief financial officer
thanks, robert. today, we announced our financial guidance for 2021. the company anticipates 2021 revenue will be in the range of $23 million to $28 million. operating expenses will be in the range of $195 million to $205 million, and net cash utilization will be approximately $160 million to $170 million. our current cash balance of $501 million represents more than two years of forward cash based on our projected operating expenses and this net cash utilization range. our net cash utilization range includes approximately $35 million of nonrecurring building construction and related capital expenditures. it also includes potential receipt of $45 million from rtw royalty holdings designated activity company in exchange for a low single-digit royalty on ck-274 in connection with the funding agreement signed in july 2020, subject to conditions for payment being fulfilled. should we not exercise our option to receive the $45 million, we expect our net cash utilization range will be increased. we may revise this guidance later in the year once we finalize our strategy and potential commercial launch plan for omecamtiv mecarbil. significant additional expenses and net cash utilization may arise from our executing on those strategies and plans that are not included in the guidance. examples of such additional expenses include, but are not limited to, the purchase of drug substance related to omecamtiv mecarbil from amgen and other costs associated with transitions from amgen, funding of the development and regulatory activities associated with the immuno assay used in galactic-hf and meteoric-hf to determine the dose levels of omecantiv mecarbil as well as other potential commercial planning and readiness activities. our goal is to end 2021 with more than two years of forward cash. as we prepare for potential commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil and advance the clinical development of ck-274, we have already begun to execute on our corporate development strategy.
the strategy is twofold: first, to seek a development and commercialization partner for omecamtiv mecarbil and ck-274 in japan and other geographies; and second, to see potential royalty monetization and/or structured financing deals to support the commercial launch of omecamtiv mecarbil. as we advance commercialization plans for omecamtiv mecarbil, which we believe will importantly lay a strong foundation for commercialization of ck-274 and the expansion of our cardiovascular franchise, we are studying comparable company best practices and building a fit-for-purpose commercial organization. as our target product profile comes into focus, we will be putting together pricing models, forecast and profitability assessments to inform our u.s. and european go-to-market strategies, including investment and partnering or co-promotion plans. as always, we expect to navigate our key corporate development decisions through the lens of maximizing potential values to our shareholders.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to robert blum.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ching. we've entered what could be a transformational year for cytokinetics in 2021 as we prepare for the potential marketing authorization and commercialization of our first medicine and concurrently advancing multiple drug candidates in various stages of clinical development. this is all consistent with our vision 2025 outlined at the start of last year, which articulates ambitious, but we believe achievable goals to commercialize at least two new medicines, establish sustainable product-generated revenues and both expand our discovery platform and double our number of development programs to 10 by 2025. as we've said today, engaging with regulatory authorities and preparing for the potential commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil is the first step toward achieving that vision. we have teams executing against multiple work streams to refine the target product profile and determine the appropriate sizing, structure and territory alignment of our sales organization to optimize customer engagement in a post-covid world. we're using a combination of applied analytics and learnings from recent cardiovascular launches to determine the manner in which we should engage with physicians in either face-to-face or digital dialogue or both. importantly, we're planning for a sales force to target the high-volume heart failure hospitals and their adjacent specialty cardiology group clinics as well as to provide for key market access activities to reach the advanced heart failure patients in the united states, and as may be complemented by a copromotional partner outside of our focused market segment. additionally, given the synergy between high-volume heart failure in hcm centers, that investment will be amortized across our cardiovascular franchise and lay a strong foundation for future cross-promotion of ck-274.
we're also executing a comprehensive health economics and outcomes research strategy in collaboration with leading academic institutions and healthcare networks to illuminate the burden on the healthcare system associated with the advanced heart failure patients and how omecamtiv mecarbil may provide, not only clinical, but economic relief to reduce the cost of rehospitalizations. this will no doubt be of interest to payers as hospital administrators manage against penalties for rehospitalization within 30, 60 and 90 days post-discharge with a diagnosis of heart failure. with results from redwood-hcm expected midyear, we plan to rapidly advance ck-274 into phase iii in obstructive hcm by year-end and also to determine next steps to initiate a potential clinical trial in either nonobstructive hcm or a patient population with hfpef as they begin in 2022. we believe our executing on these activities are essential to balance out our company plans and to inform our cost of capital and the enterprise risk-benefit going forward. we also recognize our place in the urgency to help patients with als, and we remain optimistic that we'll begin our phase iii clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with als later this year. however, once we have regulatory clarity on the path forward for omecamtiv mecarbil as well as visibility on results from redwood-hcm and our associated cost of capital. and finally, we recently welcomed nancy wysenski and muna bhanji to our board of directors, both of whom bring deep experience and expertise in commercial strategy, market access and especially specialty sales through their leadership roles at vertex and merck, respectively, as well as among other companies. their recent and relevant experience navigating the evolving landscape of access and other issues for patients with high unmet needs will prove invaluable, we're quite sure, as our pipeline advances toward marketing authorization and commercialization.
we look forward to providing updates on our progress this year as our leadership and the mechanics of muscle and contractuality may translate into new medicines, and medicines that may help patients with devastating diseases of impaired muscle function and improve their health spend. now let me recap our expected milestones for 2021. for omecamtiv mecarbil, we expect to meet with fda to discuss galactic-hf in this first quarter of 2021. we also expect to develop our go-to-market strategy and potential commercial launch plans in the first half of 2021, and we expect enrollment of patients with heart failure in meteoric-hf to be completed in the first half of 2021. for ck-136, we expect to analyze phase i data to determine the next steps in the development strategy in 2021. for ck-274, we expect a phase i study of ck-274 in china, conducted under the license and collaboration agreement between cytokinetics and ji xing pharmaceuticals limited to get started in this first quarter of 2021. we expect to begin an open-label extension study for patients who complete redwood-hcm in the second quarter of 2021. we expect to announce results from both cohorts in redwood-hcm by midyear 2021. we plan to engage regulatory authorities regarding a potential registration path in the second half of 2021, and we expect to begin a potential phase iii clinical trial of ck-274 by the end of 2021. for ck-271, we expect to continue evaluating the potential to further develop ck-271 in connection with our plans to conduct a broad development program for our cardiac myosin inhibitors in hcm and potentially other indications. for reldesemtiv, we expect to conduct start-up activities for courage-als in 2021 and may open the trial to enrollment in the second half of 2021, subject again to our plans relating to advancing omecamtiv mecarbil toward commercialization and ck-274 and to a potential phase iii clinical trial in patients with obstructive hcm. for our ongoing research, we expect to advance programs and conduct ind-enabling studies to potentially advance one to two potential drug candidates into development in 2022.
and operator, with that, we can now please open up the call to questions.

[operator instructions] your first question will come from dane leone with raymond james. please proceed.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
hello dane.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, hello. how are you?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
all good.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
thank you for taking my question. congratulations on the progress. i guess i'll focus my question on just what you're looking for from this fda interaction for omecamtiv to give you kind of the decision-making information you need to move one way with that program? i think maybe if you could put that into context of the broader investor discussion, the questions we get in. you mentioned in your remarks, thinking about other launches in the cardiovascular space, i think rightly or wrongly, there are some concerns about how difficult it can be to launch into that space. some people could say that the recent launch of bempedoic acid as one of those examples. do you -- at this point? or is this still tbd post your discussion with the fda, have an internal model where you have an idea about what peak sales could be for this launch of omecamtiv? how long did it take you to get there? and then how long it takes into what year of the launch, you would actually have a positive margin on that commercial product? thank you.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so dane, that's quite a lot to ask in one question. i'll try to tackle it and ask my colleagues maybe to join in. some of that i can answer. some of it, obviously, it's premature. with regard to this upcoming fda meeting, this will be to review the results of galactic and not otherwise serve as a pre-nda meeting. we actually expect there'll be a series of regulatory interactions starting in this first quarter and continuing in the second quarter that ultimately will be informing our potential filing of an nda in the second half of the year. but at this first meeting, we want to talk about galactic and understand whether they believe it would be sufficient and suitable to stand-alone in support of a potential nda filing and a potential marketing authorization. so we'll review the data with them as we are prepared to do in its comprehensive form. and that should be hopefully informing whether this is going to be pre then supportive of what would could be second and third meetings that we might expect as we go forward in the second quarter. so that's the objective for this meeting. fady, anything you want to add to that before i might pick up on the other points.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
no, i think you covered it fine, robert. thanks.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
okay. dane, then you asked a lot of questions about the go-to-market strategy and when we might expect to be able to give visibility to profitability and things like that. obviously, we do have models, and we are refining them. and in fact, we're in the midst right now of moving from some of the earlier qualitative market research on a series of target product profiles based on the galactic data to more quantitative market research that will inform forecasting, price sensitivities, etc. ultimately, to get to your question, we have to understand what the infrastructure needed to support of commercialization would look like. and i would argue that there are no other launches that resemble what we have in mind, even as there are other cardiovascular launches. and i take your point that some of those launches have underperformed and therefore, we need to learn lessons from them. but the way we're approaching this, and many of us have direct relevant experience in these types of commercialization activities. the way we're approaching this is, we believe, as could be enabling omecamtiv mecarbil to be complementary to existing drugs, but for patients where there are no other good alternatives and our goal then would be to point to both safety, efficacy and economic value in connection with that as would be a very concentrated tractable commercial market where those patients present the most burden, that being in the institutional care setting where those patients then tend to be treated adjacent by specialty cardiologists who focus to advanced heart failure.
so, one doesn't need many hundreds, certainly not thousands, of reps to be able to reach those patients and those physicians and especially understanding where one can see high-yield returns. with ai and digital marketing, we expect to build a fit-for-purpose organization that's suitable to a post-covid world. and we do believe that there are go-to-market strategies that should be affordable to us and provide prompt visibility to profitability. how soon? is really going to be a function of some things that i really shouldn't speculate on at this time. but we do expect to lay out a go-to-market strategy midyear this year in support of our plans for omecamtiv mecarbil, and i expect we can provide more clarifying information at that time.

your next question will come from jason butler with jmp securities. please proceed.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
hello jason.
jason butler -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi, robet. thank you for taking my question. a couple on 274. just now that you have -- you're past the first cohort in the phase ii study. can you maybe give some thoughts on the different trial design considerations for phase iii? obviously, you need to wait for the full data, but just what are the pushes and pulls you're thinking about? and maybe compare it to the explore trial for mavacamten? and then just what are your considerations when determining next steps for an additional indication for 274, be it non obstructive hcm, hfpef or something similar? what are the key factors there that you're still analyzing? thanks.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. good question. so i'll ask fady and stuart to address them, but before i do, i'll just highlight. so i think the rapid enrollment of cohort two in redwood-hcm speaks to the significant enthusiasm on the part of this mechanism and ck-274, both in u.s. and ex u.s. institutions that are enrolling patients in redwood-hcm and from which we'd be expanding in a potential phase iii program. so with that, i'll turn it over to fady and stuart as they can highlight how that phase iii program may take shape. some things we'll be able to speak to now. other things, obviously, we're going to keep confidential for now, but then also how we're thinking about other indications. fady?
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
yes. i'll address the first part of the question, jason. i think with regards to phase iii, one of the things we want to take advantage of is the easier type tradability of ck-274, to be able to craft endpoints that speak to earlier symptom resolution and improved exercise performance, ease of titration, things like that. so really the data from redwood will give us a sense of how to tune some of those the timing of those assessment of those things and the design of phase iii as well as tune some of the escalation criteria and so forth. but as robert said, i think we're in the midst of designing this. we have some interesting good ideas. and probably when we launch a trial, we'll try and make sure that people understand the differences between our phase iii trial and the way explorer was conducted. i'll turn it over to stuart to talk a little bit about how we're thinking about nhcm or hfpef.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president and chief medical officer
well, yes. i was just going to comment that certainly, the obstructive hcm study design will depend on the results from redwood-hcm. and well, as fady said, maximize, take advantage of the opportunity to try to differentiate from mavacamten. but i'm just sort of introducing my comment that way because redwood-hcm will also inform -- help inform our strategy with nondisruptive hcm or hfpef. and we discussed previously about some of the features of nonobstructive hcm that may inform benefit in a subgroup of patients with hfpef. so i think a lot of this decision-making is contingent upon the results of redwood-hcm and where we see the best opportunity.
jason butler -- jmp securities -- analyst
okay. great. that's very helpful. thanks for taking my questions.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president and chief medical officer

your next question will come from joe pantginis with h.c. wainwright. please proceed.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president and chief medical officer
hi, joe.
joe pantginis -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
hey everyone. thanks for taking the questions. i want to focus on bd since that's factored largely in your discussions today in your prepared comments. so maybe starting with the continuum or the evolution of your discussions. maybe first, how soon did any potential discussions start after amgen returned the asset? and then sort of fast-forwarding to now, is it -- it just seems that it's important with regard to timeliness for a potential partner to maybe want to be in the copilot seat, if you will, with regard to commercialization and moving forward in other geographies or even copromoting in the u.s. as you look -- as the nda is really not that far off.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so very good questions. i'll start and then see if ching wants to add anything as well. so we began these discussions promptly after we received the notice from amgen, albeit all caveat by saying there are certain things we cannot be sharing in as much as our collaboration with amgen is winding down and will be officially ending in may of this year. so there are confidential materials that cannot be shared in that interim period. and there are nonconfidential materials that can be shared ahead of that, albeit that relates to omecamtiv mecarbil. and as we think about business development and corporate development, they go hand-in-hand, our interest are to prioritize partnering as may enable a combining of omecamtiv mecarbil and ck-274, for which we have no similar restrictions, and with focus to japan and europe before co-promotion in the u.s. so we've got a very clear-minded view as to what we're interested in. and you're right, a potential partner may have an interest in copiloting certain of those activities, but we also know that we're the lead here, and we're in a position to inform a potential partnership on terms that we would find acceptable by pushing forward on these initiatives.
and in this case, we want to make certain that we have our go-to-market strategy clarifying we do know what the regulatory feedback is in order to be able to identify the best potential partner on the right terms. the fact also doesn't limit us from having conversations on matters pertaining to royalty monetization and structure deals. and with that, i'll turn it over maybe to ching to see if he wants to elaborate on some of those ongoing discussions.
ching w. jaw -- senior vice president , chief financial officer
yes. thanks, robert. so we have begun discussions with various parties on both fronts, both in terms of potential business development deals and/or royalty monetization or structured financing deals. i would just say that you might be able to look at the deals that we've done in the past with companies like royalty pharma and others to get a -- in rtw to get a sense of the type of deal structure we might be pursuing for the royalty monetization and structure financing. i'll just stop there.
joe pantginis -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
no. that's really helpful. i appreciate that color. and then, obviously, a lot depends on omecamtiv, but i was just curious if you could provide a little more color on the gating factors about pushing reldesemtiv forward.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so the trial that we have laid out for reldesemtiv called courage-als is one that has design features that enable it to be stopped or adapted to interim analyses. and as such, if we aren't seeing what we expect to see in that trial, then we could pull the plug or we can actually dial up some of the patient enrollment as well. that's for a study that we have fully costed and for which a significant percentage of the cost would be borne by our partner, astellas, in exchange for a low single digit royalty. so we believe that this is a trial that is affordable. but at the same time, we recognize that our priorities need to be focused to omecamtiv and ck-274, especially as those will be more cost-intensive and also inform our cost of capital. so we want to have all of the information in place when we make a decision to start that trial.
and in the meantime, we can be conducting start-up activities that would be enabling when we do start-up that trial that it is ending on relatively the same time frame. so we believe that this is prudent investment in the balanced way we're approaching our portfolio, recognizing priority number one is omecamtiv, priority number two is ck-274, priority number three is reldesemtiv. but we do expect that we should be advancing all three during the second half of the year.
joe pantginis -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
got it. thanks a lot, guys.

our next question will come from salim syed with mizuho. please proceed.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
hi, salim.
salim syed -- mizuho -- analyst
hey, robert. how are you doing? thank you. a few for me, if i can, probably for maybe fady or stuart. on ck-274 guide, i noticed you mentioned similar to pk data, and you've talked about substantial reductions in lvot gradient. i'm just kind of curious, are you guys already where you want to be with cohort 1? or is this something where you think you'll need cohort two here? because you're already talking about running pivotals. so i'm just kind of curious how you're thinking about the data set, given you've already seen substantial reductions at four to six weeks? my second question is also in 274. the data that we'll be getting top line in the middle of the year, can you just perhaps describe to us what you plan on putting in the press release? is it going to be more of a placeholder type press release? or will we get any thing of substance here that investors can use? and then just an unrelated one on 136, my read is just -- it seems like you guys are a bit hesitant in moving this troponin activator forward. you want to do potentially other phase i studies, and i'm kind of curious what you're seeing there? i would think with omecamtiv, where it is that you would want to perhaps move a troponin activator quicker in the pipeline? thank you.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so let me start, and then i'll turn it over to fady and stuart. i'm probably going to go in a reverse order of your questions. so with regard to ck-136, we're in the midst of these transition discussions with amgen and we still need to assess that data and whether anything else might need to be done in accordance with further development in phase i before committing to how we might do phase ii. and i suspect there are going to be other activities that will need to be done in order to be prepared for phase 2. however, don't take that to mean that we're any less enthusiastic about its potential because that's not true. the fact of the matter is we have a bit of an embarrassment of riches in terms of our ability to fund and prioritize everything at the same time. and i do believe that we'll find a way to make happen a plan for ck-136, but in priority order relative to the other programs we've mentioned. also with regard to how we will report results from redwood when we do?
it's hard to answer that question until we have the data, but expect it will be somewhere in between just simply a top line announcement, and that which would be reserved for the presentation itself, enough to be able to communicate will be the results in order to be able to set the table for what would be the presentation. it won't be in its full detail to jeopardize the presentation but enough so that it will hopefully inform us and shareholders about why that may be supportive of movement into phase iii and distinguishable as well from the first-generation product. and with that, i'll turn it over to fady to answer your question about cohort one and anything else he wants to add.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
yes. how are you doing? i think the answer to your question is that both cohort one and cohort two [indecipherable] final dose selection for phase iii. cohort 1, clearly, it was very -- a set of very active doses, but not every single patient had a full treatment response. and so that is the rationale for exploring some higher doses in cohort two increase the percentage of patients who meet the treatment response. and the combination of the two will inform both starting dose and the high dose we select. so i think the -- they're not -- they're on track in order to enable us to design and begin phase iii by the end of this year.
salim syed -- mizuho -- analyst
okay. thanks so much, guys. i appreciate the color.

your next question will come from charles duncan with cantor fitzgerald. please proceed.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
hey, charles.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
yes. thank you.hey, robert and team, thanks for taking my questions. lots of good one asked, but i'll give it a shot for a couple of others. first of all, regarding the upcoming fda meeting in the next few weeks, i assume that you'll wait for the actual minutes? or do you think that the questions that you're asking are not sufficiently, call it, complicated that you'll be able to talk about that even yet this quarter?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
we'll certainly want to see the minutes, but i also don't know that, that meeting will it self, prompt any further disclosure as much as a continuing set of activities. and therefore, we'll have to assess the outcome after the meeting. but what we aren't intending to do is provide a play-by-play on every regulatory interaction and every activity in accordance with transitions from amgen because all of this factors into a gestalt that will communicate as we think is appropriately informative, but as those things materialize materially. i hope that's helpful.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
yes. that is. so it seems like there is no particular question around clinical strategy, i.e., perhaps waiting for medioric or additional clinical work, it's really in terms of what to include in an nda?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
no, not at this meeting. at this first meeting, it really is to discuss galactic and whether it is supportive of proceeding toward what would likely be next, further interactions in a pre-nda meeting. so we're expecting a series of these meetings over the course of the next several months. if we learned that galactic by itself was not sufficient to support a filing or if there's something that definitive, we might then feel obligated to communicate that because that would be a surprise. but our expectation is we'll get advice that will be likely needing to be elaborated in further interactions.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
okay, ok. that's helpful. and then my second question is regarding commercialization. i'm assuming all of that goes well with agency and omi is ultimately approved, i guess i'm wondering if -- i think fady mentioned that you've gotten great feedback from kols and others. any feedback from payers at this point? and what is the key, call it, pharmacoeconomic consideration, one or two of them that you think differentiates omi in terms of its ability to create value for patients and payers?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
very good question. so we've engaged already well over 150 key opinion leaders, and we've gotten very consistent consensus feedback that they believe that omecamtiv mecarbil in galactic generated data that would distinguish it from other medicines currently available for the treatment of heart failure and especially, as it augments cardiac performance and in galactic demonstrated activity, safety and efficacy on top of standard of care, well maintained patients on adherent standard of care. so we see that as very encouraging. but to your question, that's not the entirety of the story. we have been engaging payers, and we will continue to do that through the period of this q1 and q2. we're getting good feedback that a new medicine that could keep people alive and out of the hospital and especially reduced costs associated with heart failure would be a welcome addition. and as you know from the results from galactic, the predominant effect we saw with omecamtiv mecarbil added to standard of care was a reduction in hospitalizations and rehospitalizations, and that was on top of standard of care. and that affect size seems to be more meaningfully large as you get into more advanced heart failure patients based on secondary analyses. that's very interesting and compelling, and that informs a lot of the value proposition and what could be the pharmacoeconomic rationale for omecamtiv mecarbil is commercialized. and we believe that this is potentially ripe for the times, given that these heart failure hospitals are increasingly under the penalty of readmissions, as was first 30 days and now increasingly with initiatives in public policy looking like it could move to 60 and 90 days, meaning any rehospitalization during that period would be at the cost of the index hospital.
and therefore, adding omecamtiv mecarbil upon discharging and with the expectation it could reduce the number of those rehospitalizations, should be not only clinically advantageous but also could be economically advantageous. so we see the value proposition being particularly important, especially knowing that heart failure is the number one discharge diagnosis for patients admitted into hospitals on medicare, and it's only looking to get worse with the aging demographics. so we foresee that this is increasingly a significant portion of the story as it's unfolding with additional analyses and research still to be done.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
that's helpful, robert. and appreciate the thoughtful answer. last question is perhaps for ching. ching, you said several things, one of which caught my -- well, actually, all of which caught my attention, but one thing that i remember is on the immunoassay, it makes sense that you're expense guidance can't really be well informed until you decide on a path forward in terms of commercialization and other things with regard to omecamtiv in the pipeline. but you mentioned the immunoassay, and i'm trying to understand that more. and what is the potential expense with that?
ching w. jaw -- senior vice president , chief financial officer
charles, there, i'm referring to the existing relationship between amgen and thermal fisher in the development of the in vitro diagnostics that will be used for dose titration of omecamtiv mecarbil. and as the amgen steps out of that relationship, the assumption is we will have to step in, and we have just begun discussion with thermo fisher on the path forward. so that's what the immuneassay comment was meant to, referred to.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
got it. some more later. okay. thanks for taking my questions.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question will come from jeff hung with morgan stanley. please proceed.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thanks for taking my questions. with the focus for omecamtiv mecarbil on patients with ejection fractions below 30%, i guess, what are your current thoughts on how to more effectively reach this group of patients once omecamtiv is on the market? and then i have a follow-up.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
so these are very identifiable patients, as you might remember from -- hearing from mike felker at our panel presentation after the results from galactic were presented at aha, these are patients that tend to be treated, not just by cardiologists, more often, it's the specialty heart failure cardiologists who are called upon for these frequent flyers in u.s. hospitals. so these patients are not difficult to identify and very often are well known. in fact, as we've been engaging with opinion leaders, it's that patient phenotype that is top of mind for many of them because they don't have anything in their toolbox right now as could be helpful to those patients who are already bottomed out on their blood pressure or kidney function and potassium levels. and therefore, that's where the profile of omecamtiv may be especially suitable. fady, anything you want to add to that?
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
yes. i think just the main point is that these patients, as we talked about earlier, are often in and out of the hospital. and so they're readily identified based on the fact that require a higher level of care. and the physicians take care of them are often positioned to have hospital-based practices and other things that lend themselves to being approached and engaged in terms of what alternatives are available to them.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great. and then i heard the question, but i missed the answer on the next one. so sorry, if i missed it. could you just repeat the answer? for the redwood data, what endpoints should we expect to see with the top line data? and i guess what do you need to see to consider the study success? thank you.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
well, i think, jeff, the answer to that the data that we have are similar to what we announced in cohort one release, but level of scale will be greater than what you saw there. so the -- we're looking at are related to echocardiographic response, pharmacokinetics and safety. and i think those are the key things that we will be emphasizing and in our reporting of the study.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
just to be clear, so when you say reported -- but do you mean in the -- sorry, i was referring to the top line, data for like in the press release, you'll cover all those aspects? or...
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
yes, i'm sure we'll cover all those aspects. i can say right now to what level of detail. we haven't written the press release, obviously. so...
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst

your next question will come from ted tentoff with piper sandler. please proceed.
ted tentoff -- piper sandler -- analyst
[indecipherable] thank you. hey,guys. thanks so much for the opportunity and i guess my only question really have to do with the current study, and i don't know if there's anything you can, just in terms of design or sort of what you're thinking there?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so we published a poster in december relating to the design of courage-als, but maybe i'll ask fady to kind of highlight its main features.
ted tentoff -- piper sandler -- analyst
perfect. thank you.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
yes. so courage-als is a study that would enroll patients, randomize them to active versus placebo treatment for six months. at which point, the patients on placebo would cross over to active treatment. so the last six months of treatment, 12 full months, would be -- all patients would be on active treatment. study stayed blinded for the entire time period. the primary endpoints assessed at six months is the alsfrs, which is the als functional rating scale, that has been used was a secondary endpoint in fortitude phase ii study. and i think the other key feature is that there are a couple of analyses that enable us to either study per futility at an earlier stage of its conduct or to assess it for to upsize it should it need to be upside for powering. but maybe just in interest of time, i'll leave it at that.

your next question will come from greg suvannavejh with goldman sachs. please proceed.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
hey, greg. greg, you there?
greg suvannavejh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. sorry about that. thanks. how are you? thanks for taking my question. it's yearly updates i've got two questions, please. my first, maybe it's actually for ching, just on the guidance. so i realize that the guidance is the guidance, but clearly, there are some determinations of the path forward for omecamtiv mecarbil. so i'm just trying to get a sense of what magnitude of swing could we possibly see once you get your strategy as we look at our models? i'm just trying to get a sense of how much of your current thoughts around omecamtiv mecarbil are already contemplated into that $160 million to $170 million net cash utilization? and could it be meaningfully different once you figure out your plans on the go forward? so that's my first question.
and then my second question has to do around comments that, obviously, you're going to meet with the fda in the next little bit to find out if indeed, the agency does view that the data that you've generated is supportive of a filing on a go-forward basis. and obviously, i think we'd all hope that. but any preliminary thoughts as to if that's not the case, what other trials you would contemplate doing in order to take it across the finish line? or is there another then strategic decision as to like what to do with the program going forward? thanks.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll let ching answer your first question, and then i'll answer the second.
ching w. jaw -- senior vice president , chief financial officer
so with regard to the first question, greg, i think it's a little bit early to give you specifics due to the fact that we are, as we said earlier, seeking potential partners and depending on the economics and cost share with those potential partners, our cost picture might change. and i could tell you that i anticipate significant increase in 2021 spending if we have a path forward with omecamtiv mecarbil recordable in terms of commercialization. but that is not going to be -- given the fact that by the time we could build our sales force it will have been late in the year. so as you think about 2021 change versus the potential 2022 increase. i think majority of the increase you'll be seeing will be in 2022. i hope that helps.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
i think that's the operative point. while we may provide a change in guidance midyear as relates to 2021 spending, depending on what you might think to be significant or meaningful, it's unlikely going to have the kind of effect that you might be worried about in 2021 as much as it might have effect to our cash runway extending through 2022 and into 2023. and therefore, it's not enough to be coming up with a go-to-market strategy if we can't also fund and finance it. and that's where business development and corporate development go hand-in-hand. with all of that. so our aim is to keep that adjustment within a reasonable range, and i can't put a percentage on it right now, but i trust you understand that there's a lot of things that will affect that in many moving parts right now.
your other question related to fda, and if we get definitive feedback at this upcoming meeting that galactic by itself is alone insufficient to inform potential progression to an nda filing, firstly, i think we'll be surprised. but secondly, we do have an ongoing second phase iii trial, meteoric. as we mentioned, it will complete enrollment in the first half of this year, and that could very well serve as a second pivotal if that would be required. we've got an over 8,000-patient study with a p less than 0.05. so we don't foresee that, that should be necessary, but that could be the second phase iii trial that might be then required. and if not that one, then we would expect that another trial could be conducted in this population that we think was the most responsive omecamtiv mecarbil in galactic. but obviously, that's a whole other ballgame, and that would take additional resources and time, and that's not currently what we are expecting.
greg suvannavejh -- goldman sachs -- analyst
understood. thank you so much.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer

and we do have one final question in queue coming from carter gould with barclays. please proceed.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
hey, carter.
carter gould -- barclays -- analyst
hey, guys. good evening. long time listener, first time caller. i guess coming back to some of your commentary on 274 versus 271, i guess what i'm hearing is, in the near term, just clear prioritization on 274, but i guess things are still -- all options are on the table as you think then around either divvying up indications, i guess. is that a correct interpretation? have you made any decisions around not pursuing overlapping indications with these assets, i guess, in the near term? and then maybe just as a follow-up, robert, you talked about potentially co-promotion options for omecamtiv. at the same time, you talked about all the potential leveraging of commercial infrastructure and synergies toward a budding cv franchise. so i guess just trying to understand what are the -- thinking about that decision process around a copromote, what would maybe drive you to that decision versus not?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so firstly, we haven't made any decisions regarding not overlapping indications, but we're looking at ck-274 in obstructive hcm. and as you know, it's following behind very good work that myokardia did with mavacamten now in the hands of bms. and we have a lot to learn about where as a next-generation compound, we can advance the field. and as a fast follower, there's upside in being good students of how this category evolves. so as you might have noted, bms made some announcements about its interest in nonobstructive hcm and also in hepef. and we think that as they go forward with mavacamten in those indications, it will be informative of how we might choose to go forward with ck-274 and ck-271. we can't afford to do everything at the same time, so we've got to prioritize things, and we're looking at nonobstructive disease, and we're looking at hfpef with an eye on how might we, with a molecule like ck-274 or ck 271 or frankly, we also have other compounds arising out of research, how might we be -- if not the first to market, how might we be a potential best-in-class? and that's where we want to make certain that we're being smart about our pipeline of cardiac myosin inhibitors. i hope that's helpful. with regard to partnering in co-promotion, i'll just mention that we're looking at where we could be building our business, but recognizing we can't build everything we want. some things we have to rent as we then establish positive marketing contribution and positive cash flows in order to funnel them back into an expansion and scale-up of our commercialization. i don't expect that we will be going into europe by ourselves.
i expect that, that will be built together with a co-promotion partner. in the u.s., i want to make certain that we are leading in the area where we think we can make the most impact with the highest yield, and that's in the institutional care segment. but as we might scale our commercial organization beyond those hospitals and those integrated networks into the community, there are those clinics that are more adjacent and more likely treating the advanced heart failure patients, and there are those that are more distal and we might see benefit to having a co-promotion partner in some of those activities as we might ultimately build our commercial business. and again, this all has to be factored in together with what are we doing from a digital standpoint, recognizing that we can be a leader in that space as it relates to heart failure. so these are all things that factor into how we think about co-promotion and franchise building. but what we do want to do is know that we've got a presence with feet on the ground in those high-volume heart failure hospitals that are also those high-volume hcm centers, and that's going to be essential as a nucleus to our strategy. is that okay?

good afternoon, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to cytokinetics' first quarter 2021 conference call. at this time, i would like to inform you that this call is being recorded and that all participants are in a listen-only mode. at the company's request, we will open the call for questions-and-answers after the presentation.
i will now like to turn the call over to diane weiser, cytokinetics senior vice president of corporate communications and investor relations. please go ahead.
diane weiser -- senior vice president of corporate communications & investor relations
good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on the call today. robert blum, our president and chief executive officer, will kick off the call with an overview of the quarter and recent developments. then fady malik, our evp of research and development, will provide an update on omecamtiv mecarbil, including progress following a recent meeting with fda and what to expect from upcoming analyses from galactic-hf, the positive phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil as well as recent activities related to meteoric-hf, the second phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil.
next, stuart kupfer, our svp and chief medical officer, will provide an update on our cardiac myosin inhibitor program with focus to redwood-hcm, the phase 2 clinical trial of ck-274. then robert wong, our vp and chief accounting officer will provide a financial overview for the past quarter; and ching jaw, our svp and chief financial officer, will discuss our financial outlook and corporate development strategies before robert blum then returns to provide concluding thoughts and expected key milestones for the remainder of 2021. we also have a new team member on today's call andrew callos, our chief commercial officer who joined cytokinetics during the quarter and who you will hear in upcoming calls.
please note that portions of the following discussion, including our responses to questions, contain statements that relate to future events and performance rather than historical facts and constitute forward-looking statements. our actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. additional information concerning factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in our sec filings including our current reports regarding our first quarter 2021 financial results filed on form 8-k today. we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after this call.
and now, i will turn the call over to robert.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, diane, and thanks again to everyone for joining us on the call today. we had a productive first quarter and are feeling increasingly more optimistic as our nation reemerges toward new normalcies in the coming months with widespread vaccinations for covid-19. we continue to wish you and your family's good health and wellbeing.
we're also optimistic about cytokinetics and our pipeline, our progress, and our prospects. in the first quarter, we executed well against our plans and are firing on all cylinders. with priority to advancing our industry-leading cardiovascular drug candidates directed to muscle, focusing to both redwood-hcm and meteoric-hf, as well as advancing regulatory and commercial readiness work streams in support of omecamtiv mecarbil. toward that end, i'm very pleased to introduce the newest member of our leadership team, andrew callos. andrew joined us as our chief commercial officer, and we're thrilled to have him on board at a key time for our company, as we turn the corner toward commercialization and transition to be a forward integrated biopharmaceutical company.
andrew brings relevant commercial and operational experience from cardiovascular specialty care and rare disease markets. he had a long tenured and successful career at pfizer and at wyeth pharmaceuticals where he oversaw u.s. and international pharmaceutical business franchises. most recently, andrew served as regional president and general manager north america for pfizer's upjohn business unit.
and prior to that role, and during his over 20 years at pfizer and predecessor companies, he held leadership positions including as vice president u.s. cardiology & metabolic marketing overseeing the commercialization of eliquis in the united states. andrew also served as vice president and head of inflammation marketing europe and vice president global commercial development for rare diseases. as you can see, his experience is a perfect fit for cytokinetics, and he has quickly come up to speed and contributed to the many commercial planning work streams that had already been under way prior to his arrival.
andrew joins us to lead a team of similarly expert commercial colleagues at cytokinetics who are experienced in cardiovascular and neuromuscular specialty care markets. and as we proceed to finalize our go-to-market planning for omecamtiv mecarbil and ck-274, you'll be hearing more from andrew and his team about our plans including at an investor day to be scheduled later this year. on the regulatory front as previously communicated, during the first quarter, we convened an fda meeting to review the phase 3 clinical trial results from galactic-hf. and we're now proceeding toward additional interactions with fda and other regulatory authorities. fady will elaborate in a moment, but suffice it to say we're pleased with the level of engagement and the feedback that we received from fda and we believe galactic-hf can stand on its own as a pivotal trial in a planned nda submission.
we're now proceeding toward our goal of an nda submission for omecamtiv mecarbil in the second half of 2021. we also advanced our go-to-market planning with work streams focused on market research, brand positioning, supply chain manufacturing and logistics, market access, health economics and outcomes research, customer engagement and other commercial infrastructure to inform our future investment and execution strategies and anticipation of a potential commercial launch of omecamtiv mecarbil in the united states in 2022.
ching will elaborate later in this call on our financials, our cash runway and our deal objectives to support our go-to-market strategy. we also made significant strides advancing our cardiac myosin inhibitor program during the quarter, focusing on the completion of redwood-hcm, our ongoing phase 2 clinical trial of ck-274 in patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. as stuart will elaborate in the first quarter, we opened and promptly completed enrollment in cohort 2 and more recently opened enrollment to cohort 3.
in addition, this morning, we announced that we also activated the first site in the open-label extension study for patients who completed redwood-hcm. this high proficiency execution underscores the urgency of our activities in this program given the high unmet need among patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. based on data from the interim analysis of cohort 1 that we announced in december, we plan to engage fda in this quarter and prepare for a phase 3 clinical trial expected to begin before year end. we're also advancing medical and new product planning activities directed to specialty care cardiologists in high volume heart failure hospitals that overlap with high volume hcm centers of excellence given the many synergies between our cardiac myosin modulators and planning.
and with that, i'll turn the call over now to fady to elaborate on developments related to omecamtiv mecarbil.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
thanks, robert. during the first quarter, we advanced omecamtiv mecarbil forward in several important ways. first, we met with fda to review the top line results of galactic-hf that type c meeting met our expectations in terms of engagement and feedback. we now intend to proceed to file an nda later this year based on results from galactic-hf and the rest of the development program.
we had an opportunity to hear from fda as those matters that we should be prepared to address and finalizing the nda filing. we are now preparing for additional discussions with fda during the second quarter, including another plan type c meeting that we expect to further inform our filing strategy. at this next meeting, we plan to share additional analyses of galactic-hf and request fda feedback that can inform labeling and our nda submission. we expect still further interactions, including a potential pre-nda meeting and are pleased to have multiple opportunities to engage fda ahead of our goal to submit an nda in the second half of the year.
i'll remind you that our planned nda submission will be based on the results of galactic-hf in combination with the rest of the development program comprising over 30 clinical trials and as informed by prior regulatory discussions. in parallel with these activities, we continue to conduct meteoric-hf, our second phase 3 clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure with the reduced ejection fraction. and meteoric-hf, we're investigating the potential effects of omecamtiv mecarbil to improve exercise tolerance in patients with heart failure, which may provide a benefit for these patients struggling to perform daily activities.
screening is now nearly closed and we're on track to complete randomization of patients into meteoric in this second quarter. we expect top line results to be available in early 2022. if the findings for meteoric are positive, we expect that data from that trial would be submitted in a supplemental filing as would be expected to follow a potential fda approval and commercial launch.
i'd like to acknowledge the efforts of the study team, investigators and study coordinators for their successful commitment to accomplish this milestone during an unprecedented pandemic. during the quarter, we received confirmation the data from a secondary analysis of galactic-hf assessing the effect of omecamtiv mecarbil on clinical outcomes in relationship to ejection fraction at baseline will be presented by dr. john teerlink in a late breaking clinical trial session at the american college of cardiology 70th annual scientific session.
we can't say more about these data. so as not to break embargo policies, but suffice it to say, we believe it will further advance the understanding of which patients in galactic-hf achieved the greatest benefit from treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil on top of standard of care. the executive committee of galactic-hf in collaboration with cytokinetics has been working on several additional secondary analyses from which data will be forthcoming later this year at medical meetings and in manuscripts to further elaborate on the results of galactic-hf and inform its potential use.
we believe that these additional analyses will be very informative as to how omecamtiv mecarbil performed in galactic and illuminate key learning. given the dynamics of the heart failure treatment setting, it's incumbent on us to best understand how to frame these data and what can hopefully be an approvable submission for this first-in-class cardiac myosin activator, which reduced the risk of heart failure events in its pivotal trial.
to that point, in the last quarter, we continued market research activities to better define and refine the potential target product profile of omecamtiv mecarbil and understand where it may best fit in the treatment armamentarium, particularly given the new entries available to clinicians and their patients. as we've said before, it's an exciting time in the treatment of heart failure, where there are still tremendous unmet need, and we remain enthusiastic that omecamtiv mecarbil may provide a welcome addition in the battle to better manage this high prevalence progressive disease, particularly among more severe patients who have exhausted guidelines directed therapy, and still suffered debilitating symptoms or at high risk for heart failure hospitalization.
we also had opportunity to engage with a large number of kols during the quarter with a significant majority of them providing positive views regarding omecamtiv mecarbil. and importantly, pointing out that it could potentially fill a key need among a more severely ill patient population that is more at risk of hospitalization and rehospitalization. common themes included an understanding that biologically it stands to reason that those patients with more impaired cardiac systolic function may benefit more from this novel mechanism therapy, this designed to act directly on muscle and improve cardiac function and performance. as well as the potential to add omecamtiv mecarbil to standard of care, given its favorable tolerability and safety profile as we observed in galactic-hf, and which it's addition to standard of care did not adversely affect blood pressure or renal function.
and finally, during the past quarter, we're pleased to conduct an inaugural meeting of our heart failure patient advisory council. this is a group of passionate patients and caregivers with whom we've been meeting regularly to inform understanding to the patient experience, disease journey, and unmet needs. these insights will be instrumental in designing patient support services, educational materials, and guiding the development of our heart failure directed pipeline.
we're grateful to the participants. from our first engagement, we are confident this group will be valuable to our patient-centric activities. as we've indicated, cytokinetics is committed to advancing omecamtiv mecarbil as a key priority in 2021. doing that as required extensive attention to wind down activities and our collaboration with amgen included among these projects are managing the transfer of the integrated safety database and reported-related reporting obligations, receipt of regulatory documents and assuming responsibility for manufacturing. transitioning these many work streams from a 15-year collaboration is not trivial. and our team at cytokinetics has been very busily attending to these issues to ensure smooth and orderly handoffs.
naturally, we have prioritized omecamtiv mecarbil and are therefore de-prioritizing the further development of our cardiac troponin activator, ck-136 formerly referred to as amg 594, which will be deferred for the rest of 2021. we plan to continue its development in the future as we continue to build out in advance our pipeline and look to expand our emerging cardiovascular product franchise.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to stuart.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president & chief medical officer
thanks, fady. during the quarter, we made significant progress within our cardiac myosin inhibitor program focus on the advancement of ck-274. i'll begin with an update on redwood-hcm, the phase 2 clinical trial of ck-274 and patients with obstructive hcm, including a highlighting recent and upcoming regulatory interactions, and then touch on preclinical data recently presented at the american chemical society annual meeting.
during the first quarter in redwood-hcm, we dosed the first patient and also completed full enrollment in cohort 2, which is examining the safety and tolerability of doses of 10, 20 and 30 milligrams of ck-274 versus placebo. dosing of ck-274 is individually titrated by echocardiography at weeks two, four and six with dosing optimized on the basis of target reductions in lvot gradients, while maintaining a normal ejection fraction.
overall, the treatment duration is 10 weeks with an echocardiogram to examine reversibility of effect two weeks after the last dose. we remain on track to report top line results from both cohort 1 and cohort 2 mid-year as well as to begin to plan phase 3 clinical trial by year end. earlier this week, we announced the opening of cohort 3 of redwood-hcm. cohort 3 is intended to examine the safety and tolerability of ck-274 in patients whose background therapy includes disopyramide, a medication that a sometime use in patients with symptoms refractory to first-line medical therapy, and that has been excluded in most trials of hcm intervention today.
in cohort 3, patients will receive ck-274 in open-label fashion over a 10-week period with individualized dose titration of 5, 10 or 15 milligrams once daily. this cohort is not being conducted to further refine the dosing strategy that we intend to study in phase 3, but instead cohort 3 is expected to provide important data to inform the potential inclusion of disopyramide treated patients in our planned phase 3 clinical trial.
additionally, this morning, we announced that we have activated the first site in redwood-hcm ole, open-label extension study that is designed to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of ck-274 in patients with symptomatic obstructive hcm. eligible patients will have completed their participation at redwood-hcm. primarily, we will evaluate long-term safety as assessed by the incidence of adverse events and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%. secondary endpoints include measures of the long-term effects of ck-274 on left ventricular outflow tract gradient and assessments of steady state pharmacokinetics.
the open-label extension study will also include a cardiac mri sub-study to assess changes in cardiac morphology function and fibrosis. all enrolled patients will receive ck-274 and use a similar echocardiography guided dose titration to individually optimized dose as has been employed in redwood-hcm.
during the last quarter, we also made progress under our collaboration with ji xing pharmaceuticals with initiation of a phase 1 clinical study of ck-274 in healthy participants in china. this aligns with our shared objective for the inclusion of china in a global phase 3 clinical trial planned to begin later this year.
we are pleased to see that our colleagues at ji xing are operating with the same sense of urgency as we are to enable advancement of ck-274 into a global registration program. from a regulatory perspective, we were also pleased to recently receive orphan drug designation from the fda for ck-274 and symptomatic hcm encompassing, both obstructive and non-obstructive patients. this underscores a significant unmet need and patients who continue the separate symptoms that can severely impact their quality of life. the few treatment options available to them and no currently approved medical therapies.
in the first quarter, we also prepared for regulatory interactions, including type c and end of phase 2 meetings with the fda, as well as with ema for scientific advice. the first of these next level meetings is planned to occur in the second quarter and will inform how we approach an end of phase 2 meeting that is expected to occur in the third quarter.
finally, last month, data related to the optimization of ck-274, including the first disclosure of its chemical structure were presented at the american chemical society spring 2021 virtual meeting. this scientific presentation highlighted the preclinical characterization of ck-274 and focused on key compound characteristics, including this half-life, the shallow dose response relationship and lack of meaningful cytochrome p450 interactions.
furthermore, data were presented from genetic models of hcm, in which ck-274 reduced fractional shortening and lvot peak gradient in a dose related manner. these results highlight the success of the chemical optimization program conducted at cytokinetics, which was intentionally focused on designing key compound characteristics to enable flexible, safe and timely dosing adjustments in clinical practice.
we now look forward to results from both cohorts 1 and 2 of redwood-hcm, which will elucidate how these next generation physicochemical properties of ck-274 may translate into important clinical effects in patients with obstructive hcm.
and with that, i'll turn it over to robert wong, who will provide an update on our financials.
robert wong -- vice president & chief accounting officer
thanks, stuart. i'll first provide an update on cash, revenue and spending, and then ching will review our financial outlook and corporate development strategies looking forward. more details on our actual results for the first quarter 2021 are included in the press release, which we released earlier this afternoon. we ended the first quarter with approximately $460 million in cash and investments.
our revenues in q1 2021 came primarily from our strategic alliances with amgen and astellas. our first quarter 2021 r&d expenses increase to $31.6 million from $21.7 million in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to increases in spending on our skeletal muscle program and clinical development activities for our cardiac myosin inhibitor programs.
more than 50% of our r&d expenses were attributable to our cardiovascular programs as expected, given activity for meteoric-hf and the cardiac myosin inhibitor program and the remainder of our expenses were attributable to our skeletal and early research activities. our first quarter 2021 g&a expenses were $15.6 million up from $12.4 million in q1 2020, due to higher personnel related costs, including stock-based compensation and higher commercial readiness spending.
and now, ching will review our planning and corporate development strategy.
ching jaw -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, robert. as we ended the first quarter was approximately $460 million in cash. we look to our financial guidance for 2021 and believe we have over two years of forward cash runway. we have also indicated that we may revise financial guidance based on finalizing commercial planning activities related to omecamtiv mecarbil and a potential product launch in 2022.
during the quarter, we delve deeply into commercial planning and are developing a comprehensive go-to-market strategy, which will be presented to our board to gain alignment on the overall approach and investment requirements. the strategy comprises key elements, such as market assessment, brand strategy, market access, commercial organizational structure, customer facing and digital engagement strategies, supply chain, information systems and projected sales, spending and return on investment.
as we advance these strategies in support of potential launch of omecamtiv mecarbil, we are focusing on the most efficient and high yield investments to enable the commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil in 2022, but also equipped cytokinetics to be best prepared for potential expansion of our cardiovascular pipeline and the commercialization of ck-274. the foundation we build for omecamtiv mecarbil will be leveraged to support the planned product launch for ck-274, which will assume file.
as part of this planning process, we are engaging in industry benchmarking exercises to understand best practices to optimize our approach to franchise development, especially in a post-pandemic world. executing on our commercial strategies and plans may result in our incurring significant additional expenses that were not included in our current financial guidance.
we expect that some or all of those potential expenses could be covered by our accessing additional capital through strategic partnerships with near-term cash infusions or buy equity and or debt financing, if deemed appropriate. finally, as we have previously discussed, we are advancing a two-fold corporate development strategy in 2021.
firstly, to seek a development and commercialization partner for omecamtiv mecarbil and ck-274 in complimentary geographies to that, where we intended to go-to-market ourselves. so those additional geographies, we are currently engaged in potential partnering discussions in japan and europe.
secondly, to see potential royalty monetization and/or structure financing deals in order to support the commercial launch of omecamtiv mecarbil and ck-274. during the first quarter, we've had encouraging and productive interactions with potential partners to advance this strategy and we look forward to continuing those discussions as may result in a deal or deals in the second half of the year.
cytokinetics has always gain access to capital through a diverse array of transaction types. and we continue to believe that our path to commercialization will be served by our continuing monetization of our leadership in muscle pharmacology.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to robert blum.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, ching. before i provide an update on our expected milestones for the remainder of the year, i'd like to take a moment to remind you of the landscape upon, which cytokinetics is operating, especially, as it relates to the overall clinical and economic burden of cardiovascular disease today.
despite covid taking well over 500,000 american lives, cardiovascular disease remains the leading killer of americans, taking even more lives over the same timeframe. clearly, the impact of cardiovascular disease to patients, caregivers and our healthcare system remains unacceptable. we're gratified to be in a position to have the opportunity to make a meaningful impact with novel mechanism therapies that work unlike other available therapies and has may benefit millions of patients with various forms of heart failure. phase 3 trials have demonstrated that modulating cardiac myosin either by its activation or its inhibition can translate into clinically meaningful effects on highly relevant registration endpoints.
we're pleased to have pioneered the biopharmaceutical sciences directed to cardiac muscle and we're excited to be preparing for commercialization activities in the same comprehensive and expert way in which we're defining an entirely new cardiovascular pharmacology. as you've heard, it's been a productive quarter and we're energized by the transformation taking place at the company, as we advance plans for our first potential fda approval and commercial launch, which we believe will set the table for achievement of our vision 2025. one goal of which is to secure two to three approvals for our potential medicines over the next few years.
ching reviewed components and work streams related to our go-to-market strategy in support of the commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil. during the quarter, we continued to conduct market research with physicians and payers to refine our target product profile and our understanding of patient journeys and treatment patterns related to the severe heart failure patient, who may benefit most from treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil.
we also began in earnest to lay down the design strategy for our commercial organization and our potential launch of omecamtiv mecarbil. these activities had begun under our collaboration with amgen and now we're being refined with that collaboration coming to an end later this month. as we develop the structure and customer engagement strategy for omecamtiv mecarbil, we're keeping ck-274 close in mind, as we are intent to capitalize on a franchise approach to our business, much like we prioritized a portfolio approach to our focus to muscle biology.
i want to emphasize the high degree of overlap in high volume centers that specialize in both heart failure and hcm, both geographically, as well as institutionally. the investments we're making in sales and marketing infrastructure to support the potential commercialization of omecamtiv mecarbil will be amortized over time and set the table for advancement and potential commercialization of ck-274.
in other words, the economies of scale and the synergies, we've seen in r&d over many years at cytokinetics should also serve us well from a commercial standpoint, as we expect to build a cardiovascular drug franchise established on sustainable and growing revenues. while our priorities in 2021 are clearly focused on our cardiovascular programs, we're also mindful that we need to continue to prepare for courage-als, the phase 3 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with als.
als is another major area of high unmet need for patients and we maintain a commitment to opening this trial to potential enrollment once we have clarity on our go-to-market strategy with omecamtiv mecarbil and progression of ck-274 to phase 3. during the quarter, we initiated clinical trial start-up activities, including regulatory and institutional review board submissions for courage-als in preparation for the potential start of the trial in the second half of the year.
in summary, as we round out the second quarter of 2021, we've remain enthusiastic about our prospects across the pipeline and our transformation to a fully integrated bio-pharmaceutical company. the second half of the year has us turning over several cards at cytokinetics, most notably, the upcoming results of redwood-hcm and the potential regulatory advancement of omecamtiv mecarbil.
with what we believe could be among the most promising cardiovascular pipelines. we're taking strides to realize our mission of bringing potential medicines to people living with cardiovascular diseases of impaired muscle function that may improve their health span. at the same time, ingenuity and innovation remain a core focus of our research activities, which are also a key component of our vision 2025. in the next few years, to remind you, we expect to double our development pipeline to 10 therapeutic programs, as well as to expand our discovery platform from the biomachinery of muscle contractility to muscle energetics growth and metabolism.
we're making good progress already and expect to select up to two more development compounds over the next year across our cardiac and skeletal programs to enter ind-enabling studies. and we look forward to elaborating on these promising r&d programs in our future calls.
now, let me recap our expected milestones for 2021. for omecamtiv mecarbil, we expect to meet with the fda in this second quarter to continue discussions related to our goal of an nda submission in the second half of 2021. we expect randomization of patients with heart failure in meteoric-hf to be completed in this second quarter of 2021 and we expect to refine our go-to-market strategy and our potential commercial launch plans in the second quarter of 2021 and through the remainder of this year. for ck-274, we expect to announce results from cohorts 1 and 2 in redwood-hcm by mid-year 2021.
we plan to engage regulatory authorities regarding our phase 3 trial and development program in this second quarter and also continuing into the second half of 2021 and we expect to begin a potential phase 3 clinical trial of ck-274 by the end of 2021. for reldesemtiv, we expect to continue conducting start-up activities for courage-als and we may open the trial to enrollment in second half of 2021, again, subject to our plans relating to advancing omecamtiv mecarbil toward commercialization and ck-274 to a potential phase 3 clinical trial in patients with obstructive hcm. and for our ongoing research, we expect to advance programs and conduct ind-enabling studies to potentially advanced one to two potential drug candidates in development in 2022.
operator, with that, we can now open the call up to questions, please.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] our first question comes from the line of emanuela branchetti with h.c. wainwright.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello, emanuela.
emanuela branchetti -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
good afternoon, guys. and thank you for taking my questions. congratulations on the progress on our programs. you mentioned a discussion with the fda omecamtiv going as expected. could you please provide more color on what elements were discussed with the fda and what still needs to be discussed before nda submission?
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
sure. i'm not sure we're going to be able to do more than that, which we already mentioned on this call, but perhaps in summary, i'll say that the first meeting was specifically intended to understand, if a galactic-hf by itself without any other phase 3 clinical trial could stand alone in support of an nda filing. and we asked questions, it had discussion and we believe coming out of that call that we got the answer that we were looking for, which is that we can proceed this way, readying to file an nda based on galactic by itself. but that's just the beginning of a series of fda interactions that we had intended. and with that, i'll turn it over to fady to speak about some of the things we expect to be discussing in other fda interactions, including an upcoming type c meeting.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
yes, i'll maybe just tackle that at a high level. i think there are many aspects of filing an nda to try to get fda input on before you go ahead and file the nda, in terms of approaching labeling in terms of approaches to dosing and other things that we will examine with them, in terms of the program. that way we can put together a filing that think helps the line, what their feedback might be with our objectives.
and finally, there are number of technical matters that one has to settle with them in terms of data standards and other aspects of the program as one submits a filing. nda filing is a very large undertaking and there are many details, which sometimes it helps to align on for you submit the documentation, so that you're not having to sort through those things later.
emanuela branchetti -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
got it. thank you. that's very helpful. and switching over to redwood-hcm, can you ask us maybe frame the expectation around the coming data? what should we specifically focus on, especially when considering potential comparisons with phase 2 data being mavacamten.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
sure. so again, i'll start and then turn it over to fady and stuart. as you know, we already reported on interim results from cohort 1, we did that back at the end of last year. we had some pretty high expectations going into that. and i think admittedly, we believe that the interim cohort 1 data exceeded those expectations in that a majority of patients achieved clinically meaningful responses at the low end of the planned dose response curve. and we did not have any of those patients have efs fall below 50%. so we see that as ordering well for the completion of this study, both cohort 1 and cohort 2.
and as we are now completed with enrollment in cohort 2, we'll be preceding toward the database lock and the readout of those results. but as far as how that compares to another compound, keep in mind please that we're running a different study. we're not doing a head to head comparison. we are, however, looking at what we think are real world practice patterns here in this trial on top of background therapy compared to placebo where we think this can best inform phase 3. and with that, i'll turn it over to fady and stuart.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
i think robert covered most of it. i think i'll just be brief in that the-we were quite pleased with the cohort 1 results, i think, as we said, the majority of the patients in that cohort reached the target of where we would stop escalating drug therapy, but not everybody. and that was why we embarked on cohort 2 to study somewhat higher doses and see if we could ensure that we had covered the top of the dose range.
so the data from cohort 1 and 2 will inform the starting dose and obviously the top dose as well. and we'll report those data in july, but i think the most important data are the effect of the drug on the left ventricular outflow tract gradient, the timing of its reduction and extent of its reduction, and all of those things should be pretty well laid out for you all, when we report the data in the middle of the year.
emanuela branchetti -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
got it. thank you. and in regards to the enrollment of the circle redwood-hcm, the beginning of this quarter was optional, if i remember correctly. could you elaborate on the rationale behind combining ck-274 with disopyramide.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
i'll turn that over to fady or stuart, whoever wants to answer that.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
stuart, why don't you take that question?
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president & chief medical officer
right. so the rationale is, we've noticed is that patients with more advanced symptomatic obstructive hcm are sometimes treated with disopyramide, which can reduce cardiac contractility to some extent. but if there are patients despite being treated with some of the standard therapy, including disopyramide who still are suffering from symptoms related to hcm, they could benefit from a drug like ck-274, which of course is specifically designed to inhibit reduced cardiac contractility.
so there really is a potential advantage here for patients with sort of run out of options, so to speak and are further along in the natural history of disease, in terms of their disease severity. they could benefit from another medical intervention, such as ck-274 and that's really our objective to explore that more severe patient population by adding to disopyramide treated patient.
emanuela branchetti -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
got it. thank you for that. and it seems to be [indecipherable] open-label, would you expect to release data as the trial advances cut off before all patients have dosed?
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
i'm sorry. stuart, can you take that.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president & chief medical officer
right. i'm sorry if i understood the question was about releasing data for cohort 3. was that the question?
emanuela branchetti -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
yes. yes. what's the timeline for that?
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president & chief medical officer
well, let me say, first of all, the results from cohort 1 and 2, essentially, it will inform our planning for phase 3. so i just want to make it very clear that-those are the cohorts that are focused on our dose finding objectives. so that will eventually feed into our phase 3 trial design. and we plan to start that study by the end of the year.
so cohort-the conduct of cohort 3 or the start of phase 3 is not contingent on completion of cohort 3. so having said that, we will release the results, essentially when we get to the point of completing that cohort. it will be likely later in the year. but again, it's-we don't have a specific meaning or timeline at the moment. and again, it's not tied to starting our phase 3 trial.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
yes, most likely this open-label extension will be generating data for a while and will be periodically reporting on its progress.
emanuela branchetti -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
got it. thank you very much.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of charles duncan with cantor fitzgerald.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hey, charles.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hey, robert and team, thanks for taking our question, and congrats on the forward progress with omecamtiv, very good productivity this quarter. i wanted to ask you a question about that recent fda meeting. i know that you probably can't give us details. but i'm just wondering, first of all, if you've received the meeting minutes yet. and secondly, do you feel like the fda was most compelled by the efficacy that was seen or by the identification of the high burden and relatively underserved patient population, likely both. but where do you think their real interest was?
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
good question. firstly, with regard to the minutes, yes, and we have received them. with regard to your second question, i don't think i can speak for fda. but i think as you know, with a program that comprises over 30 clinical trials and a phase 3 pivotal trial that is over 8,000 patients in 35 countries, it's a rather robust data set that we have generated in connection with omecamtiv mecarbil over 15 years.
i don't think the fda is newly realizing the unmet need in heart failure. and you've seen how they've been leaning forward in connection with approvals in that space. albeit, not medicines that directly impact cardiac muscle. and i think, while i can't speak for fda, we have had many, many, many listening sessions with opinion leaders since the galactic results have been provided.
and there is a very consistent theme running across those conversations, which is-this is an opportunity that we've been looking for in connection with a new mechanism therapy that binds directly to cardiac muscle enhances cardiac function, improves cardiac performance and can do so safely without risk of arrhythmias heart rate and where blood pressure and renal function are not compromised. so that's what we believe omecamtiv mecarbil represents as could be complimentary to standard of care and keep in mind the results we saw in galactic were on top of standard of care. and we believe that speaks to an opportunity set for omecamtiv mecarbil. and we discuss that with fda and we were pleased with the feedback. i hope that answers your question.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
yes, absolutely. so it's kind of the entire gestalt. but it does seem, like, they certainly considered the differentiated mechanism of action and potentially target product profile.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
i think it's important that, the fda has been involved in a lot of public meetings with academics and biopharma, heart failure researchers, and trying to advance the field. you saw a couple of years ago, a guidance came out to reiterate their position on, what approvability for drugs and heart failure looks like, that you see many senior members of the fda involved in these meetings. and i think that just reflects on recognition that there's a tremendous unmet need here, despite the fact that we have existing therapies. and you can just even look at the event rates in galactic, they exceed 30% and even higher than that in some sub-populations. so still a tremendous need, despite the therapies that we have.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
yes, makes sense. i know there'll be a lot of questions on ck-274 from other analysts. so i'll leave that to them. but i wanted to ask you about courage-als, you mentioned being in a position to start that phase 3, once you nailed down omecamtiv go-to-market and then potential moving to ck-274 into phase 3. and i guess, i'm kind of wondering, what are the trigger points with regard to courage-als, if you can share them with us that you're waiting for to be able to operationalize that study.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
sure. good question. so firstly, as you may recall, we presented the design for courage-als late last year. and we've also commented on additional secondary analyses that lend support for ways we think we can enrich the response seen in four to two day or less has designed into that phase 3 trial courage-als. we've also announced that astellas has agreed to provide co-funding of courage-als in connection with their receipt of a low single-digit royalty on sales in certain countries. we've also announced that courage-als is designed with interim analyses so that we can see if it is affirming the kind of activity that we designed and powered the study for based on what we saw in phase 2. so we took certain steps to ready for the potential start of courage-als, but we're a small company and we have to maintain priority and focus.
so we wanted to make certain that we understood what would be the path forward for omecamtiv mecarbil and ck-274, before we commit to operationalizing courage-als. and we laid out a couple of objectives or milestones. firstly, we wanted to see the galactic results, we've seen them. we wanted to understand if they could support an nda filing and we believe that we have that feedback and that they do and we expect to file in second half of the year. but we also want to understand the go-to-market strategy and how that can return on investment, the timelines, the expenses, and the activities, and make certain that we've got our arms around that.
and we're in the process of making that happen. we also wanted to understand ck-274 and what could be its path to phase 3. so that's partly answered by the fact that we've seen interim data from cohort 1 and we're engaging regulatory authorities. and we are preparing for potential phase 3 later this year, but we haven't seen enough yet from redwood, in order to be committal to courage-als.
so we want to see those data in order to be able to be in the best position to know that ck-274 has a path forward to phase 3, and that can be moving forward, potentially in parallel with reldesemtiv in courage-als in phase 3. imagine that will then be a company with a profile, omecamtiv going to market potentially in 2022 and two programs, one from each of our verticals in phase 3 in 2022. we like that complexion. we think that's in the interest of shareholders and in the interest of our science, that's what we've been building toward. and if there's anything that we've learned from the course of over 20 years at cytokinetics is that there's always advantage to having one up next a program up is in the interest of building a sustainable and durable company managing a portfolio enables us to build a franchise across both cardiac and skeletal muscle.
so we're not there yet with courage-als, we still have to turn over a few cards, but we're getting there in the meantime, we've been conducting start-up activities and getting mobilized. i hope that helps.

your next question with salim syed with mizuho.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello, salim.
salim syed -- mizuho -- analyst
great. hey, robert. hey, guys. thanks for all the color and congrats on the progress. just a couple from me if i can. fady, did i hear you, right, that, did you say we're getting the data for redwood in july?
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
i think i said mid-year, in july, mid-year.
salim syed -- mizuho -- analyst
it is. but i thought you mentioned the month, is that-i just want to make sure, i didn't mishear you.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
i might have mentioned the month. i think we expect the data given the completion of enrollment and the completion of the anticipated study duration and things for it to read out sometime in july.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
yes. given that, we still haven't locked the database. we still are conducting the study. i've seen your notes and you've made certain calculations and projections on timing. what i can say is that we're looking to mid-year and that's still to be determined based on things still to happen.
salim syed -- mizuho -- analyst
okay. got it. just to clarify on that. i mean, if you guys had finished enrollment for cohort 2 in february, i believe, i think you guys announced that on the 25, specifically. why wouldn't you be able to lock the database two weeks-post the week 10 treatment duration? so at the last echo, why wouldn't you be able to lock it then for cohort 2 and present the data earlier? is this any curiosity?
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
salim, there's actually a four-week period after a week 10. so there's a two-week echo at week 12 and then there's a two-week follow-up at week 14. there's a period of time when all the echos have to be centrally read and adjudicated and the data need to be cleaned and all that sort of stuff. so the timeline is something that requires, includes database lock and core lab activities and so forth.
salim syed -- mizuho -- analyst
okay, got it. and then just secondly, you guys are starting to discuss the phase 3 for ck-274, and just wondering how you guys are planning to do this with mavacamten on the market and i think the pdufa is in january of 2022. are you guys contemplating the head-to-head versus mava or how are you guys exactly thinking about this with another hcm acid potentially on the market early part of 2022?
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
it's a good question, but i don't think it would be reasonable for us to be responding about that from the competitive positioning standpoint, recognizing that there could be a single pivotal trial, there could be more than one. we're ultimately going to be deciding how best to position and frame a ck-274 in what will be a dynamic space.
we do expect bms should get approval for mavacamten in 2022, but we also believe that the trial that we expect to conduct at least the phase 3 trial that we've been focused toward is one that should enroll, well, not only in the united states, but outside the united states. our plan is to make this a global registration program. so i think it has the potential then to still enroll rapidly even as mavacamten may be approved in 2022, as far as the head-to-head or anything like that, i think it would be premature for us to speak to any of those issues.
salim syed -- mizuho -- analyst
got it. thanks so much, guys.

your next question comes from the line of ted tentoff with piper sandler.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hey ted.
ted tentoff -- piper sandler -- analyst
great. thanks very much. hi guys. how are you? thanks for the thorough update. i guess my question would be with respect to omecamtiv mecarbil. i was encouraged by that update. and one of those sort of and maybe it's a little bit early to talk about this, but what do you see as sort of the market opportunity based on the results that were reported from galactic? thanks very much.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
sure. good question. i'm going to tackle that, but i'll also ask andrew, who's joined this call to speak about it also at a high level, because he brings a different perspective than some of us at cytokinetics. we've been at this for 15 years on omecamtiv mecarbil in the clinic. and we admittedly are pretty close to the trees, but he can look at this from a forest viewpoint as well and given his expertise in specialty care cardiology markets, i think it'd be helpful for you to hear from him at least this first time.
what i'll tell you is that there are over 6 million of patients today in the united states with heart failure. that number looks to be growing to 8 million to 9 million by 2030. if you consider that roughly half of those have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and you look at data cuts, how many have ejection fractions below 40, below 35, below 30, below 25. and you can get this from real world evidence. there are a large number of patients who fit the bill for that, which is comparable to how we pre-specified in galactic patients above and below the median.
the median in galactic was 28%, ejection fraction at 28%. there over 4,000 of those patients in galactic. and they are symbolic, if you will of patients with more severe heart failure and other risk factors. and we're looking at a combination of these risk factors as defines a patient population that's in high unmet need of new therapy, despite a standard of care. so because this is cardiology, you're talking about not thousands or tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands of patients, and even over a million such patients. and that's where we need to be smart about positioning and knowing where omecamtiv mecarbil may play a role in guideline directed therapy.
but maybe i'll stop there and turn it over to andrew to provide some of his perspective.
andrew callos -- chief commercial officer
thanks, robert. so maybe just to build on what robert said, while i've been fairly new to the team, we've been spending a lot of time on our go-to-market strategy and given the profile that fady and robert described and an add on therapy, we are concluding that there given the unmet need and the match to the profile of omecamtiv, that there are a numerous amount of patients that could benefit from the emerging profile of omecamtiv and that we could be very successful in commercializing it as well.
we're currently designing and building what we think is the right size commercial organization and infrastructure that will enable us to focus on care settings where the majority of heart failure patients are treated of both community cardiology and hospitals. so getting those cardiologists in those two care settings activated on omecamtiv for that subset of patients is really what's going to be critical to our success. and we feel again right size their organization, and in the right roi that we certainly can be successful in this market.
ted tentoff -- piper sandler -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of jeff hung with morgan stanley.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello, jeff. jeff, you might be on mute.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
can you hear me?
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
yes, we can hear you now.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. well. hey everyone, and thanks for taking the question, and welcome, andrew. so actually this is for andrew, if he's on the line. i guess before you joined cytokinetics, what aspects of omecamtiv mecarbil or galactic did you find most compelling? and now that you're at the company, what are some of the improvements that you envision for the commercial efforts?
andrew callos -- chief commercial officer
sure, thanks for the welcome. i mean the biggest thing really is the science, the focus the company has on science and match with the unmet need from a patient point of view, really focusing on the muscle biology, cardiac myosin inhibitor, cardio myosin activators that really matches science and unmet need is really the foundation of what i thought was great for patients and great for an organization to be successful.
coming to the company, now for a few months, i think what we really learned is that you have to make sure that you get access to drugs and you get cardiologists to really understand the evidence produced by a clinical trial like galactic-hf and using this evidence really painting a picture for who the clear patient is that can benefit most from that, and then bringing the organization and the infrastructure in place with the right roi and the rightsizing and structure for a company or a size kind of marrying these things together, access, drug profile, given the evidence in science and kind of our go-to-market strategy. i think that formula together will surely make us successful.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
thank you.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
i know the question wasn't directed to me, but we'll have an opportunity not only to hear from andrew, but also members of his team as we'll have an investor day later this year. and we intend to layout our go-to-market strategy in significant detail. we're not going to try to be that company that competes on every front, but rather instead, where do we think the mechanistic science, the evidence, and our ability to achieve a high roi could distinguish cytokinetics in a marketplace with a high unmet need both clinically and economically.
and don't forget the economic piece of this, because as you've already seen in galactic-hf, omecamtiv on top of standard of care translated into significant reductions in hospitalizations and rehospitalizations, and those hospitals are having to eat those costs on patients readmitting within 30 and 60 days. and there's a very compelling opportunity for a pharmacoeconomic argument here that we think makes a lot of sense to institutions and cardiologists that treat patients in those institutions. so more to follow on that, but recognizing that when we go forward to hopefully a launch of omecamtiv mecarbil, we'll have laid out our rationale for others to also understand.

robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello, dane.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
hi, how's it going? congrats on all the progress.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
good, thanks. thank you.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
just one for me, because it's getting a bit late in the call. the-could you maybe just parse out because we've gotten a lot of questions in terms of what you've disclosed around redwood today with cohort 1 versus cohort 2, and then the opening of cohort 3 with disopyramide. is it -maybe just to stay clearly is the purpose of the cohort 3 combination study with disopyramide to satisfy with a lot of the clinical community? the highlight is potentially a deficiency of what was generated with mavacamten dataset. or is there some angle that maybe you can get more efficacy out of the cohort 1 dosing on in combination with disopyramide that would preclude necessity from dosing ck-274 higher to the doses that were used in cohort 2. thank you.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
that's an interesting way of thinking about it. i hadn't even thought about it that way. it very much is in order to inform the possible inclusion of other patients in phase 3, but maybe fady can speak more to that or stuart.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
yes. i think i can't really speak to the whole investigative communities thinking about this other than these are patients that have not had the opportunity to participate in trials. we're about to conduct a fairly sizable trial in this area. and if there isn't a need to exclude them, then why not include them. and so i think cohort 3 is designed to give us the information regarding the safety of combining those two drugs so that we can do so in an informed manner.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of greg suvannavejh with goldman sachs.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hey greg.
unidentified participant
hi team, this is anna on for greg. just one quick question from us on ck-274 cohort 3, and the chosen doses which had appeared to be a slightly lower than the other doses have been explored. if you could just provide some color on the decision around the doses chosen for cohort 3, and perhaps if you can give us some color on what's the magnitude of the effect size that you're hoping to see with cohort 3 versus what you saw previously in cohort 1. thanks.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
stuart, why don't you go ahead and take that?
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president & chief medical officer
right. so the-we've been discussing disopyramide has some impact on reducing cardiac contractility and given that effect, we want to essentially evaluate that patient population cautiously as you might expect. and so as we described in our december press release and the interim results of cohort 1, we determined that those-that lower dose range was a safe tolerable. and so it was reasonable to evaluate the disopyramide treated patients using those doses that had already been qualified so to speak were known to be safe and well tolerated.
but an additional point is, and just as a just to reinforce the point is that ck-274 dosing is individualized for each patient, right. so and based on achieving target gradients while maintaining reasonably normal ejection fraction. and so it could be very well be that some patients treated disopyramide will be well controlled achieving their target gradients the lower dose range. and it still some patients may require higher doses, but in the end, and we'll learn this in our phase 3 trial that-what type of-for the most part, what sort of doses will be required, given the full dose range in phase 3 and these disopyramide treated patients.

and your last question comes from the line of akash tewari with wolfe research.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello, akash.
andrew newton -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey guys, this is andrew on for akash. i just had a couple if i can. but first, can you kind of talk to us about how much relative reduction in contractility you guys need to alleviate kind of the outflow gradient. this is something that i believe we're targeting fairly low on a dosing curve, call it, [indecipherable] or so. could you speak to that? and then secondly, like in terms of average lvef drops across the cohorts and across like any dose that you might bring forward, when we look at the averages from the mavacamten trials, if you guys are able to dose relatively higher up the dosing curve, given the shallower relationship. is it fair to say that we could see a slightly higher average drop in ef? and then lastly, well, i know we don't want to everybody's going to look at these phase 2 results and try and compare it back to mavacamten, given the design of the trial and the titration scheme. is it fair to say that the better comparator is really the explorer trial versus the phase 2 pioneer? thanks.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
all good questions. i'll turn it over to fady and stuart can probably handle these better than like...
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
so i'll try and tackle them quickly as we're getting shorter on time. i think in regards to your first question, it's a little bit of an open matter is that ejection fraction you need to drop in order to maximize the effect on the gradient. i think it depends on the patient. these patients in general have the ejection fractions that are 70%, 75%. so they have quite a ways. they have a significant room to move in terms of trying to maximize the effect on the gradient. but it's kind of sum it up. i think we were anticipating drops of 5 to 15-range depending on the patient and the severity of their gradient.
i think the second question in terms of i'm remembering the third question now, but the second question had to do with, you want to remind me.
andrew newton -- wolfe research -- analyst
yeah. if like-if the shallower pk/pd plays out, is it fair to say the average ef drop could be relatively higher? is that suggestive that we could get relatively higher on the dosing curve?
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
right. yes, i think that's an astute observation. the fall and ejection of 3%, 4%, 5% on average is pretty minimal in terms of again where these patients start. and so as i alluded to in the first question, if you can predictably push the dose a bit higher, maybe even potentially lower the ejection fraction a bit more, you're still well in the normal range. but you may be able to achieve a greater effect in patients that have a more severe gradient.
that's something that we'll hopefully have some read on when we see the fullness of the data from redwood-hf, hcm rather. and then i think in the last question, the answer is, i think the explorer data in some ways, the echocardiographic data from explorer probably a better comparator to redwood-hcm in the sense that it's a placebo-controlled trial patients who are on background therapy in their phase 2 trial there they had withdrawn patients from background therapy. it was an open-label trial.
i think there are certainly differences between the two trials that really preclude a head-to-head with caution people from always trying to draw those comparisons in the absence of understanding the underlying variables. but in essence, i think probably explorer would be more relevant to the redwood experience.
andrew newton -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. thank you.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer

robert blum -- president & chief executive officer

that is happening at the same time, we're doubling down on research and development both our research platform expansion, and a doubling of our pipeline in clinical research. and we hope to be one of those companies that is establishing a franchise business. at the same time, we continue to innovate in science and bring forward a sustainable pipeline and make for a durable business. i look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. and we look forward to responding to other comments and questions over time.

good afternoon, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to cytokinetics' second quarter 2021 conference call. at this time, i would like to inform you that this call is being recorded and that all participants are in a listen-only mode. at the company's request, we will open the call for questions-and-answers after the presentation.
i will now like to turn the call over to diane weiser, cytokinetics senior vice president of corporate communications and investor relations. please go ahead.
diane weiser -- senior vice president, corporate communications and investor relations
good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on the call today. robert blum, our president and chief executive officer, will begin with an overview of the quarter and recent developments. then fady malik, our evp of research and development, will provide an update on omecamtiv mecarbil, including the secondary analysis from galactic-hf, our positive phase three clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil as well as recent activities and next step with fda.
next, andrew callos, our evp and chief commercial officer, will provide an update and progress toward our go-to-market strategy for omecamtiv mecarbil and how those plans intersect with our franchise development strategies and our future plan for the commercializing of aficamten or ck-274. then stuart kupfer, our svp and chief medical officer will provide an update on our development program for aficamten with focus to recently announced results from redwood-hcm, our positive phase three clinical trial.
next, robert wong, our vp and chief accounting officer will provide a financial overview for the past quarter, and ching jaw, our svp and chief financial officer will discuss our financial outlook and corporate development strategies before robert blum will return to provide concluding thoughts and expected milestones for the remainder of 2021. please note that portions of the following discussion, including our responses to questions, contain statements that relate to future events and performance rather than historical facts and constitute forward-looking statements.
our actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. additional information concerning factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in our sec filings including our current reports regarding our first quarter 2021 financial results filed on form 8-k today. we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after this call.
and now, i will turn the call over to robert.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, diane and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. we had a productive second quarter, which has continued with intensity more recently, as we've delivered against multiple milestones across our cardiovascular and also our neuro muscular development programs. in the past few quarters, we've made tremendous progress on the clinical development front punctuated by positive phase iii results from galactic, positive phase two results from redwood-hcm.
completion of enrollment in meteoric-hf and initiation of courage-als, the phase three clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with als. looking forward, we're preparing for our first nda submission, and executing well against commercial readiness objectives, while also advancing three distinct late stage development programs, all expected to be in phase three clinical trials by the fourth quarter.
this is an extraordinary achievement for any company; much less one of our size, but it's a testament to our focus, our innovation, our resilience, our resourcefulness and our disciplined strategic corporate development. importantly, progress across our pipeline also catalyzed our recent equity offering, which fortified our balance sheet and which is expected at year end to have us with over $600 million.
this will ensure a strong financial position as we pass through key milestones in building a sustainable and durable business anchored in our industry leading muscle biology focus. as fady will elaborate new analyses from galactic-hf reinforce previous results, which reinforce that patients with higher risk factors underscoring more severe heart failure, derive greater treatment benefit from omecamtiv mecarbil when added to standard of care, and they augur well for a defined clearly identifiable target patient population.
these patients remain among the toughest to treat, despite the availability of guideline directed medical therapy and based on continued feedback from the healthcare professional community; we believe omecamtiv mecarbil may fill an unmet need in the treatment armamentarium. as you'll hear more in recent months, we've conducted several additional interactions with fda toward our goal of submitting an nda for omecamtiv mecarbil in this second half of the year.
and concurrently, under andrew's leadership, our commercialization strategy is also taking further shape. we have active work streams progressing across every element of our go-to-market strategy, including product positioning, market research, value proposition development, market access, and manufacturing and other logistics scale up. turning to another underserved cardiovascular patient population, we were pleased to share top line results of redwood-hcm, which met our high expectations for this dose ranging trial and our next in class objectives.
as pioneers in the science of modulating cardiac myosin, it's rewarding to see that the physio chemical properties that we prioritized in optimizing aficamten are translating into clinically meaningful results for patients. with positive results from redwood-hcm now in hand, we have received constructive fda feedback from our recent type c and end of phase two interactions are supportive of progression into our phase three trial intended to get underway in the fourth quarter of 2021.
with enthusiastic clinical trial sites across north america, and europe, we anticipate high interest for enrollment. and we'll provide updates as the trial gets underway. and finally with clarity on a submission strategy for omecamtiv mecarbil, as well as positive results from redwood-hcm supporting a phase three trial and a reinforced balance sheet. earlier this week, we announced the start of courage-als, our phase three clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with als.
and as a reminder, under the terms of our amended collaboration agreement with astellas, cytokinetics now controls development and commercialization of reldesemtiv and astellas will contribute $12 million toward the conduct of this trial. we feel fortunate to be at a major turning point in our corporate development, the promise of modulating contractile proteins that drive muscle contractility is being realized with our positive clinical trial programs. and we're grateful to our shareholders for continuing to believe in the potential of this platform, so that we may deliver to patients first in class, and next in class drug candidates that may improve their health span, and also overall quality of life.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to fady to elaborate on recent developments related to omecamtiv mecarbil.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
thanks robert. as you mentioned results from additional analyses of galactic-hf presented during the quarter at heart failure 2021 and international congress of the european society of cardiology continue to build upon previous results, underscoring that patients with markers of more severe heart failure or a greater risk, derive greater clinical benefit from treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil when added to standard of care.
specifically results of analyses and patients with higher baseline nt pro bnp and patients with severe heart failure based on modified criteria from the heart failure association of the european society of cardiology, advanced heart failure physician statement were presented. despite the availability of and adherence to guidelines directed medical therapy, many patients with severe heart failure remain at high risk for significant clinical events.
and based on these data omecamtiv mecarbil may offer a new treatment option for more severe heart failure patients or maxed out on standard of care and still in and out of hospital. as i said before, these results align well with the mechanism of action of omecamtiv mecarbil and so far as its ability to improve cardiac function and performance appears to impact the outcomes in patients who present with signs that their cardiac function is particularly limiting.
it's been affirming and encouraging hearing key opinion leaders share this perspective, especially given that the greatest need exists among those patients, for which the benefits of omecamtiv mecarbil are most concentrated. specifically, we've heard that the results lend themselves to an opportunity to highlight a clear population of patients who may benefit from potential treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil. the many physicians with whom we've engaged point out those options are limited in these patients.
and if approved, omecamtiv mecarbil may provide a key addition to existing standard of care, given its mode of action, and lack of adverse impact on hemodynamics, or kidney function. meteoric-hf, the second phase three clinical trial of omecamtiv mecarbil aims to expand on the nature of benefit by potentially demonstrating that a drug candidate that improves systolic function may enable patients to improve exercise capacity and stamina, allowing them to do more of the things they enjoy every day.
during the second quarter, we completed enrollment in meteoric-hf despite the headwinds of the pandemic, and expect to complete its conduct by year end, which would enable reporting results in early 2022. now, onto the regulatory front. since the beginning of the year, we've participated in three productive meetings with fda including a top line meeting to review and gain feedback on initial results from galactic-hf, a type c meeting to elaborate on key aspects of results from galactic-hf and the use of omecamtiv mecarbil informing our approach to an nda submission.
and a pre nda meeting to review results-rather review details of the submission, including such things as specifics of its content and the format of data sets. together, these meetings have been engaging and constructive, and it met our objectives to inform the content and format of our nda submission. we remain on track as we continue to work toward the submission of our nda in the second half of this year, based on the results of galactic-hf in combination with the rest of the development program, comprising over 30 clinical trials and informed by our long standing regulatory discussions.
in parallel, we're also discussing with fda our strategy to enable personalized dose optimization in patients being treated with omecamtiv mecarbil to be available at the time of potential approval, and utilizing the most robust technology and a centralized approach to collect and process sample as well as to make patient data available to physician. we look forward to elaborating on the strategy for optimized, optimal personalized dosing in the future.
as we move closer to our goal of submitting our nda to the fda for the potential approval of omecamtiv mecarbil, our growing teams of medical science liaisons are working to educate hospital based and community cardiologists on the challenge of impaired contractility in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fractions. and we remain committed to helping physicians increase their understanding of the sarcomere and cardiac muscle function. additionally, we've made progress on development of a framework for an investigator sponsored study program, and expect to further elucidate the potential of omecamtiv mecarbil within the treatment armamentarium.
and with that, i'll turn the call over to andrew to elaborate on progress against the go-to-market strategy for omecamtiv mecarbil.
andrew callos -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
thanks fady. during the second quarter, our board of directors endorsed our proposed go-to-market strategy for omecamtiv mecarbil. and since then, we have proceeded in its implementation as we prepare for potential commercial launch in 2022. we put in to present a deep dive into the strategy and how it intersects with our cardiac muscle franchise strategy and planning for the commercial launch of aficamten at an investor day later this year, but today, i will share a few highlights of our progress.
from an organizational development perspective in addition to the stellar team i joined, we are expanding the commercial organization at all levels, with key hires in marketing, health economics and outcomes research, analytics, supply chain logistics and market access. in addition, i anticipate having the full leadership team in place by the end of the summer. as you heard from, fady, the results of the galactic-hf and the secondary analyses provide clarity around a subset of heart failure patients in which the benefit of omecamtiv mecarbil are most concentrated.
that is those with an ejection fraction less than 30 or who can no longer tolerate guideline directed medical therapy due to renal or blood pressure impairment, or those recently hospitalized. those patients likely to derive the most benefit from omecamtiv mecarbil represent 50%, approximately 50% of all heart failure with reduced ejection fraction patients. in addition, our market research test confirmed that they are managed by fewer than 30% of total cardiologist, and in fewer than 15% of total hospitals in the us that treat the majority of these [indecipherable] patients.
targeting this well defined and tractable subset of cardiologists and hospitals also enables us to effectively launch with a lot of size specially cardiology field force. notably, there was also a significant overlap between heart failure and atm directed accounts. specifically, there are approximately 1,100 high value hospitals and centers of excellence, treating both patient populations. so the cardiac muscle directed field force we are building today is purpose driven to leverage infrastructure and relationships we established in support of omecamtiv mecarbil or aficamten in two to three years.
put simply, we expect that our reps will have another product in their bag without need to build an independent field force. furthermore, we recognize and appreciate the high cost burden of heart failure as it represents the most common hospital admission diagnosis for medicare. hospitalizations and readmissions are considerably higher among patients with lower ejection fraction.
and as you may know, these are the patients who become the frequent fliers at hospitals, given their increased risk of rehospitalization, with every subsequent hospitalization events. given the evidence from galactic-hf demonstrating the risk reduction resulting from omecamtiv mecarbil was greatest among patients with low rejection fraction levels, we are evaluating the cost effectiveness potential for patients being potentially treated with omecamtiv mecarbil. finally, it will be critical to our work with payers to ensure patients have access to omecamtiv mecarbil. the current heart failure reimbursement mix is approximately 55%, medicare part d, and approximately 30% commercial payers, we have initiated payer discussions with several of these key stakeholders.
and they're getting a better understanding what drives their decision in the heart failure arena, particularly as they contemplate a host of new branded therapies to treat this patient population. towards this end, we're also developing a distinct value proposition based on the results from galactic-hf. and we believe the well defined patient population with severe heart failure will be a welcome strategy among the pair community.
and with that, i will turn it over to stuart to provide an update on aficamten and next steps in the cardiac myosin inhibitor development program.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president, chief medical officer
thanks andrew. as we announced in today's press release, during the quarter, we received final approval from the world health organization and the united states adopted name council for aficamten to be used as the international nonproprietary name, or ck-3773274. about three weeks ago, we announced a positive top line results from cohorts one and two of redwood-hcm, the phase two clinical trial of aficamten. since we held a dedicated conference call to report the results, i'm not going to go into detail but rather recap the key data and focus on next steps toward opening a phase three clinical trial by the end of this year.
top line results from redwood-hcm demonstrated that treatment with aficamten for 10 weeks resulted in highly statistically significant reductions from baseline compared to placebo, and the average resting and post-valsalva left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradients in both cohorts one and 2o. in cohort 1, which evaluated a lower dose range of five to 10 milligrams, 79% of patients treated with aficamten achieved the target goals of treatment, defined as resting gradient less than 30 millimeters of mercury and post-valsalva gradient less than 50 millimeters of mercury at week 10 compared to 8% for placebo.
in cohort two with studied a higher dose range of 10 to 30 milligrams, 93% of patients treated with aficamten achieved the target goal. patients treated with aficamten experienced decreases in both resting and post-valsalva gradients by week two, and a maximum treatment effects was achieved by week six after completion of dose titration, which was the same for the final visit week at 10. treatment with aficamten was generally well tolerated. the incidence of adverse events was similar between treatment arms.
no serious adverse events were attributed to aficamten. and no treatment interruptions occurred on drug treatment. importantly, we were pleased to see that only one patient experienced a transient decreased in left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%, which required a dose adjustment, but did not result in dose interruption. overall, feedback from the investigators of the trial has been quite positive and enthusiastic, given the magnitude of the treatment effect, the proportion of patients who achieved response criteria and the overall safety and tolerability profile observed.
in the quarter, we initiated the open label extension trial of redwood-hcm, which continues to enroll patients from cohort one and is now enrolling patients with cohort 2. the primary objective of this trial is the evaluation of long term safety of aficamten. and the secondary objectives focus on the evaluation of gradient reduction and pharmacokinetics with long-term administration of aficamten.
we're also conducting a cardiac mri sub study to assess changes in cardiac morphology, function and fibrosis. patients in the open label extension will begin at the lowest dose of five milligrams and will be individually titrated to achieve target gradients, as informed by cohorts one and 2. as a reminder, we still have cohort three in redwood-hcm ongoing, which includes patients treated with aficamten who are also on dicey pyramide as background therapy. this cohort will further inform the inclusion of this small but important patient population in phase 3.
we are moving rapidly begin our phase three clinical trial of aficamten in patients with obstructive hcm in the fourth quarter, continuing preparations that began last december when we obtain results of the cohort one interim analysis from redwood-hcm. during the second quarter, we had a type c meeting with the fda to review our plan for the phase three trial. in that meeting, we reviewed the design endpoints and patient populations, and found the feedback we received enabling of our plans to advance to phase 3.
building on this informative type c meeting, we recently received fda feedback from our end of phase two meeting. after review of the final doses selected for phase 3, namely 5, 10, 15 and 20 milligrams. and our proposal to continue individualize echocardiogram guided dosing. the agency agreed with our dose titration strategy. we also received helpful feedback on other aspects of the overall development program, including non clinical safety, clinical pharmacology, and the preferred format for datasets among other components.
in addition, we initiated interactions with ema during the quarter and received feedback and informed our proposed phase three clinical trial design. we anticipate additional engagements this quarter from hts to further inform our strategy for this program in europe. moreover, under our collaboration with ji xing pharmaceuticals, during the second quarter, ji xing continued enrolling patients in a phase 1study of aficamten in china and prepare for participation in the phase three clinical trial of aficamten in obstructive hcm. as we finalize preparations for our phase three trial and as part of our clinical development program for aficamten, we are now considering the best path forward for a trial in patients with non obstructive hcm and expect to clarify our approach later this year.
and as we have previously stated, in addition to exploring the opportunity to address hyper contractility, in obstructive and non obstructive hcm, we believe there is also a subset of heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction whose underlying cause of their disease is driven by left ventricular hyper contractility and hypertrophy. these patients may also benefit from treatment with an optimized next class cardiac myosin inhibitor. and we remain interested in pursuing this population as the development program matures.
and with that, i'll turn it over to robert wong, who will provide an update on our financials.
robert c. wong -- vice president and chief accounting officer
thanks stuart. i'll first provide an update on cash, revenue and spending. then ching will review our financial outlook, revised financial guidance for 2021 and corporate development strategies looking forward. more details are actual results for the second quarter 2021 is included in the press release, which we released earlier this afternoon. we ended the second quarter with approximately $424 million in cash and investment. our revenues in q2 2021 came primarily from our strategic alliances with amgen and astellas.
our second quarter 2021 r&d expenses increased to $36.4 million from $21.8 million in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to the transition costs related to the termination of our collaboration with amgen, the purchase from amgen of approximately $7.3 million of materials including manufactured quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredients for omecamtiv mecarbil, and increases in spending on our clinical development activities for cardiac myosin inhibitor programs.
more than 70% of our r&d expenses are attributable to our cardiovascular program, as expected given activity for transition from amgen, meteoric-hf in the cardiac myosin inhibitor programs, and the remainder of our expenses was attributable to our early research in skeletal activities. our second quarter 2021 g&a expenses were $21.2 2 million, up from $14.2 million in q2 2020 due to higher personnel related costs, including stock based compensation, and higher commercial readiness spending.
and now ching will review our financial outlook and corporate development strategy.
ching w. jaw -- senior vice president and chief financial officer
thanks robert. as robert indicated, we ended the second quarter with approximately $424 million in cash. in addition, we recently raised approximately $297 million through an equity offering relative expenses. therefore, our pro forma cash today is approximately $721 million, which represents more than three years of cash runway based on our revised net cash utilization guidance of $195 million to $215 million in 2021.
this new guidance includes non recurring new building construction costs of approximately $35 million and assumes receipt of $45 million under our funding agreement with rtw investments. net proceeds from the equity offering will support the conduct of a phase three clinical trial of aficamten in patients with obstructive hcm. expansion of the clinical development program for aficamten to include other indications planned commercial launch activities omecamtiv mecarbil, the conduct of courage-als are now ongoing phase three clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with als, and for research and general corporate purposes, including working capital.
during the second quarter, we also made progress against our twofold corporate development strategy to first seek potential role demonetization in or structure financing deals in order to further support commercial launch of omecamtiv mecarbil and continued development of aficamten. and second to seek a development and commercialization partner for omecamtiv mecarbil and aficamten in complimentary geographies to that where we intend to go to market ourselves.
our partnership priorities our focus to japan was the goal of securing a deal which founds on omecamtiv mecarbil and aficamten to support co founding of a lifecycle management studies, as well as regulatory and commercial activities respectively. our focus will also be to china in order to secure a potential licensing agreement for omecamtiv mecarbil and selectively to europe and other markets to enter into potential agreements with co development and co commercialization partners for omecamtiv mecarbil.
as such, we expect to preserve north america and potentially european rights for development and commercialization. i'm pleased to report that we've had encouraging and productive interactions to advance these strategies. and we look forward to continuing those discussions as may result in a deal or deals in the second half of the year. cytokinetics has always gained access to capital through a diverse array of deal structures. and we continue to believe that our path to commercialization and sustainable cash flows, and profitability will be served by our continued monetization of our leadership in muscle pharmacology, through deal making.
and with that, i'll turn the call back over to robert blum.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, ching. as we look toward the remainder of 2021 and our upcoming milestones, i'm reminded of the vision we established more than two decades ago, it was the time when most pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies were stepping away from research in cardiology, and cytokinetics was boldly pursuing a novel scientific rationale, discovery platform and biology.
now that vision is coming into more refined focus, as we continue to double down on our cardiovascular pipeline, with two muscle biology directed drug candidates, advancing and with several others close behind. and as we make progress in our neuro muscular vertical, based on regulatory, clinical, commercial, and financial clarity. in addition to the clinical, regulatory and commercial progress we made related to omecamtiv mecarbil during the quarter, we successfully reached several agreements to facilitate the transition of the programs for omecamtiv mecarbil and ck-136 from amgen to cytokinetics, including an agreement for the sale and our purchase of approximately two tons of active pharmaceutical ingredient of omecamtiv mecarbil.
as you can imagine, transition activities following a 15 year collaboration takes significant time and attention. and i want to thank my many colleagues who have been engaged diligently in this activity. as we've assumed more responsibilities and built out our teams over the past six to nine months. on the neuromuscular front, we're also pleased to have courage-als underway. and we believe it's designed leverages key learnings from fortitude-als, our phase two clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with als, and as well the dynamics of als therapy development and the urgent needs of the patient community.
with greater efficacy seen in patients whose disease seems to be progressing more rapidly, we believe the design of courage-als is itself enriched toward that patient population accordingly. additionally, based on feedback from patients, and caregivers, and advocates, and payers, as well as healthcare professionals, the design of courage-als incorporates important elements that are intended to remove key barriers to clinical trial participation, including our incorporating remote clinic and home nursing visits, as well as mobile app based endpoint measurements.
importantly, we're working toward a goal to provide continued access to reldesemtiv for patients who complete courage-als, as well as for patients who have previously participated in our als trials. the program is being developed with the objective to ensure ethical and equitable access. we fully recognize the urgency to bring new medicines to people living with als, and we're diligently working with purpose, passion, and compassion.
in summary, we expect that the next 12 to 18 months may be even more transformational for cytokinetics with two positive late stage trials for our lead cardiovascular programs, we look forward to advancing our goal toward nda submission of omecamtiv mecarbil for the potential treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and also starting a phase three clinical trial of aficamten in patients with obstructive hcm. together, these potential medicines may change the treatment landscape for these severe cardiovascular diseases by harnessing the power of myosin modulation, and in that way, offering patients new hope.
now, let me recap our expected milestones for 2021. for omecamtiv mecarbil, we expect to submit an nda to the fda in the second half of 2021. and we expect to complete the conduct of meteoric-hf by year end with results expected in early 2022. for aficamten, we expect to begin a phase three clinical trial of aficamten in patients with obstructive hcm in the fourth quarter of 2021. for reldesemtiv, we expect to continue enrollment of courage-als throughout 2021. and for our ongoing research, we expect to advance programs and conduct ind enabling studies, with one to two potential drug candidates through the remainder of 2021.
and operator, with that we can now open up the call to questions please.

[operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of jason butler with jmp securities.
jason butler -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi, robert, thanks for taking the questions. first one, just based on the regulatory feedback that we have when omecamtiv, can you talk about what you plan to propose to include in the label in terms of the analyses around patients with lower baseline ejection fraction? and then the second question for 274. can you talk about conducted or planned at us regulatory interactions, and specifically how you think including patients from china can help impact enrollment and the regulatory dialogue there? thanks.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so to unpack that, let's start with omecamtiv and you asked a question about our plans. some of this, i'm not going to be able to speak to on this call, of course, but i'll tell you that, for the fact that galactic-hf was a positive clinical trial, we expect that its indication, as we will propose to fda would be inclusive of those patients that participated in the study.
but to your specific question, as would be potentially inclusive in the label of those data, as highlights those patients that benefit the most. and we think there's ample precedent in already approved drugs in heart failure for the inclusion of data, especially as was in our case pre specified for those subpopulations that seem to be doing better than others. i hope that may answer that first question. your second question, i believe related to ck-274 and our plans for regulatory outside the us. is that right?
jason butler -- jmp securities -- analyst
yes, exactly. yes.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
so that's something that is beginning. and i'd say ongoing, i don't think we can yet be as clear minded and definitive about that in light of those being still ongoing conversations. fady, anything you want to add to that?
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
yes, i think only in that our plan is to conduct the phase three outside of north america. so including europe and china, of course. and regulatory interactions to enable that are underway.
robert c. wong -- vice president and chief accounting officer
yes. as it relates to your question about china, our expectation is through our collaboration with xi jing, that they will be ready to go so as to be enabling their enrollment of patients in china as part of the same global registration program, and pivotal study.
operator
your next question comes from the line of dane leone with raymond james.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
hey, how's it going? i'll keep it brief. i just wanted to ask in terms of the fda discussions on omecamtiv, it sounds like you're probably moving forward with a submission with a head of the meteoric data. is that going to be integrated into the submission package at some point? or do you feel like it is not necessarily relevant for the label that you're trying to get approved with fda at this point?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
good question. so we believe that our submission will stand on galactic alone. and that, as meteoric may provide further information, and we won't have that data until 2022, we could then consider whether and this may be occurring post approval, hopefully of omecamtiv. whether then, the label might be then expanded to incorporate that which incorporates results pertaining to omecamtiv in meteoric-hf, but our strategy pivots on galactic-hf.
operator
your next question comes from a line of carter gould with barclays.
carter gould -- barclays -- analyst
good afternoon, robert. great to see all the progress. i guess two questions from us. first off on you've talked in the past around there being a distinction between your phase three and explorer. now that you've had these meetings with fda, does that still hold true? and will that expand beyond the potential inclusion of that population in cohort three of redwood? and then maybe just as we think about finally getting a look at the redwood data presentation at an upcoming medical meeting? can you maybe just give a little bit more color on what other incremental analyses we might see in those upcoming medical presentations? thank you.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. i'll turn it over to fady who may also then turn it over to stuart. but i'll say that for having now a couple of interactions with fda pertaining to ck-274. i think it's affirming of our plans for the phase three trial and fadi and stuart can pick it up from there.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
yes, i mean, our trial design for phase three will certainly borrow from what was conducted with mavacamten and explorer but will be different in other ways. and we'll elaborate on that later in the year. we certainly have, i think, agreement on how we plan to go forward in phase three with fda. and maybe stuart can comment on what we may plan to present at a subsequent medical meeting regarding redwood.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president, chief medical officer
well, we'll certainly plan to expand on the results. we publicize in the recent press release. we'll have details on our baseline characteristics, biomarkers, pharmacokinetic data, and nyha class just as an example. so there's more interesting data to come. thanks for the question.
operator
our next question comes from the line of salim syed with mizuho.
salim syed -- `mizuho -- analyst
good afternoon, robert and team. i think couple of questions on ckt-274. so bristol has had on their call a question on ckt-274 versus mavacamten and just curious they're saying that they don't see differentiation between the two molecules. i'm curious how you guys are seeing it, just everything that we've seen with the published explorer data and everything that you've seen with ckt-274? and for how confident are you that ckt-274 is actually a differentiated molecule?
and is there anything in the phase three data set that you produce that you think can alter that thinking? and then the second question just is in the myosin inhibition in general? just curious how you would perceive an add com if mavacamten were to get one? would it be a net-net negative positive? are you expecting one? or how are you thinking about this generally? thank you.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so very good questions, i'll start and ask my colleagues if they want to add, we do believe we very much believe that these are differentiated molecules. and in fact, if we didn't believe that, we wouldn't be taking aficamten into phase 3. and we've verified that. so it's not just our own thinking. it's verified also by our conversations with key opinion leaders and investigators in the space. but i understand a perspective that was just that the data from redwood are comparable.
what i would underscore is that we believe that some of these things we specifically designed into ck-274 or aficamten, like a more rapid time to onset of activity and enabling better easier dose titration, as well as more rapid reversibility. these are things that enable in the conduct of future clinical trials, the inclusion and exclusion of patients. these are things that are enabling of a clinical trial design that should in fact, further advanced the category and the field.
if we didn't think that these properties of a next class molecule didn't do that, we wouldn't be in a position to invest here, as we expect, could be advancing the field. so we can't elaborate today on what will be those features, and how they play out in a phase three trial. but you'll know that soon enough, when we announced the start of this study, we'll talk about the clinical trial design, and hopefully those will come into more clarity. so i think that's my answer to your first question. your second question, can you remind me?
salim syed -- `mizuho -- analyst
yes, just on the mavacamten add com. do you perceive that as a negative or a positive if mavacamten were to get one?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
why don't i turn to fady maybe to speak to that?
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
yes i frankly don't want to really speculate on whether or not they may or may not get an outcome that's really up to fda to determine and based on the submission that was made. so we will just have to wait and see if they decide to have one.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
there hasn't been any suggestion yet that there will be an add com. so we're certainly not assuming that there should be. but if there is, we'll certainly be prepared to be astute observers, and how that might inform our planning as well.
operator
so your next question comes from the line of chad messer with needham & company.
chad messer -- needham & company -- analyst
hello, great. good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. first of all, congratulations on your first appearance with all these programs, it's great to see you guys have at least three exciting programs that are kind of in play, if you will, and could bring a great benefit to patients. they all have not had the easiest time. just a couple questions on reldesemtiv. you guys are moving forward with the phase 3.
very excited for it. what's been the response from the als community? because they've been waiting around for a while to hear about this. we all have. but i think maybe the patients the most anxiously? and then maybe can you comment on what lessons you learn from fortitude, that you think will make-we're calling it the courage is that right phase three trial higher probability success there?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure, i'll take the first part of that question. i'll ask fady to take the second part. so in terms of the response from the als community, admittedly the community was confused by what had been the delay between the announcement of results of fortitude-als and our start of courage-als. because if you recall, when those results were first announced, they were characterized as among the most promising phase two results ever seen in als.
and that being an international placebo controlled, large study, it showed quite encouraging data lending support for phase 3. but as we committed to shareholders, we wanted to make certain that before we advanced reldesemtiv to phase 3, we had a number of things that we had to accomplish. first, we wanted to discuss those results with fda, but also with payers, both in the us and in europe.
we wanted to discuss a design of a clinical trial, that would be enabling of some looks into the data, as would be enabling of a interim stop for futility if it looked like that was appropriate, and a second interim down the road as could also be expanding of the study. if it looked like that may be warranted. we wanted to understand the cost of the study, and we wanted to renegotiate our collaboration agreement with astellas in order to have them enable our lead in this area, and also their co funding of that trial.
both of those things we negotiated successfully, we wanted to best understand what patients would be looking for in their participation in a clinical trial, because, as you may know, the landscape for trials in als has become more crowded, which is a good thing. but at the same time, we wanted to make certain we could be enrolling our study expeditiously and know that we would have the support of the patient community.
it so happens that in these last couple of years, during this time when we were assessing these matters, the als community has led by certain advocacy groups has become much more assertive and engaged, it's a good thing. and at the same time they've been assessing and evaluating which clinical trials would be best to direct patients to participate in. i'm really pleased to be able to share today that i am als, one of those advocacy groups that does rate clinical trials, gave our trial courage-als, its highest rating. and there are only a couple of trials that have that five star rating.
they look at this design in terms of what's in the best interest of patients, and they scored it among their highest ever clinical trials. so all of these things we wanted to line up before we started this trial, in order to make certain that we could finish what we started, and do so to give the drug and patients the best chance for success here. and i think we did that well. and hence we've started courage-als.
now, with that said, i'll turn it over to fady to answer the second part of your question.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
hey, chad. with respect to the design of courage and how it may have a higher probability of success, i think, you have to look back to our conduct of fortitude, which you mentioned, to begin with, fortitude was a pretty sizable study in als, it enrolled over 450 patients, we had, i think, compelling signals of the slowing of decline in both the primary endpoint of this phase three study the als frs as well as in slow vial capacity. and those signals were strengthened when you looked at patients that came into the study that were progressing more quickly than others.
and so in designing courage as others are doing now with als is focusing on enrolling patients that whose disease may be they are crossing more rapidly, and other things that we've done in the design to optimize, we think its chances for success. so we're fairly encouraged, based on both the precedent for the two day als as well as well as the way we've implemented it encourage.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
from a portfolio standpoint, it was incumbent upon also to know that when we're advancing reldesemtiv in als, it's occurring alongside of the advancement of our pipeline for new cardiovascular medicines. so when omecamtiv mecarbil moving forward, as well as aficamten moving forward, we believe is enabling of our advancement of reldesemtiv in key ways. and as is in the interest of diversified product development risk, as well as hopefully maximizing potential shareholder value.
chad messer -- needham & company -- analyst
great, thank you. i appreciate those answers on omecamtiv and once again, congrats on getting to a place with all three major programs as well as the other things you're working on.

your next question comes from the line of jeff hung with morgan stanley.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, robert, thanks for taking the questions. just to clarify jason's question earlier on omecamtiv mecarbil. are you going for a broad label? or would you expect that the label will focus on the more severe patients specifically calling out patients with a lower ejection fraction?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
yes again, i'm not going to be so elaborative to our strategy, but i think it's fair to say that our intention, our objective is to go for a broader label. but as would also be inclusive of those data and results that are highlighting where the effects are more maximal. and as such provide physicians more information as to guide therapy.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thanks. and then can you talk about the feedback that fda has provided at the type c and pre nda meeting on your plans to submit the nda on galactic data? has there been any pushback about the focus on the more severe patients? and have they suggested that any additional clinical work might need to be done or do they seem completely on board that the available data is sufficient? thanks.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
so good questions. we believe in the multiple interactions, we've had with fda, this year that we have heard what we need to hear in order to lend support for what i just said, which is to say, we believe that this filing should be built around galactic-hf. and the results in data that i am highlighting in particular and including of those patients that may stand to benefit the most.

our next question comes from a line of emanuela branchetti with h.c. wainwright.
emanuela branchetti -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
hello, good afternoon, guys. and thank you for taking my question. so you touched upon these maybe earlier, but can you share some of the feedbacks you receive from the kol regarding the results obtained with redwood perhaps in relation to the differentiation from other accounting and debt expectations around the design and the target population for the upcoming phase 3?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so specifically your question relates to feedback we've received on the aficamten and how it may set the stage for phase 3.
emanuela branchetti -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
correct.
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
yes, i think in presenting these results to our steering committee, we haven't obviously, since we haven't presented them more broadly, we've focused on those that were involved in the trial. they were really quite pleased with the profile, what we saw a number of responders, the magnitude of effect, evidence of reversibility, and the overall safety profile that we observed in the phase two trial. i think all of those things, lend themselves to the design that we will implement in phase 3, which, as i said, will elaborate at a later time. but overall, the feedback was quite enthusiastic.
emanuela branchetti -- h.c. wainwright -- analyst
got it. and switching gears to reldesemtiv. it's nice to see the drug beginning the few self study as planned. and i know it's early, but i was hoping you could give more color around the expected timeline for the enrollment. i saw you incorporated in the design, remote visits. and so i just was just wondering, based on your experience with governmental als patients, do you expect the covid-19 to have an impact on the trial? and so when should we expect the interim analysis to occur?
fady i. malik -- executive vice president of research and development
well, i'll start off turning over stuart a little bit, but i think it's still very early to speculate on the timing for the trial. we've just literally starting to screen patients. we're still in the process of getting sites up and going. i think once we start to see the pace of enrollment, we can maybe provide some better estimated timing. stuart, do you want to add anything to that?
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president, chief medical officer
well, i will add is that we've all learned a lot about conducting clinical trials in a pandemic. i think on other programs, we managed reasonably well with respect to meteoric, and redwood-hcm. but there have been lessons learned. and we've designed courage-als to as much as possible, pre-empt issues related to disruptions from the pandemic, and large part that includes a large portion of home visits. or for patients who enroll courage-als.
so we've very proactively specifically designed the trial to unburden patients. so they won't have to in most of the-for most of the study visits actually to have to present themselves in person in a clinic. so all of this has been anticipated. we incorporated these features into the study design, and we hope that will bode well for managing any further bumps in the road related to pandemic.

hey, robert and team how are you? thank you very much for the update and congrats on the progress. i was curious about earlier comments you made in the call about your early experience with commercial payers. i believe that was in relationship to omecamtiv mecarbil. i was wondering if you could share any of the insights from that early experience, certainly, there's still some time to go but wondering what the initial feedback has been.
and then secondly, i wanted to get a sense of and i might have missed this before. so my apologies, as you think about the clinical trial design for aficamten. how similar or how different might that be from the mavacamten phase 3, as you could expect, many of us will be trying to see how apples to apples it may be and it doesn't have to be. but i'm just curious if you could give us some high level thoughts around how you're thinking about that phase3 trial?
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so i'll ask andrew to tackle the first question, which is relating to early feedback and perspectives relating to payers. and then maybe i'll ask stuart to comment on the second part of your question relating to the trial for aficamten. andrew?
andrew callos -- executive vice president, chief commercial officer
sure, robert. so the payer meetings, we've had about a half a dozen payer meetings across large pbms, med d, and commercial, most of the meetings have been introductory in nature introductory, our company, our science, and our people. and we felt we have more and substantial interaction scheduled as the year progresses. and we totally anticipate filing for in december for maybe, inclusion in the 2023 reimbursement and access team. so overall, the interactions have been positive, but early.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
yes, i'd say that, in large part, these meetings are focused to socializing the science, introducing the company; we want to make sure we're on their radar screen, as you can well imagine they do budgeting and other activities in anticipation of new product launches. and those things are already underway. now the second part of your question related to the phase three design of aficamten and how it might compare to mavacamten.
and whether this is going to be an apples and oranges or an apples and apples, and i'll tell you, we believe that for the fact that redwood-hcm delivered on its next in class profile, that we need to design a study that is advancing the field, and therefore it should be apples and apples, but there are different kinds of apples. and with that, i'll just see if stewart wants to add anything more.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president, chief medical officer
only that we certainly have learned a lot from the redwood-hcm trial, as well as the explorer trial. and we'll take those learnings into our study design for phase 3. we're not really prepared to offer any details, or discuss those in today's call. the study design details will be forthcoming later this year.
robert i. blum -- president and chief executive officer
you won't have to wait very long. we're going to be providing those details soon enough now that we've had these recent interactions with fda and we can lock in on the protocol. we expect to begin this study soon. and we'll elaborate on those design elements soon.

i will now turn the call over to joanna siegall, cytokinetics' senior manager of corporate communications and investor relations. please, go ahead.
joanna siegall -- senior manager of corporate communications & investor relations
good afternoon and thanks for joining us on the call today. robert blum, our president and chief executive officer will begin with an overview of the quarter and recent developments; then fady malik, our evp of research and development will provide an update on omecamtiv mecarbil including recently presented additional analyses from galactic-hf, as well as an update on our ongoing next steps with the fda. next, stuart kupfer, our svp and chief medical officer will provide an update on our development program for aficamten by recapping the results from cohorts 1 and 2 of redwood-hcm, elaborating on continuing activities in redwood-hcm and reviewing the design of sequoia-hcm, our planned phase 3 clinical trial of aficamten in patients with obstructive hcm. he will also speak to initial progress in courage-als, our ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with als. then, andrew callos, our evp and chief commercial officer will discuss our go-to-market strategy for omecamtiv mecarbil and our cardiovascular franchise development plans for the commercialization of aficamten. robert wong, our vp and chief accounting officer will provide a financial overview for the past quarter; and ching jaw, our svp and chief financial officer will discuss strategic planning, our financial outlook and corporate development strategies before robert blum will provide concluding thoughts and expected key milestones for the remainder of 2021.
please note that portions of the following discussion including our responses to questions contain statements that relate to future events and performance rather than historical facts and constitute forward-looking statements. our actual results might differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. additional information concerning factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements is contained in our sec filings, including our current report regarding our third quarter 2021 financial results filed on form 8-k today. we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after this call.
now, i will turn the call over to robert.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, joanna, and thanks again to everyone for joining us on the call today. we had a very productive third quarter marked by meaningful progress across all of our later stage programs. most notably, our sharing positive results from our phase 2 clinical trial redwood-hcm which demonstrated the efficacy and the safety of aficamten, our next-in-class drug candidate in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. as we've said, these results met our high expectations for this trial and we received positive feedback from the physician community. stuart will elaborate more on these results in a moment.
during the third quarter, we are also pleased to complete enrollment in cohort 3 of redwood-hcm, which as you'll recall, enrolled patients also on disopyramide, a medication, often prescribed to patients with more severe hcm. we expect to share the results from cohort 3 in the first quarter of 2022. following previous interactions with fda from which we received feedback on our planned trial design, we continue to advance activities in preparation for sequoia-hcm, the phase 3 clinical trial of aficamten in patients with obstructive hcm. as we recently presented and as stuart will elaborate, this trial was designed to potentially demonstrate a significant improvement in exercise capacity and evaluate safety in a broad population of patients with symptomatic obstructive hcm. we're working with sites around the world including many who participated in redwood-hcm who are enthusiastic about also participating in sequoia-hcm and we look forward to starting this trial soon.
moving now to our heart failure program. we continued activity supportive of our plans to submit an nda for omecamtiv mecarbil and we remain on track toward our goal of submission in this fourth quarter of this year. fady will have more to say about that in a moment. additionally, as outlined in our recent analyst and investor day, we're making significant progress in refining and executing our go-to-market strategies for omecamtiv mecarbil across several work streams that andrew will elaborate on in a moment. these commercial readiness activities represent a tremendous scope of work from our growing commercial organization and supporting our go-to-market strategies as well as our intention to build a cardiovascular business franchise by leveraging common denominators and synergies across our business, inclusive of our plans both for the potential launch of omecamtiv mecarbil and a potential future launch of aficamten.
as fady will discuss, in the third quarter, we presented additional results from galactic-hf highlighted by an analysis of black patients enrolled in galactic-hf, showing that the treatment effect of omecamtiv mecarbil in black patients was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population and also similar to the effect observed in white patients in the trial. this finding is important due to the fact that black patients tend to have a higher risk of heart failure and often have worse outcomes. additionally, an analysis of the severe heart failure subgroup in galactic-hf was published in the journal of the american medical association cardiology, illuminating a larger treatment effect when compared to the overall population of patients studied. this important manuscript was accompanied by an editorial suggesting recognition of a new classification for a group of severe heart failure patients who still prevailing high unmet need represents an increasing patient population with heart failure that contributes more and more to the clinical and the economic burden of this disease.
finally, we were pleased in the most recent quarter to begin enrolling patients encouraged als our phase 3 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in patients with als. the results from the phase 2 clinical trial fortitude-als were deemed compelling by investigators and physicians who treat patients with als and our advancement to phase 3 is an exciting and important step forward for this program as is aligned with our dedication to the als communities. the als communities are more assertively seeking new medicines and the fda and public policymakers seem to be increasingly responding to these louder calls for action.
it is an incredibly important time for our company. we're building our teams and capabilities as we are now on the precipice of a powerful transformation from an r&d company into one that is also a commercial organization. it has always been our strategic vision to ourselves deliver on the promise of our science and we're closer now to that than ever before. these are exciting times to be sure, but how we execute on those plans will matter. robert will speak to our current financials and ching will comment on our progress and prospects in continuation of our long-standing practice to diversify our access to capital through both partnering and structured financings as is informed by annual strategic planning.
with that, i'll turn the call over now to fady to elaborate on developments related to omecamtiv mecarbil.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
thanks, robert. as you mentioned, results from additional analyses of galactic-hf presented during the quarter at the heart failure society of america annual scientific meeting reinforce that outcomes with omecamtiv mecarbil in black patients enrolled in galactic-hf were consistent with the overall population and like the overall study results were driven primarily by a reduction heart failure hospitalizations and heart failure events. the treatment effect in black patients was also similar compared to white patients. galactic-hf enrolled the most black patients among recent heart failure trials and of patients enrolled in the u.s., 29% were black, which is important not only because black patients have historically been underrepresented in clinical research, but also because they have a higher risk of heart failure and suffered worse outcome. this disparity now comes as complex but it's encouraging to see that the potential benefit of treatment with omecamtiv mecarbil remains consistent in this group.
expanding on the theme of higher risk patients with heart failure, three weeks ago, a manuscript entitled assessment of omecamtiv mecarbil for the treatment of patients with severe heart failure was published in jama cardiology, following on the heels of the initial data presentation in late june at heart failure 2021 and international congress of the european society of cardiology. the analysis by dr. michael felker and co-authors looked at the treatment effects of omecamtiv mecarbil on the primary composite endpoint in patients from galactic-hf, classified as having severe heart failure based on modified criteria from the heart failure association of the european society of cardiology, advanced heart failure physician statement. patients in this subgroup had nyha class iii/iv symptoms, efs [phonetic] of less than or equal to 30% and hospitalization for heart failure within the prior six months. approximately 30% of patients enrolled in galactic-hf met these criteria and had event rates [phonetic] that were approximately twice those patients without severe heart failure.
in this post-hoc analysis, those with severe heart failure who received omecamtiv mecarbil experienced a significant treatment benefit for the primary endpoint with a hazard ratio of 0.80, whereas patients without severe heart failure had no significant treatment benefit with the hazard ratio of 0.99. the results for cardiovascular death were qualitatively similar. patients with heart failure that was severe experienced a trend toward treatment benefit from omecamtiv mecarbil while patients without severe heart failure did not. omecamtiv mecarbil was equally well-tolerated in patients with and without severe heart failure, with no significant changes in blood pressure, renal function, or potassium compared to placebo.
accompanying this manuscript was an editorial authored by doctors clyde yancy, adrian hernandez and gregg fonarow titled identifying treatments for stage c2 heart failure, in which stage c2 is proposed as a new addition to the currently defined four stages of heart failure a through d and as would encapsulate, these severe heart failure patients who may be a priority for additional impactful therapy. this high unmet need was a focus of our panel discussion at our recent analyst and investor day despite the availability and adherence to guideline directed medical therapy or gdmt, patients with worsening heart failure still have high event rates. as we heard from doctors alanna morris and tarek hamad [phonetic] who were both specialists in heart failure at major academic medical centers, it can be a challenge to get patients on gdmt because many are unable to tolerate their medications due to side effects.
with omecamtiv mecarbil with a potential add-on therapy with a novel mechanism of action, that could be used as a complement to and alongside existing therapies without increasing cardiac mortality. physicians' feedback has indicated that their view is positive toward the clinical utility of omecamtiv mecarbil as an additional therapeutic option with good safety and tolerability profile, and that there is a clear need for therapy like omecamtiv mecarbil to fit into regular practice.
moving on, we completed enrollment in meteoric-hf at the end of the second quarter and we continued conduct of the trial in the third quarter. this trial will provide insight as to how omecamtiv mecarbil could benefit another key aspect of improving the lives of people with heart failure, which is to improve their exercise capacity. the common concern of patients with heart failure is their inability or difficulty with everyday task, but current treatments have little to no impact on exercise capacity and stamina. we expect to complete meteoric-hf this year and look forward to reporting results in early 2022.
also in the third quarter, we conducted meetings with fda to support a preparation and submission of our new drug application, our nda for omecamtiv mecarbil. we completed a pre-nda meeting which confirmed the suitability for submission of content related to chemistry [phonetic] manufacturing and control, clinical pharmacology and the non-clinical program as well as the format of data sets, the integrated summary of safety and other components of the nda. we also had a meeting with fda to discuss the assay for plasma concentrations of omecamtiv mecarbil in terms of its potential need to guide dosing as well as the regulatory pathway for its implementation. in sum, these meetings provided guidance to some of the contents of our nda, which is on track for submission this quarter.
as we approach our goal of submitting our nda to the fda, we also continued simultaneously growing the scope and reach of our medical affairs activities by hiring therapeutic area lead medical directors and deploying additional field-based medical scientists. we have developed a compliant framework for an investigator-sponsored studies program, which is timely as we have started to receive requests for potential collaborative activities. the team is working on finalizing their scientific platform for omecamtiv mecarbil, which forms the basis for communications with medical professionals. we also initiated vendor selection for the development of a medical contact center to be prepared to respond and request for medical information or to direct questions to the proper personnel for response.
with that, i'll turn the call over to stuart to provide an update on aficamten and reldesemtiv.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president & chief medical officer
thanks, fady. during the third quarter, in september, we presented the full results from cohorts 1 and 2 of redwood-hcm, the phase 2 clinical trial of aficamten at the heart failure society of america annual scientific meeting in denver. as we've mentioned, the results were positive and support our advancing aficamten to phase 3, which i'll touch on in a moment. as we previously shared, in redwood-hcm treatment with aficamten for 10 weeks resulted in statistically significant reductions from baseline, compared to placebo and the average resting left ventricular outflow tract for lvot, pressure gradient and the average post-valsalva lvot gradient.
the majority of patients treated with aficamten, 79% in cohort 1 and 93% in cohort 2 achieved the target goal of treatment defined as the rest of the gradient [phonetic] less than 30 millimeters of mercury and post-valsalva gradient less than 50 millimeters of mercury at week 10, compared to 8% for placebo. these reductions in lvot gradient were dose-dependent with patients achieving greater reductions of lvot gradient with increasing doses of aficamten. reductions in lvot gradient occurred within two weeks of initiating treatment, were maximized within two to six weeks of the start of dose titration and were sustained until the end of treatment at 10 weeks.
reversibility of lvot gradient and lv ejection fraction reductions were observed after discontinuation of aficamten with levels returning to baseline at the end of the two-week wash-out period. patients also experienced statistically significant reductions in nt-probnp and treatment with aficamten was associated with an improvement in new york heart association functional class with a substantial number of patients improving by at least one class.
as previously stated, treatment with aficamten was well-tolerated. the incidents of adverse events was similar between treatment arms and there were no treatment-related serious adverse events. importantly, there were no treatment interruptions or discontinuations. doctor martin maron, director of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy center at tufts university school of medicine who presented the results of redwood-hcm at hfsa underscored the potential clinical utility of aficamten based on the elimination of resting lvot gradients in nearly all patients. doctor maron further commented on the substantial improvement in heart failure symptoms, rapid onset and reversibility of effect, the ability to use precise echo-guided titration and the lack of dosing interruptions for low ejection fraction.
at the conference, we also received a positive reaction from physicians who manage patients with hcm and expressing their enthusiasm about the results and for a medication that potentially could be used for patients who have symptomatic obstructive hcm and are not responding to current standard of care therapies. overall, we're very encouraged by the results so far and their potential translation to clinical practice.
during the quarter we also completed enrollment in cohort 3 of redwood-hcm in which patients with obstructive hcm who are receiving disopyramide as background therapy are treated with aficamten in an open-label manner. this cohort will further inform the potential inclusion of this small, but important patient population in our planned phase 3 trial. in addition, during the third quarter, we continued enrolling patients in redwood-hcm ole, the open label extension trial of redwood-hcm.
with the positive results in hand from redwood-hcm, we have been actively engaging in start-up activities for sequoia-hcm, our planned phase 3 clinical trial of aficamten in patients with obstructive hcm. at our analyst and investor day meeting in october, we presented the design of the trial, which i'll recap at a high level now. sequoia-hcm is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled international clinical trial designed to evaluate aficamten in patients with symptomatic obstructive hcm on background medical therapy for 24 weeks. the primary objective is to evaluate the change from baseline to week 24 in peak oxygen uptake or peak vo2, measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing or cpet, which is a measure of exercise capacity. among the secondary objectives we are investigating the change in kansas city, cardiomyopathy questionnaire clinical symptom score. in new york heart association functional class at week 12 to evaluate a potentially early improvement in heart failure symptoms and again at week 24.
we plan to randomize 270 patients in a one-to-one ratio to aficamten or placebo, in addition to standard of care. each patient will receive up to four escalating doses of aficamten or placebo with dose optimization based on achievement of echocardiographic targets. the starting dose will be 5 milligrams once daily, escalating to 10, 15 or 20 milligrams once daily as needed to achieve target gradients. these four doses were selected based on the results from redwood-hcm to facilitate selection of the optimal dose for each patient and maximize the individual benefit risk profile. study start-up activities, regulatory filings and irb submissions are underway with the first site initiations already completed. drug product availability in early 2022 will enable the commencement of screening and enrollment of the first patients in this trial.
in anticipation of enrolling patients with obstructive hcm from china in sequoia-hcm, we continue to collaborate closely with our partner ji xing pharmaceutical. ji xing recently completed phase 1 study, evaluating single and multiple doses of aficamten in healthy chinese subjects. the pharmacokinetic results were similar to those observed in the caucasian populations enrolled in our phase 1 study of aficamten conducted in the u.s. and similarly showed dose proportional pharmacokinetics with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to placebo. the results of this study supports submission of the clinical trial application and enrollment of patients with obstructive hcm in china.
on the neuromuscular front. as robert mentioned, during the third quarter, we began enrolling patients in courage-als, the phase 3 clinical trial of reldesemtiv in als. courage-als will enroll approximately 555 patients with als randomized two-to-one to receive reldesemtiv or placebo for 24 weeks, followed by a 24-week period in which all patients will receive reldesemtiv. the primary endpoint is the change from baseline to 24 weeks in als-frs-r, a functional rating scale that indicates the progression of als. as we designed courage-als, we incorporated feedback from patients and caregivers to remove key barriers to clinical trial participation and to help make the patient experience less burdensome. we are also working to provide continued access to reldesemtiv for all patients who complete courage-als, as well as patients who have previously participated in our als trial, reflective of our goal to ensure ethical and equitable access for patients who are in need.
with that, i will turn the call over to andrew to discuss our progress against the go-to-market strategy for omecamtiv mecarbil.
andrew callos -- chief commercial officer
thanks, stuart. during the third quarter, we advanced our go-to-market strategy for omecamtiv mecarbil and we were pleased to present it at our recent analyst investor day. there are a few highlights to this strategy i'd like to review on today's call. first, our go-to-market strategy is based on a gated build with a planned total investment to be titrated over time as de-risking events occur such as nda submission, nda filing and approval by the fda. to illustrate, we have around 10% to 15% of our planned commercial ftes in place today and we will have less than one-third of the total number in place post-nda submission. this level of commercial hires are sufficient for launch preparation.
as robert mentioned, we hired a seasoned team to implement this go-to-market strategy and we now have our full leadership team in place as well as our account manager team who call on payers [phonetic] in nearly all of our marketing organization. the go-to-market strategy is based on four key pillars: insights, education, access and support. insight speaks to having a very deep understanding of who the worsening heart failure patient is, where they are treated and who the cardiologist are who treat them. education means that if omecamtiv mecarbil is approved, then we need to ensure that cardiologist clearly understand the data supporting our label including the evidence supporting omecamtiv mecarbil's potential benefit for the subset of patients who have worsening heart failure. access speaks to our plans to have affordable copays for most patients as soon as possible after launch. and finally, support entails the programs that we will have and provide for patients like copay support for commercial patients, patient assistance program and educational services.
to support our goal of affordable access, our payer account management team has met with every major payer in the third quarter. we have introduced our team and our company while engaging payers in a mutual understanding of the unmet need to heart failure. to further support access, our health economics and outcome research colleagues continue events outcomes research with the goal of multiple publications in 2022. these publications are targeted documenting the value of omecamtiv mecarbil as illustrated by meaningful reductions in resource utilization, intensity and cost. and we are preparing for the potential launch of omecamtiv mecarbil, we are simultaneously building our cardiovascular franchise strategy toward our plan for the potential launch of aficamten, keeping in mind our corporate goal of bringing multiple medicines to market in the next several years.
this strategy relies on several synergies. first, in the cardiologist to treat these patients, there is an 80% overlap between the cardiologist who treat patients with heart failure and hcm. cost efficiency is another synergy where we will sphere [phonetic] field sales, field medical, shared services and systems across the entire organization. once we have established relationships and built system to support the launch of omecamtiv mecarbil, we are well-positioned to accelerate and streamline the potential launch of aficamten. it is an incredibly exciting time to be working at cytokinetics as we continue to grow our team and advance our plans, it remains important for us to remember the driving force behind this patients and the clear unmet need in both heart failure and hcm.
and with that, i'll turn it over to robert wong, who will provide an update to our financials.
robert wong -- vice president & chief accounting officer
thanks, andrew. i'll provide an update on cash, revenue and spending and then ching will review our financial outlook and corporate development strategy. more details on our actual results for the third quarter 2021 are included in the press release, which we released earlier this afternoon. we ended the third quarter with approximately $668.9 million in cash and investments. our revenue in third quarter of 2021 came primarily from our recognizing a $5 million milestone from ji xing pharmaceuticals in anticipation of the start of sequoia-hcm. our third quarter 2021 r&d expenses increased to $48.4 million from $24.2 million in the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to increases in spending for our clinical development activities for our cardiac muscle inhibitor programs. in addition, we incurred transition costs related to the termination of our collaboration with amgen and our purchase from amgen of approximately $7.3 million of materials including manufactured quantities of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for omecamtiv mecarbil, thereby completing our purchase commitment.
more than 70% of our r&d expenses were attributable to our cardiovascular programs, as expected, given activity-related to transitions from our collaborations with amgen, but purchased manufactured quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient, ongoing activities associated with meteoric-hf and also our cardiac myosin inhibitor program, including the ongoing activities associated with redwood-hcm and start-up activities related to sequoia-hcm. the remainder of our expenses were attributable to our early research and skeletal muscle program activity.
our third quarter 2021 g&a expenses were $26.2 million, up from $12.3 million in the third quarter of 2020, due primarily to an increase in outside spending in anticipation of our potential commercial launch of omecamtiv mecarbil in 2022. personnel-related costs including stock-based compensation and facilities costs related to our new building.
and now, ching will review our financial outlook and corporate development strategies.
ching jaw -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
thanks, robert. as is our annual practice, we recently conducted a comprehensive strategic planning process with subsequent presentation and discussion with our board. this year, the strategic plan was focused to prioritizing on our expanding clinical pipeline to ensure that we focus on r&d programs that leverage our core competencies and competitive advantages in muscle biology and also address high unmet need opportunities that may afford [phonetic] high return on investment potential. in addition, we pressure-tested plans to enrich our research pipeline with external collaborations that could complement and strengthen our internal innovation. lastly, we focused in this year's strategic planning process to critically evaluating and reformulating our cardiovascular and neuromuscular business franchise strategy, that should continually capitalize on lifecycle management of our most advanced drug candidates omecamtiv mecarbil, aficamten and reldesemtiv.
to recap our cash position, we ended the third quarter was approximately $669 million in cash which includes $297 million raised in q3 through an std [phonetic] offering net of expenses. therefore, our pro forma cash at year-end 2021 is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $610 million, which represents more than three years of cash runway using our revised net cash utilization guidance of $195 million to $215 million in 2021. with the potential commercial launch of omecamtiv mecarbil and the funding of two phase 3 clinical trials, sequoia-hcm and courage-als, we do expect our 2022 and 2023 cash burn rate to increase relative to 2021 spending. and we will provide guidance on this in our fourth quarter earnings call and to occur in early 2022.
as we have stated, we continue to seek ways to strengthen our balance sheet and in the third quarter, we have advanced partnering and structure financing discussions aligned with our corporate development strategy. during the quarter, we continue our discussions with potential co-development and co-commercialization partners for omecamtiv mecarbil as well as aficamten with priority attention to business development in asia and other complementary geographies where we don't intend to go to market ourselves.
our plan is to preserve north american and potentially european rights for development and commercialization for both omecamtiv mecarbil and aficamten. in parallel, we have also been advancing discussions with multiple entities and funds with share interest related to structure financings, including royalty monetization and a structure debt deals to further support the commercial launch of omecamtiv mecarbil in our continued and expanded development objectives for aficamten.
our goal is to complete these deals in the fourth quarter which could enable us to end the year with two to three years of forward cash runway, even as we expect the spending in 2022 and 2023 to be higher than our expected spending this year. as you know, we have always built our business on a strong financial foundation and we have an established history of making non-equity dilutive deals to support our continued growth and progress. with transactions expected to close this quarter, we believe we are positioned financially and strategically to ask that you -- the potential launch of omecamtiv mecarbil and continue to advance our pipeline and business franchise strategies.
and with that, i will turn the call back over to robert blum.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, ching. within our vision 2025 that we set forth in 2020, we laid out several goals including achieving regulatory approvals for at least two drugs arising from our pipeline and expanding our discovery platforms. over the past quarter, in addition to the clinical, regulatory and commercial progress we made, we also engaged in activities to broaden our research footprint in the years to come. thinking even beyond 2025, we continue to forge ahead as leaders in muscle biology with focus to populations of high unmet need. in the next year, you'll be hearing more about our activities as we've extended our muscle biology focus from the biomechanics of muscle contractility to the energetics growth and metabolism of muscle with novel mechanism drug candidates advancing in development.
while much of our focus has been on our programs in cardiovascular disease, as you heard with our starting courage-als, our commitment to the als communities remains strong. along these lines, we also recently donated data from our completed clinical trials in als to the pro-act database, which stands for pooled resource open access als clinical trials. pro-act is available to members of the research community and it contains over 10,000 de-identified clinical patient records from multiple completed clinical trials, providing a powerful tool to advance research in the als field and also to gather observations related to disease progression and epidemiologic data. we will be donating data from three completed trials in als: benefit-als, vitality-als and fortitude-als, which represents data from almost 600 patients. we're pleased to be working with the als association with price for life and with the neurologic clinical research institute at mass general to share these data with the als communities to which we are altogether so importantly dedicated.
further, demonstrating our commitment to patient communities, during the quarter, we renewed our partnership with cure sma to increase education, awareness, public policy and fund-raising for spinal muscular atrophy; and we also announced the fourth annual cytokinetics communications fellowship grants program, which we'll award a total of $100,000 in grants to patient advocacy organizations in heart failure in hcm, in als and in sma to support increased capacity in communications and outreach.
as we near the end of 2021, we look back on our very gratifying progress and achievements and we look ahead to what may be a watershed year for our company. we expect to end 2021 with two distinct programs advancing in phase 3 clinical trials with our first potential medication moving toward a potential approval and commercial launch, and all of that happening on the foundation of continued innovations in muscle biology, directed to patients who rely upon us and in areas for which our leadership offers hope for diseases associated with muscle dysfunction and weakness. we look forward to providing more updates on our continued progress and we welcome your questions and feedback.
now, let me recap our expected milestones for the remainder of 2021. for omecamtiv mecarbil, we expect to submit an nda to the fda in this fourth quarter of this year. we also expect to complete the conduct of meteoric-hf by year-end with results expected in early 2022. for aficamten, we expect to continue with study start-up with regulatory filings with irb submissions and site readiness activities altogether for sequoia-hcm and with availability of drug product in early 2022, we anticipate commencement of screening and enrollment of the first patients in that trial. and for reldesemtiv, we expect to complete enrollment of courage-als throughout the remainder of this year. and for our ongoing research, we expect to advance new muscle-directed compounds and to conduct ind-enabling studies and to potentially advance one to two potential drug candidates into clinical development over the next year.
operator, with that update, we can now open the call up to questions, please.

[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of dane leone with raymond james.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello, dane.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
great. hi, robert, and team. thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on all the updates. just two for me, if you will. firstly, can you give us any more color in terms of the scale and scope of the sequoia-hcm study as we think about: one, modeling expenses; and two, time to run the study? is it fair to use the explorer-hcm study as a similar proxy and scale and scope for the patients required an enrollment? and then my second question would be just to drill down a little bit more on the submission for omecamtiv. i know it's been asked before, but in terms of updating your communications back and forth with the fda, any additional color in terms of the scope or scale of the label as it relates to baseline left ventricular ejection fraction? thank you.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
sure. good questions. so i'll start and turn it over to fady. he may also ask stuart to elaborate. i don't think we're going to provide any specific financial guidance with regard to sequoia, it may be premature to do that until we start dosing patients, but certainly we can give you some things to hold on to with regard to your projections for instance. what might be our expectations in terms of time for enrollment and duration of the study. i hope that could be helpful and certainly you know already the number of patients, we aim to enroll. so why don't i turn it over to fady to talk to you about how we think it's going to enroll the number of sites. the number of countries, things like that and then most likely once we start dosing presumably that will be in early 2022 will be at a better position to point to how we think it's going to be affecting our spending, and then we'll come back to your second question.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
all right. thanks, robert. i think we plan to enroll approximately 70 patients in 2 sequoia which is a little bit more than was in roles and explore. i think the size and scope are comparable and certainly the number of sites and things like that. we will probably go to a few more sites than they did in explore nearly a dozen countries and well over north of 80 sites. i think ultimately, when we get study fully up and going. so our plan is to push hard and to enroll this as quickly as possible. but there are certain i think limitations in terms of study start-up and things like that that are hard to press once we have sites up and going, i think it would actually enrolled very rapidly.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
so then, your second question related to the nda and how we're approaching what could be that which is contained within the fda indication statement and otherwise. in particular, around ejection fraction. and as we've stated, we do believe that patients with the ef less than 30% are seemingly benefiting a great deal more than other patients in galactic and we do think that it's in the interest of omecamtiv mecarbil in patients with heart failure, that's where the label should point. so we are hopeful that that data including graphics could be included in the label ultimately upon potential approval, but that's obviously going to be subject to fda review, but based on conversations. we've been having in fady can elaborate. we do feel encouraged that that would be supportive and consistent with other things the fda has done. fady anything you want to add.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
no, i mean, i think we've had those discussions with fda obviously what ends up in the label will be the outcome of the negotiations at the time that we negotiate the label. but in general, i think there are supportive of the concept, that the label should indicate where the benefit of the drug is concentrated and that provides physicians with the information needed to best use the drug and in that context. yes, an important, obviously an important indicator.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
not only the label. i might suspect that could ultimately inform how omecamtiv mecarbil could be incorporated into guidelines also and you got a sense of that from some of the publications that fady referred to in his statements.
dane leone -- raymond james -- analyst
excellent. thank you very much and congratulations.

your next question comes from the line of joe pantginis with hc wainwright.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello joe.
joe pantginis -- hc wainwright -- analyst
hey everybody, good afternoon. thanks for taking the questions. i wanted to focus. my first question and the concept that you guys are really in an important execution and logistics time for the company. so with that said, i'll even go off of want to stuart's comments and robert you said it to about drug availability for sukhoi early next year and executing courage as well. do you feel you've had to plan anything above and beyond for these studies, no matter what it is, including drug availability based on any anticipated issues around the global supply chain problems that we're seeing right now.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
very good question and i think that might be the first time on one of these earnings call that we really did get a question about the supply chain. it's an area of intense focus for us right now as we're not only embarking on these large phase iii studies, but we're readying for the supply of omecamtiv into the marketplace and obviously had, we still been partnered with amgen, that would be something we'd have relied on them for, but now it's our responsibility. and we are executing well on contracts as well as conversion of drug substance to drug product and the like and the study start-up activities for sequoia are proceeding nicely, we moved very swiftly from having completed cohorts one and 2 reading out there results, having meetings with fda and readying to start sequoia all of that occurring in a relatively short timeframe. so, it seems like things are going well. that way, both in support of clinical trials and also commercialization. but we are building the supply chains. at the same time we're executing on how the delivery of drug product into clinical trials is occurring. so it's something that i think is going to be continuing to be a focus for senior management as that is enabling of our success and to this point. the good news is, we're working with some of the same contract manufacturing organizations with whom we have long-standing relationships with. and there may also be opportunities to consolidate programs, among them so that we're working with them for more than 1 program and we're focused to small molecule drug candidates and that way. it's not like we're dealing with an incredibly novel way of approaching supply, but at the same time, we have to ensure capacity and deliverable timelines and that's what we're focus toward. fady anything you want to add to that.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
no, i think you summed it up, but i think we've been able to continue to advance drug supplies for our studies and things like that. i think the real major constraints. this has to do with the spare capacity in the supply chain. there's just a lot of it's been squeezed out. so you have to be careful about how you plan things.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
and what i might also say as andrew and his team are very focused to the hand off between the manufacturers and then the logistics associated with distribution and all of the activities in connection with ensuring patients get reliable sources of drug as well and that speaks to potential patient hub services and other things like that. over time, i expect you'll hear more about that from andrew too.
joe pantginis -- hc wainwright -- analyst
that's very, very helpful. thank you. and then i guess 2 smaller questions. one maybe for ching on the financial side, are you. we have this $7.3 million cost to pay amgen for drug-drug product. for omecamtiv, just curious what might still be outstanding they're going, going into the future or if that expense is essentially done. and then second, if i heard fady correct when he was discussing the future for omecamtiv as well. i could of sworn i heard him say potential isps so that sounded like an interesting there. so, i'm curious what kind of studies. you might be looking at.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
yeah, i mean. go ahead, ching. you go first.
ching jaw -- senior vice president & chief financial officer
i'll go first fady, so, in regards to the payment that we pay amgen. the $7.3 million this quarter is the last of those payments. as we stated in our press release for the 9 months ended september 30, 2021. we have paid them $14.6 million. so that was the total amount and this $7.3 million was last of the payments.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
and i think just in regards to investigator sponsor initiated all those, we've begun to receive proposals, obviously we'll vet them and decide which ones we can support things like that, they fall under a fairly broad range of interest. the people have really outside. some of them outside of the heart failure population that we studied in galactic some of them within hmh. but i think we'll elaborate more on those as we begin to see them through.
joe pantginis -- hc wainwright -- analyst
sure. understood. thank you very much.

your next question comes from the line of yasmeen rahimi with piper sandler.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hi yasmeen.
yasmeen rahimi -- piper sandler -- analyst
hi, robert. thank you so much for taking my questions. but i have 2 questions for you. maybe the first place to start is, a lot of our investors have been sort of surprised by the fda recently by some of the actions that were taken a created sort of a nervous nellie situation. so, i get the question for you is, especially over the last few months as you've been interacting with the fda. what sort of their tone, their body language, their enthusiasm toward you. so, if you could just elaborate sort of and how does discussions went and i think that could be really important. and then i have a follow-up question
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
sure. so what i'll say is oftentimes, in these situations, biotech companies talk about having a pre nda meeting they submit an nda. it gets filed or doesn't get filed and then they await approval. in our case, over the last year we've had many interactions with fda both in person before covid shut that down and then also subsequently by zoom interactions and otherwise through written exchange of documents. i found fda to be very accessible and very interactive with us and providing guidance that informs both the formatting and the content of our planned nda submission. so i'm very encouraged by the level of engagement and should hopefully support our submission that would hopefully align with interest for approval. we've had all of our questions satisfactorily answered in order to provide for us now to go through the final mechanics of an nda submission in order to get that done this quarter.
yasmeen rahimi -- piper sandler -- analyst
and thank you robert for your answer and maybe a follow-up question is, maybe giving me some insight when you speak with cardiologist whether these are in private practice, whether it is at the hospital setting and sort of the level of appreciation, they have for omecamtiv in terms of a novel mechanism of action. does it click right away when they know that it's the first myotropes being able to really being able to improve cardiac contractility. i think i that might be really important like how important is the novelty of its mode of action for driving adoption in their enthusiasm beyond obviously the outstanding data form blocked in nature.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
so it's a little too early to talk about adoption of course in that is much is not approved, but certainly based on ad boards and interactions with key opinion leaders that have been driven out of medical affairs and also market research as is driven out of our commercial group, we're getting very positive vibes about how the novelty of the mechanism may translate into potential future adoption. maybe i'll turn it over to fady i to speak about some of those activities that he is overseeing and then i'll turn to andrew as well.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
yeah, i mean i think in the physician community certainly understands where this could play a role. and it's been a finding a drug that can improve cardiac function safely and have benefit for patients has been a long-standing goal in this field. and if you listen to our investor day presentation, i think you might hear some of the enthusiasm in the 2 discussions we had, but it was similar among many ad boards that we conducted, both in the us and in europe. and i think even as we go out to other stakeholders in the process we're sensing their enthusiasm for something that is new, but on the other hand, we understand how it works and it and it's rational it's rationale as to why you might use it.
andrew callos -- chief commercial officer
this is andrew, the only thing i would add is that when we talk with physicians, they excited by the mechanism enough for the mechanism alone, but it's a reason to believe relative to the data any evidence that we produced. so when they look at the mechanism. and the evidence and the unmet need very well aligned. they are running out of options when patients can't tolerate guideline directed medical therapy. they are running out of options when they need products that what could be an add-on that neutral and kidney neutral or blood pressure in working patients. and when you talk about the add-on and those type of effects think get very excited and a good reason to believe then kind of closing is a mechanism. so we're getting a lot of enthusiasm for a very specific subset of patients relative to the product.
yasmeen rahimi -- piper sandler -- analyst
thank you for the answer.

your next question comes from the line of jeff hung with morgan stanley.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hey jeff.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey robert, thanks for taking the questions. previously indicated that meetings with payers on omecamtiv mecarbil has been largely introductory, just curious if you have any updates that you can provide on payer feedback.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
sure, i'll turn it over to andrew to address that.
andrew callos -- chief commercial officer
sure. so i appreciate the question. so, we've interacted with. as i've mentioned, we've hired all of our account managers, as well as the leader of that team. many of them have existing relationships with all the major payers. we've interacted with the major payers and it's really more about introduction who cytokinetics and then making sure we align well on, how they think about heart failure, how do they manage heart failure, what are their challenges and what are their needs. so we've had those kind of baseline discussions and then where will go next is per fda regs is kind of a pre-approval information exchange, we will start doing that in coming weeks. so the feedback has been, well they do like that we can clearly identify those patients relative to benefit in ef. so then therefore that could indicate where they would target us from a prior authorization point of view, which is acceptable to us because that gives us access to a very specific population that greatly benefit from omecamtiv, so hopefully the color of our interactions in the 3rd quarter.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
the other thing to add is, there is a lot more forthcoming that you'll see in the published literature in 2022 that underscores the economic burden of heart failure, especially for those with worsening heart failure and where there could be opportunity for a new mechanism therapy like omecamtiv mecarbil based on results from galactic to make a dent in that for payers and payers are clearly aware of the economic burden associated with their management of heart failure patients. they're aware, especially of the high medicare percentage of these patients for which there oftentimes penalized, when these patients are readmitted. so a novel mechanism therapy that could reduce heart failure related events primarily hospitalizations would be something that would catch their attention. and that's something that we'll continue to investigate, this could be supportive of our plans for omecamtiv.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
great, thanks. and i think i may have misheard, but did you say that you expect enrollment of 1:9:57courage to be completed this year. otherwise, any updates on this made timing or be better-able to gauge the pace of enrollment to estimate that time? thanks.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
yes. what i said or meant to say was that enrollment continues through this year, but also intended next year also. we expect that we'll enroll patients sufficient to enable a first interim analysis next year. the timing of which is still to be defined, but we expect that were it to pass through that interim analysis, hopefully it will, the study would continue through next year. so, no, it's not intended to complete enrollment this year.
jeff hung -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay, thank you.

your next question comes from the line of akash tewari with jefferies.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello, akash.
akash tewari -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, robert. so, thanks so much for taking my question. can you talk about what drove your decision to look at exercise capacity as your primary endpoint for sequoia, not the comps that i'd point that now is ahead [phonetic]. why may exercise capacity be a more useful endpoint, both for the agency and clinicians? and additionally, have you heard any feedback from either the fda or kols on the need for long-term outcomes data post-approval for our aficamten? thank you.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
why don't we turn first to stuart to address the first question and then maybe fady and stuart the second question.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
thank you, robert. so, we focused on evaluating functional improvement in patients with obstructive hcm, comparing aficamten versus placebo and with respect to the fact that these patients have very poor exercise tolerance. we focus on one of the most rigorous objective measurements of exercise capacity and that is clearly peak vo2 as well as other parameters using cardiopulmonary exercise testing. so, rather than combining this with, say, a more subjective component of the composite endpoint, we really wanted to zero-in on what we thought was the most sort of critical and quantitative measurement and objective measurement of exercise capacity. having said that, we will be evaluating other endpoints -- these secondary endpoints that evaluates symptomatic improvements such as kansas city cardiomyopathy questionnaire, new york heart association functional class, et cetera. so, those other kind of i'll say more traditional endpoints, we will be evaluating in sequoia.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president & chief medical officer
and your second question, you want to repeat for me, akash?
akash tewari -- jefferies -- analyst
yes, absolutely. have you heard any feedback either from the fda or kols on the need for outcomes data post-approval for ck-274? thanks.
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president & chief medical officer
yes, outcomes, i think that the regulators and kols appreciate that outcomes data are very hard to come by in a symptomatic, although very heavily burdened patient population. these patients, unlike traditional heart failure patients don't get hospitalized. their mortality rates are usually quite low and lessen well under 5% per year. so, you can't really do an outcomes-based trial per se and i think that's well-understood based on the event rate. that said, i think there's also a recognition that the therapy that is being developed for these patients is a lifelong therapy. and having a good understanding of safety long-term is important and that's why we're conducting the open label extension and plan at least five years of follow-up in patients that we enroll in that, that rollout of either redwood or sequoia to enable us to better characterize the course of these patients who are being treated with aficamten.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
i think the advent of new pharmaceuticals is going to drive a better awareness of the outcomes associated with a diagnosis of hcm as could be modified with add-on therapy of aficamten or mavacamten and you're going to see i think increasingly publications arising out of registries that speak to the real-world evidence associated with these longitudinal studies. so, we will be in a position to better-understand what might be possible and i do suspect that will play into ultimately the adaption of the category. but to your original question as to whether regulators are pushing for it, i don't think that's likely going to factor into the registration of these new medicines -- at least not from what we've heard from fda.
akash tewari -- jefferies -- analyst
that's super helpful. and if i may just follow-up here. can you talk about the importance of showing to the fda that patients are able to get stabilized onto a safe dose for these class of drugs. is that something that the agency is focused on from a regulatory perspective? thanks so much.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
it's certainly something that we think is possible and achievable with aficamten and we hope to be able to demonstrate that with sequoia. if your question is pointed to, is that something fda is pushing for because of their review of another product? that would not be appropriate for fda to be signaling anything like that to us.
akash tewari -- jefferies -- analyst
understood. thanks so much. appreciate it.

your next question comes from the line of salim syed with mizuho.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello, salim.
salim syed -- mizuho -- analyst
good afternoon, robert, and team, and congrats on all the progress. just a couple for me -- one on 274 and one on actually reldesemtiv. on 274, looks like, robert, obviously the thesis here has gotten a lot more comfortable for a lot of long only investors. right. and i'm curious, in your mind, what are the gating factors -- when you think about the story, what are the gating factors here for 274 that are really stopping you from turning on the after-burners and starting to develop, have path, which as you know, is a large indication more aggressively? and i guess we can also ask the same question for a non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. and then the second question on reldesemtiv. so, as we start to dig in here on the courage design, you guys are enrolling -- it looks like als, frs total score 44 or less, but when we look at the phase 2 data, the slow progressor tartile [phonetic] which had a score of 41, didn't really show much of a difference between drug and placebo. so, i'm curious how you guys are thinking about courage. are you going to limit somehow this slow progressors that are entering the trial? or how are you ensuring that when we get to futility that you have an over-enrolled slow progressor? i guess is one way to ask it. or how are you controlling that you're going to actually have enough medium or fast progressors that would show a large benefit here potentially according to the phase 2 data? thank you.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
sure. both very good questions. let's start with your first one around the development program for aficamten. we spent quite a bit of time over these last several months once we saw the redwood results considering what might be our next steps beyond sequoia-hcm for aficamten and fady, and stuart, and steve, and others here at cytokinetics are considering a number of different trial designs as we would be expected to expand the development program in non-obstructive hcm and in half-math [phonetic]. it's premature for us to elaborate on them, but you should expect in 2022 to hear more about our plans that way. we intend to be pursuing the development of aficamten along both those lines and not in a linear way per se, but in parallel ways that would be enabling of us to build on what we know for aficamten. i'm just not in a position to do that on today's call. but certainly as we plan for budgets for 2022, and goals, and consider the resources that we need to align in order to make that happen, that's very much in the forefront of our planning. your second question related to courage-als and i'll ask fady and stuart to address. i think you might be misunderstanding a bit how we are designing the study. we are going to be prioritizing for those patients who are progressing, but they can elaborate.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
yes. i think it's really an enrichment strategy, salim, and so the entry criteria design in such a way to enrich for the medium and faster progressors -- and i can turn it over to stuart a little bit to describe how that works -- but ultimately, it's also something that we can monitor because you can calculate the early progression rates in the study and ensure that you're enrolling the right patients in a blinded way. stuart?
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president & chief medical officer
yes. salim, i think you're referring to the post-hoc analyses that were conducted with fortitude-als database. while we observed trends of benefit in slow progressors, we observed greater magnitude of benefit with respect to als-frs-r in the medium and fast progressing patients. and what we did, we'd map that progression rate to critical entry criteria. particularly a maximum als-frs-r of 44, as well a time from symptom onset two years. and so, if we apply those two main criteria that enriches as fady mentioned for population of faster progressing patients, while not excluding slow progressors, but we'll have a larger proportion of medium and faster progressing patients. and with that strategy, we anticipate that this will increase the sensitivity of detecting a beneficial treatment effect with reldesemtiv.
salim syed -- mizuho -- analyst
okay, got it. so, you will be able to in your view, do this based on entry criteria and not having to calculate during the trial based on blinded data?
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president & chief medical officer
that's correct. exactly.

robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
good afternoon, jason.
jason butler -- jmp securities -- analyst
hi, robert. thanks for taking the questions. just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the path for aficamten in china? is there a data that you need beyond the completed pk study to open up the sequoia trial to china? and then just give us a sense of what proportion of patients in sequoia you think could come from china. and then could sequoia as a stand-alone support registration in china or would you need additional data or an traditional trial beyond that trial? thanks.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
yes. very good questions. we're still learning about what might be required, but it's our assumption that we're going to be in a position to start sequoia in china and based on the phase 1 data, be enrolling china patients into the same study and as could be supportive of registration in china, as well as outside of china, u.s., europe, elsewhere. so that's the intention in the plan. obviously that's subject to regulatory interactions that are still to be had, but our partner ji xing is very much on top of these things and we're working very, very well. stuart is leading much of that activity for cytokinetics. stuart, anything more you want to add?
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president & chief medical officer
i think you summarized it very well. we certainly rely on ji xing for guidance. they have more expertise in china regarding the regulatory requirements. but as has been laid out, we expect the phase 1 data to support enrollment of patients in china in sequoia-hcm and that trial to support registration in china.

robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
hello, charles.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
hello, robert and team. congratulations on good year of progress. thanks for taking my question. had a couple of questions. one on omecamtiv and then another on reldesemtiv. with regard to omecamtiv nda filing, i guess i'm wondering, are you planning on press releasing the submission or the acceptance for review or filing? and then i guess i just need to clarify something. i think it was to dane's question. would you be filing for a broad label claim with data pointing to the patient, the cohort that had the greatest benefit or would you limit the filing claim to that cohort?
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
yes. i'll take those and fady may want to elaborate. with regard to the communications and the press release, we expect to be submitting an nda in this quarter and we probably would not be communicating anything until such time as we have a read on its fileability -- whether it's filed not filed by fda. and then as to your second question, i'll ask fady to speak regarding how we might approach the indication statement and where might be the information containing the patients that benefited the most.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
yes. i think if we look at different indication statements, even recent ones, they're different approaches. but in general, they reflect the patient population that was studied in the clinical trial at large. you can see in the entresto label after the paragon data were added that there was an additional statement with regards to where the benefit was concentrated i.e. in patients with below normal ejection fraction. so it may be that you could end up with modifying statement in the indication. you certainly will have data in the clinical trial section that show the pre-specified subgroups, which one of which was ejection fraction as you know and showed the benefit in the lower ejection fraction group, nyha 3-4 group then others across the subgroups that we had pre-specified. so, there are different places in the label where the information may be contained and ultimately, it's hard to predict where we'll end up until we go through those discussions.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. consistent with what i kind of thought. regarding meteoric, i think you mentioned that you'd complete the conduct of it yet this year. can you give us some sense of timing to data? could that be in the first half of the first quarter? and then can you confirm whether or not you think that that data would then be submitted to the agency and have any potential for impacting the review? it seems like it could be pretty early in the review cycle. so, likely not.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
i think what -- and we probably aren't going to give guidance with regards to the first half or second half of the quarter with regards to meteoric. its conduct will wrap up this year, but it's really going to wrap up pretty late in the quarter and then of course, it's a complicated study because there is a lot of central lab work in terms of the cpet evaluations and so forth and the data sets are relatively complex to integrate. so, time and database lock maybe not a swift as you might have in an event-based trial.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
okay.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
but i think the other aspect of your question, you're going to have to remind again now. i got lost the track of it.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
just impact on review cycle timing.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
i think having the results in-hand and early in the quarter is not going to -- obviously the fda will see them as we release them and hope to see them presented but they won't, we think impact the review. the safety data will be probably part of an update during the review cycle. but that's it.
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst
okay. and then going on to reldesemtiv. just one quick question regarding the conduct of that trial and i think you mentioned in the previous set of questions or couple of the four, that your kind of enriching for faster progressing patients. so, i guess i'm wondering, are you explicitly asking for more bulbar onset versus limb onset patient? seem like they could become consistent with that given that under two years since symptom presentation.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
stuart, you want to take that?
stuart kupfer -- senior vice president & chief medical officer
we're not really seeing that restricted in terms of our enrollment. we're certainly enrolling patients in both categories. but as i mentioned before, the major criteria to enrich for faster progressing patients based on that als-frs score at baseline and the time since sort of the onset [phonetic].
charles duncan -- cantor fitzgerald -- analyst

robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
good afternoon.
rohit bhasin -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, good afternoon. this is rohit, on for serge. thanks for taking my question. can you talk a bit about how the meteoric-hf trial fits with the gold market strategy for omecamtiv? do you expect to label expansion or better-payer reimbursement?
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
sure. i'll ask fady to speak to that and maybe andrew might want to add.
fady malik -- executive vice president of r&d
i think if meteoric is positive, we would at some point submit for a supplemental nda filing, an expansion of the label that would include the results from meteoric, the clinical benefit there is important, the patients and certainly would be worth having in the label. that wouldn't come until after the primary approval of omecamtiv mecarbil. and i think being that improving exercise capacity is something that is rarely shown with drugs that improve [indecipherable]; that would be a unique feature of omecamtiv mecarbil should the trial be positive. maybe i'll ask -- turn it over to andrew and see if he has anything else he wants to add there.
andrew callos -- chief commercial officer
and we're going to be negotiating access pre-approval, post-approval and largely will be using the data from galactic. if we have a positive meteoric trial, that certainly will enhance the benefit we could bring to patients, especially in capacity. it could enhance our value argument if patients feel better or could be more productive. so, it's really going to depend on how the data readout and what the adjustments are to the label, but i wouldn't expect it to have a major impact on our overall access strategy or access levels.
robert blum -- president & chief executive officer
what it does do is it reinforces the mechanism as it provides what could be differentiating benefits to patients beyond outcomes. this being a functional outcome. and in that way, it could reinforce the use of omecamtiv mecarbil. but i agree with andrew, it's not likely to drive huge things [phonetic]. it might very much have the fact to things like adherence and compliance of patients and also how physicians might ultimately view the category.
