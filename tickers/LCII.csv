jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning, everyone, and welcome to lci's fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 earnings call. 2020 was not only an extremely challenging year but also a pivotal and rewarding one for both lci and the outdoor recreational industry as a whole. in the face of extraordinary operational challenges, we leveraged the skills of our experienced leadership team and pulled together to deliver what we consider to be outstanding results, including the highest annual revenue in lci's history and double-digit earnings growth despite a six-week period where there were essentially no rv sales. further, we made significant progress with respect to our long-term diversification strategy, closing on three acquisitions, and expanding our market share across our rv, marine, adjacent aftermarket, and international businesses.
none of this would have been possible without the unwavering dedication of our incredible lippert team members who rose to the challenge and worked bravely and tirelessly to ensure we could meet the unprecedented industry demand from consumer streaming into the outdoor recreational lifestyle. ending the year strong, we exited 2020 with $2.8 billion in revenues, up 18% year over year. importantly, this growth was supported by strong performance of our aftermarket and adjacent market segments. aftermarket revenues more than doubled during the year due to the addition of the curt group, which has done very well since we announced the acquisition in late 2019.
our performance outside the rv business underscores the success of our diversification strategy which has been a critical driver in outperforming our industry and helping to establish lci leadership in the many industries it now serves. rv oem sales increased 3% during the year compared to 2019, reaching $1.5 billion primarily driven by the ongoing surge in retail demand as new consumers and their families enter the rv lifestyle and recognize the benefits of rv. this increase was partially offset by the industrywide production shutdowns in the first half of the year, after which we saw incredible recovery to ultimately deliver 29% sales growth for the segment in the fourth quarter. industry wholesale rv shipments for the year totaled roughly 430,000 units, which was the fourth-highest wholesale year on record.
we expect this number to rise further in 2021 and beyond, driven by heightened consumer demand and extreme popularity of rvs going forward in a post-pandemic environment. we believe that the growth in popularity and availability of peer-to-peer rv rentals will also help drive rv demand, creating a huge new opportunity for consumers to try rv ultimately bringing them into the lifestyle over the long term. outdoorsy, one of the largest peer-to-peer rental companies grew 4,500% to over $1 billion in rental revenues in 2020, while others in the space grew significantly as well. while we anticipate continued supply chain constraints heading into 2021, lci and its customers are doing well at mitigating these challenges.
as i said in the past, when challenges arise, the industry is excellent at finding solutions quickly. we also added capacity so that we can continue to stay ahead of the demand of our oems. with six new facilities in q3 and q4 of 2020, all outside elkhart county, in the northern indiana area, we are quickly staffing up to increase our production output. additionally, we have two significant building projects already moving and are evaluating others.
we are also continuing to leverage our automated processes in our operations, enabling us to further ramp production without the need for much labor. finally, we are leveraging our lean teams and have turbocharged our continuous improvement projects, so that we can continue to free up more manufacturing space. i am proud to say that we are on pace to complete a record number of continuous improvement projects this year. our team also delivered further content growth for the year in both towable units and motorhomes, echoing the strength of the lippert brand despite the recent wholesale mix shift toward small entry-level units driven by the surge of first-time rv buyers.
content per towable rv for the full-year 2020 adjusted to remove furrion sales from prior periods increased 1% from the prior year to $3,390, while content per motorhome rv for the full-year 2020 increased 8% from the prior year to $2,479, supported by the success of our new product offerings. despite the obstacles we faced and overcame during 2020, our diversification strategy remained a top priority as we successfully grew our non-rv businesses, both organically and through acquisitions. we reached a significant milestone in our strategy during the year with our adjacent markets, aftermarket, and international businesses, now making up more than 50% of our total net sales, up from 42% at the end of the year 2019, despite the large boom in rvs. we believe that diversification will help further establish our presence in the broader outdoor recreation market to drive long-term growth.
our large adjacent market contributors are still cargo and utility trailers, components for buses, boats, and other commercial vehicles as well as windows and other products for manufactured housing and residential housing markets. as i mentioned earlier, our revenues in the aftermarket segment more than doubled year over year, up 125% compared to 2019, primarily driven by the addition of the curt group, which remains our largest acquisition to date. we are pleased to say the curt teams demonstrated their strong operational skills throughout the year, realizing cost synergies and exceeded their pre covid target numbers, and have entered 2021 with a backlog triple of what they started 2020 with. our rv aftermarket group also knocked the cover off the ball by outperforming their pre-covid targets as well.
our aftermarket and adjacent businesses proved to be resilient through the pandemic and with the workhorse of our business during the time that our oem businesses is shut down. we believe that in times when our rv and marine oem businesses are down, our aftermarket businesses will provide opportunities for growth. this is one of the reasons we will continue to invest in this part of our strategy as we continue to steer our aftermarket business toward the $1 billion mark. we have continued to focus our attention and resources on the customer experience in the aftermarket world.
we believe helping to change the customer experience will be pivotal to our future success as we support first timers coming into the rv lifestyle. like we typically do, to help drive this initiative, we appointed a leader for this area in q1 of last year. nicole sult is a seven-year lippert bet with 10 years of additional experience as an rv oem director of customer service. as director of customer experience at lippert, she has started to build a team and has already launched several great initiatives to get closer to the consumer and gather more valuable feedback.
we also hired joyce schofield who came to us with a great experience from onstar and guardian as a call center leader to help change the customer experience as it pertains to the over 60,000 customers each month that reaches by phone or email to get service on our products. we've additionally launched two social communities that are providing excellent feedback for our products and services. the lippert scouts, as we've named them is a group of specifically selected rv super users that connect daily with our customer experience teams. the scouts numbering over 1,200 members will serve as our eyes and ears to provide valuable insights on our new and existing products.
we will be listening to their new ideas and engaging in conversations so that we can obtain important feedback to help solve our main issues. we've also launched the campground project, through which we are sending technically experienced team members to over 100 campgrounds nationwide to meet, survey and collect candid feedback from real campers and rvers. we are confident that our continued emphasis and passion for the customer experience can serve as yet another competitive differentiator to drive growth for our aftermarket segment and oem segments, and in turn, strengthen our overall business. turning to adjacent markets, 2020 revenues rose 4%, again, driven by the heightened retail demand from marine and other related markets, which continue to benefit from the similar secular tailwinds driving the growth across the rv and the aftermarket.
looking forward, the additions of challenger door, leading manufacturer of branded doors for rvs and specialty trailers; and veada industries, a manufacturer of marine seating, will both serve as new growth drivers for the oem segment. and we are excited to continue to integrate these businesses into lci. veada has a substantial relationship with polaris owned bennington boats, the largest pontoon builder in the country. and we are looking forward to adding more value to that relationship as we continue to grow polaris in its applicable segments.
our marine revenues for 2020 have eclipsed $205 million and are expected to increase with the ramp-up of the industry in 2021. it is noteworthy to announce that we have been working closely with tracker marine over the last 12 months. tracker, one of the largest and most well-known boat brands and boat builders in the u.s. has decided to shift its marine furniture production from a vertical preference to lippert through our tailor-made marine group, further strengthening our presence in the marine space.
over the long term, this collaboration will add business to several lippert u.s. facilities, including a dedicated marine seating facility in missouri near the tracker campuses. we look forward to working with tracker to develop a strong relationship and drive growth for both businesses. in addition to marine, our windows business in our adjacent markets, our third largest product line in the company, has continued to gain share in the commercial bus manufactured housing and residential housing markets.
our international businesses saw strong growth in 2020 as well, with revenues increasing 62% year over year, supported by the four acquisitions we closed in late 2019. the strength of these brands coupled with their culture and innovation, wide-reaching footprints, and customer relationships in europe have continued to help position lippert as an industry leader overseas. the various european countries in which we operate, including italy, the netherlands, and the u.k. seem to be slightly behind the rapid pace of recovery we saw in the u.s., but still remain strong and showing opportunities for a great 2021.
overall, europe is showing many of the same drivers of secular rv and recreational demand and european consumers have increasingly turned toward the outdoor lifestyle for travel and vacation, while some airports have shut down due to the pandemic. 2020 retail caravan registrations in europe increased almost 12%, with the largest market germany, up over 32%. our rv, rail and marine divisions in europe are all forecasting significant growth over their 2020 numbers based on the feedback they are getting from their customers. in addition, we continue to see great progress toward lci european components being adopted by the u.s.
rv oems. this is a trend we were really proud of, and it helps that the u.s. oems really see us as even more of an innovator with the ability to bring these products to the u.s. market on a regular basis.
we are very confident in the ability of our leadership teams to capture this demand and drive new growth across our international businesses. innovation is one of our strongest competitive differentiators and remains at the center of everything we do, particularly as new customers increasingly seek out technologically sophisticated products as well as products that appeal to new generations of campers. this trend has driven the success of our onecontrol products, among others, which put rvers in control of their vehicle by enabling them to manage an rv's most important functions from their smartphone. further, onecontrol integrates seamlessly into our largest strategy to enhance the customer service experience, allowing our support teams to know immediately if a problem with an rv has occurred so that we can alert the customer.
this will be especially helpful to new entrants still familiarizing themselves with their rv. we're also seeing strong demand for other innovative offerings that provide additional modes of support, including our tire linc pressure and temperature monitoring and electronic sway control systems, equipping rvers with the ability to be in tune with these safety aspects of their vehicle and help provide them with a safer journey. we believe that safety products, which will be a significant focus for us over the next few years, will likely have the same impact in making consumers feel more comfortable buying rvs like they do automobiles. to lead our new product innovation, we recently announced the addition of our vice president of innovation, john rhymer, an industry leader and avid rver who will help us drive forward our extensive catalog of industry-leading rv and marine-related innovations, products, functions, and features.
by fostering a strong cohesive culture with our business, we have been able to create dependable and dedicated teams that were able to power lippert through the crisis brought on by the pandemic and we could not be more thankful for each and every one of our team members. unlike many companies, we provide leadership coaching to all leaders in the business and have dedicated resources for training, that ultimately creates longer-tenured leaders who understand what effective leadership looks like. we have seen first-hand, how this ultimately drives higher retention and ultimately a greater momentum in the business as a result. these initiatives have directly supported our operations for over seven years now and give our teams the skills needed to keep leadership evolving.
it has proven to be especially effective during its most recent environment, which was one of the most toughest to manage in our recent history. ultimately, it was our strong cultural foundation that allowed us to supply our customers in the manner that we did. during these tough times, we also worked to ensure the safety of our team members while supporting the larger communities surrounding lci. we invested millions in personal protective equipment for our team members while altering production environments to keep people properly distance and we're able to involve select teams in covid-19 vaccine testing phase ran by johnson & johnson.
we also set up and dedicated an industry-first drive through rapid covid testing site for our team members. our teams kept up our commitment to our community by providing over 67,000 hours of community service during 2020 despite an environment that made it nearly impossible to serve in groups like we have in the past. we also led the industry with a significant gift to our local hospitals to help them hire mental health experts to provide much-needed help to the hard-working men and women on the front lines of our hospitals those who have seen some of the worst of the pandemic. i could not be more proud of our ability to give back during these times of great need.
with respect to capital allocation, we continue to remain receptive to strategic m&a opportunities. we are looking for great strategic fits with great leadership teams and solid plans for growth. at the same time, we are focused on integrating our recent acquisitions and paying down debt. additionally, we are investing in innovation and optimizing our manufacturing footprint to ensure we maintain the appropriate capacity to meet the soaring demand for recreational products.
in closing, i'd like to thank all of our team members not only for their tremendous work and commitment to delivering quality products to our customers but for also fostering a culture that has made lippert so successful. we could not have achieved such amazing results without these incredible dedications coupled with the strength and guidance of our leadership team. we look forward to continuing this tremendous progress as we headed further into 2021 and deliver further value for our shareholders. i will now turn to brian hall, our cfo, to discuss in more detail our fourth-quarter and full-year financial results.
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, jason, and good morning, everyone. our consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter increased 39% to $783 million compared to the prior year, with acquisitions contributing 13% of the year-over-year growth and organic growth contributing the remaining 26%. the q4 2020 sales to rv oems increased 29% compared to the prior year due to the continued record rv oem retail demand. when normalizing for the termination of our relationship with furrion, rv oem sales increased by 39%.
at the same time, sales to adjacent industries grew 20%, aftermarket segment sales increased 129%, and international sales increased 60% as the popularity of outdoor leisure continues to drive strong demand across many of our markets. we continue to work toward our diversification strategy goals, and we recently announced the acquisitions of challenger door and veada industries during the fourth quarter. acquired revenues contributed $73.2 million across the business during the quarter, primarily curt and polyplastic, driving strong growth in aftermarket and europe. as we now lap the year on the curt and polyplastic acquisitions, forward-looking acquired revenues consist of challenger and veada, each representing about $80 million or $160 million in a total of acquired revenues and split across rv oem at 36% and adjacent industries at 64%.
we expanded operating margins by roughly 140 basis points from the prior-year period, largely due to the favorable impact of leveraging organic sales growth, coupled with the impact of operational efficiencies driven by increased automation and lean manufacturing initiatives and partially offset by increased labor expense to meet heightened production requirements and the increasing cost of steel, aluminum, and freight. we anticipate the current headwinds from increased input costs to continue through the first half of 2021. while the pricing for many of our products is indexed to steel and aluminum costs, there remains the traditional lag time and effectiveness of approximately two quarters. gaap net income in q4 2020 was $48.7 million or $1.92 per diluted share compared to $28.8 million or $1.14 per diluted share in q4 2019, primarily due to strong growth in net sales as well as a favorable impact on the effective tax rate due to discrete adjustments.
adjusted ebitda increased 54% to $88.1 million for the fourth quarter. this increase was also driven by leveraging the aforementioned heightened demand in retail rv oem and aftermarket as well as incremental revenue from recent acquisitions. moving on to full-year 2020 results. sales to rv oems increased 3%, driven by the heightened retail demand for outdoor recreational products.
as jason mentioned, we expect an increase in wholesale unit shipments in 2021 compared to 2020. further, the current rvia forecast for 2021 is 507,000 units, which would be an 18% increase compared to 2020. we remain acutely aware of the industry supply chain issues and are confident that our flexible business model will be able to adapt to any significant changes. content per towable rv unit for the 12 months ended december 31, 2020, increased $44 to $3,390, while content per motorized unit increased to $192 to $2,479, excluding the impact of furrion in 2019.
for comparative purposes, excluding furrion, content per towable rv for the full year of 2019 was $3,346 and content per motorhome was $2,287. the content increase in towables was primarily driven by organic growth, including new product introductions, partially offset by the increased demand for entry level products, which traditionally have less content per unit. in addition, price reductions passed to our customers during the last 12 months, primarily due to commodity index pricing, has negatively impacted content growth by approximately 2%, and we estimate significant volatility in oem inventories have negatively impacted content growth by approximately 4%. as the second quarter was significantly impacted by the abrupt shutdown of production and subsequently shipment of product was impacted by supply chain disruption, the matching of lci sales with the wholesale shipments has been temporarily diverged.
pro forma towable content growth is estimated to be approximately 7% year over year. sales to adjacent industries increased 4% to $688 million in 2020, and our aftermarket segment increased its total sales by 125% to $628 million, while international sales increased 62% to $237 million compared to the prior year. acquired revenues were approximately $375 million for the full-year 2020. noncash depreciation and amortization increased by over $22.6 million for 2020, while noncash stock-based compensation expense increased just over $2.4 million for the full year.
we are anticipating depreciation and amortization expense to increase to $110 million to $120 million in 2021, primarily due to increases in capital investments for capacity inefficiencies in 2021. our effective tax rate for the full year was 24.4%, remaining relatively flat year over year. gaap net income for the full-year 2020 was $158.4 million or diluted earnings per share of $6.27, compared to $146.5 million or diluted earnings per share of $5.84 in 2019. during 2020, we generated $231 million from operating activities, while using $182 million for business acquisitions, $57 million for capital expenditures and returning $70 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends over the year.
capital expenditures for 2020 included normal replacement capex along with $5 million in automation investments and over $21 million in growth initiatives as part of the operational improvements we have discussed. we ended the year with a net debt position of $686 million at december 31, 2020, roughly two times pro forma ebitda adjusted to include ltm ebitda of acquired businesses. leverage remained comparable to 2019, while enduring covid shutdowns and two acquisitions late in 2020. we remain focused on maintaining a healthy balance sheet and continue to target long-term leverage of one to one and a half times net debt to ebitda as we work to integrate recently completed acquisitions, which we believe will contribute strong operating cash flows.
we expect capital expenditures between $130 million to $150 million in 2021 as we focus further on various smaller scale, continuous improvement, and automation projects to support growth and continue to build capacity to support heightened production rates. as we continue to execute our acquisition strategy by integrating our latest acquisitions into our business, we are confident that we are well-positioned for strategic growth heading into 2021. that is the end of our prepared remarks, operator, we're ready to take questions. thank you.

[operator instructions] first question comes from scott stember with cl king.
scott stember -- c.l. king & associates -- analyst
good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. jason, in the release, i think your last comment was related to the oems seemingly taking less downtime, i guess some of the supplier issues incrementally are abating. can you maybe just talk about the pace of improvement and where you would think that would be by the middle of the year of '21?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. it's just -- all i can say, it's really noticeable. i mean, october, november, december, i mean, we were riddled with brands all over the industry being down one day to the next. it seems like every day, there was somebody else that couldn't work because of covid or they couldn't -- they shut down because of supply chain-related issues, and in january, you just didn't hear about any of that.
so i mean, i haven't confirmed it, but i'm pretty sure that nobody took down days in january. so it's just a stark contrast from what we're seeing. covid-related cases were up significantly in october and november, so that was a big piece of it and january has been very quiet around the county here. so i can't tell you or put in numbers specifically.
it was just a significant change. and then the big challenge will be the 20 or so facilities that the oems are putting online new between now and the end of the year, which will add significant capacity is just getting those up and making sure those are able to run cleanly.
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
and, scott, i'd add to that. i think back in october, we were talking about a lot of these random shutdowns and just disruptions because of the supply chain, etc. but to give you an idea, our chassis shipments, just the numbers of them from october to january have increased 12%. so i think things are running much more efficiently.
we talked about it growing 10% or so by the time we got to january, and it's certainly -- the industry has done a nice job of getting caught up, and we were able to see that pull through.
scott stember -- c.l. king & associates -- analyst
got it. and brian, maybe on the gross margin. i know there's some seasonality in the fourth quarter when you compare it to the third quarter. but just maybe talk about how we should look at gross margins going forward? seems like input costs are something that we have to keep an eye on.
but just trying to get a sense of last quarter -- in the third quarter, you're pushing doubly actually over 11% operating margins. just trying to get a sense of where we should look for margins to be during 2021.
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think that we started talking a little bit early fourth quarter or late third quarter about some of our input costs rising, primarily steel and aluminum. certainly, labor has been challenging as well. once you got into those late fall months, as covid kind of spiked here locally, you certainly had -- we had to deal with that from an operations perspective as well.
so you did see some margin deterioration from third quarter to fourth quarter. some of it, like you said, due to the seasonality, but the rest of it due to some of these pressures on our input costs. i would expect that to continue to increase. i think our overall margin that we turned in, in q4, i think it's going to be a bit spotty throughout the course of the year.
because i think that as you know, we have a lot of our steel and aluminum products tied to the pricing, our customers are tied to some indexes. there's a little bit of lag there. so we've had some price reductions that were flowing through during 2020. and now in 2021, i think we're going to start to see things go the other way, but with a little bit of a lag there.
we're also addressing some specific price increases to help out on some more unusual items, things like freight, that skyrocketed here in the past few months as well. so all in all, i think we did a little over 8% in the fourth quarter. i think we'll see that grow a little bit, but then likely level out and maybe decline some and then pull back up in the later months of the year. so i think we'll show some our typical incremental margin, but then offset by some of these costs such as steel, aluminum and freight primarily.
but maybe, i want to say, if you took your incremental margin that we typically have somewhere around 20%, maybe one and a half percent at times, you could see as a headwind, at least that's what we're seeing today.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and i'd add to that, scott, just real quick, additive to margins going forward, i mean, we had weeks during the last quarter of q4, where we have 10% to 20% of our workforce missing because of covid trying to get just out the required volume. and going forward, it feels a lot better certainly, things could happen. but january was certainly a month where we didn't have anywhere near close to that, haven't had that this month either. so as long as covid doesn't wreak havoc in our operations, we can get 95% plus of our workforce engaged in building product and not have 10% to 20% missing, sometimes that adds huge deficiencies.
scott stember -- c.l. king & associates -- analyst
great. and just last question. jason, you touched on -- you mentioned the opportunity with tracker. sounds like a very nice opportunity.
could you maybe size up what -- or just to frame out the size of the opportunity ultimately there?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. it's not too dissimilar from some of the other verticals we've taken over. we've done chassis verticals. we've done furniture verticals for people over the years for our customers.
and i think tracker sees -- they've been up here a lot. they see the opportunities in all product lines. and as you're well aware, all the marine -- all the rv businesses are looking for more capacity right now. so if you can sub out a vertical that's really not adding value, and it helps create an immediate labor pool to build more boats or more rvs.
and you got a company like us that's willing to lease space and put our teams around building out a vertical like this so that they can use that capacity for building their finished products. it's good for both. so they're a big boat manufacturer. they're the -- one of the largest in the country.
so we're excited to start doing a lot of things for them, not just furniture.
scott stember -- c.l. king & associates -- analyst
that's all i have. thanks.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thanks.

next question comes from kathryn thompson with thompson research group.
brian biros -- thompson research group -- analyst
hey. good morning. this is actually brian on for kathryn. i guess i wanted to start with some of the prepared remarks kind of alluded to seeing those supply chain issues kind of continuing into 2020 -- sorry, 2021.
i guess, could you maybe touch on what those issues actually are that are out there or could possibly out there if that's covid disruptions that still might be causing plants to shut down or if it's something just more fundamental with the industry? i guess, was that kind of in reference to lippert specifically, or is that kind of just across the general supplier base? and then any kind of updated expectations on when it all could be back to normal?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. i think the last part of your question is a little bit more challenging to answer, but i think all the supply chain on the oem side, i mean, we've all got certain struggles. i mean, freight certainly is the largest issue that's kind of hitting a lot of businesses. so we're all having to beg, borrow and steal to try to figure out how to get the product here from overseas.
it's not really freighted domestic. it's just freight overseas, that's really the larger problem for the oem suppliers. steel is obviously challenging right now. you hear a lot of businesses that are buying steel, challenged to get it.
if you can find it, you're paying a lot more than what the market is. so our business in the industry is relatively small. so the steel users, some of the other raw materials that are being challenged right now. i mean the one thing i love about our industry is we're pretty resilient, we're pretty resourceful.
when there's problems and issues, we find a way to substitute. oems are generally pretty lenient on substitutions. so the industry makes substitutions pretty regularly so that we can continue to stay running. so i don't anticipate much of any disruption in production from supply chain-related issues.
it's just probably going to be one of those things that just is poking at us for the next several quarters, and hopefully, things start to even out. so i hope that answers your question.
brian biros -- thompson research group -- analyst
it does. yeah. thank you for the color. i guess, the second question, i guess, maybe could you guys talk about high level, how to think about kind of some of the comps throughout 2021.
i guess there'll be some interesting looking numbers, at least for q2. and then the end of the back half, there'll be maybe some tough comps, but you're also expecting kind of some retail growth for 2021 as well. so maybe just some insights on how you guys are thinking about the quarterly comps throughout 2021 would be helpful.
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think, i'll start with first quarter. i do think that our january reported results are pretty indicative of what we're expecting for the quarter other than march. we were up 38% and for january and i think that february is likely to be similar.
as jason mentioned, as more production comes online with the oems, that's certainly going to have an impact, but we're not expecting that here in the recent months. but in march, then there was a shutdown, i think that last week or so in march. so that's where i think we'll see our growth rates start to pick up. obviously, when you get into q2, those are going to be some pretty significant growth numbers.
in the back half, i do think, as i mentioned earlier, our chassis shipments are up right now 12% from october to january. i think that tells you, in the back half of the year, at least for q3 and q4, what we kind of expect as the industries work to replenish inventories across rvs and marine. i'd expect those rates to continue to push into the back half of the year, plus whatever content growth we have on top of that.
brian biros -- thompson research group -- analyst
thank you.
operator
next question comes from fred wightman with wolfe research.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. thanks for taking the call here. could you just maybe touch on your expectations for the cadence of reported rvia shipments over the next few months? i mean, you guys have alluded to this 12% increase in chassis, a few different times.
i think in the past, you've sort of talked about getting closer to that 50,000 unit number in the start of the year. i mean, is that still realistic, or do you think that the supply chain disruptions have sort of pushed that type of delivery number further into the year?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i mean, i think it's absolutely realistic. again, part of that is just because supply chain and covid haven't -- at least as of late, in the last month and a half or so, haven't wreaked as much havoc as what we saw earlier in the prior quarter. so they are also like i said in the beginning of my remarks, the oems are putting on just the rv side, are putting up close to 20 new facilities online to build rv-finished products over the course of the next four quarters. so some of those are going online right now.
others will go online in q2 and q3 and a few left that will straggle in q4. but that's a lot of facilities. they're going to add a lot more volume opportunity. i mean, the big challenge is going to be labor.
us along with some of the other oems out there are putting facilities outside of elkhart county right now to help just make sure that we're distributing labor evenly. we're not creating bigger labor issues here that are bigger than the ones that already exist. so i think the oems and the suppliers are doing a great job to mitigate supply chain issues and feel that those numbers are totally realistic.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. and then could you just give maybe an update on the state of those semi-finished goods that you guys have talked about in the past. is it sort of steady to where we were exiting the third quarter? have you seen some improvement to where production is probably closer to actual shipments? or is there still going to be some variability there because of that supply chain impact?
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think -- i mean, personally, all the lots that i drive by, my way into work every day, have -- there aren't as many units sitting out there at all. so i think that, that's indicative of what jason was saying earlier that supply chain has done a great job of catching back up. they've been able to get a lot more units out the door.
i think if you look at what wholesale shipments did november, december, you certainly saw that kind of, at least in my opinion, a lot of inventory that stacked up here for a couple of months, go out the door. because i think wholesale shipments were outpacing what production levels were at that point in time. and fortunately, well, you can look at it, fortunately, and unfortunately, i don't think we've built back inventories at the dealer level because it seems as though we're still seeing heightened retail demand. and as every unit that's getting shipped out right now is being retail sold.
so there's still a lot of work to be done there to replenish inventory. so these next couple of months, i would anticipate there to be quite a few units get shipped. they'll produce and ship as many as they can.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.

next question comes from daniel moore with cjs securities.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. good morning, jason and brian. just wanted to drill down a little bit into some of your commentary around inflationary input costs and relationships to maybe gross margin more specifically. so 25% gross margin, pretty strong by historical standards.
can we sustain that in h1 given the inflation in steel, aluminum, freight or you expect a little bit of pressure? and then is there upside to that as we think about the full year?
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i think -- like i mentioned earlier, i think, first and foremost, our operating leverage has been really solid, both within the gross margin lines, the leveraging of those overheads as well as our sg&a. so i expect that to continue. now what is the headwind or these input costs, and like i said, i think in at least the next couple of quarters, what we'd expect based on what we're seeing is that we'll continue to grab that incremental margin on the volumes, but it's likely to be probably 150 basis points of headwinds steel, aluminum, freight being the main drivers of that.
like i mentioned, we've got some price adjustments, but some of them lag a little bit. so i think it will be a bit spotty, but i would expect to see that maybe 150 basis points or so. i hate to be too specific like that, so maybe 1% to 2%. so somewhere in that range.
and then certainly, what steel and aluminum does in the back half of the year, i think, the forwards are pointing to -- it might calm down a little bit, but that's a big unknown. so back half, probably not as clear as here in the front half. and like i said, i think we'd expect a little bit of headwind in q1, and then maybe some of that reversal in q2 as some of our price adjustments catch up.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and there's already been a significant amount of pricing going back to the oems to the dealers just because of all the volatility over the last couple of quarters. so the great thing, like i said about the oems and the businesses are great at recontenting and decontenting around some of this, so the inflationary impact doesn't hit the consumer too heavily. although there has been some inflation in the product, it's probably not as great as you might think. so we take a lot of market share on top of that.
so just with the growth in the business, we've really took more market share. i know we took more market share in the last couple of quarters than we have in any other prior quarters in a while. so we've got a lot of good tailwinds heading in our direction. the big unknown of this will be what's next, what shortages there are going to pop up in the next couple of quarters.
and we just don't have that kind of visibility, but we'll deal with them as they come like we have the last couple of quarters.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful. and so if i'm hearing it right, you kind of think about your typical incremental margin, but then a 100 to 200 basis point impact to ebit margin from what that would be in the short term, am i hearing that right, brian? i'm sorry, just be clear.
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. in this quarter.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
and then aftermarket revenue, i mean, it remains off the charts, and curt obviously not going to cover up the ball. just talk about your expectations for aftermarket growth maybe organically and overall for this year?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. so i'd say that aftermarket is clearly one of those areas we're continuing to turbocharge. we've been growing the teams there. we're expanding coverage into a lot of the marine space right now, whether it's the dealers or wholesale distributors in that world.
that's not something we had focused a ton on prior to last quarter. we've made a lot of changes around aftermarket to just be able to turbocharge our content. and it's still early innings for us in the aftermarket relative to our oem business. so we feel like we've got a lot of ground to make up there.
unlike the oem business, the aftermarket customers are asking us to supply anything and everything. because we source so much overseas and we can get some of these buy-sell products at probably a much better price because of the hundreds of millions we spend overseas, we're able to comment and then compete pretty easily with small mom-and-pop traditional players in the aftermarket. so we're expanding our product offerings and our content there, continuing to hit more direct to consumer and dealer stores. so it's pretty -- brian can expand on some of the top-line and bottom-line questions that you asked.
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i mean, i think the only thing i would add is that we saw amazing growth in 2020. i think moving on to 2021, to give you an idea, i think preliminarily january's aftermarket growth is a little over 30% as well. so it has continued into 2021.
and i know that from a curt perspective, our backlogs have been significant for the last eight, 10 months and really haven't seen much of a slowdown there. so those couple of areas are things i would point to that we're expecting them to continue to be strong throughout 2021.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and again, remember that we've got to the tune of a few million rvs entering the aftermarket cycle because of the significant production over the last handful of years. that's what really catapults our revenues and bottom line in the aftermarket is all the repair and replacement and upgrades that are going to happen as huge units change hands. and as these new units that were new a year or two years ago coming to the replacement in our rv aftermarket cycle in the next year to two years. so i mean it's big volume coming to the aftermarket in the near future.
so that's what we've been riding ourselves for.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
perfect. if i can sneak in one more, if i could just in terms of capex, it looks like to be a strong investment year. we know about obviously the chassis automation project that you completed. are there other discrete automation projects that you can kind of describe in terms of opportunities to create labor efficiencies, etc.?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i'd tell you that we've got three or four smaller projects going on right now that had areas like we're always evaluating those. and if we can take a sell of 20 to 30, which is a typical automation type project size, and get it down to three or four, and i think we still have 350 open positions in the business. so those really help us when we're trying to disperse our great team members to other parts of the business as we automate some of the repetition that we've got all over the business. so i tell you, we always have three or four in the works.
and we'll continue to do a few year on a smaller scale.
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i'd just add to that, that, yes, you're seeing a significant increase in capex. the last couple of years have been somewhat lower after a few years of pretty aggressive capex. so a lot of it is capacity related, trying to free up some space, add new lines. we've got, as jason just mentioned, some of the opportunities that we're getting in new product lines or other product lines, where maybe others have struggled.
yes, we've looked to expand in a lot of those areas, too. so it's probably -- a bulk of it is capacity related for 2021.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
all right. well, hopefully, we can actually get out there sometime later this year and check out some of the projects. thank you for the color.
operator
next question comes from craig kennison with baird.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst
yeah. thanks. good morning. thanks for taking my question.
you had mentioned a project with bennington and obviously that strong relationship. the parent there is polaris. are you signaling at all that you've got some opportunities more broadly with polaris beyond what you do with bennington?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. i think there's certainly opportunities there in the powersports world. i mean we already supply through tailor-made, windshields to some of their side by sides and powersport vehicles, windshields and glass, that's becoming a more popular option there. so we're doing more in that world.
but certainly, with all the manufacturing capabilities we have as our relationship grows stronger with polaris, there's more opportunities for us inside their broader organization. so when we make an acquisition like this with -- like we did with veada that's got significant sales into bennington and ultimately polaris, it just gives us more ability to work with their teams to partner up in a bigger way.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst
is it too much to say that you're opening a new vertical in powersports? and you've got rv, you've been expanding in marine. is it too early to say, hey, that's a new vertical where you could do some more aggressive consolidation?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i mean, we feel like we're in the powersports world on the atvs, at least with windshield and side glass. so we've been doing that for quite a while. it's in our wheelhouse. it's just a matter of expanding our product offering beyond glass in that area.
and i think that we will, it's just going to be a slow process. and we certainly got the people, the leadership, and the manufacturing capabilities and locations geographically to do that. we just need to get with people like polaris and make those commitments on a broader partnership-type basis.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst
and then you mentioned safety as a category. maybe just if you could explain with a few examples where you could be headed in terms of safety?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
we're just -- i'm failing to understand what you're getting out there. sorry.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst
i'm sorry, jason, i thought you indicated that safety was a priority for your organization, and you thought that was a big opportunity.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i'm sorry. ok. yes. yes.
so safety products. right? yes. on if you look at some of our new axle systems that will provide safer axle solutions for rvs, we just launched tire pressure management systems, some electronic pressure and heat sensor that goes into all the tires and wheels of rvs. so that doesn't exist today.
outside of the aftermarket, we're going to take a prep model to the oems, so that they can prep their units for tpms and then just do a plug-and-play in the aftermarket with our tpms system. so autos have had tpms standards since 2008, and it's time that rvs get there, and we've been working on the system for a couple of years. electronic sway control as part of our safety suite of products. so to be able to control sway electronically, so that the driver doesn't have to do it manually is a big deal.
one of the biggest fears about people buying towables is just the sway and towing the vehicle. so if we can help control that through electronic sway control, that's a big deal. so we've got four or five products that are launching and will be launched through the course of this year, and then we're just going to beat the safety drum and get out there and help the dealers sell rvs based on the safety products that might be included or might be included in the aftermarket for the consumer to buy, just like people do when they go shop for a car. so we think we're going to lead in that area.
thanks for clarifying that.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst
yeah. no. thank you, jason.

next question comes from bret jordan with jefferies.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
hey.
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hey.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
you were mentioning sort of the growth in peer-to-peer rental, and i would imagine that drives aftermarket growth given rental units or rental units. is there anything you can do, i guess, sort of more structurally to embed yourself with those rental organizations to be the aftermarket provider.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i'm glad you asked the question. we're working on that right now. we think that there's an incredible opportunity there. again, you go back to just owners now that instead of owning an rv for -- owning an rv and only using it for 10 to 20 days a year, now they can run it three or four or 10 times if they want it.
what other things would you want in the rv that it didn't come equipped with maybe cameras, maybe some of the safety products, some of our cleaning products, and things like that, that we've got? it just gives us a whole new market. i mean, you talk about hundreds of thousands of owners that might be looking at, well, if we market to them and tell them some of the things that they might consider adding to their rv or buying to give their renters a better experience than i think that's better for us. so safety products, i think, are really important in that area. if i've got somebody using my rv, i don't know if they've really driven one or towed one before.
i'd want to have some of those safety products on the rv to ensure a great experience but also ensure that the unit makes it back like it left. so i think there's an incredible opportunity there, and we're working on some things with the rental companies right now. try to make it easy to just give them owners, a sheet, or a menu to choose from to say, hey, look, these are things you might want to consider if you're running your rv.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and i guess you commented that a lot of the rvia shipments are being sold directly through given strong retail demand. do you have any anecdotal color as to what you think retail inventory levels might be right now? i mean, relative to year over year or percentage of lot available for units.
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. it's funny you asked is there was actually a video that went out on rv business yesterday that jason and i were watching this morning. and it's a, i think, a good example of a nice single site dealership typically has 400 to 500 units on their lot at this time of year, and they have 70. so i think that it's pretty significantly depleted.
i'm sure there's some markets, where it's some of the larger consolidated dealerships have been able to build back inventories a little bit, but a lot of the kind of medium-sized locations we're hearing from our touchpoints, they're significantly depleted. and essentially saying that every unit that they get from the oems, it immediately retails; or if it is a stock unit, it's maybe a week or two later and then retail. so the demand is certainly there.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. and then one quick final. i guess just to bucket the tracker opportunity, could you give us maybe a feeling for units and maybe in content per unit, so we can get an idea how big this marine growth is on contract?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. well, they're a monster builder of pontoons and bass boats and fishing boats and things like that. so they're well over 20,000 boats a year, which is significant. so we're going to start off building some furniture for pontoons and continue to add to that product offering.
and we know that we can -- any time a company has ever come to us and ask us to take their vertical, they just -- the vertical is always under-loved. there's no innovation. there's no -- it's just serving and distributing parts to other parts of that division. we have innovation departments.
we have r&d departments. we have pretty sophisticated quality and engineering department. so we feel we build better products than the oems that have those verticals can do themselves. so i think they'll see the value right after that.
we're just getting started, and we'll provide more color as we go along in the future quarters. but we're excited about this relationship. they see the value and a lot of things. we're presenting the electric bimini, which is a brand-new product of ours.
it's been a manual bimini shade cover for years for pontoons, and we have that technology. we're producing more and more of those. and eventually, for a pontoon is an expensive product, people don't want to push a button to get their shade up and down. and those types of manual operations with components are going to go away, and we've got patented solutions for a lot of this stuff.
so whether it's biminis or seating or some of the other components on the boats we'll continue to make our case to provide those customers with products that add value to their proposition to consumers.

shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
yeah. great. hi, jason. hi, brian.
nice to speak with you. good morning.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah.
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
hi, shawn.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
jason, i wanted to ask about one of your new initiatives about around inbound calls? i know you mentioned that you made a new hire around the large volume of calls you get. i think you referenced 60,000 calls. can you just talk more about the nature of the calls that you receive, this new hire, the new initiative, and what the improved customer experience might look like? thanks.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. so it's a great question. we made that change last year. we just wanted somebody from outside the industry to add great call center leadership experience from some -- honestly, some more sophisticated call center type experience in other industries.
so we brought joyce schofield and we immediately changed the name of the care center into the call center, everybody calls their service center a call center. so we want the customer to know that when they call in, we care about them. we've continued to -- we started the call center in 2013. we had decentralized call centers for all of our product divisions.
we consolidated it into one in 2013, and then we've been growing that ever since. i mean, we peaked at 75,000 communications between email and phone over the prior months. so 60,000 is about on average, but that's going to continue to grow this year. over half of those calls are dealer personnel, consumers calling in because they've got components that need to be serviced.
i mean, the one great thing about our aftermarket is we build a lot of products, and they just, over time, whether it's an awning or an axle or a chassis, furniture, i mean, the stuff wears and tears and the dealers and consumers ultimately call in and ask how they can get service. so we've got over 300 people in our aftermarket division, probably 75 in our care center right now. and we handle typically those types of calls. we do get other calls, but most of them are made up of our retail and dealer partners that are calling to get some kind of repair or service or replacement done on our components that wear and tear in the field.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
great. that's helpful. that's an exciting development. thanks for the color.
i appreciate it.

last question comes from steve o'hara with sidoti & company.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks for squeezing me in here. just curious, i mean, sure you guys talked about it directly, maybe i had missed it.
but in terms of the wholesale production that you're expecting for 2021, does that roughly align with the rvia? or how do you guys feel about that?
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
yes. i would say, i mean, first of all, retail, as you know, is the big question mark. that's going to impact our ability to build inventories back up, going to impact our ability to meet the demand. we finished strong as an industry with over 500,000 units this last year.
i think to me, steve, i usually approach it pretty conservatively. i think to expect that to go up. that would be great. i think there's a possibility for that, but let's assume it stays flat from a retail perspective.
but from a wholesale perspective, yes, i think that today, with rvia the 507,000 units, i think that there's certainly opportunity to be north of that. as jason mentioned, the 20 or so facilities that are expected to come online, that's certainly going to help us to get north of that. as you remember, we did 505,000 back in 2017, i think it was. and this is the first capacity that's been added since then.
so i think that that certainly gives us the opportunity to go north of that, assuming supply chain and everything can keep pace.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and again, we've talked a lot about rvs today, but we've got a lot of other parts of our business that aren't really hinging on what the rv business does. so the aftermarket business is going to continue to grow, no matter what the rv wholesale number is, and that's something we're excited about and going to continue to pour energy into our adjacent markets, our international markets. they're going to continue to grow. we're growing significantly in the utility and cargo trailer world right now in terms of components there.
so we got a lot of other good things going on, too.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok. yes. i mean, i mean, could you hazard a guess in terms of maybe how many units the industry needs to produce over retail in order to kind of get back to equilibrium? i mean, it seems like if retail is up even just a little bit, the industry has to produce in excess of that, and you're talking about something in the, i would say, let's say, 520 to 550 range to kind of at least make a dent in some of the units have been taken out. i mean is that the type of number that is maybe a possibility this year? and i guess the bigger question is just on the capex.
my understanding is capex in the past was kind of added. and at least on the oem side, it was something that you could kind of pull back and then reenter as you needed it. is that something different, where if we're doing 550,000 units annually or something like that, i mean, how much capex you're looking at, at that point, kind of on a steady-state basis?
brian hall -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
i would say a couple of things. you're correct in your -- the numbers you were throwing out from an industry perspective, what we'd have to do to build inventories back. i mean, i think 120,000 plus units were taken out of the system over the last two years, which is pretty significant. so to outpace retail, you really -- to build inventories back, i think you got to be in that 50,000, 70,000 type unit level to really get inventories reasonably close to where they should be.
so that's certainly depending on where retail puts you in that 550 plus type category. so it's really going to be the capacity that can come online and how strong watching retail and see where that goes for 2021 and beyond. but from an investment perspective, i mean, i would tell you that from lci's view, if you went back to 2017, the industry was planning to go to 540. so i would tell you, a lot of the capacity investments we made back then were to put us on pace to be able to deliver 540,000 units.
ultimately, the industry never got there. we consolidated a few smaller facilities. but since then, now we've kind of consolidated some things. we're in some bigger, nicer facilities, to where we can add-on and expand capacity.
so i would tell you, we're in that range for, at least, lci, from a capacity perspective and investments that we're doing are to take advantage of new opportunities and grow beyond that.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok. and then maybe just a quick follow-up. can you talk about maybe what percentage of your workforce is vaccinated and maybe what the outlook is there?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. we don't have data around that yet, but we'll have more updates on that in the next quarter's call.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok. thank you.

jason? 
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thank you, brian. good morning, everyone. and welcome to lc industries' first-quarter 2021 earnings call. we are happy to announce that we delivered our best quarter ever to kick off the year.
the growing number of rv enthusiasts has continued at a breakneck pace, driving retail demand to all-time highs. as a result, we have the largest number of rvs on the road, which has set us up for the most robust replacement cycle in the history of the industry. because we have been very intentional over the last eight years around setting up a separate infrastructure to deal with the aftermarket, lippert has uniquely positioned itself to capture this growth from both lifelong enthusiasts and those just entering the market. our proven operational expertise and best-in-class customer service will undoubtedly support continued success for many years to come.
during the quarter, we achieved an astounding $1 billion in revenue, up 52% year over year, which was led by double-digit growth across our rv oem, europe, adjacent markets and aftermarket segments. the strength of our non-rv oem businesses underscores the success of the execution of our diversification strategy we set in motion just 11 years ago and has supported lippert's continued outperformance. we also have achieved solid content per vehicle expansion, considering the current market demographics of record number of first-time buyers generally buying the entry-level products. additionally, we have gained some meaningful market share for this year due to some suppliers' inability to execute during this challenging last 12 months, helping to solidify our position as a leading supplier to the rv and marine industries.
rv oem sales increased 64% year over year to $566 million for the first quarter, driven by unparalleled retail demand as new rvers flock to the lifestyle. further, based on preliminary results, april trends reflect the continuation of that explosive growth. while many in the industry have been faced with supply chain constraints, our team's ability to creatively navigate headwinds showcase our resiliency and strength of our operational leadership. our supply chain and operations teams have been doing a fantastic job juggling one significant challenge after the next over the past several quarters.
the rv industry remains poised for sustained growth as the new generation of rv enthusiasts have converted a novel passion into a way of life that allows them to experience the outdoors, family and friends in an affordable and safe way, especially during the uncertainty of covid. underscoring our confidence in the industry, the rvia's most recent report on 2021 demand shows 533,000 units for wholesale, which surpasses historic levels and surpasses last year's wholesale by 100,000 units. with the largest survey population ever conducted by rvia's recent report, data showed that rv has, all of a sudden, become popular due to the pandemic. in fact, the amount of rv-owning household is up 85% to 11.2 million households from a survey taken in 2001.
it also shows that millennial and gen z owners control 22% of these 11.2 million rv-owning households with over 75% of millennials and gen-zers surveyed saying they intend to buy an rv in the next five years. in total, the survey showed that 9 million households intend on buying an rv in the next five years. complementing these trends is the growing popularity and availability of peer-to-peer rv rental services that invite consumers to taste the rv lifestyle, further developing the foundational infrastructure for future growth. there are many new peer-to-peer digital rental platforms meeting record demand of potential rvers who aren't ready to buy but do try the rv lifestyle out.
many families aren't ready to travel through traditional ways, so we are very excited about peer-to-peer rental opportunity, giving families a very easy way to get away in an rv. despite the ongoing significant wholesale mix shift toward smaller, entry-level products geared toward first-time buyers, we continue to deliver content growth in both total units and motorhomes, a testament to the strength of the lippert brand. content per total rv increased 4% year over year to $3,476, while content per motorhome rv increased 9% to $2,525 year over year. going forward, our market share opportunity remains strong, which is likely to drive further content increases.
operationally, we have a strong foundation to build upon. along with the six new facilities we announced in the last two quarters, we are committing to further expanding our production capacities by executing additional projects, resulting in over 2 million additional square feet of organic capacity altogether. similarly, our efforts to jump start a record number of continuous improvement projects, including some great automation projects this year, continue to free up manufacturing space, enabling us to add capacity. additionally, we expanded our chassis facilities during the quarter, welcoming team members from worldpac chassis, which allowed us to immediately increase our chassis production to meet heightened industry demand and market share gains.
we have been gaining market share in chassis in the last year and needed this capacity to quickly bolt on new customers. turning to our aftermarket segment. total revenues grew to $184 million, another record for first quarter, up 45% year over year, supported by the strength in our curt group. curt, which is running at record level, had strong organic growth across the business.
the curt teams powered through their growing backlog in the first quarter of 2021, which was more than triple what they started with the first quarter of 2020. to accompany curt in the truck accessories segment of their operations, we successfully executed a bolt-on acquisition of ranch hand, an automotive aftermarket supplier of custom bumpers, grill guards and steps in a roughly $5 billion truck accessory market. we're excited to welcome ranch hand's team members to the lippert family and are eager to begin integrating their business into our curt aftermarket business. during the quarter, we saw an incredible number of used rvs under the repair and refurbishment cycle.
with a surge in popularity and growing number of rvs on the road today, consumers will variably seek maintenance services, repairs and upgrades at a much higher level than in years past. as there are a record number of rvs entering their first replacement cycle, coupled with the millions that are already in replacement cycles, makes for an incredible season coming for our aftermarket businesses. lippert remains uniquely positioned to serve this growing community, not only through our aftermarket offerings but by leveraging investments and enhancing the customers' experience. the insight and candid feedback that our customer experience initiatives have received through initiatives such as lippert scouts, social media, brand ambassadors and our campground project, have proven to be invaluable in broadening our competitive advantage in the industry.
from letting these customers know we care to making more customer service programs available, to listening and getting new product ideas, product feedback and suggestions for enhancing our products, this initiative has certainly helped us to become more reliable source for rvers everywhere. we firmly believe helping to play a role in the change of the customer experience will be pivotal to our future success as we support all consumers engaged in the rv lifestyle and become one of the most well-known brands for customer care in the business. turning to our adjacent markets. revenue for the first quarter increased 34% to $251 million, driven by strong performance in marine, which continues to benefit from similar secular tailwinds, driving growth across erp and the aftermarket.
marine remains a primary focus for our diversification strategy and has demonstrated in our recent acquisition of veada industries, one of the country's largest boat seat manufacturers. additionally, we have strengthened our presence in the marine space by supporting the largest boat builder in the country, tracker marine, who just launched a missouri marine division, not too far from the tracker campuses. we are encouraged by the marine industry's scorching growth trends in 2020 and are excited to be expanding our position in the space given the rapid influx of new boaters. outside of marine, we are heavily focused on trailer axles and suspension systems and achieving great market share here, along with other products we sell to trailer manufacturers.
we are also focused on continuing to build a residential and housing window and door businesses, along with a glass solutions and other components for commercial vehicles, power sports vehicles and buses. lippert is focused on driving content growth in all these areas as we further expand into additional markets. our international business has maintained its momentum with revenues increasing 50% year over year to $91 million. we are encouraged by the significant growth opportunity in our international rv oem segment as our european pop-top and other new products hit the fastest-growing rv vehicle type in north america and europe, the class b van market.
the various european countries in which we operate, including germany, italy, the netherlands and the u.k., continue to fall closely behind the trailblazing recovery we saw in the u.s. rv and marine markets, indicating a bright outlook for 2021. europe's ongoing heightened retail demand is strong as european customers turn toward the outdoor lifestyle. first-quarter retail caravan registrations in europe increased almost 20%.
our international excitement continues as we see consistent positive trends of u.s. rv oems adopting our european designed and manufactured components. this helps solidify lippert's reputation with oems as an innovator with the ability to bring these products to the u.s. market on a regular basis.
we remain confident in the ability of our leadership teams to continue to capture demand and drive new growth across the international businesses, thanks to the strong market leaders we have there. in addition to the success of our rv business, we have seen great progress in our marine and rail components businesses in europe. both our marine and rail segments businesses, they continue to gain momentum through market share and efficiency gains and look forward to the growth in these two segments in europe. all in all, we continue to reap the benefits of our diversification strategy.
as we mentioned, we reached a significant milestone in 2020, surpassing more than 50% of our total sales from our adjacent markets, aftermarket and international business. and we are not stopping there. we expect organic and inorganic growth to continue in all these important areas outside of our rv business in the future. we would be remiss not to state that the 10-year journey we have undergone with respect to our culture and leadership transformation is one of the main reasons we are enjoying the success we are having today.
as a result of this transformation and our values and the way we live and meet at work, our team members have made a more conscious decision to stay at lippert for the long haul. and as a result of that, attrition has slowed. recruiting and retention have improved. and in general, when people get more content and excited about their work, home and family, they naturally bring more energy, passion and innovation to the workplace.
having this base achievement or contentment has never been more important than when you go through big challenges or crisis like we've gone through in the last 12 months. today, there is so much available work in our industries that many people who aren't happy with their company are leaving quickly because of higher compensation available to them. this is disruptive for companies as they end up losing large chunks of their workforce and ultimately creates efficiency, safety and quality-related issues. our culture and leadership movements have created significant stability in our workforce as our team members and divisions have been able to take on record demand and even significant market share gains in big product categories like windows, chassis, awnings and where some of our peers were shaken up with workforce-related problems.
our success is also underpinned by our focus on innovation. we remain committed to providing the best experience for the consumers using our products, which includes leading the industry and the advancement of rv and marine component solution. one great example of this is our tire linc tire pressure and temperature management systems, helping to promote safety within the rv business. we are on track to be prepping thousands of rvs annually to provide for our aftermarket team the ability to offer this in the aftermarket easily.
we are prepping more and more rvs for all sorts of products, and it's easier for the rv oems to accept a prep than a full-priced product. and then from there, our aftermarket teams can figure out a way to sell that component in the aftermarket world. safety products also will be a core focus for us over the next several years as we believe consumers will ultimately search for rvs to have the best safety story like they do automobiles. switching gears to capital allocation.
we continue to remain receptive to strategic m&a opportunities while remaining laser-focused on integrating our recent acquisitions and paying down debt. at the same time, we are investing in innovation and optimizing our manufacturing footprint to ensure we maintain the appropriate capacity to meet heightened demand for recreational products. at current pace, we look to be close to a 1.5 times leverage position at the end of the year, considering forecasts and no other acquisitions. we are happy about the way we manage our balance sheet and cash in such a challenging time, and we will continue to be diligent like we have in years past.
in closing, i'd like to thank the nearly 14,000 dependable and dedicated team members across the entire company that contributed to helping power lippert through the first quarter of 2021 and all of 2020 for that matter, while at the same time, cultivating a culture that supports individual team member growth and continuous improvement in all areas of the business. there is no doubt that rvs are a popular way to vacation, even more popular in an era where social distancing and maintaining more control over your environment is important to so many during these times. we look forward to continuing our incredible momentum through 2021 and beyond as we further deliver value for all of our stakeholders. i will now turn to brian, our cfo, to discuss in more detail our first quarter financial results.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
thank you, jason. our consolidated net sales for the first quarter increased 52% to $1 billion compared to the prior year, with acquisitions contributing $41 million or 6% growth over the prior year and organic growth contributing to the balance, driven by strong market performance, coupled with solid company execution. q1 2021 sales to rv oems increased 64% compared to the prior year due to the sustained record rv oem retail demand. sales to adjacent industries grew 34%.
aftermarket segment sales increased 45%, and international sales increased 50% as consumers continue to turn toward outdoor leisure activities, driving strong demand in our markets across the board. as jason mentioned, demand in our core rv and marine markets is at record level, which, coupled with the significant inventory replenishment cycle, is resulting in record production volumes. current rv industry production rates would imply 2021 wholesale shipments of approximately 570,000 to 590,000 units, an all-time record for the industry. growth rates in the marine market are not significantly different as the industry is working feverishly to support demand.
we continue to advance along our diversification strategy with acquired revenues contributing $41 million across the business during the quarter, driven by the recent acquisitions of challenger door and veada. these acquisitions are split across rv oem, $14 million; marine oem, $21 million; and adjacent industries, $6 million. subsequent to quarter end, we announced the closing of two transactions. first, ranch hand, our first bolt-on acquisition for the curt group.
ranch hand represents $50 million of acquired net sales, all of which will be classified in our aftermarket segment. last week, we announced the acquisition of schaudt, which creates a strategic presence for us in germany and represents $25 million of acquired net sales that will be classified in our oem segment. we have also driven further content growth in both towable units and motorhomes. content per towable rv unit increased 4% to $3,476, and content per motorized unit increased 9% to $2,525 compared to the prior year, adjusted to remove the impact of furrion sales from prior periods.
the content increase in towables was primarily driven by organic growth, offset somewhat by the increased demand for entry-level products. in addition, price reductions passed to our customers during the last 12 months, primarily due to commodity index pricing, have negatively impacted content growth, and we estimate significant volatility in oem inventories during 2020 have negatively impacted content growth as well. pro forma towable content growth is estimated to be approximately 7.5%. we expanded operating margins by over 340 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by the favorable impact of leveraging organic sales growth, along with the increase of operational efficiencies driven by increased automation and lean manufacturing initiatives, partially offset by increased labor expense to meet heightened production requirements and the increasing cost of steel, aluminum and freight.
we anticipate the current headwind from higher input cost to continue through the next quarter. as i mentioned last quarter, while the pricing for many of our products is indexed to steel and aluminum costs, there remains the traditional lag time and effectiveness of approximately two quarters. gaap net income in q1 2021 was $74.1 million or $2.93 per diluted share, compared to $28.2 million or $1.12 per diluted share in q1 of 2020, primarily due to the strong growth in sales across all of our business segments. adjusted ebitda increased 68% to $125.9 million for the first quarter.
noncash depreciation and amortization was $24.5 million in the first quarter, while noncash stock-based compensation expense was $7.4 million for the quarter. we continue to anticipate depreciation and amortization in the range of $100 million to $110 million during the full year of 2021, primarily due to increases in capital investments for capacity and efficiencies.for the three months ended march 31, 2021, cash generated from operating activities was $5 million, while $3 million was used for business acquisitions, $21 million for capital expenditures, and $19 million was returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends. total capital expenditures for the first quarter include 56% dedicated to maintenance, 18% in automation investments, and 26% to new market share. with rv retail demand at record levels through the first three months of 2021, the industry has faced challenges with supply chain constraints, rising material costs and tightened labor markets, especially in northern indiana.
to address these challenges, we have strategically managed working capital, including intentionally building up levels of certain inventory items to avoid future shortages and have expanded our production capacity. this has allowed us to further cement our relationships with oems and grab market share from other suppliers that have experienced supply chain issues. at the end of the first quarter, we had an outstanding net debt position of $730 million, 1.8 times pro forma ebitda adjusted to include ltm ebitda of acquired businesses. we continue to prioritize maintaining a strong balance sheet and targeting long-term leverage of one to one and a half times net debt-to-ebitda as we work to integrate recently completed acquisitions, which we believe will contribute strong operating cash flow.
we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $130 million to $150 million for the full-year 2021 as we focus on various smaller scale, continuous improvement and automation projects that support growth and continue to build capacity to support heightened production rates. with these incredible results, we remain confident in our ability to drive growth for lci and deliver shareholder value over the long term as we continue to execute on our proven growth strategy. that is the end of our prepared remarks. operator, we're ready to take questions.
thank you.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of kathryn thompson with thompson research. kathryn, your line is open.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my questions today. first, focusing -- you've done a great job of managing inflation and supply chain in the quarter. as we look forward and really are looking down the barrel of additional costs going up and pricing actions, particularly with steel and aluminum, how are you able to manage those costs? and are there anything other than price increases that can help mitigate the impact of those cost increases? thank you.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, kathryn, hi. specifically around steel, most of that raw material goes into our chassis products and almost 100% of our chassis products are indexed. so we've got a trailing two-quarter lag. so i think the good news is the great results we've had show a significant impact to steel, to our bottom line where we won't really see the price increases on those products, the chassis-related products, until a quarter or two out.
we can't see the steel prices going much higher because they're already at record levels, historical record levels. but if they do, they're -- we do have an index agreement with our large oems to cover us up there. and same with aluminum for the most part.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
okay. and as we -- you outlined a lot of -- several initiatives for growth and also for efficiency. but have you been able to put a number on efficiency gains that came through kind of this painful process of us going through covid and having to rethink about how we approach the world? so it could be anything where, for instance, we're able to have the same output with 70% of the footprint or any type of metric, just to be able to better understand and quantify those productivity gains.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i think it's -- i know brian has got some comments, but i'll chime in just by saying that it's hard to anticipate what the total efficiency gains are with respect to all the ravaging that covid had on our business over time is significant. right now, we're trying to add capacity, like i mentioned in our opening remarks. that'll add significant efficiency. but it's really hard to tell how fatigue and how inefficient the workforce is, given all the overtime we're putting in to keep up with the oems.
but i know brian's got some comments as well.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
right. and what i'd add to that, kathryn, is from a financial perspective, if you went back to q3 as we really started ramping up production volumes and trying to deal with the new covid environment, as you called out, we saw some of our best labor rates that we had seen in the last 10 years or so during that quarter. now it certainly slipped some when we got into q4, but it slowly started to improve from there, which i think is a -- we can credit a lot of that to the automation investments, the lean layouts that we have, the things that we've been investing in for a number of years now that are helping to minimize some of that impact that i think we would have seen had we not done a lot of that pre-covid.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
okay, great. and then, final question is just around acquisition and m&a. always have done historically a good job with that. but the world is a little different.
i notice that marine is part of -- an important part of your strategy. but as you think about end markets or types of businesses where you are placing greater relative focus, how has that changed? and how should we think about your m&a strategy in terms of areas of growth going forward?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i think a big piece of it is we're just getting more comfortable as we've done more acquisitions around aftermarket, around europe in the international market, around adjacent markets and especially marine. so if you go back five years ago, we weren't really doing any acquisitions in those spaces. and today, we're doing more and more there and getting more comfortable. we're getting to know those markets a lot better and getting to know the players a lot better, so that we can have those conversations and look for the strategic fits, just like we did the rv business a decade or a decade and a half ago.
so i think we're getting that level of comfort with all these other markets, and that bodes well for us. and we're just going to be very careful and strategic about the fits with respect to leadership, product innovation and growth strategies that really are the foundation of what we used to decide what acquisitions we're going to make.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
and just one quick clarification. are you primarily focused on fleshing out the marine and/or kind of that, broadly speaking, recreation-focused? or would you be -- would you look even beyond kind of that core focus?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i think marine's being in the recreational segment, being a close no. 2 behind rv, it's always going to have significant opportunity there. but almost a close second our aftermarket and our adjacent markets in the europe market, so -- for rvs and marine over there. so it feels like we've got four real strong buckets of opportunity outside of rv.
and there's still opportunities in rv. so we're just trying to be real selective with the ones that we choose right now.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yup.
operator
your next question comes from the line of daniel moore with cgs securities. daniel, your line is open.
dan moore -- cgs securities -- analyst
good morning, jason and brian. thanks again for taking the questions.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good day.
dan moore -- cgs securities -- analyst
maybe just talk a little bit about the schaudt acquisition. any more detail in terms of growth rates, margin profile? and then, does it set you up for more m&a in germany? and any more detail on the european caravan outlook, in general, would be great.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. the caravan outlook is early there. as we mentioned in our opening remarks, i mean, the wholesale looks like it's 25%, in that range right now. so it's starting to closely trail what we're seeing here in north america.
it's important to have a german presence, and we've been looking for a good german company to fit strategically with our business for -- since we've been doing business in europe, and schaudt's our first acquisition.we had -- we've had an office in germany with some german executives that are helping us work through the rv business over there. but i'd tell you that with respect to schaudt's product, really, the impetus there was just we wanted the ability to have the same kind of technology, head start, integrating smart technology with our products, control systems, things like that, that we do here in the u.s. it's been a huge advantage for us here in the u.s. to have smart technology integrated to all of our components where we can and just add the tech to our components that we've had traditionally and all of our new products.
and we need the same thing there, and they were the best option for us to go forward. and then, probably, the biggest opportunity there is they've got a very limited customer base. and over there, we do business with every oem like we do here. so we can easily move their products to -- through the distribution channels to other customers that they just don't have relationships right now.
so we should be able to grow up pretty well and pretty quick.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and dan, i'd add to that. as i said in my opening remarks, i think that about usd 25 million business, accretive ebitda margins, pretty typical-type purchase price from what we've seen in the past from a multiple perspective, so nothing really unusual there. so great synergies expected out of material savings and being able to cross-sell products, bring more of their products over here to north america because there really aren't products like theirs here. so those are some of the highlights, i'd say, from a financial perspective.
daniel moore -- cgs securities -- analyst
perfect. and then, switching gears. april, obviously, got off to an extremely strong start for q2. $365 million revenue, is that a reasonable run rate to think about given some of the supply chain constraints, etc.?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
from my perspective, from our perspectives in the company, that's what it feels like. we're going to continue to grow as long as the retail demands there. oems are adding capacity. if you take the four months that we've got in the books in terms of run rate, and again, we supply one-to-one chassis just for every -- just about every unit out there.
the ones we don't supply, maybe 15% of the total business, we know what those manufacturers are running, so we can fill in the blanks pretty easy. and if you look at the first four months and then take the run rate in the next eight months, it's a 580,000-type run rate, which the industry is projecting 530,000. so we can -- we know the number is going to be easily in between those two. it's just where is it going to wash out.
but right now, supply chain hasn't held up the business, the rv business much. it's holding up the marine business a little bit, but it hasn't held up the rv business much. and they are -- oems are adding capacity. so you put two and two together, you kind of figure that it's going to be north of 533,000, for sure.
daniel moore -- cgs securities -- analyst
indeed. that's really helpful. and then, maybe last, the 1.5 million -- sorry, 1.5 times leverage ratio that you kind of threw out at year-end, is that just kind of descriptive? or is that kind of a goal should we think about more m&a opportunistically? or are you kind of focused on debt paydown in the near term? thanks.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, dan, it's brian. i -- we typically target somewhere between one and one and a half. but certainly, when the market is right and we get the right strategic opportunities, we would -- we certainly don't have an issue being up two times or even north for the right opportunity. so that's more of our long-term target, but we'll see how things play out.
and we've certainly invested a lot, as we mentioned, in working capital to be prepared and provide a bit of a buffer, so that we don't have as many supply chain issues. and that, coupled with some acquisition opportunities, could certainly keep us north of that. but that's our long-term target.
dan moore -- cgs securities -- analyst
that's what -- that is perfect. thank you again for color. look forward to catching up in a couple of weeks. thanks.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
see you, dan.
operator
your next question comes from the line of fred wightman with wolfe research. fred, your line is open.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys, good morning. thanks for taking the question. i just wanted to touch base on that 570,000 to 590,000 run rate that you touched on and whether you think that that's appropriate. and then, given the seasonality, that seems to imply a bit of a slowdown versus the 54,000 that the industry posted in march.
so wondering if you could just sort of touch on longer term, if you think that's a good industry number. and then, sort of more near term, how we should think about the posted wholesale numbers over the next few months given that drop?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yup. yup. i think we just got to keep connecting the dots and just looking at camping world's release this morning, and they showed a deficit, a reduction of 339 million or so in inventory, new inventory. so as long as the inventory stay depressed, retail demand stays high.
i mean, we're going to have this issue going. i mean, if you take april's run rate, i mean, we're at 605,000. you roll back 12 months, you're at 605,000 number on our calculation. so i mean, the industry is running really strong right now, and inventories don't seem to be improving much.
and retail demand still seems very heavy. so until those two needles start moving the other direction, we're kind of locked in this range.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and fred, i would add to that to be consistent with kind of how i've been describing it for a while. we've been trying to track as closely as we can the weekly production rates. so wholesale is one thing, as you know. and there can -- certainly, when we've had some supply chain disruption here or there, that can create a bit of a disconnect between wholesale shipments and production rates.
so i think we've been close to slow ramp up through the first three months of the year. and when we hit april, it's been somewhere -- we'd estimate somewhere around 12,500 units and north per week. that was pretty consistent all through april. so i would anticipate that barring supply chain disruption that that rate would remain pretty consistent.
and as jason said, as new capacity comes online, likely even increase from there.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's really helpful. i guess, just to shift to the margin front. brian, last quarter, you talked about 100 to 200 basis points of sequential gross margin pressure and then sort of a high-teens operating margin leverage figure. it looks like you sort of came in toward the higher end of that gross margin side but a little bit light on the operating margin leverage.
could you sort of just walk through where the disconnect was? was it just higher materials, some of the labor issues? and how we should think about those going forward?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, a couple of things i would call out. one, i think the timing on some of the material, the inflated material costs pulling through our p&l was likely off a little bit. so i would temper your expectations, some for q2, as that's likely what's happened as it's delayed the pull-through on that to q2. we certainly have some additional price adjustments, as jason mentioned, when indexes will continue to ramp up on steel and aluminum products when we get to q3.
so q2, you might see a little bit more of that pull-through. and then, it was mainly offset then on -- we exceeded expectations on sales growth. so certainly, leveraging that sales growth on our fixed costs, definitely where we saw the offset in the margin.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. thanks, guys.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thanks, fred.
operator
your next question comes from the line of scott stember with cl king. scott, your line is open.
scott stember -- cl king & associates -- analyst
oh, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions as well.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning, scott.
scott stember -- cl king & associates -- analyst
just piggyback to the margins, brian, you gave a pretty good walk through about the cadence. but where do you see -- assuming no further hiccups with regards to major increases in steel and aluminum, what kind of a run rate from an operating margin standpoint could we be looking at as we exit 2021 and heading into the following year?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, you know i'd continue to say that as our aftermarket business grows, which is now -- it's been north of 20% of our business for the last couple of quarters, that's certainly the area that i would anticipate us long term continuing to see some margin appreciation there. from the oem side of the business, it seems to kind of hover in this 8% to 10% type range. so i think that i would expect that pattern to continue through the remainder of the year and into 2022. so like i said, i think that we could see, from a cadence perspective, maybe a little bit of a pullback as we continue to fight some of the inflation in steel and aluminum and the timing of those price adjustments, but then likely see that bounce right back up into this -- the range that we're seeing, at least for this quarter and as aftermarket continues to grow to maybe even see some further appreciation from there.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. i think it's really important, scott, to understand that from a steel standpoint, being close to 30% of our total business on the chassis side or right around there, going from the $0.28 to $0.30 a pound mark upwards toward 70% historical highs, that's impacted us pretty significantly, pretty quick, and we won't recover that until a quarter or two. so that's a big piece. our efficiency gains will continue to get better as we right size capacity.
and then, we've got other issues like marine shrinking at 100% right now, closer to 70% because they're just allocated on certain products, including foam on seating, which is one of our big ones. so that's impacting everybody in the marine side, and that will be back up to 100% toward the end of the month or north of 100% because they'd all like to run more boats than what they were running before the allocations hit.
scott stember -- cl king & associates -- analyst
yeah. and essentially on some of the automation projects, could you just give us an update on the i-beam facility and the recent acquisition that you made to gain that capacity? are there any plans to take that chassis operations and integrate it into the i-beam production lines?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, that's one of our plans. we want to continue to expand on automation. we've already started in chassis. it's the largest project by five times that we've ever taken on, so it's a big project.
it's taken a little bit longer to get where we want, but we're making progress every month and getting to a point where it's paying dividends. i mean, we wouldn't be able to keep up with chassis capacity today if we didn't have it, given the fact that we've not only seen record demand on chassis, but we've taken a lot of market share there over the last handful of months. and then, we've got several -- we've had several window automation projects hit that are doing phenomenal. and we've got a 300,000-square-foot facility we're implementing right now all for glass processing, everything from our current standard glass doors and windows on the rv side to motorhome windshield products and things like that that will be coming later this year.
scott stember -- cl king & associates -- analyst
got it. and then, just last question. jason, could you just give us your views for retail in rvs for the full year?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
man, you got -- you probably got a good handle on that as i do. like i said earlier, we're looking at inventories and what the dealers are having to say about low inventories and kind of watching that and also looking at the dealer feedback regarding lot traffic and things like that, and that doesn't seem to be slowing down. so what we do know is that we'll get a little bit of notice when the lot traffic and retail sales start to ease up, but we don't see any of that in sight right now. so you look at some of the reports at koa and the rvia association did here recently.
and you look at the feedback on people running to the outdoors to spend their leisure time right now, 10 million new camping households to koa's report just this past year. millennials surveyed, 85% millennials and gen z, saying that they would buy an rv in the next five years. 9 million households through the survey said that they'd buy in the next five years in total. and those are significant numbers.
and i think that just alludes to the fact that people are looking to the outdoors for outdoor recreation for what it is that they're going to do with their free time. so i think that that's a good sign for our industry.
scott stember -- cl king & associates -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of bret jordan with jefferies. bret, your line is open.
mark jordan -- jefferies-- analyst
good morning, this is mark jordan, on for bret. this may have already been discussed. but just thinking about the net sales during april, can you maybe break out what portion of that is organic? and what might due to some recent acquisitions?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
i would tell you that so for the first quarter, acquired revenues were $41 million, i believe. and that should be at least what we saw in april. about the only thing you'd have is a little bit of ranch hand, which is about a $50 million acquisition or $50 million of acquired sales. and then, schaudt now here at the end of the month, $25 million annual acquired sales.
so we got a little bit of ranch hand's at $41 million, which represents the fourth-quarter acquisitions that we did, plus now ranch hand and schaudt will be adding to the business on a go-forward basis would be how i'd look at it.
mark jordan -- jefferies-- analyst
ok, great. and then, just thinking about the aftermarket business, can you talk about what's really driving some of the strength there? i mean, is it broad-based strength you're seeing across all product categories? or maybe is there certain product categories that are really outstanding right now?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i think it's pretty broad in a lot of our replacement parts and repair parts. i mean, that's probably the strongest because the service bays are all full at all the dealerships. i mean, there's a lot of dealers adding capacity and service. so i mean, that i'd say service in general, service and repair, warranty, it's pretty backed up across the industry because there's been so many units added to the food chain over the last couple of years.
so probably repair and service parts, but all of our upgrade parts from furniture and all the other accessories and bells and whistles that we have in the aftermarket are doing great. we're expanding our marine aftermarket. we've really been focused there. it was somewhat of a focus, but we've kind of integrated that with our rv aftermarket team.
so it's kind of a recreational aftermarket team now that services both areas, and marine is doing better. and we're finding more and more products to plug in there. one of the great things about aftermarket is we don't have to supply the part on the oem side. so we're out asking all of our aftermarket partners and customers what they need.
and because of our size, we can go out and procure things pretty quickly and take the place of some of these smaller suppliers that are having problems and be in on sales on products this year that we weren't selling last year. so it's good across the board, and it's going to continue to grow.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
i would definitely add to that curt. i mean, curt is definitely on the hitch side of the business. they've set a record every month for, i don't know, how many months now. so their business continues to grow substantially.
i think a lot of that's driven by the demand that you see in all the outdoor recreational products, but as well as some restocking. i think a lot of the wholesale distributors depleted a lot of their inventories last year. and so they continue to restock their shelves as they're looking at increased demand as well.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i'm glad brian brought curt up. it's been a tremendous acquisition for us. we've grown significantly to the tune of 150 kind of run rate million on what we bought it for. and just the short time that we've owned it, i think we acquired it in january of 2020.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
december of '19.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
december of '19, so -- and since we've owned them, they've overtaken the no. 1 spot in hitches. so they've done really good.
mark jordan -- jefferies-- analyst
ok, great. thank you very much for taking the questions.
operator
your next question comes from the line of steve o'hara with sidoti. steve, your line is open.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
hey, steve.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi, just maybe going to the acquisitions you guys made recently. and curt -- i mean, curt, obviously, seemed like a well-timed and well-executed acquisition, larger size than, i guess, any of recent memory. just wondering how you think about the size of acquisition going forward. i mean, it would seem these smaller deals are maybe great from a return standpoint but don't move the needle as much going forward now that you're at kind of $1 billion in sales for the quarter.
how do you think about that? or are you able to kind of grow these things much more quickly once they get into your system?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i think you've hit the nail on the head. i mean, we're typically -- we're buying, say, the smaller companies from $20 million to $50 million. i mean, we're -- one of the big factors is just the rate at which we think we can grow them and the growth track that they're already on. so i mean, that's the most strategic part of the fit.
we're looking for good leadership. that's always important, but that growth run rate is super important. and we tend to find companies and acquire companies that have that great growth track where we can double them or triple the sales over the course of five years. and innovation is huge.
so we're looking for companies that have innovative products in the pipeline or ideas to bring innovation -- innovative products to the market. so that's always important. we never look at the number. we don't look at the size.
we look at the additive value that they can add once they become part of our family and how we can integrate and synergize the business. but the big ones have come along. we've been looking at curt for a long time prior to the time that we bought it, and it was just good timing for both parties. and we're always looking at a few bigger ones.
taylor made was a good-sized acquisition we made in 2018 on the marine side, great brand, and i think it was $140 million in revenues at the time we purchased. so we're looking at those, but it's got to fit the other pieces of the acquisition requirements for us, which is leadership, innovation and growth trajectory.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and then, just maybe on your comments, i think in the press release, it seemed to imply that the upgrade cycle was starting to begin or had started already. is that starting on the rv side? or is that something that you're just kind of expecting to happen and will be a benefit?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
so there's already millions of rvs in the replacement cycle today. but you look at the last three, four years of production, which we would consider the rvs coming into the replacement cycle now, it's the largest population of rvs that have ever entered the replacement cycle. and we're smack dab in the middle of repair parts, service-related activity and then, upgrades for people that are maybe buying the used that are being traded in for all these new units. so that's where the big growth in our aftermarket, the big organic growth in our aftermarket is right now is in all those areas.
so -- and then, you look at the -- you add to that the population of rvs that are being produced last year, this year, next year, probably, those are -- again, you're talking about doubling up what's coming in over the last four years. and that's -- i mean, it's a significant amount of units that are going to hit our business on the aftermarket side. and it's good business for us.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
typically, about a three- to five-year cycle on that, steve, is what we've at least historically seen.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok. and i mean, i guess, since -- i believe things have trended toward entry level, at least maybe in the last year or so. it would seem like that might be a big impact going forward. and maybe just on the inventory, maybe you mentioned this, but can you just talk about when you think the inventory normalizes, assuming kind of current thinking on retail and wholesale within rv and marine?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, we'll take a stab at it, but -- because it all comes down to retail. from a wholesale perspective, like we mentioned, you're probably on a 580-ish, 570,000 to 590,000 is what we said, if we're on that kind of pace, so barring any disruption from supply chain, et cetera. i think retail is what it comes down to.
i think that at the end of february, because most recent retail hasn't come out yet, i think we're on a five -- almost 525,000 unit retail rate on a trailing 12-month basis. i would anticipate that to climb here in the coming months, but then likely kind of level off as we hit some of those all-time record retail months that we saw late last year. and likely, inventories might disrupt that, at least the absence of inventory might disrupt that a little bit as well. but if that put you on a 525,000, we could be rebuilding inventories by 50,000 units or so during this year.
and i think that -- i think they were depleted by 70,000 or 80,000 units last year. so we're still not there even at the end of this year. so that's why i think the expectation is that this still runs into 2022. maybe the first half of the year is when you could maybe bridge the gap on that remaining inventory depletion that we experienced last year to fill that void.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and we've got the same opportunity in europe as well. they're significantly behind on dealer inventories, almost a year out to get product if you're on the retail side.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok, all right. thank you. appreciate your time.

your final question comes from the line of shawn collins with citigroup research. shawn, your line is open.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
great. good morning, jason and brian. how are you guys doing today?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
fine.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
good. thanks.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
good. hey, my question is on the recent german acquisition in the international segment. just wondering, is the european oem market experiencing some of the same supply chain challenges being experienced here in the u.s.? and if so, to what extent?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. so the ones that we're aware of are pretty substantial. they've got some chassis-related issues from motorhomes that appear to be impacting like 10% to 15% of their -- the total european production. so it's significant, but it's not crippling.
so all the rest of the supply chain seems to be able to manage and stay resilient and work around some of the daily issues that we experienced here over the last 12 months. so we -- as long as the chassis suppliers can get back healthy over there because their production is 60% motorhome, so over here, if motorhomes have an issue or opportunity, it's not that big of a staying. but over there, if motorhomes tick up, it's a bigger problem. but all in all, we feel that once they get passed the motorhome chassis, they can get past the supply chain-related issues.
they're running hot in terms of wholesale and increases there, but not nearly as hot as what the u.s. market seems to be, but still up pretty good.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
ok, great. that's helpful. and then, just a follow-up on the same subject, the new german acquisition. i'm presuming it's a large supplier to own erwin hymer a store over there.
is that correct? and then, second, with that, i'm thinking the margins on that german business are potentially lighter than the u.s. margins, which is in line with what we kind of see between erwin hymer and doors u.s. business.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. so like brian said earlier, it's a $25 million revenue business, and it's all tax-related. so typically, the tech margins are going to be a little bit higher than normal. so you might not look at it as compared to a normal widget because it's in the tech field.
and erwin hymer is their largest customer. but in europe, we do just as much business with the other large player over there, trigano, as we do hymer. so there's -- that's where the opportunity is for us is to introduce some to other customers like them that they're not doing any business within and jump their sales up pretty significantly, pretty quick because they've got capacity.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
great. that's helpful. thank you, guys.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thanks.

welcome to the q1 2021 lci industries earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, chief financial officer brian hall. please go ahead.
brian hall -- chief financial officer

jason? 
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thank you, brian. good morning, everyone. and welcome to lc industries' first-quarter 2021 earnings call. we are happy to announce that we delivered our best quarter ever to kick off the year.
the growing number of rv enthusiasts has continued at a breakneck pace, driving retail demand to all-time highs. as a result, we have the largest number of rvs on the road, which has set us up for the most robust replacement cycle in the history of the industry. because we have been very intentional over the last eight years around setting up a separate infrastructure to deal with the aftermarket, lippert has uniquely positioned itself to capture this growth from both lifelong enthusiasts and those just entering the market. our proven operational expertise and best-in-class customer service will undoubtedly support continued success for many years to come.
during the quarter, we achieved an astounding $1 billion in revenue, up 52% year over year, which was led by double-digit growth across our rv oem, europe, adjacent markets and aftermarket segments. the strength of our non-rv oem businesses underscores the success of the execution of our diversification strategy we set in motion just 11 years ago and has supported lippert's continued outperformance. we also have achieved solid content per vehicle expansion, considering the current market demographics of record number of first-time buyers generally buying the entry-level products. additionally, we have gained some meaningful market share for this year due to some suppliers' inability to execute during this challenging last 12 months, helping to solidify our position as a leading supplier to the rv and marine industries.
rv oem sales increased 64% year over year to $566 million for the first quarter, driven by unparalleled retail demand as new rvers flock to the lifestyle. further, based on preliminary results, april trends reflect the continuation of that explosive growth. while many in the industry have been faced with supply chain constraints, our team's ability to creatively navigate headwinds showcase our resiliency and strength of our operational leadership. our supply chain and operations teams have been doing a fantastic job juggling one significant challenge after the next over the past several quarters.
the rv industry remains poised for sustained growth as the new generation of rv enthusiasts have converted a novel passion into a way of life that allows them to experience the outdoors, family and friends in an affordable and safe way, especially during the uncertainty of covid. underscoring our confidence in the industry, the rvia's most recent report on 2021 demand shows 533,000 units for wholesale, which surpasses historic levels and surpasses last year's wholesale by 100,000 units. with the largest survey population ever conducted by rvia's recent report, data showed that rv has, all of a sudden, become popular due to the pandemic. in fact, the amount of rv-owning household is up 85% to 11.2 million households from a survey taken in 2001.
it also shows that millennial and gen z owners control 22% of these 11.2 million rv-owning households with over 75% of millennials and gen-zers surveyed saying they intend to buy an rv in the next five years. in total, the survey showed that 9 million households intend on buying an rv in the next five years. complementing these trends is the growing popularity and availability of peer-to-peer rv rental services that invite consumers to taste the rv lifestyle, further developing the foundational infrastructure for future growth. there are many new peer-to-peer digital rental platforms meeting record demand of potential rvers who aren't ready to buy but do try the rv lifestyle out.
many families aren't ready to travel through traditional ways, so we are very excited about peer-to-peer rental opportunity, giving families a very easy way to get away in an rv. despite the ongoing significant wholesale mix shift toward smaller, entry-level products geared toward first-time buyers, we continue to deliver content growth in both total units and motorhomes, a testament to the strength of the lippert brand. content per total rv increased 4% year over year to $3,476, while content per motorhome rv increased 9% to $2,525 year over year. going forward, our market share opportunity remains strong, which is likely to drive further content increases.
operationally, we have a strong foundation to build upon. along with the six new facilities we announced in the last two quarters, we are committing to further expanding our production capacities by executing additional projects, resulting in over 2 million additional square feet of organic capacity altogether. similarly, our efforts to jump start a record number of continuous improvement projects, including some great automation projects this year, continue to free up manufacturing space, enabling us to add capacity. additionally, we expanded our chassis facilities during the quarter, welcoming team members from worldpac chassis, which allowed us to immediately increase our chassis production to meet heightened industry demand and market share gains.
we have been gaining market share in chassis in the last year and needed this capacity to quickly bolt on new customers. turning to our aftermarket segment. total revenues grew to $184 million, another record for first quarter, up 45% year over year, supported by the strength in our curt group. curt, which is running at record level, had strong organic growth across the business.
the curt teams powered through their growing backlog in the first quarter of 2021, which was more than triple what they started with the first quarter of 2020. to accompany curt in the truck accessories segment of their operations, we successfully executed a bolt-on acquisition of ranch hand, an automotive aftermarket supplier of custom bumpers, grill guards and steps in a roughly $5 billion truck accessory market. we're excited to welcome ranch hand's team members to the lippert family and are eager to begin integrating their business into our curt aftermarket business. during the quarter, we saw an incredible number of used rvs under the repair and refurbishment cycle.
with a surge in popularity and growing number of rvs on the road today, consumers will variably seek maintenance services, repairs and upgrades at a much higher level than in years past. as there are a record number of rvs entering their first replacement cycle, coupled with the millions that are already in replacement cycles, makes for an incredible season coming for our aftermarket businesses. lippert remains uniquely positioned to serve this growing community, not only through our aftermarket offerings but by leveraging investments and enhancing the customers' experience. the insight and candid feedback that our customer experience initiatives have received through initiatives such as lippert scouts, social media, brand ambassadors and our campground project, have proven to be invaluable in broadening our competitive advantage in the industry.
from letting these customers know we care to making more customer service programs available, to listening and getting new product ideas, product feedback and suggestions for enhancing our products, this initiative has certainly helped us to become more reliable source for rvers everywhere. we firmly believe helping to play a role in the change of the customer experience will be pivotal to our future success as we support all consumers engaged in the rv lifestyle and become one of the most well-known brands for customer care in the business. turning to our adjacent markets. revenue for the first quarter increased 34% to $251 million, driven by strong performance in marine, which continues to benefit from similar secular tailwinds, driving growth across erp and the aftermarket.
marine remains a primary focus for our diversification strategy and has demonstrated in our recent acquisition of veada industries, one of the country's largest boat seat manufacturers. additionally, we have strengthened our presence in the marine space by supporting the largest boat builder in the country, tracker marine, who just launched a missouri marine division, not too far from the tracker campuses. we are encouraged by the marine industry's scorching growth trends in 2020 and are excited to be expanding our position in the space given the rapid influx of new boaters. outside of marine, we are heavily focused on trailer axles and suspension systems and achieving great market share here, along with other products we sell to trailer manufacturers.
we are also focused on continuing to build a residential and housing window and door businesses, along with a glass solutions and other components for commercial vehicles, power sports vehicles and buses. lippert is focused on driving content growth in all these areas as we further expand into additional markets. our international business has maintained its momentum with revenues increasing 50% year over year to $91 million. we are encouraged by the significant growth opportunity in our international rv oem segment as our european pop-top and other new products hit the fastest-growing rv vehicle type in north america and europe, the class b van market.
the various european countries in which we operate, including germany, italy, the netherlands and the u.k., continue to fall closely behind the trailblazing recovery we saw in the u.s. rv and marine markets, indicating a bright outlook for 2021. europe's ongoing heightened retail demand is strong as european customers turn toward the outdoor lifestyle. first-quarter retail caravan registrations in europe increased almost 20%.
our international excitement continues as we see consistent positive trends of u.s. rv oems adopting our european designed and manufactured components. this helps solidify lippert's reputation with oems as an innovator with the ability to bring these products to the u.s. market on a regular basis.
we remain confident in the ability of our leadership teams to continue to capture demand and drive new growth across the international businesses, thanks to the strong market leaders we have there. in addition to the success of our rv business, we have seen great progress in our marine and rail components businesses in europe. both our marine and rail segments businesses, they continue to gain momentum through market share and efficiency gains and look forward to the growth in these two segments in europe. all in all, we continue to reap the benefits of our diversification strategy.
as we mentioned, we reached a significant milestone in 2020, surpassing more than 50% of our total sales from our adjacent markets, aftermarket and international business. and we are not stopping there. we expect organic and inorganic growth to continue in all these important areas outside of our rv business in the future. we would be remiss not to state that the 10-year journey we have undergone with respect to our culture and leadership transformation is one of the main reasons we are enjoying the success we are having today.
as a result of this transformation and our values and the way we live and meet at work, our team members have made a more conscious decision to stay at lippert for the long haul. and as a result of that, attrition has slowed. recruiting and retention have improved. and in general, when people get more content and excited about their work, home and family, they naturally bring more energy, passion and innovation to the workplace.
having this base achievement or contentment has never been more important than when you go through big challenges or crisis like we've gone through in the last 12 months. today, there is so much available work in our industries that many people who aren't happy with their company are leaving quickly because of higher compensation available to them. this is disruptive for companies as they end up losing large chunks of their workforce and ultimately creates efficiency, safety and quality-related issues. our culture and leadership movements have created significant stability in our workforce as our team members and divisions have been able to take on record demand and even significant market share gains in big product categories like windows, chassis, awnings and where some of our peers were shaken up with workforce-related problems.
our success is also underpinned by our focus on innovation. we remain committed to providing the best experience for the consumers using our products, which includes leading the industry and the advancement of rv and marine component solution. one great example of this is our tire linc tire pressure and temperature management systems, helping to promote safety within the rv business. we are on track to be prepping thousands of rvs annually to provide for our aftermarket team the ability to offer this in the aftermarket easily.
we are prepping more and more rvs for all sorts of products, and it's easier for the rv oems to accept a prep than a full-priced product. and then from there, our aftermarket teams can figure out a way to sell that component in the aftermarket world. safety products also will be a core focus for us over the next several years as we believe consumers will ultimately search for rvs to have the best safety story like they do automobiles. switching gears to capital allocation.
we continue to remain receptive to strategic m&a opportunities while remaining laser-focused on integrating our recent acquisitions and paying down debt. at the same time, we are investing in innovation and optimizing our manufacturing footprint to ensure we maintain the appropriate capacity to meet heightened demand for recreational products. at current pace, we look to be close to a 1.5 times leverage position at the end of the year, considering forecasts and no other acquisitions. we are happy about the way we manage our balance sheet and cash in such a challenging time, and we will continue to be diligent like we have in years past.
in closing, i'd like to thank the nearly 14,000 dependable and dedicated team members across the entire company that contributed to helping power lippert through the first quarter of 2021 and all of 2020 for that matter, while at the same time, cultivating a culture that supports individual team member growth and continuous improvement in all areas of the business. there is no doubt that rvs are a popular way to vacation, even more popular in an era where social distancing and maintaining more control over your environment is important to so many during these times. we look forward to continuing our incredible momentum through 2021 and beyond as we further deliver value for all of our stakeholders. i will now turn to brian, our cfo, to discuss in more detail our first quarter financial results.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
thank you, jason. our consolidated net sales for the first quarter increased 52% to $1 billion compared to the prior year, with acquisitions contributing $41 million or 6% growth over the prior year and organic growth contributing to the balance, driven by strong market performance, coupled with solid company execution. q1 2021 sales to rv oems increased 64% compared to the prior year due to the sustained record rv oem retail demand. sales to adjacent industries grew 34%.
aftermarket segment sales increased 45%, and international sales increased 50% as consumers continue to turn toward outdoor leisure activities, driving strong demand in our markets across the board. as jason mentioned, demand in our core rv and marine markets is at record level, which, coupled with the significant inventory replenishment cycle, is resulting in record production volumes. current rv industry production rates would imply 2021 wholesale shipments of approximately 570,000 to 590,000 units, an all-time record for the industry. growth rates in the marine market are not significantly different as the industry is working feverishly to support demand.
we continue to advance along our diversification strategy with acquired revenues contributing $41 million across the business during the quarter, driven by the recent acquisitions of challenger door and veada. these acquisitions are split across rv oem, $14 million; marine oem, $21 million; and adjacent industries, $6 million. subsequent to quarter end, we announced the closing of two transactions. first, ranch hand, our first bolt-on acquisition for the curt group.
ranch hand represents $50 million of acquired net sales, all of which will be classified in our aftermarket segment. last week, we announced the acquisition of schaudt, which creates a strategic presence for us in germany and represents $25 million of acquired net sales that will be classified in our oem segment. we have also driven further content growth in both towable units and motorhomes. content per towable rv unit increased 4% to $3,476, and content per motorized unit increased 9% to $2,525 compared to the prior year, adjusted to remove the impact of furrion sales from prior periods.
the content increase in towables was primarily driven by organic growth, offset somewhat by the increased demand for entry-level products. in addition, price reductions passed to our customers during the last 12 months, primarily due to commodity index pricing, have negatively impacted content growth, and we estimate significant volatility in oem inventories during 2020 have negatively impacted content growth as well. pro forma towable content growth is estimated to be approximately 7.5%. we expanded operating margins by over 340 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by the favorable impact of leveraging organic sales growth, along with the increase of operational efficiencies driven by increased automation and lean manufacturing initiatives, partially offset by increased labor expense to meet heightened production requirements and the increasing cost of steel, aluminum and freight.
we anticipate the current headwind from higher input cost to continue through the next quarter. as i mentioned last quarter, while the pricing for many of our products is indexed to steel and aluminum costs, there remains the traditional lag time and effectiveness of approximately two quarters. gaap net income in q1 2021 was $74.1 million or $2.93 per diluted share, compared to $28.2 million or $1.12 per diluted share in q1 of 2020, primarily due to the strong growth in sales across all of our business segments. adjusted ebitda increased 68% to $125.9 million for the first quarter.
noncash depreciation and amortization was $24.5 million in the first quarter, while noncash stock-based compensation expense was $7.4 million for the quarter. we continue to anticipate depreciation and amortization in the range of $100 million to $110 million during the full year of 2021, primarily due to increases in capital investments for capacity and efficiencies.for the three months ended march 31, 2021, cash generated from operating activities was $5 million, while $3 million was used for business acquisitions, $21 million for capital expenditures, and $19 million was returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends. total capital expenditures for the first quarter include 56% dedicated to maintenance, 18% in automation investments, and 26% to new market share. with rv retail demand at record levels through the first three months of 2021, the industry has faced challenges with supply chain constraints, rising material costs and tightened labor markets, especially in northern indiana.
to address these challenges, we have strategically managed working capital, including intentionally building up levels of certain inventory items to avoid future shortages and have expanded our production capacity. this has allowed us to further cement our relationships with oems and grab market share from other suppliers that have experienced supply chain issues. at the end of the first quarter, we had an outstanding net debt position of $730 million, 1.8 times pro forma ebitda adjusted to include ltm ebitda of acquired businesses. we continue to prioritize maintaining a strong balance sheet and targeting long-term leverage of one to one and a half times net debt-to-ebitda as we work to integrate recently completed acquisitions, which we believe will contribute strong operating cash flow.
we continue to expect capital expenditures in the range of $130 million to $150 million for the full-year 2021 as we focus on various smaller scale, continuous improvement and automation projects that support growth and continue to build capacity to support heightened production rates. with these incredible results, we remain confident in our ability to drive growth for lci and deliver shareholder value over the long term as we continue to execute on our proven growth strategy. that is the end of our prepared remarks. operator, we're ready to take questions.

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of kathryn thompson with thompson research. kathryn, your line is open.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my questions today. first, focusing -- you've done a great job of managing inflation and supply chain in the quarter. as we look forward and really are looking down the barrel of additional costs going up and pricing actions, particularly with steel and aluminum, how are you able to manage those costs? and are there anything other than price increases that can help mitigate the impact of those cost increases? thank you.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, kathryn, hi. specifically around steel, most of that raw material goes into our chassis products and almost 100% of our chassis products are indexed. so we've got a trailing two-quarter lag. so i think the good news is the great results we've had show a significant impact to steel, to our bottom line where we won't really see the price increases on those products, the chassis-related products, until a quarter or two out.
we can't see the steel prices going much higher because they're already at record levels, historical record levels. but if they do, they're -- we do have an index agreement with our large oems to cover us up there. and same with aluminum for the most part.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
okay. and as we -- you outlined a lot of -- several initiatives for growth and also for efficiency. but have you been able to put a number on efficiency gains that came through kind of this painful process of us going through covid and having to rethink about how we approach the world? so it could be anything where, for instance, we're able to have the same output with 70% of the footprint or any type of metric, just to be able to better understand and quantify those productivity gains.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i think it's -- i know brian has got some comments, but i'll chime in just by saying that it's hard to anticipate what the total efficiency gains are with respect to all the ravaging that covid had on our business over time is significant. right now, we're trying to add capacity, like i mentioned in our opening remarks. that'll add significant efficiency. but it's really hard to tell how fatigue and how inefficient the workforce is, given all the overtime we're putting in to keep up with the oems.
but i know brian's got some comments as well.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
right. and what i'd add to that, kathryn, is from a financial perspective, if you went back to q3 as we really started ramping up production volumes and trying to deal with the new covid environment, as you called out, we saw some of our best labor rates that we had seen in the last 10 years or so during that quarter. now it certainly slipped some when we got into q4, but it slowly started to improve from there, which i think is a -- we can credit a lot of that to the automation investments, the lean layouts that we have, the things that we've been investing in for a number of years now that are helping to minimize some of that impact that i think we would have seen had we not done a lot of that pre-covid.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
okay, great. and then, final question is just around acquisition and m&a. always have done historically a good job with that. but the world is a little different.
i notice that marine is part of -- an important part of your strategy. but as you think about end markets or types of businesses where you are placing greater relative focus, how has that changed? and how should we think about your m&a strategy in terms of areas of growth going forward?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i think a big piece of it is we're just getting more comfortable as we've done more acquisitions around aftermarket, around europe in the international market, around adjacent markets and especially marine. so if you go back five years ago, we weren't really doing any acquisitions in those spaces. and today, we're doing more and more there and getting more comfortable. we're getting to know those markets a lot better and getting to know the players a lot better, so that we can have those conversations and look for the strategic fits, just like we did the rv business a decade or a decade and a half ago.
so i think we're getting that level of comfort with all these other markets, and that bodes well for us. and we're just going to be very careful and strategic about the fits with respect to leadership, product innovation and growth strategies that really are the foundation of what we used to decide what acquisitions we're going to make.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
and just one quick clarification. are you primarily focused on fleshing out the marine and/or kind of that, broadly speaking, recreation-focused? or would you be -- would you look even beyond kind of that core focus?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i think marine's being in the recreational segment, being a close no. 2 behind rv, it's always going to have significant opportunity there. but almost a close second our aftermarket and our adjacent markets in the europe market, so -- for rvs and marine over there. so it feels like we've got four real strong buckets of opportunity outside of rv.
and there's still opportunities in rv. so we're just trying to be real selective with the ones that we choose right now.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
okay, great. thank you very much.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yup.

your next question comes from the line of daniel moore with cgs securities. daniel, your line is open.
dan moore -- cgs securities -- analyst
good morning, jason and brian. thanks again for taking the questions.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good day.
dan moore -- cgs securities -- analyst
maybe just talk a little bit about the schaudt acquisition. any more detail in terms of growth rates, margin profile? and then, does it set you up for more m&a in germany? and any more detail on the european caravan outlook, in general, would be great.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. the caravan outlook is early there. as we mentioned in our opening remarks, i mean, the wholesale looks like it's 25%, in that range right now. so it's starting to closely trail what we're seeing here in north america.
it's important to have a german presence, and we've been looking for a good german company to fit strategically with our business for -- since we've been doing business in europe, and schaudt's our first acquisition.we had -- we've had an office in germany with some german executives that are helping us work through the rv business over there. but i'd tell you that with respect to schaudt's product, really, the impetus there was just we wanted the ability to have the same kind of technology, head start, integrating smart technology with our products, control systems, things like that, that we do here in the u.s. it's been a huge advantage for us here in the u.s. to have smart technology integrated to all of our components where we can and just add the tech to our components that we've had traditionally and all of our new products.
and we need the same thing there, and they were the best option for us to go forward. and then, probably, the biggest opportunity there is they've got a very limited customer base. and over there, we do business with every oem like we do here. so we can easily move their products to -- through the distribution channels to other customers that they just don't have relationships right now.
so we should be able to grow up pretty well and pretty quick.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and dan, i'd add to that. as i said in my opening remarks, i think that about usd 25 million business, accretive ebitda margins, pretty typical-type purchase price from what we've seen in the past from a multiple perspective, so nothing really unusual there. so great synergies expected out of material savings and being able to cross-sell products, bring more of their products over here to north america because there really aren't products like theirs here. so those are some of the highlights, i'd say, from a financial perspective.
daniel moore -- cgs securities -- analyst
perfect. and then, switching gears. april, obviously, got off to an extremely strong start for q2. $365 million revenue, is that a reasonable run rate to think about given some of the supply chain constraints, etc.?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
from my perspective, from our perspectives in the company, that's what it feels like. we're going to continue to grow as long as the retail demands there. oems are adding capacity. if you take the four months that we've got in the books in terms of run rate, and again, we supply one-to-one chassis just for every -- just about every unit out there.
the ones we don't supply, maybe 15% of the total business, we know what those manufacturers are running, so we can fill in the blanks pretty easy. and if you look at the first four months and then take the run rate in the next eight months, it's a 580,000-type run rate, which the industry is projecting 530,000. so we can -- we know the number is going to be easily in between those two. it's just where is it going to wash out.
but right now, supply chain hasn't held up the business, the rv business much. it's holding up the marine business a little bit, but it hasn't held up the rv business much. and they are -- oems are adding capacity. so you put two and two together, you kind of figure that it's going to be north of 533,000, for sure.
daniel moore -- cgs securities -- analyst
indeed. that's really helpful. and then, maybe last, the 1.5 million -- sorry, 1.5 times leverage ratio that you kind of threw out at year-end, is that just kind of descriptive? or is that kind of a goal should we think about more m&a opportunistically? or are you kind of focused on debt paydown in the near term? thanks.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, dan, it's brian. i -- we typically target somewhere between one and one and a half. but certainly, when the market is right and we get the right strategic opportunities, we would -- we certainly don't have an issue being up two times or even north for the right opportunity. so that's more of our long-term target, but we'll see how things play out.
and we've certainly invested a lot, as we mentioned, in working capital to be prepared and provide a bit of a buffer, so that we don't have as many supply chain issues. and that, coupled with some acquisition opportunities, could certainly keep us north of that. but that's our long-term target.
dan moore -- cgs securities -- analyst
that's what -- that is perfect. thank you again for color. look forward to catching up in a couple of weeks. thanks.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
see you, dan.
operator
your next question comes from the line of fred wightman with wolfe research. fred, your line is open.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys, good morning. thanks for taking the question. i just wanted to touch base on that 570,000 to 590,000 run rate that you touched on and whether you think that that's appropriate. and then, given the seasonality, that seems to imply a bit of a slowdown versus the 54,000 that the industry posted in march.
so wondering if you could just sort of touch on longer term, if you think that's a good industry number. and then, sort of more near term, how we should think about the posted wholesale numbers over the next few months given that drop?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yup. yup. i think we just got to keep connecting the dots and just looking at camping world's release this morning, and they showed a deficit, a reduction of 339 million or so in inventory, new inventory. so as long as the inventory stay depressed, retail demand stays high.
i mean, we're going to have this issue going. i mean, if you take april's run rate, i mean, we're at 605,000. you roll back 12 months, you're at 605,000 number on our calculation. so i mean, the industry is running really strong right now, and inventories don't seem to be improving much.
and retail demand still seems very heavy. so until those two needles start moving the other direction, we're kind of locked in this range.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and fred, i would add to that to be consistent with kind of how i've been describing it for a while. we've been trying to track as closely as we can the weekly production rates. so wholesale is one thing, as you know. and there can -- certainly, when we've had some supply chain disruption here or there, that can create a bit of a disconnect between wholesale shipments and production rates.
so i think we've been close to slow ramp up through the first three months of the year. and when we hit april, it's been somewhere -- we'd estimate somewhere around 12,500 units and north per week. that was pretty consistent all through april. so i would anticipate that barring supply chain disruption that that rate would remain pretty consistent.
and as jason said, as new capacity comes online, likely even increase from there.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
that's really helpful. i guess, just to shift to the margin front. brian, last quarter, you talked about 100 to 200 basis points of sequential gross margin pressure and then sort of a high-teens operating margin leverage figure. it looks like you sort of came in toward the higher end of that gross margin side but a little bit light on the operating margin leverage.
could you sort of just walk through where the disconnect was? was it just higher materials, some of the labor issues? and how we should think about those going forward?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, a couple of things i would call out. one, i think the timing on some of the material, the inflated material costs pulling through our p&l was likely off a little bit. so i would temper your expectations, some for q2, as that's likely what's happened as it's delayed the pull-through on that to q2. we certainly have some additional price adjustments, as jason mentioned, when indexes will continue to ramp up on steel and aluminum products when we get to q3.
so q2, you might see a little bit more of that pull-through. and then, it was mainly offset then on -- we exceeded expectations on sales growth. so certainly, leveraging that sales growth on our fixed costs, definitely where we saw the offset in the margin.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. thanks, guys.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thanks, fred.

your next question comes from the line of scott stember with cl king. scott, your line is open.
scott stember -- cl king & associates -- analyst
oh, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions as well.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning, scott.
scott stember -- cl king & associates -- analyst
just piggyback to the margins, brian, you gave a pretty good walk through about the cadence. but where do you see -- assuming no further hiccups with regards to major increases in steel and aluminum, what kind of a run rate from an operating margin standpoint could we be looking at as we exit 2021 and heading into the following year?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, you know i'd continue to say that as our aftermarket business grows, which is now -- it's been north of 20% of our business for the last couple of quarters, that's certainly the area that i would anticipate us long term continuing to see some margin appreciation there. from the oem side of the business, it seems to kind of hover in this 8% to 10% type range. so i think that i would expect that pattern to continue through the remainder of the year and into 2022. so like i said, i think that we could see, from a cadence perspective, maybe a little bit of a pullback as we continue to fight some of the inflation in steel and aluminum and the timing of those price adjustments, but then likely see that bounce right back up into this -- the range that we're seeing, at least for this quarter and as aftermarket continues to grow to maybe even see some further appreciation from there.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. i think it's really important, scott, to understand that from a steel standpoint, being close to 30% of our total business on the chassis side or right around there, going from the $0.28 to $0.30 a pound mark upwards toward 70% historical highs, that's impacted us pretty significantly, pretty quick, and we won't recover that until a quarter or two. so that's a big piece. our efficiency gains will continue to get better as we right size capacity.
and then, we've got other issues like marine shrinking at 100% right now, closer to 70% because they're just allocated on certain products, including foam on seating, which is one of our big ones. so that's impacting everybody in the marine side, and that will be back up to 100% toward the end of the month or north of 100% because they'd all like to run more boats than what they were running before the allocations hit.
scott stember -- cl king & associates -- analyst
yeah. and essentially on some of the automation projects, could you just give us an update on the i-beam facility and the recent acquisition that you made to gain that capacity? are there any plans to take that chassis operations and integrate it into the i-beam production lines?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, that's one of our plans. we want to continue to expand on automation. we've already started in chassis. it's the largest project by five times that we've ever taken on, so it's a big project.
it's taken a little bit longer to get where we want, but we're making progress every month and getting to a point where it's paying dividends. i mean, we wouldn't be able to keep up with chassis capacity today if we didn't have it, given the fact that we've not only seen record demand on chassis, but we've taken a lot of market share there over the last handful of months. and then, we've got several -- we've had several window automation projects hit that are doing phenomenal. and we've got a 300,000-square-foot facility we're implementing right now all for glass processing, everything from our current standard glass doors and windows on the rv side to motorhome windshield products and things like that that will be coming later this year.
scott stember -- cl king & associates -- analyst
got it. and then, just last question. jason, could you just give us your views for retail in rvs for the full year?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
man, you got -- you probably got a good handle on that as i do. like i said earlier, we're looking at inventories and what the dealers are having to say about low inventories and kind of watching that and also looking at the dealer feedback regarding lot traffic and things like that, and that doesn't seem to be slowing down. so what we do know is that we'll get a little bit of notice when the lot traffic and retail sales start to ease up, but we don't see any of that in sight right now. so you look at some of the reports at koa and the rvia association did here recently.
and you look at the feedback on people running to the outdoors to spend their leisure time right now, 10 million new camping households to koa's report just this past year. millennials surveyed, 85% millennials and gen z, saying that they would buy an rv in the next five years. 9 million households through the survey said that they'd buy in the next five years in total. and those are significant numbers.
and i think that just alludes to the fact that people are looking to the outdoors for outdoor recreation for what it is that they're going to do with their free time. so i think that that's a good sign for our industry.
scott stember -- cl king & associates -- analyst
got it. thank you so much.
operator
your next question comes from the line of bret jordan with jefferies. bret, your line is open.
mark jordan -- jefferies-- analyst
good morning, this is mark jordan, on for bret. this may have already been discussed. but just thinking about the net sales during april, can you maybe break out what portion of that is organic? and what might due to some recent acquisitions?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
i would tell you that so for the first quarter, acquired revenues were $41 million, i believe. and that should be at least what we saw in april. about the only thing you'd have is a little bit of ranch hand, which is about a $50 million acquisition or $50 million of acquired sales. and then, schaudt now here at the end of the month, $25 million annual acquired sales.
so we got a little bit of ranch hand's at $41 million, which represents the fourth-quarter acquisitions that we did, plus now ranch hand and schaudt will be adding to the business on a go-forward basis would be how i'd look at it.
mark jordan -- jefferies-- analyst
ok, great. and then, just thinking about the aftermarket business, can you talk about what's really driving some of the strength there? i mean, is it broad-based strength you're seeing across all product categories? or maybe is there certain product categories that are really outstanding right now?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i think it's pretty broad in a lot of our replacement parts and repair parts. i mean, that's probably the strongest because the service bays are all full at all the dealerships. i mean, there's a lot of dealers adding capacity and service. so i mean, that i'd say service in general, service and repair, warranty, it's pretty backed up across the industry because there's been so many units added to the food chain over the last couple of years.
so probably repair and service parts, but all of our upgrade parts from furniture and all the other accessories and bells and whistles that we have in the aftermarket are doing great. we're expanding our marine aftermarket. we've really been focused there. it was somewhat of a focus, but we've kind of integrated that with our rv aftermarket team.
so it's kind of a recreational aftermarket team now that services both areas, and marine is doing better. and we're finding more and more products to plug in there. one of the great things about aftermarket is we don't have to supply the part on the oem side. so we're out asking all of our aftermarket partners and customers what they need.
and because of our size, we can go out and procure things pretty quickly and take the place of some of these smaller suppliers that are having problems and be in on sales on products this year that we weren't selling last year. so it's good across the board, and it's going to continue to grow.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
i would definitely add to that curt. i mean, curt is definitely on the hitch side of the business. they've set a record every month for, i don't know, how many months now. so their business continues to grow substantially.
i think a lot of that's driven by the demand that you see in all the outdoor recreational products, but as well as some restocking. i think a lot of the wholesale distributors depleted a lot of their inventories last year. and so they continue to restock their shelves as they're looking at increased demand as well.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i'm glad brian brought curt up. it's been a tremendous acquisition for us. we've grown significantly to the tune of 150 kind of run rate million on what we bought it for. and just the short time that we've owned it, i think we acquired it in january of 2020.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
december of '19.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
december of '19, so -- and since we've owned them, they've overtaken the no. 1 spot in hitches. so they've done really good.
mark jordan -- jefferies-- analyst
ok, great. thank you very much for taking the questions.
operator
your next question comes from the line of steve o'hara with sidoti. steve, your line is open.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
hey, steve.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
hi, just maybe going to the acquisitions you guys made recently. and curt -- i mean, curt, obviously, seemed like a well-timed and well-executed acquisition, larger size than, i guess, any of recent memory. just wondering how you think about the size of acquisition going forward. i mean, it would seem these smaller deals are maybe great from a return standpoint but don't move the needle as much going forward now that you're at kind of $1 billion in sales for the quarter.
how do you think about that? or are you able to kind of grow these things much more quickly once they get into your system?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i think you've hit the nail on the head. i mean, we're typically -- we're buying, say, the smaller companies from $20 million to $50 million. i mean, we're -- one of the big factors is just the rate at which we think we can grow them and the growth track that they're already on. so i mean, that's the most strategic part of the fit.
we're looking for good leadership. that's always important, but that growth run rate is super important. and we tend to find companies and acquire companies that have that great growth track where we can double them or triple the sales over the course of five years. and innovation is huge.
so we're looking for companies that have innovative products in the pipeline or ideas to bring innovation -- innovative products to the market. so that's always important. we never look at the number. we don't look at the size.
we look at the additive value that they can add once they become part of our family and how we can integrate and synergize the business. but the big ones have come along. we've been looking at curt for a long time prior to the time that we bought it, and it was just good timing for both parties. and we're always looking at a few bigger ones.
taylor made was a good-sized acquisition we made in 2018 on the marine side, great brand, and i think it was $140 million in revenues at the time we purchased. so we're looking at those, but it's got to fit the other pieces of the acquisition requirements for us, which is leadership, innovation and growth trajectory.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok, that's helpful. and then, just maybe on your comments, i think in the press release, it seemed to imply that the upgrade cycle was starting to begin or had started already. is that starting on the rv side? or is that something that you're just kind of expecting to happen and will be a benefit?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
so there's already millions of rvs in the replacement cycle today. but you look at the last three, four years of production, which we would consider the rvs coming into the replacement cycle now, it's the largest population of rvs that have ever entered the replacement cycle. and we're smack dab in the middle of repair parts, service-related activity and then, upgrades for people that are maybe buying the used that are being traded in for all these new units. so that's where the big growth in our aftermarket, the big organic growth in our aftermarket is right now is in all those areas.
so -- and then, you look at the -- you add to that the population of rvs that are being produced last year, this year, next year, probably, those are -- again, you're talking about doubling up what's coming in over the last four years. and that's -- i mean, it's a significant amount of units that are going to hit our business on the aftermarket side. and it's good business for us.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
typically, about a three- to five-year cycle on that, steve, is what we've at least historically seen.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok. and i mean, i guess, since -- i believe things have trended toward entry level, at least maybe in the last year or so. it would seem like that might be a big impact going forward. and maybe just on the inventory, maybe you mentioned this, but can you just talk about when you think the inventory normalizes, assuming kind of current thinking on retail and wholesale within rv and marine?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, we'll take a stab at it, but -- because it all comes down to retail. from a wholesale perspective, like we mentioned, you're probably on a 580-ish, 570,000 to 590,000 is what we said, if we're on that kind of pace, so barring any disruption from supply chain, et cetera. i think retail is what it comes down to.
i think that at the end of february, because most recent retail hasn't come out yet, i think we're on a five -- almost 525,000 unit retail rate on a trailing 12-month basis. i would anticipate that to climb here in the coming months, but then likely kind of level off as we hit some of those all-time record retail months that we saw late last year. and likely, inventories might disrupt that, at least the absence of inventory might disrupt that a little bit as well. but if that put you on a 525,000, we could be rebuilding inventories by 50,000 units or so during this year.
and i think that -- i think they were depleted by 70,000 or 80,000 units last year. so we're still not there even at the end of this year. so that's why i think the expectation is that this still runs into 2022. maybe the first half of the year is when you could maybe bridge the gap on that remaining inventory depletion that we experienced last year to fill that void.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and we've got the same opportunity in europe as well. they're significantly behind on dealer inventories, almost a year out to get product if you're on the retail side.
steve o'hara -- sidoti & company -- analyst
ok, all right. thank you. appreciate your time.

your final question comes from the line of shawn collins with citigroup research. shawn, your line is open.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
great. good morning, jason and brian. how are you guys doing today?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
fine.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
good. thanks.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
good. hey, my question is on the recent german acquisition in the international segment. just wondering, is the european oem market experiencing some of the same supply chain challenges being experienced here in the u.s.? and if so, to what extent?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. so the ones that we're aware of are pretty substantial. they've got some chassis-related issues from motorhomes that appear to be impacting like 10% to 15% of their -- the total european production. so it's significant, but it's not crippling.
so all the rest of the supply chain seems to be able to manage and stay resilient and work around some of the daily issues that we experienced here over the last 12 months. so we -- as long as the chassis suppliers can get back healthy over there because their production is 60% motorhome, so over here, if motorhomes have an issue or opportunity, it's not that big of a staying. but over there, if motorhomes tick up, it's a bigger problem. but all in all, we feel that once they get passed the motorhome chassis, they can get past the supply chain-related issues.
they're running hot in terms of wholesale and increases there, but not nearly as hot as what the u.s. market seems to be, but still up pretty good.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
ok, great. that's helpful. and then, just a follow-up on the same subject, the new german acquisition. i'm presuming it's a large supplier to own erwin hymer a store over there.
is that correct? and then, second, with that, i'm thinking the margins on that german business are potentially lighter than the u.s. margins, which is in line with what we kind of see between erwin hymer and doors u.s. business.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. so like brian said earlier, it's a $25 million revenue business, and it's all tax-related. so typically, the tech margins are going to be a little bit higher than normal. so you might not look at it as compared to a normal widget because it's in the tech field.
and erwin hymer is their largest customer. but in europe, we do just as much business with the other large player over there, trigano, as we do hymer. so there's -- that's where the opportunity is for us is to introduce some to other customers like them that they're not doing any business within and jump their sales up pretty significantly, pretty quick because they've got capacity.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
great. that's helpful. thank you, guys.

jason? 
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning, everyone, and welcome to lci's second-quarter 2021 earnings call. we delivered another incredible quarter as we continue to drive record results in 2021. demand across the recreational space remains at an all-time high with no end in sight to the ways of new consumers entering the outdoor lifestyle. this quarter was historic for, not just our company, but for the rv industry as a whole, as they hit a record of 153,100 rv unit shipment.
at an annualized rate, the industry is set to ship near 600,000 units in 2021, even blowing past levels last seen in 2017, and we expect this trend to continue well into 2022 as inventories will likely remain at an all-time low. despite supply chain-related headwinds continuing to impact our business, our teams have proven their operational expertise and mitigating the impact of production-related challenges, including rising input costs, to enable us to meet our customer demand. during the quarter, we achieved $1.1 billion in sales, up 108% year over year or 74% compared to second quarter of 2019, providing us with double and triple-digit growth throughout each of our respective business markets. this growth has been supported by our focus on executing our diversification strategy as we work to integrate our newest acquisitions, including challenger, veada, ranch hand, schaudt, and trazcor.
additionally, we continue to drive market share expansion and achieve strong content per vehicle growth as we further solidify our position as a global leader in the recreation space. turning to our performance by segment. beginning with rv oem, sales increased 151% year over year or 56% compared to the second quarter of 2019 to $595 million for the second quarter, driven by elevated retail demand throughout both north america and the international markets we serve. preliminary results for july indicate no slowdown in this trend despite supply chain and labor constraints, which continue to impact the rate of increase for the entire rv industry.
our rv chassis capacity has been significantly improved by the recent acquisition of wolfpack, allowing us to continue to meet the increased need for chassis as the oems keep gearing up production to meet retail demand. we are also leveraging our existing customer relationships and significantly increasing our revenues at one of our most recent acquisitions, trazcor. in addition, we continue to experience significant efficiency improvement through several recent automation projects and continuous improvement in lean initiatives around the business. as demand remains at an all-time high, we are focused on pushing our teams to roll out more continuous improvement projects to further increase capacity and improve quality, efficiency, and profitability.
our rv margins were under pressure during the second quarter for a few key reasons. first, our commodities indexes lagged by a quarter and these indexes dictate when customers get increases, specifically around steel-related products. steel has risen to over twice its historical highs in a very short period of time, and it will simply take a few quarters to see these increases layer back in. that said, the indexes will also lag on the backside and keep our prices higher and allow us to recover when steel prices start to move back down.
not only has labor been problematic for the industry with respect to a significant shortage, where most of our facilities are located in northern indiana, but labor wage increases and overtime premiums are also at the highest level we've seen in the last couple of decades. freight costs and logistics have also been pretty unpredictable. all that said, our teams have done an amazing job keeping up with wholesale demand without shorting our customers. and most importantly, the margin performance has been fantastic, considering the amount of pressure we have seen around material, labor, and freight against this record demand.
content per unit has also continued to trend favorably despite an ongoing wholesale mix shift toward smaller entry-level products. content per towable rv increased 7% year over year to $3,621, while content per motorhome rv increased 15% year over year to $2,644 year over year. over the course of the last year, we have gained significant market share in a few core product areas in the business. we expect to continue driving content increases throughout 2021 as we further expand our market share and keep bringing innovative advancements to our customers.
turning to our aftermarket segment. total revenue grew $229 million in the second quarter, up 45% year over year, driven, in part, by the performance of our rv aftermarket group and the curt group as the team continues to work through record backlog, as well as the successful integration of our ranch hand into our aftermarket portfolio. we believe the most important thing we have going for our aftermarket business is the sheer record number of rvs entering the aftermarket population. with about 1 million rvs being brought into use every two years now, it creates an incredible opportunity for our aftermarket business for our peers, service and upgrade opportunities with many of our products.
additionally, because of the new ownership trends, rvs are not being purchased solely for single-family use, but also for use in the new peer-to-peer rental marketplace. these rental platforms serve as an amazing opportunity to introduce consumers to the rv lifestyle while also enabling our entire rv population to monetize their vehicle for an additional stream of income, while not in use. the surge of popularity and peer-to-peer rental speeds up the rv replacement cycle brings many more prospective customers into the lifestyle, as well as creates a case for heavier use. we believe this will inevitably create the need for more repair and replacement services, which enables us to leverage our wide product offerings and repair parts services network to meet this increasing consumer demand for upgraded parts and replacement parts.
turning to our adjacent markets. revenue for the second quarter increased 107% year over year or 60% compared to the second quarter of 2019 to $269 million as marine and other related markets continue to benefit from similar secular tailwinds, driving growth across rv and the aftermarket segment. in line with rv, our marine customers have been soaring demand, but have also been impacted by widespread supply chain issues. thankfully, we are beginning to see the easing of some of these constraints.
our marine business has continued to serve as one of the primary drivers of our diversification strategy, supported by the strong performance of veada and taylor made marine, enabling us to expand our market share in the space while also boosting content growth. further, our deep industry relationships allow us the pipeline for our new marine innovation that we continue to develop and add to our marine content. we also continue to grow our axle and suspension product line revenue significantly in the trailer market, which has added nicely to our top and bottom line. our international businesses showed strong performance with revenues increasing 133% year over year or 226% compared to the second quarter of 2019 to $103 million.
international demand for rvs remains elevated, which we've been able to successfully capitalize on through our numerous acquisitions we made in the recent past in europe. we believe this space will continue to grow meaningfully in the near future as it continues to see record demand. innovation by our europe teams, as well as the development of our aftermarket products in that market and our focus on rail, marine, and caravan industries in europe, should also bolster lci's results in the near term. the european markets in which we operate, including germany, italy, the netherlands, and the u.k., are seeing continued, albeit delayed, recovery, consistent with north america.
international customers are embracing the rv lifestyle as they embark on their summer holiday this month, with the second-quarter retail caravan registrations increased 27.5% across europe. our long-term strategic initiatives revolve around innovation and product development, which play a critical role in establishing our position as an industry leader. as demand remains at record levels, we have not let up on continuing to figure out how to add improved features and do existing products, as well as to develop new products, to further enhance the customer experience in the future. a prime example of our innovative capabilities is our continued evolution of our onecontrol platform.
by utilizing the onecontrol platform, customers can now control an incredible range of vehicle functions from leveling and slide out to lighting an hvac systems. in addition to our onecontrol product, we anticipate great success over the next 12 months in the launch of our tire pressure management systems, battery systems, axel and suspension innovations, our new ladder innovation, electric biminis and thrusters for the pontoon market, as well as our top roof for the class b van market, which is the fastest-growing segment of rvs in north america. with regards to capital allocation, we have maintained our focus on integrating our recent acquisitions and paying down debt while pursuing strategic acquisitions. at the same time, we are continuing to invest more heavily in innovation and optimizing our manufacturing footprint to ensure we have capacity to meet the heightened demand while identifying cost efficiencies where possible.
in closing, we want to thank all of our team members for their dedication and hard work as we have continued to meet all-time record demand for our products, while delivering quality products to our customers. our performance continues to be driven by the operational strength and tenure of our workforce, guided by an incredible leadership team that keeps us on track in executing our strategic priorities. we look forward to continuing down the path of industry outperformance as we keep delivering value for the stakeholders of our business well into the future. i will now turn to brian hall, our cfo, to discuss in more detail our second-quarter financial results.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
thank you, jason. our consolidated net sales for the second quarter increased 108% to $1.1 billion compared to the prior year, driven by strong market performance, coupled with solid company execution. acquisitions contributed $54 million to our quarterly results, with organic growth contributing the balance of the improvement. as jason mentioned, july sales remained strong, increasing 25%, and when adjusted for the difference in oem shutdowns year over year, it would imply a growth rate of approximately 35%, indicative of current q3 growth expectations.
q2 2021 sales to rv oem increased 151% compared to the prior year due to the sustained record rv oem retail demand. sales to adjacent industries grew 107%. aftermarket segment sales increased 45%, and international sales increased 133% as consumers continue to turn toward outdoor leisure activities, driving strong demand in our markets across the board. as jason mentioned, demand in our core rv and marine market is at record level, which, coupled with the significant inventory replenishment cycle is resulting in record production volumes.
current north american rv industry production rates would imply 2021 wholesale shipments of approximately 570,000 to 590,000 units, an all-time record for the industry. we drove further content growth in both towables and motorhomes. content per towable rv increased 7% to $3,621 and content per motorized unit increased 15% to $2,644 compared to the prior year. the content increase in towables was a result of organic growth, in addition to $29 million in acquired revenue.
growth rates in the marine market also remained high as the industry continues to work to support consumer demand. north american marine sales increased over 200%, supported by modest acceleration in production rates, as well as the addition of $18 million in acquired revenue. we have made strong progress toward our diversification strategy. at the end of the first quarter, we announced the closing of ranch hand, our first bolt-on acquisition for the curt group, as well as schaudt, which creates a strategic presence for us in germany.
in june, we also announced our acquisition of trazcor, a specialized metal fabricator that utilizes innovative technology to supply custom aluminum sidewalls and panels to the recreation and transportation oem markets. gross margins were 23.6%, compared to 24.5% in the prior-year second quarter. the decline was primarily due to the steep climb in material and freight costs, partially offset by strong overhead leverage. the cost of steel has increased over 250% since september of 2020, while aluminum has increased over 60% during the same period.
we anticipate the current headwinds from higher input costs to continue through next quarter. as i have mentioned on prior calls, while the pricing for many of our products is indexed to steel and aluminum costs, there remains the traditional lag time and effectiveness of approximately two quarters. sg&a costs as a percentage of sales decreased from the second quarter of 2020, due primarily to the leverage of fixed costs on higher sales. sg&a cost as a percentage of sales are up slightly when compared to the first quarter of 2021, due primarily to the aforementioned increase in freight costs, which is also negatively impacting outgoing shipment costs.
transaction costs were also significantly higher during the second quarter. we expanded operating margins by over 460 basis points from the prior-year period, primarily due to the favorable impact of continued organic sales growth, coupled with operational efficiencies driven by increased automation and lean manufacturing initiatives. these benefits were partially offset by increased labor expense to meet heightened production requirements and the increasing cost of steel, aluminum, and freight. gaap net income in q2 2021 was $67.9 million or $2.67 per diluted share, compared to $13.2 million or $0.52 per diluted share in q2 2020, primarily due to strong growth in sales across all our business segments.
adjusted ebitda increased 68% to $121.3 million for the second quarter. noncash depreciation and amortization was $51.3 million for the six months ended june 30, 2021, while noncash stock-based compensation expense was $13.9 million in the same period. we continue to anticipate depreciation and amortization in the range of $100 million to $110 million during the full year of 2021, primarily due to increases in capital investments for capacity and efficiencies. for the six months ended june 30, 2021, cash generated from operating activities was $24 million, while $104 million was used for business acquisitions, $42 million for capital expenditures, and $42 million was returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends.
total capital expenditures for the second quarter included 65% dedicated to maintenance, 6% in automation investments, and 29% to new market share. while demand in our core markets remained at record levels, the industry continues to face challenges with supply chain constraints and rising material costs. to address these challenges, we are focused on strategic management of working capital, including intentionally building up levels of certain inventory items, to avoid future shortages. this has allowed us to further cement our relationships with oems and grab market share from other suppliers that have experienced supply chain issues.
at the end of the second quarter, we had an outstanding net debt position of $910 million, 1. times pro forma ebitda adjusted to include ltm ebitda of acquired businesses. during the quarter, we also priced $460 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.125% convertible senior notes due in 2026. the net proceeds from this offering were approximately $448 million, which we, in part, used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, with the remainder to be used to fund current and future growth opportunities.
we continue to prioritize maintaining a strong balance sheet and targeting long-term leverage of 1.0 to 1.5 times net debt to ebitda as we work to integrate recently completed acquisitions, which we believe will contribute strong operating cash flow. capital expenditures are anticipated in the range of $130 million to $150 million for the full-year 2021, unchanged from previous expectations as we focus on various smaller scale continuous improvement in automation projects that support growth and continue to build capacity to support heightened production rates. with these strong results, we remain confident in our ability to drive growth for lci and deliver shareholder value over the long term as we continue to execute on our proven growth strategy. that is the end of our prepared remarks.
operator, we're ready to take questions. thank you.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of katherine thompson with thompson research.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my questions today. just for the quarter, if you could -- you gave a lot of great detail about the various impacts. but if you could balance price increases, volumes, some planned downtimes because there were differences year over year and seasonality for the rest of the year as we think just about the stairstep for revenues and margins.
thank you.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
ok. hi, kathryn, it's brian. the -- so starting with gross margins, i would tell you that from materials and pricing certainly had the most significant impact on gross margins. and the way i've kind of looked at it is it's almost approximately 300 basis points worth of negative impact, just the difference in materials and pricing that we saw in the second quarter.
now a lot of that is starting to catch up in the third quarter. and as our input costs such as steel, aluminum, and freight have continued to climb, i'm expecting that to stretch a little bit more into the quarters beyond that, might even be a chance that it makes its way into the first quarter of next year, just given the fact that aluminum and steel are still climbing today. most of that is offset by a lot of great overhead leverage. so by the time you're said and done, your gross margin was down by 60 basis points, i think, as i said.
and that's mainly offset by all overhead leverage. when you get into sg&a, sg&a, the transportation costs are pretty significant in there, and those increased almost 60 basis points from the -- even from the first quarter of this year. so we've continued to see inbound and outbound freight climb at a pretty significant rate. and to give you an idea, i think, from first quarter to second quarter, that's almost $11 million of additional costs from additional outgoing transportation that's within our sg&a costs.
the remainder, you've got a couple of million here and there. i think amortization was up a little bit, almost a couple of million dollars. and then the transaction costs, as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, were up some as well. so certainly had those, as i would say, those are the -- as i point every line in the financial statements, those are the key movers from -- for the quarter.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok. and is it -- if you were to give kind of the top three in terms of headwinds from an inflationary standpoint, you mentioned steel, aluminum, and transportation, which of those three has the greatest impact? and which of the three has the greatest amount and the least amount of visibility?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yes. steel and aluminum, combined, are almost 50% of our material spend, so it's a pretty significant mover. and when you're talking steel, up 250% from september of last year, that's been pretty significant for us to adjust for and work with our customers to try to accommodate all the issues that they're dealing with from a supply chain perspective and trying to meet record demand. so we've been pretty strategic as we've worked through that, and there's still some to come there.
a lot of the steel, though, is tied to some indexing contracts. so that's where you do get a lot of the two-quarter lag from. aluminum, within that 50%, call aluminum, maybe 10 to 15 percentage points, and the rest of steel. so obviously, steel is no.
1 for us. but for aluminum, i think aluminum is the one that we still see climbing here in the short term. it seems like steel has gotten up into the mid $0.90 a pound and aluminum still -- and it's kind of at least slowed its climb some. aluminum still continues to go up.
so i think aluminum is the one that's going to continue to hurt for the coming quarters. and in freight is, i think, going to be a problem for a long time. we don't really see that correcting itself in the near term. so that's -- those are things that are probably going to -- we're going to be dealing with well into 2022.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. i'd just add real quick, kathryn, that you take steel, for example, our largest raw material cost, it went up three times what it was prior to covid over the course of 12 months, and it's not stabilized, but it's not an accelerated climb like it was over the last 12 months. so the hope is that it's at least manageable at this point. same with freight, freights up 10x from asia from what it was prior to covid and that's stabilizing.
so we might have a little bit of more increase there, but more likely downside opportunity over the next 12 months and a lot of upside or a lot of more cost.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
that's helpful. and then just on acquisitions, you've always been very active in terms of the acquisition front, typically, buying assets at a smaller market share or being proactive with technology and then expanding it so you dominate. you did make a little bit different acquisition that was more on the commodity side. and maybe you can help us understand some of the logic behind that and how you see your kind of growth path going forward, just, in general, for lippert?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
sure, sure. so with the most recent acquisition of trazcor, in any acquisition, the things we're looking at is can we innovate products, do they have a large growth runway, and how does the competition field look? and all three of those boxes are checked there. we feel we can innovate the product significantly. we feel that there's really only one other player in the game there.
and we had our customers knocking on our door over the last eight-or-so months, asking us to get in the game because we're already doing a lot of metal work. as brian alluded to earlier, our largest -- 50% of our raw costs are steel and aluminum. so when we look at the side metal on the rv products out there, it's a significant product content opportunity. it's right in our wheelhouse, and we feel we can innovate and grow.
on top of that, the rv influx of the rvs, the category that are growing the fastest are the small entry-level units that require the metal siding. so there's a greater need for that product, anyway, right now, so it's a perfect fit. and we feel we can grow it pretty significantly over the next 24 months.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of scott stember with c.l. king.
scott stember -- c.l. king & associates -- analyst
good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions as well. 
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning, scott.
scott stember -- c.l. king & associates -- analyst
brian, you gave a lot of great detail about what's impacting the operating margin. but if we look out into the back half of the year, could you just give a little granularity of where we can look for the operating margin? are we looking for, to remain in this level, notably in the third quarter? or it sounds like there's a little bit of improvement going on. but just try to give us a little bit, if you could.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yes. i think that, certainly, early, if you rewound earlier in the year, we were talking about price increases catching us up and that we would be able to recoup a lot of that when we got into the second quarter and third quarter. as i mentioned, the fact that steel and aluminum, and freight have continued to climb, and you then have the quarter to two-quarter lag on many of our product pricing adjustments, i think that it's going to drag out into multiple quarters, as i mentioned earlier, maybe even a little bit into q1 of next year, just given the fact that we're still seeing those input costs climb. so we're working very closely with our customers to push through some price adjustments where we can.
but a lot of those index arrangements are going to cause us to drag out. so from a margin perspective, i certainly think that there's some upside potential given the volumes that we're running and the strong leverage that we've seen. but i think that lag in price adjustments, along with the continued climb and input cost, is going to cause some temporary level setting of that margin. so i'm not expecting it to change greatly from, at least in the next quarter or so.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and certainly, with a significant part of our pricing increases coming by way of indexes, scott, there's -- that lag happens over the next few quarters. and then pricing will certainly subside at some point in time. our prices remain elevated over the longer-term while we catch up with the price decrease going the other way when that happens, whenever that happens.
scott stember -- c.l. king & associates -- analyst
and just to be clear, it's -- there's -- the indexing, it's the same delay of the same time period on the way up as on the way down, correct?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
that's correct.
scott stember -- c.l. king & associates -- analyst
ok. as far as -- we seem to be an rv side, this 50,000 units a month range, and demand just appears to continue to be incrementally growing to new levels. but how do you see production over the next couple of quarters? is this probably the most of the industry can eat that right now? do you see any relief on the horizon from that?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. i think all suppliers and oems alike are trying to increase capacity any way they can. and the most refreshing thing i've seen over the last handful of months as several oems and suppliers, including us, are looking at production capacity outside of elkhart county. one of the biggest constraints going forward is going to be labor, the elkhart county has only got so much labor.
and we're all working on some creative strategies to bring more labor to this area and increase our ability to produce. but like i said, the most refreshing thing i've seen is oems and some suppliers going outside in the new york counties to tap some of the labor outside of this area that's pretty stressed. so a lot of people are getting their second shifts up and getting capacity running that way. some of the oem capacity comes online, third and fourth quarter, the new capacity.
so i think right now, to answer your question, 50,000 units, it will grow very slowly, but it certainly feels like we're heading toward a 55,000 units number in the near term.
scott stember -- c.l. king & associates -- analyst
got it. and then just lastly, july, very nice growth of 25%. i haven't done to all of the math yet, but if you, i guess, adjust for the time you have when acquisitions fully take hold, it sounds like the lion share, obviously, of growth is still organic, correct?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
oh, yes. yes, for the most part, the acquisitions have accounted for quickly, almost 10% in the quarter. so about 10% of the growth in the quarter, and i'm expecting it to decline from there as we're seeing strong organic growth in all categories. and we've seen some nice organic growth out of our acquisitions we've made this year already.
scott stember -- c.l. king & associates -- analyst
got it. all right. thanks again, guys.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thanks, scott. 
operator
your next question comes from the line of bret jordan with jeffries.
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. this is mark jordan on for bret. just switching gears to the aftermarket a bit. can you kind of talk about some of the trends you're seeing right now? are you still seeing strong demand for replacement and repair parts? and kind of maybe what are you seeing for more of the upgrade parts and furniture, particularly in rvs?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. so all of our aftermarket categories from repair, replacement service, and upgrades, they're all very strong right now. we're seeing increases in all those categories. i think one of the trends we've seen here recently is our aftermarket partners are all asking for more products.
so we're adding more products to our aftermarket categories. as i mentioned in my opening comments, the peer-to-peer rental market is creating a case for heavier use of the rvs because it's more rvs to run in the peer-to-peer marketplaces that have really evolved over the last 12 to 18 months. and it's creating a whole new avenue for repair and replacement, which is because rvs are getting used more. prior to covid, you could have made the case that the average use of an rv is 14.0 to 21.0 days.
and that's certainly increasing with all this peer-to-peer marketplace, rental use. so that's really good for our business. on top of the fact that we've got 0.5 million rvs coming into use every single year. that's going to be great for our aftermarket business.
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. and then i guess, thinking about the curt group as demand for rvs and marine have been pretty strong lately. so i have to imagine that's been pretty solid for the curt group's hitch products.
is there anything to note there?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
no, i'd say just the amount of -- whether it's rvs or bike racks or anything that people are going to do in the outdoor as you need a hitch, and we're the largest hitch supplier in the country. so it's really good for that business. we don't see that slowing down. like i said, earlier we've got -- we're on a 590,000 unit run rate right now for the industry this year.
we're running at a rate -- if you take july's rate, 625,000 unit if you were to blow that out another 11 months. so i mean, that's just going to create a case for more hitches and more curt products, and we're continuing to innovate and develop and launch new products there for the outdoor, so -- 
mark jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
great. and then do you have any early reads from the ranch hand acquisition?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
not yet, it's early, but i mean, their orders and backlogs are robust, as robust as our curt group businesses. so that's what i can tell you there.

your next question comes from the line of fred wightman with wolfe research.
fred wightman -- wolfe research, llc -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. i wanted to just circle back on to the production rate numbers that you gave, that 570,000 to 590,000 units i think is consistent with what you had quoted last quarter, but you guys outlined some capacity investments that you're making, and then there's also some oem capacity coming online in 3q and 4q. any sense for how much capacity that could add to the market? is it just that incremental 5,000 units that you sort of touched on? any sort of color on where you think wholesale production could go over the next few quarters would be helpful.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
well, certainly, the industry could build or could sell a lot more than what we're building today. but there's just -- there's too many material and labor constraints. you can add capacity really, really fast on the oem side and the supply side. but at the end of the day, the entire oem output and sell-through to wholesale is strictly relying on the weakest supply chain leagues.
and there's some weak ones out there. every week, something is popping up. but what i can tell you is that we've seen this increase -- gradual increase from where we ended up last year to the 590,000 -- 575,000 to 590,000 units rates, it looks like we're going to hit this year based on current numbers. and it just feels like we're going to continually gradually increase as the entire supply chain gets through some of these material constrained problems, get through some of these labor constrained problems, add capacity.
it just feels like you can kind of count on the industry continuing to inch up volume as you've seen over the last 12 months in that type of fashion and not any slow or not any faster.
fred wightman -- wolfe research, llc -- analyst
ok. makes sense, so sort of slow and steady. i guess to shift a little bit, the color that you gave on the peer-to-peer rental impact for the refresh cycle. could you put some more numbers around that? i mean, is that a big enough chunk of business to where you could see an acceleration versus that three to five-year trade-in, trade-up cycle that you've touched on in the past, how impactful could that really be either from a wholesale sort of new rv side or the aftermarket business just with more wear and tear on those units?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. there's a lot to that question. but i'd tell you, without a doubt, there's -- i know in talking to some of the peer-to-peer rental companies, they're looking to put their own fleets in because they don't have enough rv owners in their marketplace to support all the demand that's out there. i think the number is like 75% of all people end up getting into an rv by starting out with a rental search.
so the fact that there's just -- these vast marketplaces out there right now for people to get into an rv and try them. they say that after the second try, after the second rental, they're highly likely to buy. so the fact that there's just a marketplace where this can happen, that wasn't always available. so outdoors we specifically had some really good data around their owner base.
so you can get on their website and look at some of that. but their owner base they've got owners that have multiple rvs that never own multiple rvs, just because of the fact that they have an ability to create some side income on running their rvs. so -- and again, all this creates a case for heavier use of the rvs, which ultimately wears and tears, the components that need to be replaced, and a lot of those are ours.
fred wightman -- wolfe research, llc -- analyst
makes sense. thanks, guys.

your next question comes from the line of mike swartz with truist securities.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. just wanted to touch on rv content loads in the quarter. obviously, some pretty strong growth there.
and i think jason and brian, you said that a lot of that's coming organically. maybe give us a little more context about what's driving that. are you starting to see some trade up or mix toward higher contented units? or what exactly is behind that during the quarter?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. i would say, for the most part, we've been talking for the last probably three quarters now where we've talked about other suppliers that were maybe a little challenged in getting product to the oems, and we were pretty strategic about layering that business in. so over the last three quarters, you've seen new business get layered into that content per unit number. so we've expected that to continue to accelerate.
i would say the obvious thing is how much this price driving that. but i would tell you, price in the trailing 12-month period is not yet driving it in a meaningful way. it's less than a couple of percentage points because we were still giving price decreases as steel and aluminum were declining during 2020. so net-net, i would expect that to maybe even start to accelerate a little bit more as some of the price adjustments come in, but we're still layering in new business as well.
and really, from an acquisition perspective, on the rv side, it's been trazcor, would be the one that had a small impact on a challenger a little bit. so some smaller deals. so it's not having a meaningful impact on the content.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and i'd say that the increase in the content, the meaningful increase in content speaks largely to the market share we have taken because we just keep seeing the amount of entry-level units that are getting shipped out there. it's a pretty significant number. and they're -- i'd say they're turning away from fifth wheels right now, but there's a high focus. if you talk to any dealer out there, they're looking to get their hands on as many trailers, smaller trailers as they can get.
and that's certainly driving the opportunity for content down. and you look in the face of that, we've increased content, that's pretty fantastic.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. great. and then, brian, just on the sg&a side, understanding, i think a lot of the sequential increase in sg&a dollars was transport costs. maybe help us think about from an absolute dollar standpoint, what -- maybe what the sg&a line should look like in the next quarter or 2? i know there's sometimes seasonality there and there's some acquisitions coming in.
but i guess is there a way we should think about that going forward?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
i mean -- although i've said this before, and then it goes the opposite direction. but i would anticipate it to stay relatively consistent. i think that the big movers that i mentioned, transportation costs, that's not going away anytime soon. so i do think that those, as i mentioned, sequentially from q1 to q2, it was up $11 million in aggregate dollars within the sg&a line alone.
i'm not expecting that to change much in the coming quarters. so the other thing that i mentioned, we're a couple of million here, a couple of million there. some of those do ebb and flow, so you might be -- you might see some movement, plus or minus $5 million or so, for things like that. but for the most part, i would expect it to remain relatively consistent.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.

the next question comes from the line of dan moore with cjs.
dan moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
good morning. this is brendan on for dan. i just want to ask real quick, looking at aftermarket from a margin perspective, how much opportunity is there to expand margin in that business as it continues to gain scale with -- and you have these catalysts?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
well, certainly, our price increases are lagging in that market like our oem business. so we'll continue to catch up margins and get where we need to be based on all the scattered cost increases that we've seen across the business. so that's one piece. but like i said earlier, the customers in all channels in that space are looking to get product however they can.
we've -- unlike a lot of small suppliers out there we've beefed up our inventories. we've been able to get inventory so that we can get products out there and supply channels we haven't in the past. the dealers, the warehouse distributors, the consumers on e-com out there, they're all looking for products, whether it's repair and replacement or upgrade parts or service parts. so our aftermarket team has done a stellar job of getting out there and getting in front of all those channels and making sure that they're plugged with products.
so margin opportunity is great. and we'll continue to launch new innovations in that space over the coming months. so we have substantial prep programs going on with all of our oems right now. so we put prep hardware on the rvs at the oem side.
so that there's -- it's easier to plug-and-play aftermarket items into the oem items. and it doesn't create a situation where the oem doesn't have to put on a high-cost component, they can leave that to the aftermarket, and we've gotten really good at that over the last handful of years.
dan moore -- cjs securities, inc. -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of shawn collins with citigroup.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
hey, great. thanks. good morning, jason and brian. 
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning, colin. 
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
my question is on operations. north america is clearly experiencing a recent covid reappearance with the delta variant. i just wanted to ask if this had impacted your recent manufacturing and operations, both on a labor availability standpoint and processes? and maybe how do you think about this long-term? is this now a permanent reality in operations i presume? thanks. 
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. so it hasn't impacted our operations. i think over the last four weeks, we've seen a couple of cases a week, which -- back in october, november of last year, we were seeing 50 to 100 cases a day. so it's -- we're tracking to the extent we can, the vaccinations and things like that.
we're making it easier for our team members to get vaccinated, but it hasn't impacted our production over the last couple of months. and if anything, from the market standpoint, it's just going to prolong some of the covid-related demand we've seen in the marketplace as a result of some of the recent happenings with the delta variant and things like that.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
got you. that's helpful, jason. thank you. maybe just a quick follow-up.
you've made three acquisitions in 2021, not unprecedented as you've done a lot of acquisitions, but you're in an unprecedented business cycle. you're also experiencing rising input costs. so a lot going on. can you just talk about how the integration is going on those three acquisitions? i think one is in texas, one is in germany, and the most recent one is in indiana? thanks.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. so i'd tell you that we're getting better and better with our -- after the 75 acquisitions, me and our team have done over the last 20 years. we're kind of straight away from a lot of the -- i don't want to say tuck-in, but tuck-in acquisitions that get folded into an existing operation that don't have quite the leadership team. we're buying more today a lot of businesses and companies that have very grounded capable leadership teams.
it just allows us to be more acquisitive than what we've been in the past and be more effective at the integration. so i'd tell you that from the ranch hand acquisition, rock, our ceo of the curt group, they folded that in. they're doing a terrific job getting that one integrated, our seating and our door acquisitions from the recent months are going great. management team is still intact.
we're seeing synergies, and then we've had some pretty significant organic growth in those operations already. schaudt has been great from the european perspective because it gives us kind of an electronics handle. and we've got some new products there that we're looking at bringing back to the u.s. like we have other european acquisitions we've made.
so it's -- all in all, by all marks, it's been really, really healthy and good this year from an integration standpoint.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and i think i would add, i mean just how much more mature we are in that integration process. i mean, we do look to make sure that we integrate them into our system. we've got teams that are well first in doing so. and then also our culture.
so taking our culture, leadership programs and putting them into these organizations to help give them more of the tools they need to be successful. and i think to jason's point, those are the -- maybe a bit of a change in strategy from 20 years ago. we're looking for a great innovative product, great leadership teams. and i think there's a lot of great companies out there that fit that mold.
and we went out and we raised some additional capital here during the second quarter. the pipeline is full. i think that there's great options for us out there to be strategic and fold in the right technology, the right aftermarket business, the right innovative product, the right teams, as we mentioned, that can create a lot of long-term value for shareholders. with veada and challenger, it was $160 million in revenues, roughly we acquired there.
those are right here in town. so i think when you look at acquisition integration, we can always integrate the ones that are close to our home office and where the -- in front of our team members and leadership staff is. we can integrate those faster and more effectively than we can businesses that are a day trip away, for example. but we integrated a project management office in the last 12 months for our bigger acquisitions just to make integration more meaningful.
so hopefully, that answers your question.
shawn collins -- citi -- analyst
no, that's great. that's very helpful. thanks, jason. thanks, brian.

jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning, everyone. we delivered another quarter of strong results, driving both substantial top line and market share growth as consumers continue to gravitate toward the outdoor lifestyle in record numbers. despite operating in an environment riddled with supply chain challenges, material and labor shortages and rising input costs, our teams powered through these headwinds to meet our customer commitments and fulfill record demand in the recreational markets we serve. during the quarter, we achieved $1.2 billion in sales, up 41% year over year or up 99% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
this great achievement by our teams has been supported by great organic growth and success of our recent acquisitions of veada, challenger, polyplastic and curt, which underscores the strength of our diversification strategy. in addition, we continue to increase our rv content per vehicle growth, further solidifying our position as a global leader in the recreational space. before getting into segment results, i'd like to address our recent acquisition of furrion, which we announced beginning of august. furrion is a premier distributor of a range of appliances and other electronic products for rvs in a wider transportation market.
the addition of furrion with $230 million in forecasted sales for 2021 will help us tap into a $1.5 billion addressable market in north america alone through its robust catalog of innovative products, complementing our oem product lineups with kitchen appliances, av appliances and observation camera systems, just to name a few. because of the teams, products and innovative mindset, we believe that we have a real opportunity to double this business in the next few years. beyond north america, we plan to utilize furrion in broadening our offerings in the international markets by leveraging our existing global customer relationships. this will enable our company to unlock further market share, especially in the european and australian caravan industries.
additionally, furrion brings a strong aftermarket business with both an online and brick-and-mortar presence, further accelerating our company's aftermarket division, which is one of our fastest-growing segments. investment and growth in our aftermarket help accelerate our proven diversification strategy to support the long-term growth of lci. the lippert teams have been working closely with the furrion teams for several years through our distribution partnership and have long-standing ties with its strong management and r&d teams. since the acquisition closed, we've already kicked off a few exciting projects, which we'll be able to discuss in further detail in the coming quarters.
we're incredibly excited to welcome furrion to lippert family, and i look forward to them helping us turbocharge innovation to further transform the industries we serve. turning to our performance by segment, beginning with rv oem, sales increased 44% year over year to approximately $667 million for the third quarter, driven by strong demand across both north america and international markets. our preliminary results showed record sales for october, indicating continued industry strength carrying over into the fourth quarter and demand remained strong, while dealer inventories are still at an all-time low and not to mention campgrounds remaining fully booked nationwide. to mitigate the margin pressure we've seen all year, stemming from a combination of historically high steel and aluminum prices, skyrocketing freight costs and widespread labor shortages, our teams have focused on driving continuous improvement and automation initiatives across the company.
these efforts will also help us to create capacity without the need to put up many new buildings and we've allocated a record amount of capital toward these automation and continuous improvement projects with over 15 larger automation projects set to go live in 2022 and the first part of 2023. long term, we will continue to implement more projects like these to support margins, while also positioning our production to be agile, repeatable and scalable in any environment. rv content per unit ramped significantly during the quarter, driven by our continued strong organic growth as our teams continue to bring new products to market and take market share while some of our competitors couldn't supply well during this last 12 months. content for towable rv increased 10% year over year to $3,786, while content per motorhome rv increased 14% year over year to $2,732.
our teams are focused on continuing to take advantage of content growth through innovation and continued new and existing product development. innovation remains one of the cornerstones of our success, and we are committed to meeting the demand for our technically sophisticated products to create a best-in-class experience for consumers, as well as to meet the demands of the new tech-savvy customer. in line with recent consumer trends, we're also focusing more on developing our safety suite of products to bring safety-related components of the rv space that have already existed in automobiles for years. our abs brakes are a prime example of one of our newest safety innovations for rvs.
we're already seeing substantial demand for the product as it comes to the market. to add, our safety products are designed to be compatible with one control, further extending the capabilities for platform and ecosystem, while providing more flexibility and technology for the customer's recreational experience. turning to our aftermarket segment, total revenue grew to $219 million in the third quarter, up 18% year over year. the lippert aftermarket teams in automotive, rv and marine continue to work through very extensive backlogs.
demand for our aftermarket products is significant as units being serviced are at an all-time high because used rvs continue to enter the repair and refurbishment cycle in record numbers. with the record number of rvs currently on the road and a million coming into the repair and replacement cycle every two years, the trend should be nothing short of fantastic for aftermarket products and service businesses that assist the rv consumer with repair, replacement and upgrades. as we look to serve this growing group of existing users and those brand-new to the lifestyle, customer experience initiatives like lippert scouts program and the campground project remain top priorities. these innovative initiatives allow us to collect valuable feedback directly from the rv users themselves, which we can utilize to improve our current and future offerings and services to rvers everywhere.
this quarter, we engaged over 200 families through our lippert getaway which is our company's first rv rally, meeting with owners, groups and hosting our first ever all lippert influencer summit had a wonderful campground of pigeon forge, tennessee. for four days in tennessee, we listened to the rvers loyal to our brand and based on their comments and testimony it's become abundantly clear that we are doing more for this group than just about anyone out there with respect to listening to these customers in order to more favorably impact the rv customer experience. turning to our adjacent markets. revenue for the third quarter increased 55% year over year to $281 million.
with marine and other related markets being driven by the same secular trends for towing rv and aftermarket segments. marine demand remained strong, but industry production has also been impacted by supply chain. that said, we are successfully growing market share, which we delivered with the support of our lexington, veada, taylor made marine businesses. as you may recall, we purchased an electric bimini product about a year ago, and we are just now starting to transition much of the industry away from manual biminis to electric powered biminis, while creating an aftermarket option for this as well.
we launched our seating division for tracker marine earlier this year in missouri, and we believe it's been a great success with a lot of additional opportunity now that we are located near and supplying the largest pontoon and boat builder in the country. other notable progress continues to be made in our utility and trailer axle businesses. it has now eclipsed sales in our rv axle suspensions and continues to outpace the industry growth significantly. we are winning new accounts in this space monthly due to our relationships and product offerings.
due to the success of similar programs in rv, we've also launched customer experience initiatives for boaters and other users in the marine space. we look forward to these findings to fix existing customer pain points and elevate the customer experience in the boating world while bringing more attention to the lippert brand. our international business has showed strong performance with revenues increasing 47% year over year to $88 million. from what we've seen, it is clear to us that european consumers continue to turn toward the outdoor lifestyle.
in fact, caravan and motor caravan retail was up 70% for the month of september. the european rv industry seems to be reacting a little slower and catching consumer demand than the u.s., so we believe that this could be a nice tail for us as europe's run could extend longer than that of the u.s. we continue to see a rise in interest in european products in the u.s. and u.s.
rv oems are increasingly adopting lippert's european components, including our euro pop-tops, steps, doors, windows and bed lists. five years ago none of these european products were even being sold in the u.s. this strategy further helps establish our brand reputation as a global innovator. at the moment, pop-tops for b vans made in our europe facilities provide a large opportunity for growth as we work toward building these in the u.s.
like we have the other products that the u.s. manufacturers that we've adopted from europe. our european products and r&d continue to be steady secret weapons for our sales teams as they allow us to offer products to our customers that would otherwise not be possible without europe businesses and creative product teams. next, i'd like to highlight the recent progress we've been making with regards to sustainability reporting.
over the past year, we've taken a focused effort to understand the impact of our operations on the environment and in communities in which we operate, exploring sustainable business practices that can drive value creation over the long term. through these efforts, we have made real operational improvements, including the establishment of environmental management system to monitor and reduce waste and updates to our safety training requirements. to highlight these and many other advancements, we'd like to announce that we'll be publishing our inaugural corporate sustainability report in late q4, which we'll use to report on our esg performance and track improvements into the future. together with operating sustainability comes the support of our team members and communities, two key pillars of our cultural foundation that's stilled lippert in the company that it is today.
just four weeks ago, i had the opportunity to chair, along with the support of a large group of lippert volunteers, an auction for the boys and girls club of goshen, indiana, through which we raised $2 million to benefit the local youth. i could not be prouder of our volunteers who helped out those benefit, illustrating our ability to give back to the community through the support of lippert since our earliest days. this event was one of almost 100 events, our team members across the globe took part in the month of october. last week, we had over 2,000 team members participate in our company's annual volunteer week during which our philanthropy team created serving events daily for our teams to take part in.
switching gears to capital allocation. we are focused on integrating our recent acquisitions, but remain receptive to strategic m&a opportunities as we pay down debt. as i mentioned earlier, we are investing heavily in the automation of our manufacturing footprint to ensure we maintain the appropriate capacity and quality to meet the heightened demand for recreational products, while identifying cost efficiencies where possible. in closing, i'd like to thank our dedicated team members that work so hard to overcome challenges while cultivating a culture that supports sustainable growth and continuous improvement.
we could not consistently deliver these results without this dedication, along with the strength and guidance of our dedicated leaders all over this company. we look forward to continuing our incredible momentum as we deliver value to our shareholders in 2022 and beyond. i will now turn the call over to brian hall, our cfo, to discuss in more detail our third quarter financial results.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
thank you, jason. our consolidated net sales for the third quarter increased 41% to $1.2 billion compared to the prior year, driven by continued strength in market performance, along with strong operational execution. acquisitions contributed $78 million or 10% growth to our quarterly results, with organic growth contributing the balance or 31% of the improvement. as jason mentioned, october sales were up 52% from october 2020 to $441 million, an implied growth rate of over 50% for q4 when seasonally impacted.
we expect to see continued elevated demand into the remainder of the year. q3 2021 sales to rv oems increased 44% compared to the prior year due to heightened wholesale and retail demand. current north american rv industry production rates also remain high, implying 2021 wholesale shipments of approximately 577,000 to 587,000 units, an all-time record for the industry. we substantially expanded content in towables and motorhomes during the quarter.
as jason mentioned, content per towable rv unit increased 10% to $3,786 and content per motorized unit increased 14% to $2,732 compared to the prior year. the content growth can be attributed to organic growth, such as several new product introductions in addition to the impact of price increases enacted during the quarter. we continue to see robust performance in the marine market, driven by similar tailwinds bolstering rv. north american marine sales increased 119% in the quarter as production further increased to support elevated demand, which we expect to continue through the fourth quarter.
acquisitions contributed $23 million or 49% of this growth. sales to adjacent industries grew 55%. aftermarket segment sales increased 18%, and international sales increased 47% as strong secular trends continue to drive consumers into the recreation space. in our continued execution of our diversification strategy, we closed the acquisition of furrion during the third quarter.
as jason had stated previously, this addition will not only open doors for us as we continue to expand on our oem offerings with their innovative products to help drive long-term content expansion, but also help us grab further market share by leveraging furrion's existing distribution channels. approximately 40% of furrion's sales are to the aftermarket with the remaining 60% being oem. gross margins were 21.6%, compared to 26.8% in the prior year quarter, pressured by headwinds, including elevated freight, material and labor costs. the cost of steel again rose increasing, 23% during the quarter, partially offset by the aforementioned price increases.
as we have mentioned previously, many of our price increases are passed on to our customers on a two-quarter lag, which is the primary contributing factor to the margin pressures we have experienced. price increases, which were effective during october have now surpassed the bottom of the curve, and we are beginning to see some margin expansion when compared sequentially to q3 results. we are anticipating q4 margins to improve 100 to 150 basis points from q3. sg&a cost as a percentage of sales decreased from the third quarter of 2020, as well as sequentially due to a decrease in fixed costs paired with higher sales, offsetting increases in freight and transaction costs.
operating margins decreased roughly 375 basis points compared to the prior-year period, again, driven by increased labor expense to meet heightened production requirements and the increasing cost of steel, aluminum and freight, partially offset by lean manufacturing and automation initiatives we have continued to introduce. gaap net income in q3 2021 was $63.4 million or $2.49 per diluted share, compared to $68.3 million or $2.70 per diluted share in q3 2020, declining due to the previously mentioned cost pressures, partially offset by strong sales growth across all of our business channels. adjusted ebitda decreased 1% to $118.1 million for the third quarter compared to the prior year. noncash depreciation and amortization was $80.2 million for the first nine months ended september 30, while noncash stock-based compensation expense was $20.3 million for the same period.
we continue to anticipate depreciation and amortization in the range of $110 million to $120 million during the full year 2021, primarily due to increases in capital investments to enhance production capacity and enable further manufacturing efficiencies. for the nine months ended september 30, cash generated from operating activities was $12 million, while $155 million was used for business acquisitions, $74 million for capital expenditures and $64 million was returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends. operating cash flows were negatively impacted by the intentional increase in working capital to support heightened demand and minimize supply disruption in addition to rising prices of steel and aluminum-based products. at the end of the third quarter, we had an outstanding net debt position of $1 billion or 1.8 times pro forma ebitda adjusted to include ltm ebitda of acquired businesses.
with the constantly evolving operating environment, we are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and continue to target a long-term leverage of one and a half times net debt-to-ebitda. in the near term, we are working to integrate recently completed acquisitions which we expect to positively impact our operating cash flows in the coming quarters. for the full year 2021, capital expenditures are anticipated in the range of $130 million to $150 million. looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong performance results and remain dedicated to further executing our growth strategy to drive long-term value creation for shareholders.
that is the end of our prepared remarks, operator, we're ready to take questions. thank you.

operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. your first question comes from the line of scott stember with c.l. king.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions. just starting out, maybe just talk about furrion a little bit. obviously, you guys had a history with them a few years ago, and what's different now that you're taking over the entire thing after walking away from it a few years ago.
and then, maybe just talk about the margin profile of how this will impact the overall results.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, sure. so the big difference is that we have total control over the entity now. prior, we were strictly sales and distribution, so we did all the warehousing, logistics and sales work. we had a little input on product, but not much.
and today, we have 100% control over product which is the big piece of it. so we control the amount of money that goes into innovation and r&d. we can listen to the customers and figure out what they need and go right to the r&d and engineering and start designing products that the customers are asking for as opposed to just take what's given to us. so we said in the earlier remarks that we feel we can double that business in the next few years, strictly because competition is in a good spot for us.
the competition is relatively weak in that space. there's a lot of opportunity. there's not a lot of innovation in that space. and furrion is the clear innovator in that space.
and there's a lot more they can do with appliances and electronics. so does that answer your question?
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
yeah, also about the margin profile.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yes. and then, from a margin profile, it's about 60% oem and 40% aftermarket business today, which the aftermarket side has grown significantly since when we were in the partnership with them a couple of years ago. so aftermarket certainly taken off and has very, very attractive margins, as you would anticipate, much better than our consolidated aftermarket margins. from an oem perspective, i would expect those margins to come in pretty consistent with our other oem margins, just given the competition and some of the margin profile we're seeing today.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
and they weren't really hammering aftermarket, scott. so that's -- we, obviously, have a robust structure and sales force and distribution network there, and we are going to leverage that -- and really fully take advantage of the aftermarket opportunity versus just the e-commerce and some of the other smaller aftermarket business that we're doing.
it sounds like a similar overall operating market profile for the whole company.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
except on the aftermarket part, as i said, that's accretive to the margins that we're seeing in our legacy aftermarket business today. so that should be where we should see consolidated margin expansion.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
all right. and then, just on the price front, i know you guys usually have the two-quarter lag and price increases are now going through intra-period. can you just talk about how that's going, any sign that consumers are pushing back and then just last question would just be on the gross margin or the margin commentary, brian, that you made about 100 basis points. are we talking gross margin or operating margin?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. so with respect to the feedback from the consumer end of the world, we're not seeing anything yet. our understanding is that we'll start seeing some of the dealers were first out with more significant margins because they just sold inventory that they had, and they were selling at or above msrp, likely in these types of cycles, as we are starting to catch up and still trailing and coming into a point where our selling prices will exceed our costs that we've been -- that have been rising. we'll be in a position where likely the dealers will start pinching their margins a little bit, and it will start working its way back down the chain.
but to date, we haven't seen anybody back off. and i don't know if it's because new buyers, they look at a $20,000 trailer that might have been $15,000 a year ago and not really affecting the payment that much. some of the new buyers, they don't really know what to expect in terms of price and $20,000 might seem a fair price from looking at a trailer like that. so -- but the long and short is we haven't seen much kick back on the inflation that's been passed on in terms of selling price increases all the way up to the consumer.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and scott, to wrap that up on margins. so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we finally have, what we believe, reached the turning point at the bottom of the curve, where we're starting to catch up a little bit. so in the fourth quarter, we had october price increases that were meaningful in our index contracts. and so, we're expecting 100- to 150-basis-point improvement to start here in october.
so it's good to finally see that come. and as for where it falls on the p&l, i'm talking operating profit margins, but really all the compression we're seeing in margin is due to gross margin, due to direct labor and materials, so that's where we're really experiencing it at all and offsetting it is leveraging our manufacturing overheads, as well as our sg&a overheads.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
got it. that's all i have now. thanks. thanks, guys.
operator
your next question is from the line of kathryn thompson with thompson research.
brian biros -- thompson research -- analyst
hey, good morning. it's actually brian biros on for kathryn. thank you for taking my questions. maybe could you just start with -- for q4, any additional thoughts around any differences from a normal seasonality just given the amount that october was up with the record backlog that you can work through and you can work through all that every day and probably still not really make a dent.
so just wondering how your approach in q4 from a normal seasonality versus this year.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i mean, we're just looking at run rates with respect to the oem. we certainly keep a pulse on what's going on at the dealer and the retail level. but right now run rates are at all-time highs. i mean, they're above where they were at last quarter.
so there's just some constraints from a supply chain and materials and labor standpoint. so we could actually run more than what we are running today or what we're forecasted to run for the quarter, if we could just get materials and not have some of the supply chain issues that we're having. but the industry is running at about 600,000 clip right now. if you take all the production from all the manufacturers on the oem side, it's about 600,000.
they're trying to run more than that, but supply chain has kind of got a constraint to 600,000. and we feel that that will continue to alleviate over time, but it's just going to take some time for some of these issues that have popped up to work themselves out.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
hey, bryan, as far as the seasonality, i think i said in my prepared remarks, october was up 52%. i would expect for the quarter to pull back a little bit from that just due to the typical shutdowns around christmas and new year's. we're working with the oems right now to try to gauge how consistent that is with what we've seen in the past. i suspect it won't be too different from what we saw last year or maybe even compared to july of this year.
so they'll take some time down, and i'm sure it will be a week or maybe even a day or two beyond that.
brian biros -- thompson research -- analyst
thank you. very helpful. second follow-up question, i guess, you guys have talked about automation for a while now, and i guess, every quarter it seems like that just becomes more and more of a thing you guys should continue to invest in. how has that thought process changed recently, if at all? it seems like bigger projects might be on the table now versus before.
i think, they were kind of looking at more smaller projects, trying to consume kind of a manual process? are guys thinking about bigger things now or how are you thinking about automation now going forward given supply chain still -- challenges still remain and some of them seem to be around for a while for the bottlenecks?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. so our process typically works where we analyze each cell in the business, each manufacturing cell, and we try to wean it out and work through continuous improvement to try to make as much progress and improvement and make the cells as efficient as possible. and then, once we do that, the next step is, ok, can we automate it? so i tell you that we're not looking at bigger projects. our projects kind of fit in the realm of few hundred thousand dollars on the low side to a few million on the high side it's kind of the sweet spot.
that cost will allow us to automate a full cell of production. and that's where we experienced the most efficiency and the biggest improvement in quality and the biggest improvement in safety, and just allows us to, like i said in our opening remarks, just to be repeatable and scalable and consistent. so i think, that's our sweet spot. that's what we are going to stay in.
you get into these big projects, and they -- there's just a lot more complexity to those. we've had our success really working on automating one cell at a time. and if you consider that we've got 100 facilities around the globe, there's lots of single-cell opportunities to automate, and that's what we're focused on.
brian biros -- thompson research -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mike swartz with truist securities.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
good morning. maybe just help us think about the price cost dynamic. i think, in the second quarter, you said your costs were uncovered by about 300 basis points. i guess, what did that look like in the third quarter? and then, how do we think about that in the fourth quarter and maybe beyond?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, it's continued to be a battle. if you go back and look at the curve and the steepness of that curve for steel and aluminum and given that we were lagging a couple of quarters on our price increases, that has gotten worse and worse as we were anticipating some of those costs to plateau, and we would be able to catch up in the second quarter. that did not happen. in the third quarter it then deteriorated some more from there.
i would tell you that our materials -- year over year is what i'm going to give you. our materials are over 500 basis points to the negative compared to q3 of the prior year. so that gives you an idea of just the disconnect between material input costs and pricing today from where we were a year ago. so it's gotten a little bit worse.
but now, where we're at in the fourth quarter is as i mentioned in prepared remarks. and then, on the question earlier, we're expecting 100 to 150 basis points of improvement. that's primarily price catching up and surpassing what we are seeing from an inflationary perspective on our input cost. so it's primarily material.
so you're starting to see us turn the corner on that, and we should start to expand margins from there. and as you know, many of those index agreements are -- they're contractual. they're on a two-quarter lag and so that will continue into the first quarter and likely a little bit in the second quarter as well of '22.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and steel is largely one of our largest input cost. it is our largest input cost on raw materials. so at the beginning of the year, we thought that steel would kind of eclipse or top out in q2 some time and it just kept running. so our index pricing to our customers has continued to trail that, and until a few weeks ago, it peaked.
so that's where the improvement that brian is talking about it is coming from as our selling prices next quarter will finally -- or this quarter, will finally catch our input costs and even out.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
so ok, great. thanks for the color. brian, second question, just looking through the p&l, i mean, it looks like the sg&a dollars were down quarter over quarter slightly. revenue was up.
you had some more acquisitions in there. i know some of your outbound freight costs actually were up in the quarter, i believe. so help us understand why you had so much sg&a leverage during the quarter?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i would say, the slight improvement from a dollar perspective and from a margin perspective, would be the -- a little bit of improvement in transportation. a lot of our outgoing shipping costs are on a contractual basis as well. so some of those are getting passed along with a lag. so we saw a little bit -- just looking back through past quarters, our shipping costs were some of the highest we've seen as a percentage of sales in the second quarter, and we saw a little bit of improvement in q3 back to more on par with what we had in the first quarter.
so that's the real driver between that nominal improvement. i would expect those sg&a costs to remain somewhat consistent. price increase will certainly help from a margin perspective, but aggregate dollars should remain relatively consistent.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
ok, great, thank you.
operator
your next question is from the line of fred wightman with wolfe research.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. maybe just to follow up on some of the steel commentary. is the -- i assume that reflects some of the easing tariff environment and could you just sort of talk about how big of a tailwind do you think that could be, just some of the price pressure that you've seen over the past year-plus?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
we haven't seen any of that yet. i mean, the price run-up has strictly been kind of supply and demand based, i think. so it's just -- i mean, it's run-up to three times its historical trend. so we didn't think it get much higher than $0.50 a pound, and it's worked its way all the way up to the mid-90s.
but it should ease from there. i mean, we don't know where it's going to settle back down. certainly not -- maybe not historical trends, but certainly much lower than it is today. and that's where index has turned favorable as chasing them the way down it's more beneficial and impactful to us from bottom-line perspective then chasing them a way up.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and fred, i do think that some of the conversation around easing trade negotiations in europe, that's likely to have some sort of impact. i don't know that we've seen it completely yet. it might be some why it's leveled off here recently, but i think we're still uncertain with the outlook as far as where it goes from here. it feels like it's peaked.
and the more those talks continue and the more -- there might be more imports coming into the u.s. that certainly should bode well for supply/demand and bring some prices down. but it's yet to be seen.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and then, on the content per unit side, can you just sort of help us think conceptually about how we should be modeling that sort of post furrion? and then, as the supply chain environment hopefully starts to normalize a little bit here. you guys have called out some share benefits just from some of the smaller competitors being more capacity constrained than you are. but when you look at it from a higher level, how do you see that shaking out for both categories going forward?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, we're running at -- i'll speak most to towables because that's the dominate category. so we're over 10% growth right now in the third quarter. certainly, pricing as we've talked historically, pricing has not been a meaningful part of the content growth. so prior to this quarter, we were running about 7%.
so i think, pricing is definitely starting to be the difference maker in that content growth. now none of these content numbers have furrion in it. we only owned them for a couple of there weeks in september or the last of the quarter. and for consistency purposes, they're not included in any of the historical numbers either.
so now, on a go-forward basis, furrion will start to leverage in. as we mentioned, they're on a $230 million type pace today, 60% of that's oem. and like jason said, we think we've got a good opportunity in the next two years to double that business. and we think we've got a plan to do that.
so that should give you an idea what furrion will do to that. now, i think, pricing is going to continue to have an impact -- favorable impact to content. so we should expect to see that in the next couple of quarters as that becomes a little more meaningful, as we mentioned previously.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
it feels like the content that we've always given in terms of opportunities is about $7,500. it feels like that's running closer to $10,000 with all the other things that we've added in, in terms of total opportunity. we've got new products coming onboard, 2.0 innovations on a lot of products. so that always bumps up the opportunity as well.
but that gives you a range that's higher than $7,500 today of opportunities.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. thank you, guys.
operator
your next question is from the line of daniel moore with cjs securities.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions, jason, brian. just in the aftermarket business, what -- as you kind of look at the crystal ball, what kind of organic growth do you look at in that business over the next three to five years? and is that at all dependent on the direction of wholesale shipments of rvs, boats, etc.?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
i mean, as far as percentages go, we've lapsed all the curt acquisition. and so, we're -- and we haven't done much in the way of acquisitions in that space. so i think, we've with q2 was around 36% growth, q3 came down a little bit. i think, we've been chasing some price there as well.
so it's certainly double digit. it's been a long time since we've been below 10% in that category. so usually 15% to 25%, i think, is a good long-term run rate for legacy business. now furrion, i think, the growth opportunity that we have there.
certainly, supply chain is gonna be an obstacle. but as the supply chain, over the coming years, alleviates -- the issues alleviate, i think we'll be able to certainly add to that growth rate, given the furrion product. and as you -- i think jason mentioned in his remarks about the millions of -- 1 million units every couple of years that are out on the road. and as you work through the three- to five-year trade-in and upgrade cycle, that certainly bodes well for aftermarket growth.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
that's really what i'm -- i think we're laser-focused on from our aftermarket growth. it's a great separator for us. it's what a lot of other companies, either aren't focused on or aren't thinking about. but when you look at the 2021 and '22, you're talking about 1.7 million rvs into the rv universe, and those are going to come into the repair cycle.
in a couple of years we've got maybe a million in 2018 and 2019. so you look at those five years and how those units are going to fall into the repair and replacement and upgrade cycle, i think that that bodes really well for our organic growth opportunity, not to mention that we are continuing to take on new products, and we've got our own innovation department for aftermarket, and we're working those products. and then, you look at the way rvs are getting used, and i keep talking about peer-to-peer rentals every single call, that you look at just peer-to-period rentals, and there's just more people out there experimenting. and if you're sort of using an rv 20 days a year, you run it three or four more times it gets used more, it's going to needed to be serviced more.
so even if 10% or 20% of the whole rv population takes advantage of peer-to-peer running, units are going to used more and need to get serviced more, and that just bodes well for our aftermarket division.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
perfect. and then, just holding in on furrion, once we get past q4 in the initial kind of accounting -- or our acquisition accounting, do you expect the margin accretion that you described earlier for 2022? or is that more of a longer-term outlook? that's one. and then, two, given supply chain challenges, do you -- what type of growth should we be thinking about for the next kind of 12, 24 months? thanks.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, i think, you are into next year before you start to see some of the margin appreciation. they had a third-party logistics company that we had to start out with, and we're working through that now to remove them from the channel and we'll take over the distribution as we handled it before. so we should certainly see a little bit of improvement there. but that will take some time to integrate.
and so, certainly, 2022 is when i would expect to see some of it. on the aftermarket side of things, i think from the get-go, we should see margin appreciation there as their margins -- they're even selling to some of the big box stores, and there's good margins there. so i think, we'll start to see that. but again, that's about 40% of their business today.
and supply chain, to your point, will be likely the first part of the year -- first two quarters will be a little challenging, but we're expecting to have some additional suppliers in place for their products. so we think we can expand our opportunity in the back half of 2022.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
all right. very helpful. appreciate it.

and your last question comes from the line of ethan huntley with jefferies.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. this is ethan huntley on for bret jordan. thanks for taking my questions. just with regards to the october sales being up 52% year on year, can you sort of break out what percentage of that might be organic versus acquired?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
it's a good question, ethan. i wouldn't expect it to be much different than the q3 numbers that i threw out, because really furrion was acquired at the tail end of september or mid-september and didn't impact us meaningfully. so if you were to look at q3, q3 was about 31% organic and almost 10% acquisition growth year over year. so i think, for q4, given furrion, that might pick up maybe a couple of points being acquisitions.
but i also think organic will -- that will be the balance they'll get.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then, just sort of into q4, i know you said sort of expect a pullback in november and december, but is there any sort of color or commentary you can provide on the magnitude of that pullback?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i'll chime in here. i mean, like i said, the run rates -- we're running at record run rates right now to the tune of a 600,000 unit run rate. as i said before, they're scheduling more than that. the industry supply chain just isn't able to hit those numbers yet.
so suppliers are working on alternative supply chain opportunities to be able to get -- to some of those higher numbers, and they've scheduled even more for q1. so supply chain is a real problem. i think, the only thing that's going to impact seasonality in q4 is the fact that i think both of the -- over the weeks that most of the manufacturers are taken down are in the month of december sometimes they're split between january and december. so i think, you get it from that aspect.
but, certainly, they're not taking more time on thanksgiving and run rates are at an all-time high. so i think, that you look at the run rates for october carried forward -- october and november, maybe with an extra week of seasonality because of both holiday months and december falling in that month, and i think that helps you get to the number.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks. and then, just lastly here, i just wanted an anecdotal commentary on retail trends you've been seeing. and then, i guess, sort of to that extent, any outlook on sort of the oe backlog would be helpful.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i mean, retail is still pretty solid. i mean, this is -- it's coming into the time of year when it slows up a little bit. it's just historical. but the oems and dealers are anticipating a robust selling season or as soon as sell season starts.
oem backlogs seem pretty significant still. i mean, they're telling us to gear up. they're adding facilities -- all the oems are adding facilities right now. so some of those are coming online right now, some of them came online last quarter, others will come online over the next couple of quarters.
so i think, we're just preparing for a robust selling season in next couple of quarters.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you for taking my questions.

jason? 
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning, everyone. we delivered another quarter of strong results, driving both substantial top line and market share growth as consumers continue to gravitate toward the outdoor lifestyle in record numbers. despite operating in an environment riddled with supply chain challenges, material and labor shortages and rising input costs, our teams powered through these headwinds to meet our customer commitments and fulfill record demand in the recreational markets we serve. during the quarter, we achieved $1.2 billion in sales, up 41% year over year or up 99% compared to the third quarter of 2019.
this great achievement by our teams has been supported by great organic growth and success of our recent acquisitions of veada, challenger, polyplastic and curt, which underscores the strength of our diversification strategy. in addition, we continue to increase our rv content per vehicle growth, further solidifying our position as a global leader in the recreational space. before getting into segment results, i'd like to address our recent acquisition of furrion, which we announced beginning of august. furrion is a premier distributor of a range of appliances and other electronic products for rvs in a wider transportation market.
the addition of furrion with $230 million in forecasted sales for 2021 will help us tap into a $1.5 billion addressable market in north america alone through its robust catalog of innovative products, complementing our oem product lineups with kitchen appliances, av appliances and observation camera systems, just to name a few. because of the teams, products and innovative mindset, we believe that we have a real opportunity to double this business in the next few years. beyond north america, we plan to utilize furrion in broadening our offerings in the international markets by leveraging our existing global customer relationships. this will enable our company to unlock further market share, especially in the european and australian caravan industries.
additionally, furrion brings a strong aftermarket business with both an online and brick-and-mortar presence, further accelerating our company's aftermarket division, which is one of our fastest-growing segments. investment and growth in our aftermarket help accelerate our proven diversification strategy to support the long-term growth of lci. the lippert teams have been working closely with the furrion teams for several years through our distribution partnership and have long-standing ties with its strong management and r&d teams. since the acquisition closed, we've already kicked off a few exciting projects, which we'll be able to discuss in further detail in the coming quarters.
we're incredibly excited to welcome furrion to lippert family, and i look forward to them helping us turbocharge innovation to further transform the industries we serve. turning to our performance by segment, beginning with rv oem, sales increased 44% year over year to approximately $667 million for the third quarter, driven by strong demand across both north america and international markets. our preliminary results showed record sales for october, indicating continued industry strength carrying over into the fourth quarter and demand remained strong, while dealer inventories are still at an all-time low and not to mention campgrounds remaining fully booked nationwide. to mitigate the margin pressure we've seen all year, stemming from a combination of historically high steel and aluminum prices, skyrocketing freight costs and widespread labor shortages, our teams have focused on driving continuous improvement and automation initiatives across the company.
these efforts will also help us to create capacity without the need to put up many new buildings and we've allocated a record amount of capital toward these automation and continuous improvement projects with over 15 larger automation projects set to go live in 2022 and the first part of 2023. long term, we will continue to implement more projects like these to support margins, while also positioning our production to be agile, repeatable and scalable in any environment. rv content per unit ramped significantly during the quarter, driven by our continued strong organic growth as our teams continue to bring new products to market and take market share while some of our competitors couldn't supply well during this last 12 months. content for towable rv increased 10% year over year to $3,786, while content per motorhome rv increased 14% year over year to $2,732.
our teams are focused on continuing to take advantage of content growth through innovation and continued new and existing product development. innovation remains one of the cornerstones of our success, and we are committed to meeting the demand for our technically sophisticated products to create a best-in-class experience for consumers, as well as to meet the demands of the new tech-savvy customer. in line with recent consumer trends, we're also focusing more on developing our safety suite of products to bring safety-related components of the rv space that have already existed in automobiles for years. our abs brakes are a prime example of one of our newest safety innovations for rvs.
we're already seeing substantial demand for the product as it comes to the market. to add, our safety products are designed to be compatible with one control, further extending the capabilities for platform and ecosystem, while providing more flexibility and technology for the customer's recreational experience. turning to our aftermarket segment, total revenue grew to $219 million in the third quarter, up 18% year over year. the lippert aftermarket teams in automotive, rv and marine continue to work through very extensive backlogs.
demand for our aftermarket products is significant as units being serviced are at an all-time high because used rvs continue to enter the repair and refurbishment cycle in record numbers. with the record number of rvs currently on the road and a million coming into the repair and replacement cycle every two years, the trend should be nothing short of fantastic for aftermarket products and service businesses that assist the rv consumer with repair, replacement and upgrades. as we look to serve this growing group of existing users and those brand-new to the lifestyle, customer experience initiatives like lippert scouts program and the campground project remain top priorities. these innovative initiatives allow us to collect valuable feedback directly from the rv users themselves, which we can utilize to improve our current and future offerings and services to rvers everywhere.
this quarter, we engaged over 200 families through our lippert getaway which is our company's first rv rally, meeting with owners, groups and hosting our first ever all lippert influencer summit had a wonderful campground of pigeon forge, tennessee. for four days in tennessee, we listened to the rvers loyal to our brand and based on their comments and testimony it's become abundantly clear that we are doing more for this group than just about anyone out there with respect to listening to these customers in order to more favorably impact the rv customer experience. turning to our adjacent markets. revenue for the third quarter increased 55% year over year to $281 million.
with marine and other related markets being driven by the same secular trends for towing rv and aftermarket segments. marine demand remained strong, but industry production has also been impacted by supply chain. that said, we are successfully growing market share, which we delivered with the support of our lexington, veada, taylor made marine businesses. as you may recall, we purchased an electric bimini product about a year ago, and we are just now starting to transition much of the industry away from manual biminis to electric powered biminis, while creating an aftermarket option for this as well.
we launched our seating division for tracker marine earlier this year in missouri, and we believe it's been a great success with a lot of additional opportunity now that we are located near and supplying the largest pontoon and boat builder in the country. other notable progress continues to be made in our utility and trailer axle businesses. it has now eclipsed sales in our rv axle suspensions and continues to outpace the industry growth significantly. we are winning new accounts in this space monthly due to our relationships and product offerings.
due to the success of similar programs in rv, we've also launched customer experience initiatives for boaters and other users in the marine space. we look forward to these findings to fix existing customer pain points and elevate the customer experience in the boating world while bringing more attention to the lippert brand. our international business has showed strong performance with revenues increasing 47% year over year to $88 million. from what we've seen, it is clear to us that european consumers continue to turn toward the outdoor lifestyle.
in fact, caravan and motor caravan retail was up 70% for the month of september. the european rv industry seems to be reacting a little slower and catching consumer demand than the u.s., so we believe that this could be a nice tail for us as europe's run could extend longer than that of the u.s. we continue to see a rise in interest in european products in the u.s. and u.s.
rv oems are increasingly adopting lippert's european components, including our euro pop-tops, steps, doors, windows and bed lists. five years ago none of these european products were even being sold in the u.s. this strategy further helps establish our brand reputation as a global innovator. at the moment, pop-tops for b vans made in our europe facilities provide a large opportunity for growth as we work toward building these in the u.s.
like we have the other products that the u.s. manufacturers that we've adopted from europe. our european products and r&d continue to be steady secret weapons for our sales teams as they allow us to offer products to our customers that would otherwise not be possible without europe businesses and creative product teams. next, i'd like to highlight the recent progress we've been making with regards to sustainability reporting.
over the past year, we've taken a focused effort to understand the impact of our operations on the environment and in communities in which we operate, exploring sustainable business practices that can drive value creation over the long term. through these efforts, we have made real operational improvements, including the establishment of environmental management system to monitor and reduce waste and updates to our safety training requirements. to highlight these and many other advancements, we'd like to announce that we'll be publishing our inaugural corporate sustainability report in late q4, which we'll use to report on our esg performance and track improvements into the future. together with operating sustainability comes the support of our team members and communities, two key pillars of our cultural foundation that's stilled lippert in the company that it is today.
just four weeks ago, i had the opportunity to chair, along with the support of a large group of lippert volunteers, an auction for the boys and girls club of goshen, indiana, through which we raised $2 million to benefit the local youth. i could not be prouder of our volunteers who helped out those benefit, illustrating our ability to give back to the community through the support of lippert since our earliest days. this event was one of almost 100 events, our team members across the globe took part in the month of october. last week, we had over 2,000 team members participate in our company's annual volunteer week during which our philanthropy team created serving events daily for our teams to take part in.
switching gears to capital allocation. we are focused on integrating our recent acquisitions, but remain receptive to strategic m&a opportunities as we pay down debt. as i mentioned earlier, we are investing heavily in the automation of our manufacturing footprint to ensure we maintain the appropriate capacity and quality to meet the heightened demand for recreational products, while identifying cost efficiencies where possible. in closing, i'd like to thank our dedicated team members that work so hard to overcome challenges while cultivating a culture that supports sustainable growth and continuous improvement.
we could not consistently deliver these results without this dedication, along with the strength and guidance of our dedicated leaders all over this company. we look forward to continuing our incredible momentum as we deliver value to our shareholders in 2022 and beyond. i will now turn the call over to brian hall, our cfo, to discuss in more detail our third quarter financial results.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
thank you, jason. our consolidated net sales for the third quarter increased 41% to $1.2 billion compared to the prior year, driven by continued strength in market performance, along with strong operational execution. acquisitions contributed $78 million or 10% growth to our quarterly results, with organic growth contributing the balance or 31% of the improvement. as jason mentioned, october sales were up 52% from october 2020 to $441 million, an implied growth rate of over 50% for q4 when seasonally impacted.
we expect to see continued elevated demand into the remainder of the year. q3 2021 sales to rv oems increased 44% compared to the prior year due to heightened wholesale and retail demand. current north american rv industry production rates also remain high, implying 2021 wholesale shipments of approximately 577,000 to 587,000 units, an all-time record for the industry. we substantially expanded content in towables and motorhomes during the quarter.
as jason mentioned, content per towable rv unit increased 10% to $3,786 and content per motorized unit increased 14% to $2,732 compared to the prior year. the content growth can be attributed to organic growth, such as several new product introductions in addition to the impact of price increases enacted during the quarter. we continue to see robust performance in the marine market, driven by similar tailwinds bolstering rv. north american marine sales increased 119% in the quarter as production further increased to support elevated demand, which we expect to continue through the fourth quarter.
acquisitions contributed $23 million or 49% of this growth. sales to adjacent industries grew 55%. aftermarket segment sales increased 18%, and international sales increased 47% as strong secular trends continue to drive consumers into the recreation space. in our continued execution of our diversification strategy, we closed the acquisition of furrion during the third quarter.
as jason had stated previously, this addition will not only open doors for us as we continue to expand on our oem offerings with their innovative products to help drive long-term content expansion, but also help us grab further market share by leveraging furrion's existing distribution channels. approximately 40% of furrion's sales are to the aftermarket with the remaining 60% being oem. gross margins were 21.6%, compared to 26.8% in the prior year quarter, pressured by headwinds, including elevated freight, material and labor costs. the cost of steel again rose increasing, 23% during the quarter, partially offset by the aforementioned price increases.
as we have mentioned previously, many of our price increases are passed on to our customers on a two-quarter lag, which is the primary contributing factor to the margin pressures we have experienced. price increases, which were effective during october have now surpassed the bottom of the curve, and we are beginning to see some margin expansion when compared sequentially to q3 results. we are anticipating q4 margins to improve 100 to 150 basis points from q3. sg&a cost as a percentage of sales decreased from the third quarter of 2020, as well as sequentially due to a decrease in fixed costs paired with higher sales, offsetting increases in freight and transaction costs.
operating margins decreased roughly 375 basis points compared to the prior-year period, again, driven by increased labor expense to meet heightened production requirements and the increasing cost of steel, aluminum and freight, partially offset by lean manufacturing and automation initiatives we have continued to introduce. gaap net income in q3 2021 was $63.4 million or $2.49 per diluted share, compared to $68.3 million or $2.70 per diluted share in q3 2020, declining due to the previously mentioned cost pressures, partially offset by strong sales growth across all of our business channels. adjusted ebitda decreased 1% to $118.1 million for the third quarter compared to the prior year. noncash depreciation and amortization was $80.2 million for the first nine months ended september 30, while noncash stock-based compensation expense was $20.3 million for the same period.
we continue to anticipate depreciation and amortization in the range of $110 million to $120 million during the full year 2021, primarily due to increases in capital investments to enhance production capacity and enable further manufacturing efficiencies. for the nine months ended september 30, cash generated from operating activities was $12 million, while $155 million was used for business acquisitions, $74 million for capital expenditures and $64 million was returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends. operating cash flows were negatively impacted by the intentional increase in working capital to support heightened demand and minimize supply disruption in addition to rising prices of steel and aluminum-based products. at the end of the third quarter, we had an outstanding net debt position of $1 billion or 1.8 times pro forma ebitda adjusted to include ltm ebitda of acquired businesses.
with the constantly evolving operating environment, we are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and continue to target a long-term leverage of one and a half times net debt-to-ebitda. in the near term, we are working to integrate recently completed acquisitions which we expect to positively impact our operating cash flows in the coming quarters. for the full year 2021, capital expenditures are anticipated in the range of $130 million to $150 million. looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong performance results and remain dedicated to further executing our growth strategy to drive long-term value creation for shareholders.
that is the end of our prepared remarks, operator, we're ready to take questions. thank you.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions]. your first question comes from the line of scott stember with c.l. king.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
good morning, guys. thanks for taking my questions. just starting out, maybe just talk about furrion a little bit. obviously, you guys had a history with them a few years ago, and what's different now that you're taking over the entire thing after walking away from it a few years ago.
and then, maybe just talk about the margin profile of how this will impact the overall results.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, sure. so the big difference is that we have total control over the entity now. prior, we were strictly sales and distribution, so we did all the warehousing, logistics and sales work. we had a little input on product, but not much.
and today, we have 100% control over product which is the big piece of it. so we control the amount of money that goes into innovation and r&d. we can listen to the customers and figure out what they need and go right to the r&d and engineering and start designing products that the customers are asking for as opposed to just take what's given to us. so we said in the earlier remarks that we feel we can double that business in the next few years, strictly because competition is in a good spot for us.
the competition is relatively weak in that space. there's a lot of opportunity. there's not a lot of innovation in that space. and furrion is the clear innovator in that space.
and there's a lot more they can do with appliances and electronics. so does that answer your question?
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
yeah, also about the margin profile.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yes. and then, from a margin profile, it's about 60% oem and 40% aftermarket business today, which the aftermarket side has grown significantly since when we were in the partnership with them a couple of years ago. so aftermarket certainly taken off and has very, very attractive margins, as you would anticipate, much better than our consolidated aftermarket margins. from an oem perspective, i would expect those margins to come in pretty consistent with our other oem margins, just given the competition and some of the margin profile we're seeing today.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
and they weren't really hammering aftermarket, scott. so that's -- we, obviously, have a robust structure and sales force and distribution network there, and we are going to leverage that -- and really fully take advantage of the aftermarket opportunity versus just the e-commerce and some of the other smaller aftermarket business that we're doing.
it sounds like a similar overall operating market profile for the whole company.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
except on the aftermarket part, as i said, that's accretive to the margins that we're seeing in our legacy aftermarket business today. so that should be where we should see consolidated margin expansion.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
all right. and then, just on the price front, i know you guys usually have the two-quarter lag and price increases are now going through intra-period. can you just talk about how that's going, any sign that consumers are pushing back and then just last question would just be on the gross margin or the margin commentary, brian, that you made about 100 basis points. are we talking gross margin or operating margin?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. so with respect to the feedback from the consumer end of the world, we're not seeing anything yet. our understanding is that we'll start seeing some of the dealers were first out with more significant margins because they just sold inventory that they had, and they were selling at or above msrp, likely in these types of cycles, as we are starting to catch up and still trailing and coming into a point where our selling prices will exceed our costs that we've been -- that have been rising. we'll be in a position where likely the dealers will start pinching their margins a little bit, and it will start working its way back down the chain.
but to date, we haven't seen anybody back off. and i don't know if it's because new buyers, they look at a $20,000 trailer that might have been $15,000 a year ago and not really affecting the payment that much. some of the new buyers, they don't really know what to expect in terms of price and $20,000 might seem a fair price from looking at a trailer like that. so -- but the long and short is we haven't seen much kick back on the inflation that's been passed on in terms of selling price increases all the way up to the consumer.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and scott, to wrap that up on margins. so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we finally have, what we believe, reached the turning point at the bottom of the curve, where we're starting to catch up a little bit. so in the fourth quarter, we had october price increases that were meaningful in our index contracts. and so, we're expecting 100- to 150-basis-point improvement to start here in october.
so it's good to finally see that come. and as for where it falls on the p&l, i'm talking operating profit margins, but really all the compression we're seeing in margin is due to gross margin, due to direct labor and materials, so that's where we're really experiencing it at all and offsetting it is leveraging our manufacturing overheads, as well as our sg&a overheads.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
got it. that's all i have now. thanks. thanks, guys.
operator
your next question is from the line of kathryn thompson with thompson research.
brian biros -- thompson research -- analyst
hey, good morning. it's actually brian biros on for kathryn. thank you for taking my questions. maybe could you just start with -- for q4, any additional thoughts around any differences from a normal seasonality just given the amount that october was up with the record backlog that you can work through and you can work through all that every day and probably still not really make a dent.
so just wondering how your approach in q4 from a normal seasonality versus this year.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i mean, we're just looking at run rates with respect to the oem. we certainly keep a pulse on what's going on at the dealer and the retail level. but right now run rates are at all-time highs. i mean, they're above where they were at last quarter.
so there's just some constraints from a supply chain and materials and labor standpoint. so we could actually run more than what we are running today or what we're forecasted to run for the quarter, if we could just get materials and not have some of the supply chain issues that we're having. but the industry is running at about 600,000 clip right now. if you take all the production from all the manufacturers on the oem side, it's about 600,000.
they're trying to run more than that, but supply chain has kind of got a constraint to 600,000. and we feel that that will continue to alleviate over time, but it's just going to take some time for some of these issues that have popped up to work themselves out.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
hey, bryan, as far as the seasonality, i think i said in my prepared remarks, october was up 52%. i would expect for the quarter to pull back a little bit from that just due to the typical shutdowns around christmas and new year's. we're working with the oems right now to try to gauge how consistent that is with what we've seen in the past. i suspect it won't be too different from what we saw last year or maybe even compared to july of this year.
so they'll take some time down, and i'm sure it will be a week or maybe even a day or two beyond that.
brian biros -- thompson research -- analyst
thank you. very helpful. second follow-up question, i guess, you guys have talked about automation for a while now, and i guess, every quarter it seems like that just becomes more and more of a thing you guys should continue to invest in. how has that thought process changed recently, if at all? it seems like bigger projects might be on the table now versus before.
i think, they were kind of looking at more smaller projects, trying to consume kind of a manual process? are guys thinking about bigger things now or how are you thinking about automation now going forward given supply chain still -- challenges still remain and some of them seem to be around for a while for the bottlenecks?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. so our process typically works where we analyze each cell in the business, each manufacturing cell, and we try to wean it out and work through continuous improvement to try to make as much progress and improvement and make the cells as efficient as possible. and then, once we do that, the next step is, ok, can we automate it? so i tell you that we're not looking at bigger projects. our projects kind of fit in the realm of few hundred thousand dollars on the low side to a few million on the high side it's kind of the sweet spot.
that cost will allow us to automate a full cell of production. and that's where we experienced the most efficiency and the biggest improvement in quality and the biggest improvement in safety, and just allows us to, like i said in our opening remarks, just to be repeatable and scalable and consistent. so i think, that's our sweet spot. that's what we are going to stay in.
you get into these big projects, and they -- there's just a lot more complexity to those. we've had our success really working on automating one cell at a time. and if you consider that we've got 100 facilities around the globe, there's lots of single-cell opportunities to automate, and that's what we're focused on.
brian biros -- thompson research -- analyst
thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mike swartz with truist securities.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
good morning. maybe just help us think about the price cost dynamic. i think, in the second quarter, you said your costs were uncovered by about 300 basis points. i guess, what did that look like in the third quarter? and then, how do we think about that in the fourth quarter and maybe beyond?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, it's continued to be a battle. if you go back and look at the curve and the steepness of that curve for steel and aluminum and given that we were lagging a couple of quarters on our price increases, that has gotten worse and worse as we were anticipating some of those costs to plateau, and we would be able to catch up in the second quarter. that did not happen. in the third quarter it then deteriorated some more from there.
i would tell you that our materials -- year over year is what i'm going to give you. our materials are over 500 basis points to the negative compared to q3 of the prior year. so that gives you an idea of just the disconnect between material input costs and pricing today from where we were a year ago. so it's gotten a little bit worse.
but now, where we're at in the fourth quarter is as i mentioned in prepared remarks. and then, on the question earlier, we're expecting 100 to 150 basis points of improvement. that's primarily price catching up and surpassing what we are seeing from an inflationary perspective on our input cost. so it's primarily material.
so you're starting to see us turn the corner on that, and we should start to expand margins from there. and as you know, many of those index agreements are -- they're contractual. they're on a two-quarter lag and so that will continue into the first quarter and likely a little bit in the second quarter as well of '22.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and steel is largely one of our largest input cost. it is our largest input cost on raw materials. so at the beginning of the year, we thought that steel would kind of eclipse or top out in q2 some time and it just kept running. so our index pricing to our customers has continued to trail that, and until a few weeks ago, it peaked.
so that's where the improvement that brian is talking about it is coming from as our selling prices next quarter will finally -- or this quarter, will finally catch our input costs and even out.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
so ok, great. thanks for the color. brian, second question, just looking through the p&l, i mean, it looks like the sg&a dollars were down quarter over quarter slightly. revenue was up.
you had some more acquisitions in there. i know some of your outbound freight costs actually were up in the quarter, i believe. so help us understand why you had so much sg&a leverage during the quarter?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i would say, the slight improvement from a dollar perspective and from a margin perspective, would be the -- a little bit of improvement in transportation. a lot of our outgoing shipping costs are on a contractual basis as well. so some of those are getting passed along with a lag. so we saw a little bit -- just looking back through past quarters, our shipping costs were some of the highest we've seen as a percentage of sales in the second quarter, and we saw a little bit of improvement in q3 back to more on par with what we had in the first quarter.
so that's the real driver between that nominal improvement. i would expect those sg&a costs to remain somewhat consistent. price increase will certainly help from a margin perspective, but aggregate dollars should remain relatively consistent.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
ok, great, thank you.
operator
your next question is from the line of fred wightman with wolfe research.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. maybe just to follow up on some of the steel commentary. is the -- i assume that reflects some of the easing tariff environment and could you just sort of talk about how big of a tailwind do you think that could be, just some of the price pressure that you've seen over the past year-plus?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
we haven't seen any of that yet. i mean, the price run-up has strictly been kind of supply and demand based, i think. so it's just -- i mean, it's run-up to three times its historical trend. so we didn't think it get much higher than $0.50 a pound, and it's worked its way all the way up to the mid-90s.
but it should ease from there. i mean, we don't know where it's going to settle back down. certainly not -- maybe not historical trends, but certainly much lower than it is today. and that's where index has turned favorable as chasing them the way down it's more beneficial and impactful to us from bottom-line perspective then chasing them a way up.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and fred, i do think that some of the conversation around easing trade negotiations in europe, that's likely to have some sort of impact. i don't know that we've seen it completely yet. it might be some why it's leveled off here recently, but i think we're still uncertain with the outlook as far as where it goes from here. it feels like it's peaked.
and the more those talks continue and the more -- there might be more imports coming into the u.s. that certainly should bode well for supply/demand and bring some prices down. but it's yet to be seen.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
ok. and then, on the content per unit side, can you just sort of help us think conceptually about how we should be modeling that sort of post furrion? and then, as the supply chain environment hopefully starts to normalize a little bit here. you guys have called out some share benefits just from some of the smaller competitors being more capacity constrained than you are. but when you look at it from a higher level, how do you see that shaking out for both categories going forward?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, we're running at -- i'll speak most to towables because that's the dominate category. so we're over 10% growth right now in the third quarter. certainly, pricing as we've talked historically, pricing has not been a meaningful part of the content growth. so prior to this quarter, we were running about 7%.
so i think, pricing is definitely starting to be the difference maker in that content growth. now none of these content numbers have furrion in it. we only owned them for a couple of there weeks in september or the last of the quarter. and for consistency purposes, they're not included in any of the historical numbers either.
so now, on a go-forward basis, furrion will start to leverage in. as we mentioned, they're on a $230 million type pace today, 60% of that's oem. and like jason said, we think we've got a good opportunity in the next two years to double that business. and we think we've got a plan to do that.
so that should give you an idea what furrion will do to that. now, i think, pricing is going to continue to have an impact -- favorable impact to content. so we should expect to see that in the next couple of quarters as that becomes a little more meaningful, as we mentioned previously.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
it feels like the content that we've always given in terms of opportunities is about $7,500. it feels like that's running closer to $10,000 with all the other things that we've added in, in terms of total opportunity. we've got new products coming onboard, 2.0 innovations on a lot of products. so that always bumps up the opportunity as well.
but that gives you a range that's higher than $7,500 today of opportunities.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. thank you, guys.
operator
your next question is from the line of daniel moore with cjs securities.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions, jason, brian. just in the aftermarket business, what -- as you kind of look at the crystal ball, what kind of organic growth do you look at in that business over the next three to five years? and is that at all dependent on the direction of wholesale shipments of rvs, boats, etc.?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
i mean, as far as percentages go, we've lapsed all the curt acquisition. and so, we're -- and we haven't done much in the way of acquisitions in that space. so i think, we've with q2 was around 36% growth, q3 came down a little bit. i think, we've been chasing some price there as well.
so it's certainly double digit. it's been a long time since we've been below 10% in that category. so usually 15% to 25%, i think, is a good long-term run rate for legacy business. now furrion, i think, the growth opportunity that we have there.
certainly, supply chain is gonna be an obstacle. but as the supply chain, over the coming years, alleviates -- the issues alleviate, i think we'll be able to certainly add to that growth rate, given the furrion product. and as you -- i think jason mentioned in his remarks about the millions of -- 1 million units every couple of years that are out on the road. and as you work through the three- to five-year trade-in and upgrade cycle, that certainly bodes well for aftermarket growth.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
that's really what i'm -- i think we're laser-focused on from our aftermarket growth. it's a great separator for us. it's what a lot of other companies, either aren't focused on or aren't thinking about. but when you look at the 2021 and '22, you're talking about 1.7 million rvs into the rv universe, and those are going to come into the repair cycle.
in a couple of years we've got maybe a million in 2018 and 2019. so you look at those five years and how those units are going to fall into the repair and replacement and upgrade cycle, i think that that bodes really well for our organic growth opportunity, not to mention that we are continuing to take on new products, and we've got our own innovation department for aftermarket, and we're working those products. and then, you look at the way rvs are getting used, and i keep talking about peer-to-peer rentals every single call, that you look at just peer-to-period rentals, and there's just more people out there experimenting. and if you're sort of using an rv 20 days a year, you run it three or four more times it gets used more, it's going to needed to be serviced more.
so even if 10% or 20% of the whole rv population takes advantage of peer-to-peer running, units are going to used more and need to get serviced more, and that just bodes well for our aftermarket division.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
perfect. and then, just holding in on furrion, once we get past q4 in the initial kind of accounting -- or our acquisition accounting, do you expect the margin accretion that you described earlier for 2022? or is that more of a longer-term outlook? that's one. and then, two, given supply chain challenges, do you -- what type of growth should we be thinking about for the next kind of 12, 24 months? thanks.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i mean, i think, you are into next year before you start to see some of the margin appreciation. they had a third-party logistics company that we had to start out with, and we're working through that now to remove them from the channel and we'll take over the distribution as we handled it before. so we should certainly see a little bit of improvement there. but that will take some time to integrate.
and so, certainly, 2022 is when i would expect to see some of it. on the aftermarket side of things, i think from the get-go, we should see margin appreciation there as their margins -- they're even selling to some of the big box stores, and there's good margins there. so i think, we'll start to see that. but again, that's about 40% of their business today.
and supply chain, to your point, will be likely the first part of the year -- first two quarters will be a little challenging, but we're expecting to have some additional suppliers in place for their products. so we think we can expand our opportunity in the back half of 2022.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
all right. very helpful. appreciate it.

and your last question comes from the line of ethan huntley with jefferies.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
good morning. this is ethan huntley on for bret jordan. thanks for taking my questions. just with regards to the october sales being up 52% year on year, can you sort of break out what percentage of that might be organic versus acquired?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
it's a good question, ethan. i wouldn't expect it to be much different than the q3 numbers that i threw out, because really furrion was acquired at the tail end of september or mid-september and didn't impact us meaningfully. so if you were to look at q3, q3 was about 31% organic and almost 10% acquisition growth year over year. so i think, for q4, given furrion, that might pick up maybe a couple of points being acquisitions.
but i also think organic will -- that will be the balance they'll get.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
great. that's helpful. and then, just sort of into q4, i know you said sort of expect a pullback in november and december, but is there any sort of color or commentary you can provide on the magnitude of that pullback?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i'll chime in here. i mean, like i said, the run rates -- we're running at record run rates right now to the tune of a 600,000 unit run rate. as i said before, they're scheduling more than that. the industry supply chain just isn't able to hit those numbers yet.
so suppliers are working on alternative supply chain opportunities to be able to get -- to some of those higher numbers, and they've scheduled even more for q1. so supply chain is a real problem. i think, the only thing that's going to impact seasonality in q4 is the fact that i think both of the -- over the weeks that most of the manufacturers are taken down are in the month of december sometimes they're split between january and december. so i think, you get it from that aspect.
but, certainly, they're not taking more time on thanksgiving and run rates are at an all-time high. so i think, that you look at the run rates for october carried forward -- october and november, maybe with an extra week of seasonality because of both holiday months and december falling in that month, and i think that helps you get to the number.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thanks. and then, just lastly here, i just wanted an anecdotal commentary on retail trends you've been seeing. and then, i guess, sort of to that extent, any outlook on sort of the oe backlog would be helpful.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i mean, retail is still pretty solid. i mean, this is -- it's coming into the time of year when it slows up a little bit. it's just historical. but the oems and dealers are anticipating a robust selling season or as soon as sell season starts.
oem backlogs seem pretty significant still. i mean, they're telling us to gear up. they're adding facilities -- all the oems are adding facilities right now. so some of those are coming online right now, some of them came online last quarter, others will come online over the next couple of quarters.
so i think, we're just preparing for a robust selling season in next couple of quarters.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you for taking my questions.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
sure.
operator
there are no further questions. i will now turn the call back over to jason.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
well, thanks, everybody, for tuning into the call. i just want to make one last comment that our -- we really appreciate the hard work and efforts that our teams have done to overcome significant challenges in labor and materials and supply chain and everything there. i mean, it's been no small feat, and our customers have told us that we're in the top couple of suppliers in terms of the way we supply through all the crisis we've underwent in the last 12, 18 months. so we'll see you next quarter.
we appreciate you tuning in for the call. thanks.

[operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to the speaker today, mr. brian hall. please go ahead.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
good morning, everyone, and welcome to the lci industries' fourth quarter 2021 conference call. i am joined on the call today by jason lippert, president, ceo, and the director. we will discuss the results of the quarter in just a moment. but first, i would like to inform you that certain statements made in today's conference call regarding lci industries and their operations may be considered forward-looking statements under the securities laws and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

jason? 
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning, everyone, and welcome to lci's fourth quarter and full-year 2021 earnings call. 2021 was a year of incredible progress and highlights for lci as a larger outdoor recreation industry continued to grow at a very fast pace. highlighted by a record 600,000 rv shipped during 2021. we broke records of our own, delivering all-time high revenues along with record content and profitability, all while facing some incredible headwinds on labor, inflation, and supply chain fronts.
i'm continually impressed and proud of our team's ability to achieve such amazing results in this challenging operating environment. we believe that our cultural strength has been the cornerstone of his continued success, supported by an experienced leadership team that has kept lippert on track and executing on our culture, values, and strategic priorities. we end 2021 with $4.5 billion in revenues up 60% year over year largely driven by strong demand across all our markets. our growth is also supported by six acquisitions, adding approximately 270 million in net sales.
these acquisitions have helped us further expand our wide portfolio of innovative products while providing entry into new and meaningful markets, further establishing lci as a global leader in the recreation space. rv oem sales increased 73% during the year compared to 2020, reaching nearly $2.6 billion primarily driven by heightened demand for rvs throughout the year. families are recognizing that the outdoor lifestyle is a far more attractive alternative to the hassle of airline travel and hotel lodging as well as more affordable, considering the levels of recent inflation. with the freedom and convenience that come with our visits, no wonder families across the globe are turning to rvs as the go-to choice for a positive vacation experience.
the increasing popularity of peer-to-peer rentals has also contributed to the accessibility of being opening the door to many new customers looking to try the experience before they buy. our growth in the rv oem segment was also supported by incredible operational execution on the part of our teams and minimizing many of the supply chain challenges that have impacted the industry. as we've explored new supply channels and have worked to source materials in the us and elsewhere when possible to avoid issues associated with international freight. we see fewer component issues compared to that of our peers, which has enabled our continued outperformance.
with a focus on scalable growth, we are targeting 15 automation projects costing up to $40 million planned for 2022 and early 2023. we expect these operational improvement projects to support our long-term margin expansion and help offset the impact of inflationary pressures while improving quality and helping us to mitigate labor constraints to maintain stable production and meet the new heightened consumer demand. we deliver substantial content increases for the year in both towable units and motorhomes, driven by strong organic growth. content for total rv for the full year 2021 increased 24% from the prior year to $4,198, while content for motorhome rv for the full year 2021 increased 15% from the prior year to $2,856, supported by several market share gains.
as we head further into 2022, we expect the current strong pace of wholesale shipments to continue in the coming months as we execute during a dealer restocking period. that said, visibility toward the full-year demand is limited due to uncertainties about the longer-term impact of inflation and consumer spending. we'll have a better view of how demand is shaping up once the spring retail season ramps up. our revenues in the aftermarket segment grew year over year up 32% compared to 2020, supported by organic and inorganic growth drivers.
the integration of furrion is progressing smoothly, and we expect this business to contribute substantially to our aftermarket sales going forward as we leverage its robust catalog of innovative appliances and electronics to tap into a $1.5 billion addressable market in north america alone. as i've said throughout the past year, with the record number of our views on the road and over 1 million coming into the repair and replacement cycle every two years, we expect a long runway for growth of our four aftermarket businesses as we meet a significant demand for repair, replacement, and upgrade components. as our aftermarket business has grown, we focused our attention and resources on enhancing the retail customer experience. the lippert scouts' program, which has more than quadrupled in membership in the past year, serves to provide valuable insights on products and services, how customers use them, and most importantly, how we can drive improvements.
other experiments, like product giveaways in the campground project that help us meet, survey, and collect candid feedback from thousands of real campers and rvers nationwide. all this work culminated in the resounding success of our first lippert getaway rv rally in pigeon forge, tennessee, attended by over 200 families, where we were able to meet face to face with customers and talk about rv. the engagement, we drove through this event far exceeded expectations, and we are already a hearing buzz among our rvers for our 2022 getaway. the more we can creatively and effectively engage consumers, the better we can help them stay in the lifestyle over the long term and keep them connected to our team, our customers, and our product.
we believe that establishing lippert as a leading name and customer service will be another competitive differentiator to drive growth and strengthen our overall business for many years to come. as popularity for the outdoor lifestyle grows our ability to innovate has proven to be critical in meeting consumer demand. our titling tire pressure management systems are continuing development of one control independent suspension system and the newly introduced safety suite of products have solidified our reputation as a company operating on the cutting edge of rv technology. now, the furrion has been brought into the fold, we have even more innovative projects slated for launch that we're excited to announce later in the year.
we've also recently announced the launch of many new suspension products, including abs brakes for axle systems and independent suspension systems for the growing gen z and overland consumers. the global shift toward electric vehicles represents a monumental and innovative opportunity for lippert, and we are already preparing for what the future of rvs might look like. only a few weeks ago, in january, we unveiled our prototype ev towable rv chassis that we have been developing at our advanced r&d center, northern indiana. this concept vehicle consists of an array of lithium batteries specially housed in our chassis.
the battery system is intended to power all the rv electrical systems for multiple days of boondocking. we also displayed a new aluminum chassis design, along with regenerative braking and drive axles paired with remote control capabilities. while we plan to continue refining our concept prototype, we expect to begin rolling out parts of this technology in 2023. we believe this project will be a huge stride in reducing the environmental impact of rvs on the environment.
we are also very excited for the continued progress of our suite of class b products. with retail sales for class b van, rvs having doubled in the last several years, we've been working hard to develop a full line of products for these vehicles, including our pop-tops. this option, which allows oems to install a bed on the roof of b van, isn't being increasingly adopted by consumers. turning to the adjacent markets, full-year 2021 revenues rose 58% again driven by heightened retail demand for marine and other related markets.
additionally, our market shares and housing and cargo trailers both increased dramatically in 2021. content per unit and marine has increased over two times what we delivered in 2019. whereas rv inventories are starting to build back marine inventories remain very low, and accordingly, we anticipate a longer runway for growth in this business over the next two years. our international businesses grew 58% for the year compared to 2020, supported by our introduction of innovative products into the european markets.
demand across europe remains high, supported by the same secular drivers supporting heightened demand domestically. 2021 retail caravan registrations in europe increased 8% with the largest market germany up over 4%. however, because europe is largely motorhomes, the chip shortages are impacting industry production a little more than what we've seen in the us. that said, our european rv and marine divisions are continuing to provide solid innovations for use with customers domestically.
we continue to see our lippert europe products being adopted by us oems further supporting our content gains. looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our company's ability to drive growth in international markets, while also realizing synergies in products to bring to our north american customers. moving out of capital allocation, we are maintaining our focus on integrating our recent acquisitions and paying down debt. at the same time, we are continuing to invest more heavily in innovation and optimizing our manufacturing footprint to ensure we have the capacity to meet heightened consumer demand while identifying cost efficiencies where possible.
in 2021, we allocated over $40 million to grow off in automation capex, and we anticipate allocating even more to these important projects in 2022. i'll now move on to some cultural highlights for the year. here at lippert, we work hard to maintain a culture that values all team members and enables each team member to see how his or her individual contributions help us meet our greater goals. our culture focuses not only on how we can impact our team members but also on how we impact the world around us, starting with the communities that we work and live in.
we started our cultural journey 10 years ago, and we know it's having a real impact. not only are we hearing incredibly positive feedback from our team members, but our retention has also been significantly higher than in past years. even in the face of some of the headwinds impacting the labor markets today. in alignment with our core values, we recently published our inaugural corporate sustainability report covering our progress across a wide range of esg related topics.
this report includes initiatives such as our mission to replace conventional energy with solar power at seven facilities, identification of a board committee focused on esg, and our focus on reducing team member attrition rates by way of elevating a healthy and safe company culture. we believe our growth and recent innovations, along with our increasing focus on esg will mean our lippert team members, their families, and our customers will be able to better enjoy the communities where we live, work, play long into the future. i'd also like to mention the amazing strides our teams made in keeping up with our commitment to serving and supporting local communities. over 2021 lippert team members performed over 100,000 hours of community service through serving in various charitable organizations around the country.
over the last five years, our team members have collectively served 550,000 hours of community service. we could not be prouder of this accomplishment and our team's efforts to give back to those in need and look forward to our culture and initiatives having even more impact in 2022. in closing, i'd like to thank all of our team members not only for the tremendous work and commitment to delivering quality products to our customers but also for staying aligned to our culture that has made lippert so successful. we could not have achieved such amazing results without this incredible dedication and the record amount of team members staying with the business over the longer term.
coupled with the strength and guidance of our leadership teams, we look forward to continuing this tremendous progress in 2022 as we keep creating value for the team members, customers, and shareholders. i will now turn to brian hall, our cfo, to discuss in more detail our fourth quarter and full-year financial results.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
thank you, jason. our consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter increased 55% to $1.2 billion compared to the prior year, driven by continued strength and market performance, coupled with a strong execution against strategic initiatives. acquisitions contributed $97 million or 12% growth to our quarterly results, with organic growth contributing the balance or 43% of the improvement. as jason mentioned, january sales were up 71% from january 2021 to $526 million.
a strong indication of the expected growth rate for q1. q4 2021 sales to rv oems increased 67% compared to the prior year due to the heightened wholesale and retail demand. current north american rv industry production rates also remain high and we close the year with a record 600,240 wholesale unit shipments. we drove further content expansion for towables and motorhomes during the quarter.
content for towable rv increased 24% to $4,198 and content for motorized units increased 15% to $2,856 compared to the prior year. the content growth can be attributed to organic growth, in addition to the impact of price increases enacted during the quarter. acquired revenues contributed 5% and 6% of the year-over-year growth in towable and motorhome content per unit, respectively. we continue to see a robust performance in the marine market, driven by the same demand driving growth for the rv oem segment.
north american marine sales increased 113% in the quarter as production continues to ramp up to meet the heightened demand. acquisitions contributed $19 million in revenues or 38% of this growth for the quarter. sales to adjacent industries grew 52%. aftermarket segment sales increased 25% and international sales increased 28% as the recreation space continues to attract new customers.
gross margins were 24.1%, compared to 25.2% in the prior-year quarter, pressured by near-term headwinds, including elevated freight, material, and labor costs. on a sequential basis, gross margins improved by approximately 350 basis points, supported by the price increases we enacted in the second half of 2021 and solid operating leverage. we anticipate some margin contraction midyear as supply chain pressures begin to ease and we begin to contractually ease pricing with our customers with our traditional quarterly lag. we are expecting margins to improve approximately 150 to 200 basis points from q4 2021 to q1 2022.
considering materials and pricing alone. sg&a costs as a percentage of sales decrease from the fourth quarter of 2020, as well as sequentially due to fixed costs spread over a higher sales base offsetting increases in freight and transportation costs. operating margins increased roughly 375 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by the successful implementation of our efforts to continuously improve our manufacturing process by increasing automation. gaap net income in q4 2021 was $82.3 million or $3.22 per diluted share, compared to $48.7 million, or $1.92 per diluted share in q4 2020, increasing due to increased demand, accompanied by effective cost management.
adjusted ebitda increased 66% to $146.3 million for the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. moving on to full-year 2021 results. sales to rv oems increased 68% driven by heightened retail demand throughout the year. we drove further content expansion for towables and motorhomes during the quarter.
as i previously mentioned. sales to adjacent markets increased 58% to $1.1 billion in 2021, and our aftermarket segment increased its total sales by 32% to $829.1 million, while international sales increased 58% to $374. 4 million compared to the prior year. acquired revenues were approximately $270 million for the full year of 2021.
non-cash depreciation and amortization were $112.3 million for the 12 months ended december 31, 2021, while non-cash stock-based compensation expense was 27.2 million for the same period. we anticipate depreciation and amortization in the range of $140 to $150 million during the full year of 2022, primarily due to increases in capital investment to enhance production capacity and enable further manufacturing efficiencies. for the 12 months ended december 31, 2021, $194 million was used for business acquisitions, $99 million for capital expenditures and $87 million was returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends. operating cash flows were negatively impacted by the intentional increase in inventory to support heightened demand and minimized supply disruption.
in addition to rising prices of steel and aluminum-based products. at the end of the fourth quarter, we had an outstanding net debt position of $1.2 billion, or one point eight times pro forma ebitda, adjusted to include the ltm ebitda of acquired businesses. with the constantly evolving operating environment, we are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and continue to target a long-term leverage of one and a half times net debt to ebitda. in the near term, we are working to integrate recently completed acquisitions, which we expect to positively impact our operating cash flows in the coming quarters for the full year of 2022.
capital expenditures are anticipated in the range of $130 million to $150 million. looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to continue this momentum throughout 2022 and remain dedicated to further executing our growth strategy to drive long-term value creation for shareholders. that is the end of our prepared remarks. operator, we're ready to take questions.
thank you.
",":
operator
thank you [operator instructions] your first question is from the line of fred wightman from wolfe research. your line is open.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys, good morning. i was hoping you could just give a little bit more detail on that. january number, it looks like it picked up on a two-year basis. and just hoping you could sort of put that into context with the inventory situation across the channel.
i mean, if we look at slide 4, it looks like we've built a fair amount of inventory already. but if you could just put those sort of two data points together, that'd be great?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. so hey, fred. from -- you got two things that i would say really driving the increase. the oems did pick up production rates starting the first week of january, so from what we were running in the fourth quarter, there was a little bit of a lull with a couple of weeks around the holidays.
but then their volumes and output have picked up during the month. so i think that while inventories do, as you would know, start to seasonally improve during this time of year as wholesale would normally outpace retail, i think at this point it's, a little too early to expect the oems to adjust their production rates as they're all seeing quite a bit of success with the early dealer shows down south. so i think that i wouldn't expect those rates to change much in the near term. and then the second part would then be our price increases, as we've been discussing.
as they're on a two-quarter lag, so we had some in the fourth quarter and then additionally had more index adjustments that went into place during january, effective january 1. but at this point puts us pretty well on par with where a lot of the current input costs are. so a lot of that lag, we've made some catch up on that here these last two quarters.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and i just add that all the suppliers had a good solid two weeks to set the table for january and make preparations and clean up some of the supply chain messes that were out there. so when the oems hit the ground running the first week of january, most of the suppliers were all caught up and had the oems stock full of supply. so the oems were able to run pretty clean in january.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
that makes sense. and then, brian, i think you made a comment that the january number is a good run rate or at least a good indication for the quarter. but if we just go back and look at what you guys sort of reported for january here to date last year and then where 1q came in, it would seem to imply that that sales accelerated in february and march. and so i'm wondering if you're sort of planning for that again here this year or if there's something different if we're just looking back?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
well, we certainly -- yeah, we certainly have visibility on february orders and some march orders. so the run rate-if you just look at the run rates that the oems are moving at right now, it's kind of on pace with what rvia has put out there in terms of an annual outlook of 610 or 15,000 units. that's kind of where they're running right now. march they're looking at more of a 640, 650 run rate.
so it does look like it's going to pick up. the question is, will the supply chain and some of the other headwinds allow us to hit those numbers.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and fred, one other thing i'd add, i believe last year in january, the shutdowns by the oems straddled year-end. so you had some, some closures in december and january. and this year, most of the oems were all shut down during december and then hit the ground running at full pace in january. so that's a little bit of the dip, i think, in the prior year that we saw in january.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. thanks, guys.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah.
operator
your next question is from mike swartz of truist. your line is open.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
hey, hey, guys. good morning.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
i just wanted one, does it touch on the towables content numbers in the quarter, there was a big jump sequentially and obviously year over year. but if you give us a little context, how much of that increase is being driven by pricing relative to maybe core market share gains?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah. so i'd probably break it down into three buckets. first, our organic gains, new business, new market share. we've talked about that as we've layered in new business over the last 12 months.
that certainly, has been running in a range pretty consistent with our historical trends. so somewhere around 5% or so. it's usually 3% to 5% a`nd i think we've been a little more on the high side of that. acquisitions, there are some acquired revenues in there, and i believe it's right around 5% on the towables side of things.
and then the remainder, you would see a lot of that being driven by price adjustments, as that's caught up to keep pace with our input costs today.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. ok. that's helpful. and then, i think, jason, you'd mentioned there are more automation projects on top for this year and i guess early, early next year, i think you said in the in upwards of $40 million in investment.
just remind us of what the return on that spend typically looks like and how quickly, we'll see some benefits from those investments?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes. so we're five or so years into our automation journey. and, we started with a couple of really small projects and moved to some, some bigger projects. and we've kind of settled in, $1 million to four $4 million projects kind of being our sweet spot where we can, we can remove, 10 to 50 people out of maybe a work cell or series of work cells.
and that payback usually generally is from, a year to three years on average. so, they're pretty good paybacks, but it allows us to take the labor out of those work areas and redistribute them to other work areas where we need labor and because labor is certainly a problem. so it's really been a huge advantage for us as we continue to do more automation projects than we've gotten a lot better every year, picking the right projects and getting better returns, so.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
ok, great. thank you.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah.
operator
your next question is from craig kennison of baird. your line is open.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst
hey, good morning, thanks for taking my questions. jason, i just wanted to call out all the cultural progress that you've made, i do remember back in the day you had a lot higher turnover than you do today, and it doesn't get called out on these quarterly calls making it. it's pretty amazing.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thank you. that's awesome. appreciate you acknowledging that.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst
so, brian, on the margin front, could you just reiterate what you said about your outlook for q1 and how you think the cadence will flow through the balance of the year?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, certainly. first, you'd have to acknowledge how volatile the markets are. we've seen, steel, aluminum, freight quite a bit of volatility there, moving up and down. so it's hard to predict too far out.
although, for the most part, you can look at what steel is doing currently and use that as an estimate for two quarters out because those index adjustments are contractual and automatic. so as it relates to the current quarter, as i mentioned earlier, just getting our sales prices in line with our current input costs, which has been a journey over the last 12 to 18 months, is expected to give us another 150 to 200 basis point improvement in margin going from fourth quarter to first quarter. and then on top of that, i would look at our normal incremental margin improvement, call it 20% to 25% on the added volume, as our fixed costs are essentially pretty consistent, moving from q4 to q1. so again, i would look incrementally normal range of 20% to 25%.
and then on top of that, we finally get our pricing where it needs to be. and so i'd guess, you'd get another 150 to 200 basis point margin improvement from that. so a bulk of which, obviously that piece is 100% in the cost of goods sold and impacting gross margins. and then the incremental margin would be spread over both our manufacturing overheads as well as sg&a.
so you get to pick up some in both sections of the p&l. there.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and just to tie that back to your intro there on culture, i mean, without a solid culture and the things that were we're doing there, we wouldn't be able to attain those types of incremental margins and we wouldn't be able to grow $1.7 billion in a year. we wouldn't be able to onboard 3,500 people if we didn't have a strong culture. so really, the culture is foundational to, how we succeed in all these areas. so i appreciate you acknowledging that.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst
yeah, thank you. and then following up on the capital allocation, you've got a lot of opportunities, obviously internally, which you mentioned with response in response to mike's question, but what is the deal pipeline look like? what is your appetite for your own stock at its current multiple? how do you weigh all of those opportunities, which seem to be plentiful today?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. i mean, certainly, there's -- we're always looking for to allocate capital to highest returns and take advantage of opportunities as we see fit. the m&a pipeline, i would say, is as consistent as it has been. nothing is significantly changing there.
so as we evaluate, where to deploy our dollars, certainly today we have -- we,  as we've been talking about for the past, maybe two quarters, we've strategically built up our inventories to assist in our ability to mitigate any supply chain disruptions and keep pace with the record volumes that we're running at today. so we've certainly been very mindful of that and deployed a lot of capital there. and then otherwise, we've really kind of prioritized a lot of these automation projects, as jason mentioned with the labor benefits that that provides us so that we can deploy people where we need them to continue to keep pace with these kinds of record volumes. so it's -- so i think i would say that's at least from my perspective how we're evaluating.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and we've been pretty consistent with over the years, just between dividends and just organic capex and capex back into the business and acquisitions.  and it feels like maybe over the last few years' acquisitions have taken quite a bit of capex and the capex back into the business. and automation and things like that have been a close second, but it feels like there's an ability to put more capex into the business and focus on some of the organic growth we've attained over the last year. we've not grown $800 million in a year, let alone, $1.07 billion. and this year it'll certainly be solid.
so, i can see us putting a lot of money back into the business, and then acquisitions will take a backseat, but maybe take a second seat.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst
great. thank you.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah.
operator
your next question is from daniel moore of cjs securities. your line is open.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you and thanks for all the color, jason and brian. maybe talk a little bit focus on the aftermarket side of the business. and obviously, you mentioned 1 million rvs coming in every two years. just what is your outlook for growth in 2022? looks like as well as the m&a pipeline.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
i think, as the last very few years we've been discussing aftermarket heavy as it's growing toward $1 billion of our total business. i don't think people realize how much opportunity there really is in the aftermarket with repair and replacement, and upgrade parts with all these rvs coming in. i mean, it's not only $0.5 million coming in every year, i mean those rvs are staying and needing more work. as you know and have talked around the business, there's not as much effort and emphasis on service and service parts as fast as the industry is growing.
so we're feeling a lot of that need and happy to do it. and on top of that, the rv as of today has probably double the content that they had 10 years ago because there's just more, bells and whistles and features that frankly, we've added and the customers want and have asked for. so, we've just got a tremendous opportunity that i don't think that people understand how much opportunity is really there, but we're going to fill a lot of that need. and, we're preparing our infrastructure between, customer experience and our care center that's got, well over 120 people on the call center side taking 75,000 communications a month and growing.
i mean, all those communications are sales, and repair, and replacement, and upgrades, so.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
and it seems like in your prepared remarks, you're moving toward more of a branded strategy on that side of the business. obviously, oems, i know your lci in your brands extremely well, but maybe just elaborate on that.  and how much of it can you see could ultimately be a pull by the customer versus a push from you through, camping world and all the other dealers? thanks.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. yeah. so, in this day and age, i don't think there are enough people that can handle the customers that'll make them happier and solve a lot of the problems especially as is. as i said earlier, the industry units coming into service are far greater than what we have service and parts personnel for.
so everybody that gets into the mix there to help the customer out, i think helps keep the customers in the lifestyle and in our industry ultimately longer. so i think that's helpful that we're spending much time and resources as we are. and all the time and energy that we spend toward the retail, customer, and consumer with our customer experience department initiatives, and all the people that we've onboarded there to go out and shake hands and get face to face with the consumers that are using our rvs and ultimately our products. we just want to know, what they like and what they don't like and how we can improve and what other ideas they have for products that don't exist today.
and we get a lot of amazing feedback from all this info that we get back directly from the consumer. it's not some kind of survey or we're out there talking to real people that have real problems and issues. and i think that they're really happy to know that there are, organizations and industrial businesses like us, tending to those questions and helping get them some answers and make them feel heard. so i think that's really good.
but i think, i don't -- the short answer to your question is i don't think enough people can get in the game to help the consumer out so that we keep people in this lifestyle especially as many new buyers are coming to the lifestyle.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
okay. the last one for me and i'll jump out. but you highlighted the class b growth and your content. that's something that doesn't get a lot of colors.
what what is your content look like on class b's today? with the tam and what do you think it could be?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. so right now there is $65 million and total potential parts for our product lines, which is about $5,200 per class b, and we've got about 830 of that today. but we've -- we're currently launching several new products in the way of awnings, steps, and some furniture and pop-tops. we've noted that a few times the bed that's on top of the -- that they cut a hole in the roof of the van and put a pop-top that has a sleep  sleeping surface in it, which is like $3,000 items.
so we can boost our content pretty quick in that category as we launched the rest of these products, but we're on top of it for sure.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
all right. very helpful. thanks again.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. thank you.

your next question is from scott stember of c.l. king. your line is open.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
good morning, guys.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning, scott.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
good morning, scott.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
outside of marine, can you talk about some of the trends that you're seeing in the adjacent segment, whether it's, i guess, your high-speed rail, european rv? just maybe just give us an indication of how that's going?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, sure. well, i know you said outside of marine, but marines, marines doing really, really well right now. and they have a much longer runway, i think than rv in terms of, the amount of inventory that's out there. it's very, very low.
and it just feels like, we've got another 18 months or so of filling that pipeline. so the dealers have enough inventory. so and our content's double like brian said earlier from 2019. so -- but outside of marine, we feel europe is going to be a little sluggish with a chip shortage for motor homes.
60% of their total vehicles sold over our motorhomes. and if they can't get the motorhome chassis from [inaudible] and all the other ones over there, it's really hard for them to build the units. so some of that production capacity to switch to towable units. and we supply some towable content over there.
so i think it'll just be a little sluggish. we'll see if they can figure out how to right the supply chain issues, they've got with chips over there. and rail is such a small part of our business. i mean, really where we're picking up rail businesses in the us where some of the new rail manufacturers are putting new facilities and we've got some of those contracts over the next several years.
so we'll be talking more about that in the next couple of years as we onboard some of those contracts. and the specialty vehicle and bus market is pretty flat right now. but we're gaining content this year there. and so, that's helpful, but all in all, it's a know a smaller piece of the total business.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
got it. and just lastly, on the furrion on now this back into the fold, this time around, you've got the aftermarket angle which wasn't there before. could you talk about how that will maybe it just from a sales perspective going forward, how that should drive the business, and maybe the margin profile for the furrion aftermarket versus your traditional aftermarket?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. yeah. so i mean, their aftermarket was humming when we bought them. i mean, it was nearly 40% of their total business.
but they didn't have they weren't nearly in the amount of distributors, and dealerships that we're in. and so, we're in the process now, all the other aftermarket wholesale distribution shows are happening from january to march and april. so, we're slowly moving more of their products into our traditional channels, and that all will happen over the course of this year. and part of it for us is having to, ramp the supply chain up.
so we are going to onboard a lot of new oem businesses as well. but it's taken time to get, the supply chain ramped up to be able to do that. so, we look forward to talking more about the market share gains with furrion this year, both on the oem and aftermarket sides. but all in all, the integration has gone fine so far and they've got some great products.
and as we noted earlier, we're going to launch some really innovative products later this year that are furrion branded, so.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
 got it. that's all i have. thank you.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
hey, scott.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
i'm sorry, go ahead.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
just to wrap that up a little bit from an aftermarket margin perspective, i would say it would be pretty comparable to what the rest of our aftermarket business does. oem as when we were the distributor, margins were on the, say, the lighter side. but with us and our footprint and essentially taking the middle man out of that, we're able to show quite a bit more margin opportunity there. so probably more in line with the rest of our oem business may be on the light side to start, but we would hope that we would be able to show some additional margin improvement as we integrate them.
scott stember -- c.l. king and associates -- analyst
got it. thanks again.

your next question is from kathryn thompson of thompson research group. your line is open.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking our questions today. one is just more of a clarification on the inflation side and looking at your content per unit having a nice increase, as you've always been steadily moving up with that metric. but how much of this in the quarter or maybe you can look over the past trailing 12 months has been related to inflation versus your ongoing initiatives to increase content per unit? thanks.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
hi, katherine. yeah, i mean, like i was talking a little bit earlier the -- from a normal content growth, it's pretty consistent with what we've shown in the past, 3% to 5% type growth acquisitions on the towable side, the impact of that by another 5% points motorhomes was a little bit higher, i think around 6%. and so the remainder of that would be price impact. and i think another way to look at it as everybody's been looking at inflation across the board and the impact on the in-selling price of the unit, you have anywhere from 25% to 30% type increases in prices overall.
and i would tell you that we're pretty consistent in that percentage increase, that inflation that we've seen as well. so you would expect that as we go quarter after quarter and bleed those increases into our trailing 12-month number, you'd see, an impact of inflation that's pretty consistent with what i think the end product has inflated for the end consumer as well. so if that helps to give you a little bit of color where i would expect it to go for when it's ultimately 12 months baked in of price increases.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and because there are so many supply chain problems with, competitors last year, i mean, i can't remember a year where we took more meaningful market share in several categories like awnings and doors and axles and chassis. so we -- and some pretty significant categories, we took some pretty meaningful market share and that'll show up through the course of 2022 as well.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
yeah. and that kind of opens a door, jason, to my next question. just going to ask about it, we've seen a variety of industries over the past 18 to 24 months have and have nots in terms of market share gains and clearly you have gained market share in a variety of categories. i guess a couple of different things related to that subject.
one, based on your past experience, how much of those market share gains do you think are sticky? so we'll stay going forward. and then along that line, who are you taking market share from and what are  if you can focus on, say, the top three to five categories where you are taking market share, that you think are going to be stickier going forward?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, sure. so i think the most important point is that -- we last year, i think, being good partners of the oems, we bailed a lot of situations out and put the oems in a position where they could ship units where they were looking at not being able to ship units. it cost us a ton of overtime to onboard a lot of these customers. but again, back to when greg cook called earlier, because we have a solid culture and because we have people staying here and we don't have the kind of turnover that the rest of the industry have, we can, take on some of those things.
so, we were really successful there. and, the top products said, we spent the most time onboarding with new market share would be awnings, entry doors, axles, and then chassis. and chassis, obviously, is the largest business that we have. so i don't know if i answered all of your questions, but --
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
yes.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
i think what i would add to that is a lot of those came with long-term multi-year commitments, kathryn, as it was a very disruptive time. and as jason mentioned, wehad worked a lot over time.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and so certainly, our ask in those situations, where for longer-term commitments, i'd say they're pretty sticky.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, that's a part of the question i was missing. i think the stickiness is better than ever because we did bail them out. they are going to remember that, we did put some longer-term contracts that we were going to take some of that, that business and because of how much stress it was going to put on in the business. so and i don't think our relationships with our customers have ever been better.
i can tell you from all the major oems, i mean, they told us and all the brands they've told us numerous times over the last six months that, out of all the suppliers in the business, we responded as good as anybody and i've taken care of them through, all the headwinds that we've had from labor to covid to supply chain issues. so i feel really good about the stickiness. now, we still need to be competitive and we've got a 27-year history since i've been here, of being competitive, where and when they need us, and being a good partner. so i think as long as we stay focused on that or we're in good shape.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok. great. and then just the final question. we were in florida for the super show have several big retail shows coming up.
what's your outlook? you've got great backlogs and that's going to keep you busy for quite some time. but from a consumer standpoint, what trends are you seeing now that you'd like to share that would impact the mix of the type of business you do going forward?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. so i mean, it feels like, certainly, it's going to be there longer, i mean are -- we talking about the marine side, there's going to be a long runway there. on motorhomes there's, there's certainly more backed up than any other product category on the rv side, so. and we do have a meaningful amount of content in motorhomes.
so that's going to be significant. the b van we just talked about, i mean, that's going to continue. i don't know if it's going to continue to grow 25% to 50% every year, but it sure looks like it's going to -- that's a big trend in europe. and most of the vehicles in europe are b vans for motorhomes.
so, a lot of small -- a lot of smaller units and, i think we can continue to develop great content for small and larger rvs alike. so we're going to continue to keep our innovation machine moving and launch a lot of new products and stay attuned to what the customers need because they are telling us today. i mean, two years ago, we had no mechanism in our company to figure out what the customers wanted to tell us other than, a service-related phone call or a parts-related phone call. so now we're out there, actually, just asking what it is that they need and going back to our oem customers and saying, hey, look, there's enough need out here for this, change in the product or this new product and they're listening.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
okay, perfect. thanks for answering that questions today.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, sure.

your next question is from bret jordan of jefferies. your line is open.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
good morning.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
could you give us a little bit more color on europe? i think you sort of called it, it's sluggish given the lack of chassis. but could you talk, i guess, about the consumer cadence demand? are they wanting products and putting deposits down? they just can't get it because of the supply chain? and was there as much of a surge in sort of new buyer interest in europe in the last 18 months, as there was in the us? is it sort of a new user base over there like we have here?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, we've seen the same trends and new buyers over there and there is significant demand and consumers want the product and can't get it. much more so than over here at least it's available. available and the lead times are shorter because inventories are starting to build up. but over there they're going to, they're going to probably struggle for a little bit.
i think towables are pretty available over there, but motor homes are the bigger piece of the market, and like here, they're -- for some of the same reasons their inventories are very depleted over there in the motorhome side.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
ok.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and the other differences, we've got, the consumers in the us there are said to be, a couple trillion and people's bank accounts and investment account more than 2019. so, you've got a couple of trillion sitting in and people's investment accounts and bank accounts here were over there, i don't think they've got the same. so you might have a little bit more of an effect over here, in terms of demand because people have more access to cash, but those will be the key thing.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. and i guess your comment on inflation, you were looking for something in the 20% to 30% price increase, i guess, as a result of what we've seen in the last 12 months. how much of that is in the sticker already? versus, how much is the come if ultimately an rv is going to go up by 30% in the span of this disruption?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i feel like increases -- the amount of increases in the supply chain has passed on to the oems is pretty well baked into the price of their units for this quarter. i mean, there's going to be probably some increases. some smaller increases coming, but there are also going to be decreases in the commodities too. so it just feels like going forward from q1 that they're going to be pretty -- it's going to be pretty baked in.
and, ultimately you're going to see dealers probably start to, kind cut margins and cut their prices to keep sales going and stay competitive. so, we'll see what happens over the next few quarters there, but it certainly feels like that's going to happen. i know a couple of dealers already have started doing that and it's time because, in the beginning, they didn't. they're selling above msrp and now they're back to looking at, ok, how do we keep the keep everything going?
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
okay. and i guess one final question, you talk a lot about the aftermarket in this big service demand that exists out there, and there's obviously not much-integrated service or chains of service providers in the rv space. is that something that you could ever sort of vertically integrate into your model that you could actually physically service units? or are you mostly going to supply the part and consultation?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
well, it's a really good question where we have some service bays around the country right now where we do some service work on our parts. the question is, do we be full service and do service for other components and things like that that we could certainly train our techs and do some of those things. so we're exploring everything its just -- we're in a position now where we're just trying to get at what was coming our way. and it's incredibly difficult to find good techs in this business because there's probably a shortage of close to 2,000 already.
so an rvia got a program training techs and recruiting techs. so i think that whole part of the business is going to change significantly over the next few years. but we're certainly going to play a part in it and help out the consumer when they've got component-related issues.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
great, thank you.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah.
operator
your last question is from the line of craig kennison of baird. your line is open.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst
yeah, thanks for letting me back in the queue. so, brian, i just want to clarify something you said about margin. i think you said that you see some margin contraction mid-year due to supply chain issues. is that a year-over-year comment or a sequential comment?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
i mean, primarily what i'm addressing there is that, as i know, you watched the commodity markets and what steel and aluminum have done and have been doing. certainly, aluminum started to come down, and then it went back up. but steel has continued to trend downward. so just like on the front side of this, as our margins lag by two quarters or our price increases lag by two quarters when compared to what we're actually consuming from a cost perspective, we will see that, once again as we go the other way.
so that's whereas steel has come down to $0.60 a pound or so, i think it's where it's currently at that gets looked at every quarter. and then two quarters later, you'll start to see our automatic indexing adjustments take place. so certainly as those price reductions go into play, you would see some margin headwind as that takes place.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst
and just to put this to ask, i mean, are you saying year-over-year declines in the margin or [inaudible].
brian hall -- chief financial officer
more sequentially. so as we've caught up now, then you would start to see as we reduce prices, we will hang on and for the two-quarter lag and get the benefit of that. and then ultimately you would see the reductions which given where prices are today, it's obviously a volatile market and could go anywhere. but as those steel costs have come down, those would be things that are index adjustments will be providing our customers with price reductions, which would be two quarters out.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst
that's very helpful. and then, jason, you've got this new capability really to tap into the rv consumer in a different way. there's a lot of curiosity about that first home buyer and what their experience has been over the last couple of years, and whether they will stay in this industry? what kind of insights have you gleaned from your work as to what that first-time consumer plans to do and whether they're going to stick or exit the market?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. so i think, probably the biggest thing we've learned is that they want somebody and i'm talking specifically, the new buyers here, probably applies to some of the second and people that have bought units before. but mainly for first-time buyers, they want somebody to help them through the process. and, they get some help from a dealer and ultimately get some help from the oem.
but they have somebody that's just a trusted source that's available, and we're trying to give 24/7 service, which i don't think has been done very many places in the industry not trying, we are doing it. we're trying to help with other problems. and, we can't solve the problem if it's we're the only person they can get connected to and we're trying to, you get the answers for them, either through supplier peers or through the oems and just help keep the new buyers connected and feeling comfortable because i think that's their biggest fears. they just don't know how to do certain things and then they can't get a hold on anybody and then they get frustrated and leave the lifestyle.
and we're trying to make sure that that doesn't happen. so i think, just providing them an outlet where they're confident they can get a hold of somebody and get answers relatively fast. part of it is providing all the video content out there. that's been huge for these new buyers.
and then just, kind of having that social place to go to where they meet people and know people face to face and they feel like they've got family in the business versus just some phone number that they call when they need some service on something. so i think they enjoy the camaraderie we've offered. and, we haven't just, put a hotline up and answered the phone. i mean, we've got, almost 20 people dedicated to customer experience now, and it's a separate business from customer service.
and i think that it pays off because customers want to talk to us more than when they just have problems, which is what customer service and customer care are normally. it's, we're there when they have a problem where they can call and get ahold of somebody to fixed an issue. but when you've got a customer experience department, we're going out and meeting them where they're at, whether that's the campgrounds, or rallies, or shows. and it's been meaningful because we've had tens of thousands of contacts with families that are new into the business, getting really good feedback.
craig kennison -- baird -- analyst

presenters, i'm not seeing any other questions at this time, i would like to hand the conference back to mr. jason lippert for closing remarks.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i just want to say before i close that, we did have a strong year to grow $1.7 billion is no small feat and i just want to shout out to our  all of our team members, all 15,000 across the globe that have participated there. if we didn't have a good culture and good teammates that were committed to coming back and dedicating passion and energy to our business every day, there is no way we could attain some of the things we accomplished in 2021. so we're really looking forward to 2022. we've got a lot of momentum, and we'll talk to you about that next quarter.

operator
hello, everyone, and welcome to today's first quarter 2022 lci industries' earnings conference call. my name is emma and i'll be coordinating your call today. [operator instructions] i'll now pass the call over to brian hall to begin. please go ahead, brian.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
good morning, everyone, and welcome to the lci industries' first quarter 2022 conference call. i'm joined on the call today by jason lippert, president, ceo, and director. we will discuss the results for the quarter in just a moment. but first, i would like to inform you that certain statements made in today's conference call regarding lci industries and its operations may be considered forward-looking statements under the securities laws and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
as a result, the company cautions you that there are a number of factors, many of which are beyond the company's control, which could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. these factors are discussed in our earnings release and in our form 10-k and other filings with the sec. the company disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. except as required by law.
with that, i would like to turn the call over to jason lippert. jason? 
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thanks, brian, and good morning everyone, and welcome to lci's first quarter 2022 earnings call. on the heels of an amazing 2021, we carried forward our momentum to deliver record top-line and earnings performance. a wide range of innovative offerings coupled with our ongoing focus on providing best-in-class, customer service, and experience, continue to be key competitive differentiators accelerating growth in our aftermarket, marine, and adjacent businesses alongside rv. as these other businesses continue to flourish, we are reinforcing our ability to drive countercyclical growth, helping position us to deliver strong profitability over the long term.
we ended the quarter with a record $1.6 billion and revenues up 64% year over year with strong demand across the markets we serve. supporting double-digit revenue growth in each of our core markets. our recent acquisitions added approximately $79 million in net sales for the quarter, helping expand our market share. rv oem sales increased 84% during the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, reaching nearly $1 billion, primarily driven by strong demand for rv.
secular megatrends driving the popularity of the outdoor lifestyle is now well-established as a getaway camping survey has recently shown that 57 million households camped in 2021. rvs have quickly become an even more attractive alternative to the skyrocketing cost of air travel and hotel lodging. the industry continues to innovate, and with the explosion and popularity of peer-to-peer rentals, many new opportunities have opened up, which didn't exist prior. according to a recent rvia survey, 46% of new rv buyers plan to list their vehicle on rental sites like outdoorsy, which gives rv owners an effective way to help offset the cost of ownership.
the significant new trend should help further support the long-term growth of the industry, creating a new way for rv-ers to come into the lifestyle. along with new revenue streams and our well-established aftermarket business. we deliver strong content growth across the board as our teams continue to bring new features and existing products and altogether new technologically sophisticated products to market. in the first quarter, content for total rv increased by 40% to a record $4,854, while content per motorhome rv for the first quarter of 2022 increased 25% to $3,144.
as i mentioned in prior calls, because we had more access to inventory over the last 12 months, we gained significant market share in several of our core product categories as some supplier peers in the industry struggled. the industry remains on track for another strong year, despite some recent slowness that will likely continue through the back half of the year. retail demand is solid, and as industry inventory levels stabilize, we are keeping in constant communication with our oem and dealer partners to maintain appropriate levels of production. we've invested heavily in automation and continuous improvement projects over the past 12 months.
throughout our business, which has driven our greater efficiency gains, it is important to note that over the last two years we didn't add much building capacity. as volume skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021. we only really invested in second and third shifts to increase our output in our core product lines. this has allowed us to have a much more flexible cost structure that enables us to quickly adapt to any upward or downward swings in volume while helping us maintain solid levels of profitability.
all this, combined with the guidance of our veteran leadership team, should help us successfully navigate through any future operational headwinds while maintaining the high standards of quality and service that our customers have come to expect from lippert. moving to aftermarket revenues grew 35% year over year, supported by a combination of organic and inorganic growth. we are making great headway with the integration of furrion. we are finding amazing ways to utilize the advanced appliance lineup to bring bold new programs to our existing customer base.
our aftermarket business has benefited remarkably from the growth of the rv industry. according to the rvia study i referenced earlier, 89% of all rv owners purchase aftermarket parts or accessories after buying an rv, with over half of those customers buying multiple aftermarket products at once. this trend will be very favorable for us and our business, as approximately 500,000 rvs are currently on the road and in the repair and replacement cycle every year, creating an incredible growth trajectory for the aftermarket business over the long term. in addition to millions of rvs entering the repair and replacement cycle, we should see a higher use case due to significant running that is now taking place that will drive more wear and tear and ultimately a higher frequency of repair and replacement parts.
we have made significant preparations in our aftermarket business to be ready for this additional growth. as the aftermarket grows, our goal to create the best possible customer experience will become more critical with the summer season right ahead of us. we are excited to continue expanding our customer experience programs, leveraging them to interact with customers and collect feedback to enhance our products and services. to that end, we are holding our second lippert getaway rally later this year in pine mountain, georgia, to follow up on the resounding success of our inaugural rally held last year.
finding ways to creatively engage the rv consumer has led to a great return on investment for our business, helping us build real trust and real relationships with the people who keep coming back to the lippert brand. our onecontrol system has created 1 million rv health reports for consumers this year. our care center and call centers eclipsed 1 million communications last year, and our social media platforms accumulated over 850 million impressions last year alone. our first quarter adjacent market revenues rose 42%, again, driven by heightened demand in the rv business, along with strong content growth.
the rollout of electric [inaudible] and new furniture product lines over the past year has been an incredible success, bringing a new level of convenience to boaters. with the boat inventories remaining low, all over the country, marine shows ample runway for growth as we continue to expand market share through our industry-leading brands like lewmar and taylor made. just like an rv, we are working to expand our marine customer experience programs as we head into the summer boating season and our captains' group now boasts over 1,000 members as we continue to broaden our offerings across the recreation space. we will aim to build similar customer experience support groups to help serve as many consumers as possible.
our international business grew 15% for the first quarter of 2022 compared to 2021, as rv production in european markets is softening from the impact of the semiconductor shortage, caravan registrations decreased 13%, with registrations in germany, the largest market down 8% for the quarter. chip shortages will continue to challenge our european rv business into early next year, but will likely extend the demand tail over the longer term. now move on to our innovation highlights. with younger tech-savvy consumers continuing to stream into the outdoor lifestyle, our focus on innovation has become critical to our success.
they complement the additional capabilities we've been rolling out to our onecontrol platform, which has seen a 400% increase in usage in this past year. we just launched a complete redesign of the onecontrol app. this redesign features a range of updates we are developing using customer feedback collected through our lippert scout rv consumers group. the new design enhances the functionality of the system, providing critical notifications quickly and efficiently through the new interface, and it's also seamlessly integrated with our wider suite of safety products.
in addition, our users are now getting regular vehicle health reports that report on the status of features and service opportunities for their rv. our 100 talented engineers and [inaudible] technologies operation, we are continuing to work on extending the capabilities of the platform and overall ecosystem to support evolving customer preferences, ultimately improving the entire user experience. on top of our innovation, our focus on culture has proven to be a major differentiator for lippert. in order to increase production to meet heightened demand across our businesses over the last two years, we worked tirelessly to onboard about 3,000 new team members.
this is where our culture initiatives and leadership development programs have come into play. these programs have made lippert into a place where people are grown and developed intentionally. as we do this, people choose more often to stay over the long term. and when we retain team members over the long term, key metrics in the business improve greatly, including safety, efficiency, quality, and innovation.
as a result of the meaningful resources we have put toward culture and leadership development, our retention rates have grown significantly, reducing our overall labor costs as turnover diminishes. emphasizing the importance of health and wellness in creating wellness programs inside the company is another way we've been able to support our team members. for our northern indiana facilities, we've just introduced our mobile care unit to provide free on-site services including acute care, chronic disease management, and well-being resources for team members in need. the mobile care unit will be staffed with medical professionals and will be making routine visits to approximately 30 facilities in the northern indiana region, where we have about 7,000 of our team members.
we're excited to continue offering additional layers of aid for our teams. and the mobile medical care unit is only the first of several programs we have set this year to start helping our team members move the needle on their health and well-being. moving on to capital allocation, we are maintaining our focus on integrating our recent acquisitions and paying down debt. at the same time, we are continuing to invest in innovation and operational enhancement to drive efficiency, quality, and profitability throughout our business.
in the first quarter of 2022, we allocated $25 million to growth and automation capex and expect to spend an additional $50 million on growth in automation capex in the remainder of the year. in closing, i'd really like to thank again all of our team members for their ongoing dedication and commitment to delivering quality products to our customers while achieving record results to drive our business forward. our teams all over the business have done an amazing job working through all the challenges and headwinds that made business so much more difficult than what we were used to pre-covid. so thanks to all of our teams for helping us win big in 2021 and 2022 so far.
we look forward to continuing our progress in 2022, as we work to create value for our customers and shareholders. i will now turn the call over to brian hall, our cfo, to give more detail on our financial results. brian?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
thank you, jason. our consolidated net sales for the first quarter increased 64% to $1.6 billion compared to the prior-year period, driven by strong market demand coupled with operational execution. acquisitions contributed 79 million or 8% growth to our quarterly results, with organic growth contributing the balance or 56% of the improvement. while we have seen retail demand across many of our markets temper from the historical levels of 2021, april sales were up 47% to $537 million versus april 2021.
q1 2022 sales to rv oems increased 84% compared to the prior-year period due to strong wholesale and retail demand. and we also delivered substantial context expansion for towables and motorhomes during the quarter. content per towable rv unit increased 40% to $4,854, while content per motorized unit increased 25% to $3,144 compared to the prior-year period. towable content growth can be attributed to organic growth of 9%, in addition to the impact of price increases enacted at the start of the year.
acquired revenues contributed 6% of the year-over-year growth in towable and content per unit. we saw a great performance in the marine market driven by the same trend seen in the rv oem market. and north american marine sales increased by 49%. all sales to adjacent industries grew 42% versus the prior-year period supported by strong growth in marine sales, as well as building products, which grew 50% due to market share gains and an increase in manufactured housing shipments.
aftermarket segment, sales increased 35% and international sales increased 15% year over year as the recreational space continues to attract new customers. gross margins were 28.2% compared to 24.2% in the prior-year period, supported by strong operating leverage and the impact of price realization. as we have communicated each quarter, contractual pricing for many of our key input costs such as steel, aluminum, and inbound freight lags for approximately two quarters. pricing, effective january 1, came more in line with current input costs for the quarter.
while we did experience some temporary relief as steel and freight costs declined during the quarter, we subsequently have seen steel, aluminum, and freight costs continue to increase, which will create some short-term margin contraction until we were able to realize price adjustments. in addition, the north american rv market has experienced some slowing in retail demand when compared to the all-time industry record achieved in 2021. this has allowed oems to balance inventories, which were substantially depleted during the last 24 months, and has resulted in reduced production rates in an effort to align current retail with industrial production output. as a result, we are anticipating some reduction in sales volume in north american rv, which will decrease margins as a result.
we anticipate some margin contraction on a sequential basis as 2022 progresses, with an expected decrease of approximately 250 to 350 basis points in operating profit margin between q1 and q2 2022. that said, we will continue generating strong profitability as efficiencies are driven throughout our business and along with the leverage of fixed costs due to utilization of second and third shifts, we expect to keep expanding margins over the long term. further additional price increases anticipated in the coming months will support strengthened margins toward the end of the year. sg&a cost as a percentage of sales decreased year over year due to fixed costs spread over a higher sales base.
offsetting increases in freight and transportation costs. operating margins increased roughly 625 basis points compared to the prior-year period, driven by operational leverage on a significant sales growth and the successful implementation of our continuous improvement efforts. gaap net income in q1 2022 was $196.2 million or $7.71 per diluted share, compared to $74.1 million or $2.93 per diluted share in q1 2021, increasing due to heightened demand accompanied by effective cost management. ebitda increased 139% to 301.5 million for the first quarter compared to the prior-year period.
non-cash depreciation and amortization were 31.8 million for the three months ended march 31st. while non-cash stock-based compensation expense was 6.5 million for the same period. we anticipate depreciation and amortization in the range of 130 million to 140 million during the full year 2022, primarily due to increases in capital investments to enhance production capacity and enable further manufacturing efficiencies. for the three months ended march 31, 2022, cash generated from operating activities was $135 million.
with $50 million being used for business acquisitions. $42 million for capital expenditures. and $23 million was returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends. operating cash flows were again positively impacted by increased earnings and as inventories continued to normalize.
we anticipate a further reduction in the impact of working capital on cash generation. at the end of the first quarter, we had an outstanding net debt position of 1.2 billion, 1.7 times pro forma ebitda adjusted to include ltm ebitda of acquired businesses. with the constantly evolving operating environment, we are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and continue to target the long-term leverage of 1.5 times net debt to ebitda. in the near term, we are working to integrate recently completed acquisitions which we expect to positively impact our operating cash flows in the coming quarters.
for the full year of 2022, capital expenditures are anticipated in the range of $130 million to $150 million. looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to keep up our strong performance as we progress further into 2022. through the investments we have made in both our facilities and our teams, we are well-positioned to drive growth in any operating environment while creating additional value for our shareholders. that is the end of our prepared remarks.
operator, we're ready to take questions. thank you.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] our first question today comes from kathryn thompson from thompson research group. please go ahead, kathryn. your line is now open.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my questions today. you had a nice gross margin improvement up 400 basis points sequentially. and previously you talked about seeing 200 basis points expected from materials and pricing alone.
my question is the remaining 200, that's all efficiencies in volume, or are there other factors we should take into consideration?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, definitely. kathryn, i would tell you, that one volume certainly exceeded, i think, our original expectations. so we picked up some additional incremental margin there and then our efficiencies were some of the best we've seen. i think as you've heard in our prepared remarks and i know we've talked about it offline as well, running multiple shifts for us is something that's been new.
we've got great teams that we've assembled and they executed very, very well. so we certainly had additional, operational efficiencies that make up for that difference.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok. and how much? if you look at the components of the gross margin upside and roughly what were the biggest buckets in terms of the year-over-year gross margin improvement?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
if you look and just to just add to what brian said, kathryn, the run rate for the first quarter was about 620,000 units is what we were actually running production at. so that's where a lot of the big volume came from. but if you look at the -- how that's broken out, it's about, 5%, or so and volume increases, and operational excellence, and improvements there. some of the things brian alluded to and then a couple of points in pricing improvement from some of the pricing indexes that swung in our favor for q1.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok. and following up on the pricing index curve, is there more pricing to go? given we've seen one-quarter of significant margin expansion or there -- how should we think about that price cost as we look through all of '22?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i think from an industry standpoint, it still sounds like, with other suppliers, and other vendors, that there's still some pricing to give. but for us, we've got, as i just mentioned, our the steel index swung pretty good in our favor for the first time in five quarters. i mean, we've been chasing steel for five quarters as it's a run-up to almost double the prior historical highs and turn back in our favor this quarter. and we'll get a quarter and a half or so of an improvement there.
and then in q3, there's, we're going to be giving back what we saw steel drop this quarter because of how we do the indexes, our customers will see those decreases in q3 roughly. it's in aluminum still bouncing around at all-time highs. so, that's still going to -- i don't know that we'll have to give any increases for that based on what we're seeing, because it feels like it's at a high. but they'll definitely be some givebacks on steel, which will overshadow most of any increases that are happening right now for us.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok. and the final question is more on the content per unit. how much of that was increased with volume, versus price, versus furrion? i'm just really wanting to get to an organic number.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah. so. it doesn't take into account because on a per unit basis the changes in volume. but so what, they ultimately end up with acquisitions that contributed about 6% of the year-over-year growth.
our organic growth was about 9%, which would account for all of our content gains as they bleed in over a 12-month period of time. so we're expecting, as jason mentioned in his prepared remarks, we gained significantly during the last 24 months, locking in new businesses as we have the inventories that we're able to support the industry at record volumes. and because of that, you're seeing that continued to bleed in. so to show 9% organic growth year over year.
and i would expect that to continue to grow from this point forward until it's fully implemented in the 12-month period of time.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
and just to clarify that, 6% and 9%. those are referencing volume-only numbers. no, because of the -- go-ahead.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
those i mean, it's a per the content a per unit basis or the volume doesn't. if the industry volume as an example changes, it doesn't impact that. but for all of the additional new business that we had, those sales would get incorporated in that organic number. any acquired revenues we pull in the acquired revenue number and then any additional growth on top of that from the acquisition date forward gets reflected within our organic growth number.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok. real quick and then i'll hop back in the queue. just any update on the steady supply chain versus three months ago? or six months ago. are there any categories that are better or worse? thank you.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. thanks. i mean, it feels better today. i mean, we're anticipating some, a rough go with some of the freight, again, with some of the headaches that we're seeing in asia with some of the covid lockdowns that have really, pushed things back.
but, with volume diminishing over the coming quarters that should play into our favor, along with, as brian mentioned, we're sitting on a good amount of inventory because up until last month, we were preparing for some pretty sizable run rates and wholesale. and obviously, as those things start to tail off, we'll have some inventory there and a little bit of a cushion. so we should be setting. good.
chips are a big headache for us right now. and we're having to make changes there and redesign and products along with our electronics line ups. but other than that, things of things have been pretty decent.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok. great. thank you.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from scott stember from mkm partners. please go ahead, scott. your line is open.
scott stember -- mkm partners -- analyst
good morning, guys. and thanks for taking my questions.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning.
scott stember -- mkm partners -- analyst
just following up on thompson's questions about content. was that towable the 6% and the 9%?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yes.
scott stember -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok. so the remaining -- go to the 40%. 40% is pricing then.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
correct.
scott stember -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok. got it. and just if you were looking, i guess, at the sales rates that we're seeing so far in -- or that you talked about for april, the 47%, could you maybe parse that out a little bit? what's organic, versus what's the price? is it kind of maybe the same ratios that we saw in the content?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah, i don't think there'd be meaningful change other than rv-related volume. so we've certainly seen production rates with the oems slow some during the month of april, which i think was as, as everyone has expected. so when you look at our year-over-year growth rate for q1 versus the year-over-year growth rate for april, the most meaningful change in that is rv production rates.
scott stember -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok. got it.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah. pricing. i mean, to go back to something that kathryn mentioned and then, you've brought it up as well, the, when you look at what materials have done and i know we've talked about it quite a bit in the past, knowing that, we know what our prices are going to be two quarters out given the lag on the indexes. and, as we've stated before, january 1, was the first time that we've got our steel prices in line with what we had been consuming steel at.
so that was, that was in the $0.90 per pound range. and so, not a great deal of change as you see as we move into q2 in that regard. but with the two-quarter lag as during q1, you saw steel prices drop all the way to almost $0.50 a pound. and then it came back up to i think some were mid-to-low $0.60 a pound.
you will see that price ultimately get reflected during the third quarter. so as it relates to the second quarter, not expecting a great deal of change therefrom an input cost perspective other than maybe a little bit on freight because some of those indexes have they do adjust it at different periods, not as consistent as what the steel indexes adjust. so there will be a little bit of giving back in that regard during the second quarter. but i would think for the second quarter one of the most meaningful variables that are changing is just the rv-related production volume.
scott stember -- mkm partners -- analyst
got it. and to that point, i think the first quarter, i think the rate was around 65,000 units. what are you seeing at that rate from a production standpoint? what are you seeing that come down to? and then maybe just tie that into what you're hearing as a dealer level from an inventory standpoint, where we are?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i don't think from a dealer perspective we're hearing much different than what everybody else's. some of the recent dealer reports for april show that retail seems a little soft. a lot of that, partially due to some of the weather that we've had. i think there's anticipation that in the next few weeks that the retail will start getting a little bit better.
but i'd say that we're planning on a run rate, as we're planning on kind of a 525,000 unit number for the year based on all the inputs that we're hearing, both on the retail in the wholesale side with planned downtime and things like that. so obviously we're running a little bit hotter than that. but we've been coming off of the high run rate, sometime in q1 of about 620,000 units is what the wholesale run rate was running. so we've come off of that and, we feel, we're going to end up the year give or take 15,000 units from 525,000.
we think that that's pretty realistic.
scott stember -- mkm partners -- analyst
ok. and then on the aftermarket, i think last quarter you had talked about, you had a lot of things that were in the r&d queue that you all holding off on, particularly for furrion just because of the demand, just trying to keep up with that. can you remind us again, of the opportunity for the aftermarket to take another big step up just from furrion alone?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, i think, furrion, they still most of their aftermarket, through e-commerce, and they just didn't have the robust representation out in all the different channels, whether you're talking about, amazon or the big dealers, or some of the big wholesale distributors and some of the other channels that we've used. we sell international aftermarket. so, we're -- it takes time, but we're continuing to plug them into every single channel that we've gotten, and we're having good success. and whether it's cameras, or refrigerators, or hot water heaters, or some of the other appliance items that they've got.
we're going to continue to grow their aftermarket nicely because it's a good category. but we're still in the early stages there just getting everything in the catalogs, lined up, and making sure all the channel customers know exactly what we've got to offer.
scott stember -- mkm partners -- analyst
got it. that's all i have. thank you.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thanks, scott.
operator
our next question today comes from daniel moore from cjs securities. please go ahead, daniel. your line is open.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you, jason. thank you, brian. good morning. i apologize for this.
i jumped off another call. can you just repeat brian, the expectations for gross margins, sequentially in the q2 and a commentary you gave for the rest of the year numerically?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
ok. yeah, i think that's a couple of different variables. first of all, if you start on our input costs and the pricing that we've been chasing for quite a few quarters in a row at this point, we've finally, on january 1 got us to where we're somewhat balanced. when saying balanced, i mean, our pricing to our customers is reasonably close to what our input costs were.
as you are well aware, you've now seen steel come back down from those all-time highs. those are on a two-quarter lag though, so that will be setting a lot of the stage for the back half of the year when we get to our beginning of quarter three pricing adjustments for steel. steel ultimately i think came down to low-to-mid $0.60 a pound at the end of the first quarter. so that'll be what's setting our q3 pricing.
so you've got that variable to consider. so going from q2, probably not that meaningfully different from an input cost perspective, other than some givebacks on some of our inbound freight cost and --
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and lower volumes.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
correct. so to address the pricing, the input costs first, like that's what i would expect in q2, not a significant amount of change, but the back half of the year is where that pricing comes into play. the other variable as jason mentioned is volume. and so certainly from a volume perspective, rv being the most or rv or oem is the most significant part of our business we are anticipating volumes to continue to decline some as jason just mentioned, april we did see some reduced production rates from the oems.
some of that's because of retail slowness that we have been experiencing for a number of months, but now i don't think it's been helped by the poor weather that we've had here in north america. so, we're certainly seeing retail get off to a slow start. so, i think oems are reducing their production schedules accordingly. inventories are balanced in a good position.
so hopefully however retail does play out as the spring-summer selling season kicks into full gear that will ultimately determine, i think, what the oem production rates are. but we're expecting those to decline from as jason said, we were probably running it close to a 620 plus thousand unit run rate during q1. rvia forecast, i think the most recent one's still at 591. but, we're looking at more somewhere around that 525,000 unit type number, it could be plus or minus 15,000 units or so, but we're expecting that to play out over the rest of the year.
so, you would certainly expect q2 to see some further declines in rv-related volume, which will impact our margins. i mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're expecting a 250 basis points to 350 basis points reduction moving into q2. and that's primarily driven by volumes with a little bit of freight index adjustments. and then the rest of the year gets a bit fuzzy, but that'll certainly be driven by whatever retail demand is during the summer months.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
that's helpful. no, those are the numbers that i had missed. and then, as we look at a little bit further, a lot of moving parts, obviously, but even running so hot and facing, so much labor and raw material headwinds. if we level off, in that 500,000, 525,000 range looking beyond 2022, you see the potential to sustain or even improve margins in a more quote-and-quote, normal operating environment in fiscal '23 and beyond just talk about the puts and takes there.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. so, with the 620,000 run rate, we obviously, crushed overheads and fixed costs. we settle back down into a 525,000 unit run rate. we can still -- we still feel we can maintain a lot of those efficiencies and opex things we talked about earlier.
we'll still need to run some second and third shifts at 525,000. you have to remember that even though it's coming down 525,000 would be probably a top two year for the industry. and that volume's great. i don't want to -- i want to underscore the notes that brian mentioned earlier.
we made a conscious decision in 2020 to not run out and, buy a bunch of buildings and add capacity from a building standpoint that we would need to fill up with equipment and people. so, we chose otherwise to really focus on putting resources into adding second and third shifts, which really allows us a more flexible model. and we hadn't done that in the past. so, as we settle back down to those 525,000 units or so we're going to be sitting on roughly the same footprint we had prior to covid, which i think really helps, our efficiencies, and then saying that we're going to, we plan on keeping some of those operational efficiencies at run rates that are higher than 500,000 units.
we'll keep some of those efficiencies, we'll lose some of the pricing benefits that we had, obviously. so, we've been traditionally at a 10-point-up margin. we feel we can be a little bit better than that. and it's kind of where we're at.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
perfect. lastly is just a kind of longer-term trajectory of content gains. it's been really strong recently, obviously. and just talk about, beyond furrion once we sort of getting to a little bit more normalized if we are, in an environment where maybe we're normalizing unit growth, your ability to continue to take a share of what you think kind of content growth might look like? thanks again.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. yeah. i think, just look a little bit past rv. i mean, i've -- even though volumes have come down, i'm excited about what the next 12 months look like for us because we're going to add about $350 million in market share gains and just rv alone and just some of the stuff business we've closed over the last quarter or so that'll run out through next year as we start some of this new business stuff.
so that's a pretty significant improvement in gain given that volume's coming down and then we've got significant growth and marine, and aftermarket, and the rest of our adjacent markets. those businesses will continue to grow nicely over the next 12 to 18 months. especially marine, we feel that they have a super long demand tail because they just haven't been able to get the amount of boats out that the dealers need, and dealer inventories are very low there. so as our marine business continues to grow so should the volume on top of that.
so we'll have content gains and marine innovation gains there along with volume gains as they continue to fill up dealer inventory. so, we feel really good. adding into a lower demand time with rvs, we feel really good about the rest of our business, including some of the share gains we've had with rvs.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
perfect. thanks for the color again.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thanks, dan.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from fred wightman from wolfe research. please go ahead, fred. your line is open.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. i was hoping you could maybe just compare or contrast the environment that we're in today, right? you did 620 in the first quarter. it seems like you're going to expect volumes to decline for the rest of the year.
can you just contrast sort of how today looks relative to what we were seeing in 2018 and 2019, whether that's the level of inbound volumes you're seeing from your customers, in terms of throttling down production, whether you think it's earlier than what we saw last time, and maybe just why this time might be different?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
well, if you go back to 2018, 2019, and we struggled in 2018 because there were some pretty significant drops off probably heading to a 450,000 type unit number back then. and it feels bad right now because we're coming off such a high. but again if we land in that 525,000 unit run rate and that's about what the industry's running today. we expect that to dip a little bit.
so that your balance is out to be 525,000. but, it's 525,000, it's a big number and our plants are still really busy at that number. we're just cutting some overtime and cutting some shifts on our end to maintain that without really jeopardizing, the impact of our fixed costs and overhead, so.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
i guess you said differently. is it fair to say that the oems are being a little bit proactive about richening down capacity versus what we saw a few years ago?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
absolutely. yeah, yeah, for sure.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. thank you.

thank you. our next question today comes from ethan huntley from jefferies. please go ahead, ethan. your line is open.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is ethan huntley on for bret jordan. thank you for taking our questions. is there a way you can sort of break out the impact that inflationary pricing had on top-line growth during q1 and maybe sort of what you expect moving into the back half of the year here in terms of pricing?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i mean, that's a difficult one, ethan. but it's, across so many different markets and each one of them has a different degree of steel and aluminum components. and if you look at the hitch business, which is a lot of steel components, there's certainly a heavy weighting to price as we had to chase steel all the way from $0.25, $0.30 per pound, all the way up to almost a $1 per pound. it's probably been the most meaningful within our rv and marine components, which is why we've spent most of our time talking about the price as it relates to those markets.
certainly, when you step back and think about all the different components that we supply to within an rv, many of which, i think, i've said before that, of our materials that would consume approximately 50% of them are steel and aluminum, and that's the dominant share of that is steel. and so it's been very meaningful for us, on a percentage basis at any given point in time. i think the content color that we provided earlier, that's a very good indicator of what is baked into top-line growth as a percentage. so, i think, i would kind of fall back on that, which is about 56% of our sales today as rv oem.
so, the other markets follow that somewhat similarly.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you. and then maybe as a follow-up here, i think you mentioned april sales were up 47% year-on-year. is there a way you guys can sort of break out what percentage might be organic versus acquired there?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
acquired revenue shouldn't have changed a great deal. we did have, so it's about 7%. yeah, we acquired girard, so we picked up a little bit there. so we were 6% for the quarter, but april would have increased to about 7%.
ethan huntley -- jefferies -- analyst
got it. thank you very much for taking our questions.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thanks.
operator
thank you. our next question today comes from brandon rolle from d.a. davidson. please go ahead, brandon.
your line is open.
brandon rolle -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
good morning. thank you for taking my questions. first, you mentioned some strong market share gains recently. could you talk about some of the drivers of your market share gains and future opportunities? and then my second question would just be on the pricing environment.
you were talking about additional price increases still having a flow through the retail channel. how do you feel the pricing is impacted retail demand thus far? thank you.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah, so, start with some of the drivers. i'd say the biggest percentage, the 80/20 of the drivers on rv market share gains over the next 12 months that we've secured are largely core products. you look at chassis business, window business, our furrion business was certainly taking off that was part of our plan from the beginning when we purchased it last july has taken grow their $150 million business significantly. we felt, and as we said on prior calls, we could double that business fairly, easily given some of the competitive landscape and given some of the products that furrion has that are innovative and right for the market.
so those would be the big ones a little bit of furniture. but then if you look at inflation to your second question with respect to retail sentiment and how it's impacting consumers and buying decisions, i mean, certainly there's an impact there. if they're not paying all cash and they're financing a deal, then the impact maybe isn't as significant on a smaller unit, but certainly, the bigger units get a little bit more costly. so then, and we're in for like i said, our pricing to our customers that will ultimately flow back through to the dealer, should not go down for our customers by q3.
so that should provide some relief form. i can't speak for all the other components and things that they buy. i think it's a mixed bag when you look at all of our, all of our peers on the supply side and the business. but at least from our standpoint, there should be some net decreases for our customers come q3.
brandon rolle -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
great. thanks.
operator
thank you. this concludes today's q&a session. now, i'd like to turn the call back to jason lippert.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director

jason? 
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
good morning, everyone, and welcome to lci second quarter 2022 earnings call. continuing our momentum from the beginning of the year, we delivered another quarter of incredible performance. thanks to the solid competitive differentiation we have built up in our aftermarket europe, marine, and other adjacent industries. coupled with our culture, innovation, and customer experience, we are consistently finding ways to grow our value.
as we continue to drive our diversification strategy forward, we are creating strong, growing businesses, which greatly help mitigate the cyclicality of our rv oem business, which we believe will generate great value for years to come. we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in revenue was up 40% year over year with strong demand across the markets we serve to support double-digit revenue growth in each of our core markets. our recent acquisitions of furrion, girard, trazcor, and others added approximately $81 million in net sales for the quarter, helping expand our market share in new high-growth markets. our successful diversification initiatives continue to show fantastic results and improve our financial performance and strengthen our balance sheet, giving us the flexibility to execute on our strategic priorities and further invest in our business.
rv oem sales increased 52% during the second quarter of 2022 compared to 2021 reaching $906 million, driven by elevated wholesale shipments and market share gains. the north american rv market continues to be the foundation of our success in our oem space. despite the impacts from a constantly evolving macroeconomic environment, including record inflation, the outdoor recreation space has continued to grow as travelers recognize the advantages of camping, boating, and rv-ing over the experience of airline travel and hotel lodging and the soaring inflation associated with those two categories. outdoorsy, the world's largest rv rental and outdoor experience marketplace recently shared data illustrating the seven-day family trip has an average gas cost of $275.
that's less than one night stay in many hotels and less than the cost of a typical airline ticket. to add, the recent 40% increase in hotel prices and 25% increase in airline and rental car prices all outpaces rising fuel costs impact on rv travel. since 2021, the average rv trip quoted outdoorsy has risen only $5. for families looking for an affordable, safe, and hassle-free vacation experience, an outdoor trip is clearly an attractive and an affordable option.
in addition, listing vehicles and peer-to-peer rental sites is easier than ever expanding accessibility for potential rvers while helping out first-time owners looking to monetize their vehicles. because the typical family only uses the rv for a few weeks a year, they now have the option to rent their rvs on these little platforms, significantly lowering the total cost of ownership. current rental platforms like outdoorsy and rvshare have also recently enabled customers with the option to deliver rental rvs to campsites directly, significantly lessening the hassle involved in the rental process, as well as eliminating the fear some people associate with towing an rv for the first time. neither of these are existing until before 2020, and we expect these types of advancements to continue to help support the secular shift in popularity toward rv-ing and the outdoor lifestyle.
lci also delivered strong content growth across the board as we drove new product development to capture demand for our innovative offerings. in the second quarter, content for total rv increased 49% to a record $5,382, while content for motorhome rv for the second quarter of 2022 increased 35% to $3,569. many content gains can be attributed to new products brought on through our innovation process, as well as acquisitions like girard and furrion. further, because we had ample inventory over the course of the last two years, we strategically added to our market shares and various product lines, picking up business from supplier peers that struggled to meet demand during that time.
based on feedback that we've received, dealer total inventories are now very cool, and the industry remains on track for another strong year from a total unit standpoint. but the next 12 months look to be challenging with respect to oem volumes as dealers work down their inventories. our long-standing and seasoned leadership team is prepared to adjust our business to these new levels as long as necessary. as volumes skyrocketed in 2021 and 2020, we've focused on investment in second and third shifts to increase our output and our core product lines, creating a flexible cost structure that enables us to quickly and easily adapt to changes in the production environment while helping us maintain solid levels of profitability.
second and third shifts are much easier to flex than if we had added new buildings. we're also continuing investment in automation and manufacturing improvement projects throughout our business to ensure that we have flexibility to scale in line with industry demand. in 2022, we have a goal of completing 10,000 continuous improvement projects as part of our corporatewide continuous improvement program, which involves every team member at every level. our team of continuous improvement experts are dedicated to finding every opportunity to help improve our cost structure as many of our input costs continue to rise.
moving to aftermarket, revenues grew 13% year over year, supported by a combination of organic and inorganic growth. rv aftermarket was up close to 40%, while our automotive aftermarket was flat after growing almost 50% in the last two years since we acquired curt. we are also realizing content gains from our acquisition of furrion and are finding ways to incorporate as advanced the plans to deliver sophisticated new product offerings to our existing aftermarket customer base. we are particularly excited about the offered solar supply product, cameras, and tankless hot water heaters that will enable customers to camp more effortlessly.
margins were somewhat softer in the aftermarket during the quarter as we eased production in our curt automotive business due to their customer-stabilized inventories. we do expect this impact to be largely seasonal and short term, and we have plans to adjust operations to enable a return to historical margin levels. that said, we continue to see strength in our rv aftermarket business as hundreds of thousands of rvs on the road and the repair replacement and upgrade cycles. we are focused on both supporting and maintaining this growth through developing an unmatched service and customer experience.
to follow up the resounding success of our lippert getaway rally last year, we are holding our second rally in august in pine mountain, georgia, where we will leverage our amazing lci service teams to directly engage, serve, and collect real feedback from hundreds of rvers that are coming to the event. finding ways to creatively engage the rv consumer has led to a great return on investment for our business, helping us build real trust and real relationships with rvers who keep coming back to the lippert brand. turning to our second-quarter adjacent market, revenues rose 37%, again, driven by heightened demand in our marine business along with strong content growth. the marine market currently has a solid near-term growth runway compared to the rv oems, which should help stabilize our revenue streams over the course of the remainder of 2022 and 2023.
looking forward, boat inventories remain low all over the country, giving marine a great growth trajectory as we drive to expand market share through industry-leading brands and supply key products like windshields, furniture, chain products, and many other key marine components. like in rv, innovation of new products like our electric biminis continue to bolster our marine sales and the oem and aftermarkets into the future. similarly to rv, we are working to expand our marine customer experience programs for boaters everywhere. our captain's customer experience group now boasts over 1,000 members and are giving us immense feedback.
we will continue to encourage these brand ambassadors to offer ideas for services and products to help ensure we stay on the leading edge of the industry. in addition to marine, manufactured housing has seen significant increases lately as well. and not only manufactured housing, but residential housing as well. our window products for both markets are gaining a lot of ground.
for manufactured housing, it's important to remember that with our chassis and window products, every 10,000 units that the industry grows equals about another 20 million in sales with relatively low incremental cost for the lci business. we have many manufacturing housing customers that are adding facilities due to meaningful growth in their businesses today. our international businesses grew 5% for the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021. caravan registrations decreased 27% with registrations in germany, the largest market, down 11% during the quarter.
uncertainty surrounding chip shortages for their motorhome chassis, economic slowdown, and inflation will continue to challenge our european business into early next year, but will likely extend the demand tail over the longer term. further, a direct exposure to these headwinds have been fairly limited as the international market represents just 7% of our total revenues as the chip shortages get resolved, it is very likely that there will be a whiplash effect in industry production as the oems in europe will rush to build the man much like the u.s. did over the last two years. moving to our innovation highlights.
our customers are increasingly coming to lci for technologically advanced products, and we have been very successful in leveraging this demand to drive margin expansion and content growth throughout our business. in july, we introduced curt's rv industry first independent suspension in our axle lineup, which reduces the vibration found in the traditional axle rv platforms. with more rvs going off road and off grid, this innovation should prove extremely valuable for our customers. we are rolling out furrion's new power cord set into many of the industry's leading brands, increasing functionality for consumers while immediately helping us add content across the board.
every rv needs a power cord, and our new cord is another industry first reducing cord weight by 30%. we launched abs brake technology this year with one of our largest oems and already have several other oems lined up for launch early next year. we believe abs systems are a much-needed technology at today's recreational vehicles and will eventually be the norm. also worth mentioning is the furrion tankless hot water heater.
we're working to make the old pink heater technology obsolete and give customers what they want, hot water in seconds. our innovation teams have been operating in a high gear to drive new product development, including solutions that will help compliment the electrification of automobiles and much more. in addition to innovation, our continued passion and emphasis on culture has set us apart from our competitors. our culture and initiatives, including philanthropy programs and leadership and coaching programs, have successfully made lippert a place where people come to us to grow and develop as human beings, not just as professionals.
due to these initiatives, retention rates remain elevated and we've seen that higher retention means improve safety, efficiency, quality and innovation, which are the true cornerstones of our business. we continue to invest in improving our team member resources to help ensure that we can consistently elevate our output while providing a workplace that fosters personal and professional growth. regarding capital allocation, our focus remains on paying down debt and the integration of our recent acquisitions or returning capital to our shareholders at a rate above our industry peers. investment toward innovation and operational enhancements remains the focus point for our teams in order to drive efficiency, quality, and profitability throughout the business.
in the second quarter of 2022, we allocated $15 million to growth and automation capex and expect to spend an additional $35 million in the remainder of the year. we are working to maintain a solid financial position and balance sheet in order to achieve these goals as we continue to propel our business forward. no matter how challenging industry may get, history has proven two things to us. first, the downturn is never as long as many fear.
and second, we have one of the best and most seasoned management teams that have guided the business through these types of times in great shape. in closing, we want to thank all of our team members for their dedication and hard work as they continue to meet demand for all our segment of striving to deliver quality products and the best experience of each and every customer. our performance continues to be supported by our strong foundation and leadership and culture, as well as our operational strength and expertise of our workforce, guided by an incredible experienced leadership team. as we look forward, we will strive to deliver continued outperformance while generating value for our stakeholders as the year progresses.
i will now turn to brian hall, our cfo, to get more detail on our financial results.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
thank you, jason. our consolidated net sales for the second quarter increased 40% to $1.5 billion compared to the prior-year period, supported by continued execution to meet strong market demand. acquisitions contributed $81 million or 7% growth to our quarterly results, with organic growth contributing the balance or 33% of the improvement. while we have seen retail demand across many of our markets temper from the historical levels of 2021, july sales were up 5% to $368 million versus july 2021, demonstrating positive trends as we move into the second half of 2022, a testament to our diversification efforts which are helping to offset the deceleration we are experiencing in north american rv production.
q2 2022 sales to rv oems increased 52% compared to the prior-year period, driven by strong wholesale shipments and market share gains stemming from content expansion in towables and motorhomes. content for towable rv unit increased 49% to $5,382, while content per motorized unit increased 35% to $3,569 compared to the prior-year period. towable content growth can be attributed to organic growth of 12%, in addition to the impact of price increases enacted at the start of the year. acquired revenues contributed 7% of the year-over-year growth in towable content per unit.
we saw a great performance in the marine market driven by the same trend seen in the rv oem market. and north american marine sales increased 44%. content per powerboat increased 71% to $1,848, driven by market share gains and price increases. in all sales, to adjacent industries grew 37% versus the prior-year period, supported by strong growth in marine sales, as well as meaningful growth in our manufactured housing business, which has remained elevated as the broader housing markets have slowed recently.
aftermarket segment sales increased 13% and international sales increased 5% year over year as the recreation space continues to attract millennials and new customers. gross margins were 26.6%, compared to 23.6% in the prior-year period, supported by strong operating leverage and efficiency, as well as realization of price increases which were implemented earlier in the year necessary to combat rising steel, aluminum, and freight costs. sg&a as a percentage of sales decreased year over year due to fixed costs spread over a higher sales base. operating margins increased roughly 565 basis points compared to the prior-year period, driven by operational leverage on significant sales growth and the successful implementation of our continuous improvement efforts.
gaap net income in q2 2022 was $154.5 million or $6.06 per diluted share, compared to $67.9 million or $2.67 per diluted share in q2 2021. this increase is reflected by robust demand as well as effective cost management. ebitda increased 108% to $250.7 million for the second quarter compared to the prior-year period. noncash depreciation and amortization was $63.7 million for the six months ended june 30, 2022, while non-cash stock-based compensation expense was $13.7 million for the same period.
we anticipate depreciation and amortization in the range of $130 million to $140 million during the full year 2022, primarily due to increases in capital investments to enhance production capacity and enable further manufacturing activities. for the six months ended june 30, 2022, cash generated from operating activities was $348 million, with $52 million being used for business acquisitions, $71 million for capital expenditures, and $50 million was returned to shareholders in the form of dividends. operating cash flows were again positively impacted by increased earnings. and as inventories continue to normalize, we anticipate a further reduction in the impact of working capital on cash generation.
driven by our strong operating cash flows, we were also able to deleverage, making net payments of over $168 million on outstanding borrowings in the first six months of 2022. at the end of the second quarter, we had an outstanding net debt position of 1.1 billion or 1.3 times pro forma ebita adjusted to include ltm ebitda of acquired businesses. with the constantly evolving operating environment, we are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and continue to target a long-term leverage of one and a half times net debt to ebitda. in the near term, we are working to integrate recently completed acquisitions which we expect to positively impact our operating cash flows in the coming quarters.
for the full year 2022, capital expenditures are anticipated in the range of $120 million to $140 million. as we look forward to the remainder of 2022, given the modest slowing and retail demand within the north american rv market compared to the all-time industry record achieved in 2021, oems continue to balance inventories to align current retail demand with industry production output. as a result, we anticipate rv production levels to decline in the second half of 2022 from those experienced in the first half of 2022, partially offset by growth in the other markets we participate. the decrease in rv production coupled with the contractual sales price reductions effective july 1st related to declines in steel, aluminum, and freight costs will negatively impact top-line growth rates.
as such, we anticipate year over year growth rates to decline to approximately 5% to 7% in the third quarter. furthermore, given the aforementioned expectations, we anticipate margin contraction on a sequential basis as we progress through the remainder of 2022. in q3 2022, we anticipate operating margins to decline between 6% and 7%. longer term as we move toward the end of 2022, we continue to generate strong profitability as efficiencies are driven throughout our business since we utilize our leverage in fixed costs with second and third shifts.
we believe these dynamics will support margin expansion over the long term. further, additional price increases and operating costs adjustments anticipated in the coming months will support strengthened margins toward the end of the year and into 2023. we remain committed to investing in innovation, our facilities, and our team, all cornerstones of our long term strategy. we are confident that our talented and experienced leadership team position lci for continued long term growth.
that is the end of our prepared remarks. operator, we're ready to take questions. thank you.
",":
operator
[operator instructions] so our first question today comes from scott stember from mkm members. your line is now open, scott.
scott stember -- mkm partners -- analyst
good morning. thanks for taking my questions, guys. jason, could you maybe just follow up or give a little more granularity on your comments about inventories being very falling? and could you also maybe just talk about what you're seeing right now, the level of production cuts that you're seeing from your customers on a year over year basis?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. sure. so i'll address the production cuts first. our industry worked in the past with the little down clicks where the industry typically slams on the brakes more than they do ease into some kind of meaningful transitions.
so we're always prepared for those types of things. i mean, it's just the way it is, and we just live with it in the industry. but we went from full production months to the next couple months look like 12 production days, approximately. we have visibility over the next two months.
so august or september, we expect 12 days of full production on the rv side. but as we keep pounding the message, we're diversified in so many other businesses because our housing business is growing very strongly. our marine business is growing strongly. our aftermarket business for rv is still super strong, a 40% plus.
power sports. you look at all the other industries we're in, those are going to continue to help offset some of those down click in rv. but i say for the next couple months, it's 12 production days, maybe plus a month. the west coast rv manufacturers seem to be running a little bit better than the elkhart county groups.
and then with respect to dealer touchpoints, i'm talking to some of the larger dealers every week. and i think may retail was obviously not so great, but june seemed to be better for everybody. and july seemed to mirror june. so to classify, the dealer retail activity is decent.
and certainly, as we look to really downscale the oem production, retail as of this minute is far outpacing what wholesale's producing. so that process has started and in the matter of months we'll be back to a healthy balance likely.
scott stember -- mkm partners -- analyst
all right. obviously, we could all appreciate the diversified business model you have, but maybe just give us a little bit more, maybe high level color of the other pieces of your business. how big they are, how strong they are? we know that marine is doing very well right now, but maybe talk about manufactured housing and a few of the other segments that we could look for where we could track in the next few months.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. so, i mean, we've been up anywhere from 35% to 70% month by month on our housing, which is if you look at the residential and manufactured housing businesses, it's a couple hundred million-ish. our marine business, what brian  approaching north american marines, around 100 people [inaudible]. so call it close to $500 million there.
and that's growing significantly right now. as we said, the rv or the marine inventories are significantly low right now. so the supply chains are just starting to free up enough where they're not having supply chain issues every day, and they're able to run what they'd like to run to be able to meet the dealer demand. we keep saying rv's down and it is, but the rail and the marine businesses in europe are both doing well.
our marine business there is going to have their record quarter coming up. so marine and rail in europe is good. and then again, you look at some of the power sport businesses, less meaningful dollars, but still part of our diversification. what am i forgetting? we talk about rv aftermarket.
that's going to continue to grow at probably a 30% to 50% clip and that's $400 million piece of our business, just the rv aftermarket and marine aftermarket piece. so hopefully that's some good color. if you look at q3 going forward, rv might be 45% or so of our business and kind of this new environment for a period. and that other 60% is going to continue to grow and help offset what we've seen on the rv side.
scott stember -- mkm partners -- analyst
all right. just last question, before i jump back. oh, great. thanks.
before i jump back into queue, just last question on the content side. with furrion coming aboard and you talked about a whole bunch of stuff that's coming on, how should we look at the organic content rates going forward, particularly with this new power cord that you talked about, the antilock brakes and all this other stuff?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
hey, scott. this is brian. i think here in the short term, many ways, as we pointed out in our prepared remarks, year over year, our content growth of 49% year over year growth, about 12% of that is organic growth today. and we've talked in the past with that being a trailing 12-month computation, the timing of some of that new business getting layered in, that will continue to grow.
i do think that that will ultimately here in the third quarter reach somewhere around 15% type year over year growth, that's all organic with the remainder being pricing and acquisitions that we've called out. in the acquisitions, we're around 7% and shouldn't change greatly in at least the short term.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and to add that, we're looking at close to $250 to $300 million in new business adds post the model change coming up here in september. that's all figured at more of a 400,000-ish run rate. so that's a significant amount of new business adds. some of that's coming from furrion, some of that's coming from some of our other newer product launches.
other is coming from just market share gains. abs is something we're super excited about. it's going to take three to four years to really penetrate the entire industry on that, which we feel that we will. same thing with the power cord set.
some of the new products, hot water heaters, trying to convert -- that's an easier conversion for us because there's already tank heaters in every rv that we have no business on. and our goal is to take 400,000 to 500,000 rvs and put tankless hot water heaters in them. so furnaces are coming soon for us, which is another big appliance that we're selling zero of today. so you look over the course of a couple years and what we can do to get meaningful volume there, it'll continue to add up.
scott stember -- mkm partners -- analyst
great. thanks, guys.
operator
our next question comes from daniel moore from cjs securities. your line is now open, daniel.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
thank you. thanks, jason and brian, for the color, especially on the rv side. marine obviously looks like you've still got a good runway. maybe just give us an update where you see inventories and kind of a timetable of your best guess of when you would expect them to be more imbalanced or closer to where we are on the rv side.
do you see growth in production through the first half of 2023 at this stage? any additional color would be great. thanks.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. that's a great question. i think easily through the first quarter, we feel confident, especially with the pontoon production, which is most of the -- where most of our business settles in, where most of our content is on boats. some of the big water boats and fiberglass boats, those power boats, they're retail, they're dealer inventory, seem maybe like it's going to be more toward the end of the year, but we still feel we've got a lot of runway and still a lot of content and market share taking opportunity with, especially the pontoon business out there that's growing in a pretty nice clip.
daniel moore -- cjs securities -- analyst
great. and second for me is, you've got balance sheet that's in great shape going into any kind of temporary slowdown. maybe talk about in prior pullback slowdowns, your ability to gain share both organically and be at m&a and whether you might see more opportunity in that type of environment, and that's it for me. thanks.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. that's another good question. we're already seeing activity and opportunity in the acquisition space because people see the writing on the wall and there's some people that had high inventories coming into this little bit of a slowdown, and if you're purely rv, that's a trouble spot for a lot of maybe smaller to midsize businesses. so there's already opportunities on the table and we're excited over the next probably 6 to 12 months to evaluate those as they come along.
and there's certainly going to be opportunities like there was -- this isn't like an '08, '09 because we're much further along in diversification on our end, and we feel like this is going to be shorter blip because like i said earlier, the inventories are starting to right size now with wholesale production really pulling back, and retail is still being fairly decent. so there'll be opportunities for sure.
operator
thank you. our next question comes from kathryn thompson from thompson research group. your line is now open.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
hi. thanks for taking my questions today. if you look back at the history of lippert, manufactured housing was a much bigger portion of your business and you've diversified, but given where we are with affordable housing, the landscape has obviously changed. one of the impediments historically had been around financing for manufactured housing.
i guess, a couple questions related to manufactured housing specifically. first, what is the financing landscape look like today and how is it different since pre-grad recession? and then also, where are you seeing demand strength from a geographic standpoint for your manufactured housing product? thank you.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah. hi, kathryn. i think financing obviously has been a bumpy road over the last decade or so. so with interest rates changing upward today, i'm sure things are changing that landscape as well.
i certainly not specific to the manufactured housing world, but across a lot of our markets, the financing has still been relatively, i would say, strong where you haven't seen a great deal of delinquencies, credit scores are some of the higher that we've seen in the past. so i think those are contributing a lot to all markets, including manufactured housing. and it's certainly to your point, it's still relatively small as a percentage of our total sales, but certainly something that we know a market really, really well and have great partnerships with many of the oems. and i think jason mentioned for every 10,000 units, how much just did our content today, additional top line growth that gives us.
and i think with what's happened, what's tightened up in the typical stick-built home market that we've seen over the last 30 days or so, certainly manufactured homes has a tremendous opportunity for the consumer to find affordable housing.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. and with the typical average mean price of a stick-built home at 400,000 plus, i mean, there's a much bigger gap between manufactured housing today than what there was with stick-built housing back 15, 20 years ago. so the real quick answer to the other question is you look at capco, champion, clayton, some of the bigger players in the business, they're all adding capacity right now, probably the tune of between the three of them, more than 12 facilities. they're running out of capacity and coming to us on chassis.
we're putting a chassis plan up or just finalizing the last parts of that and launch in september. so we'll actually be building chassis again in texas. we haven't added a manufactured housing plan to our portfolio in over 20 years. so that's really a bright part of the housing business for us today.
we're still building a lot of windows today and a lot of chassis for the housing businesses. and we've recently expanded in the last few year, our vinyl window product to the residential new site built homes. so we're actually selling distributors in the site built market that are building new homes that aren't manufactured housing. we're doing quite a bit of windows there and are continuing to expand that business because it's a really big market, and we're really good at building windows.
and on all this stuff, chassis and windows, we've got ample capacity. all we have to do is add team members to the plants we already have. and then we're seeing a lot of this capacity being added in the southeast in texas and things like that. we think that that's going to continue over the next couple of years, the trend there for adding capacity in the manufactured housing side.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok. helpful. in texas, you cited in the southeast, what is your projection? you give projections for rv in terms of shipments. do you have a similar one for manufactured housing?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
we see it going to 200 -- i mean, we see it getting closer to 200,000. i mean if you remember 2011, we were probably in the 48, 45,000, and it's just been slowly climbing back and we see that momentum continue. so i wouldn't be surprised to see you get over 200,000 in the next couple of years.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok. and just for those calling in the perspective, what was it last year?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
last year, i want to say 130-ish, maybe i think. [inaudible] 10,000 homes that are built another 20 million in top line for us.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok. and then historically, those margins had been relatively better. is that still proving to be the case today?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
still true today. yeah.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok. then just kind of being the devil's advocate, makes a lot of sense to see tapping the brakes on the rv business, but why wouldn't that eventually be the case for categories that are in the leisure area, including building?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
oh, i think it for sure will, it's just not going to happen, because they were so slow to get supply chain ramped up, and we're a little bit more careful for whatever reasons why they did that. it's just going to extend that tail into the middle of next year likely. and then we expect that inventories will get full there, but by that time, rv should be right size and we'll see rv take back off again. so we've got this nice push and pull action going between these two categories.
kathryn thompson -- thompson research group -- analyst
ok. great. thank you so much. i really appreciate it.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
thanks, kathryn.

our next question comes from mike swartz from truist securities. your line is now open.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. maybe starting off with brian, i think some of the commentary just on margins for the back half of the year. i just want to make sure i heard right.
did you say that you expect ebit margins in the third quarter to be 6% to 7% and then kind of, i guess, improved over the course of the fourth quarter into 2023? and then i guess if that's the case, maybe just walk us through the moving pieces behind that outlook.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, mike. certainly, if you went back a quarter gauging where we thought rv production was going to land for the remainder of the year, q2, we thought was going to be a little bit lighter than what actuals we ended up with, and we had talked about the back half of the year being somewhere around very low, double digit percent type margin. we've seen more of that get pulled forward to the front part of this year.
certainly in q2, it didn't fall off as dramatically as what we'd originally anticipated. so you're seeing a little bit of that margin pull forward into the second quarter, and then the third and fourth quarter result in a little bit lighter margin. so i think that high single digit type margins for the back half certainly going into q3. we're right sizing the business quickly.
so a lot of the typical levers between overtime reductions and dropping down production days where necessary, depending on which market we're talking about. we're making a lot of those changes as we speak. so certainly, anticipate that q3 declines by what i had intended to say in my remarks was that it would decline 6% to 7% from where we were in the second quarter. that's going to get you pretty close.
you'd be around seven -- high single digit type margins. but then as you move into the fourth quarter and beyond, obviously, we will still be executing on right sizing the business. commodities are a bit volatile. so it's tough to gauge with a hundred percent accuracy where price increases end up with our contractual arrangements, but we certainly have seen those declining in the more recent months, but who knows where that goes and what that ultimately means for the fourth quarter and the beginning of 2023.
but really, it's all about that rv volume. if i were to look at all these other markets as we've talked, they're going to continue to perform strong in the back half of the year. we don't anticipate much change from how they're running today. and it's really just about that rv production volume and where that lands in the third and fourth quarter that's causing the absorption of some of those costs here in the near term.
and ultimately, it doesn't change our outlook for double digit at margins for the full year based on how it all plays out. and again, we couldn't do that without having a strong marine in aftermarket and some of our european businesses and housing businesses and other diversification.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. that's helpful. and then just maybe touching on the second quarter, operating leverage came in a little stronger than, i think, most people had modeled. some of that obviously is a factor of top line coming in stronger.
but even if i look at it on a sequential basis, operating margins or leverage were pretty strong given the step down in revenue just quarter to quarter. so i guess, was there anything in the quarter that was, i guess, a tailwind was outbound freight or there anything -- i guess, anything you can just call out, or is that kind of what we can think about for operating leverage going forward?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
you're certainly going from the first quarter to the second quarter sequentially. we guided and actuals ended up within that range for the margin change, but i would tell you where we benefit a little bit more that we didn't, i think, guide to was this where our material input costs landed. certainly, when you're on the tail into this, we suffer on the front side with our contractual arrangements, but then on the backside, there's a period of time where we will benefit. we were benefiting from that in the first quarter and then benefit a little bit more in the second quarter than what we'd originally anticipated, just because steel had continued to come down, aluminum has now continued to come down, freight costs have come down as well.
so there's short periods of time where we will benefit from that. i wouldn't necessarily say it's something that it's always to anticipate and carry into the third and fourth quarters, but it's certainly a variable that's there and ever-changing as those markets are pretty volatile.
mike swartz -- truist securities -- analyst
ok. great. thanks.
operator
our next question comes from fred wightman from wolfe research. please go ahead.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, guys. good morning. i was hoping -- i don't think you gave sort of a full-year industry wholesale number. do you mind just sort of giving us the latest and greatest on what you're thinking for the full year on the rv side?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah. hey, fred. it's certainly a moving target, but i think if you went back to the last quarter, we were in that 525,000 unit range. i still think that's an opportunity, but i would say more 500 or 525 and we're targeting more of the 500.
like i continued to call out in discussions, you got to really compare and contrast the first half of the year versus the back half of the year. i think wholesale shipments in the first half were 324,000 units. so pretty hefty numbers. so that should give you a good idea of what the trend looks like in the back half before anticipating more of that 500,000 unit number for the year.
and retail, you know, 440 or 460, somewhere in there, which is a good, healthy balance, especially considering how light the back half of the year is loaded with wholesale. like i said, it's going to -- retail's already starting to outpace what the wholesale current demand is. so we'll be back in good shape before too long.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
great. and then on the aftermarket business, the sales growth number there slowed sequentially, and i think there was also a comment in the prepared remarks, just talking about margins being a bit below expectations. can you just walk us through where the disconnect was and how to sort of think about that going forward?
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. so half our business there is rv and marine aftermarket, and that's growing pretty significantly right now, high double digits. i mean, we were 40% year recently. the curt business, which is a good chunk, 40% of the other half has grown 50 plus percent over the last two years when we acquired that business.
and then there was a real stark pullback here in recent months. so we've seen demand fall off on the automotive side of our aftermarket, but we are still extremely bullish on the rv and marine side. that part of our business will continue to grow nicely with good margins. so that's why the numbers look a little wonky on the aftermarket, because we kind of talk about aftermarket.
it's just one big piece of the business, but really we look at it as rv-marine is half and the automotive aftermarket is the other half.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
and, fred, we don't talk about the curt business by itself too often, but to really understand it more, i know you understand the automotive market and what disruption they've seen through supply chain issues, etc. so you certainly have automobile production quite a bit off from where it was two, three years ago. so that's a contributing factor as well as used vehicle sales as well. a lot of those hitch products will get replaced on used vehicles and there just hasn't been a whole lot of activity there.
so the channel's pretty full and the dealers are looking to work off a lot of that inventory that was built up over the last 12 to 18 months.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
and we're the market share leader in automotive aftermarket on hitches and towing. so as soon as new vehicles pop back up, we'll see our demand pop up and sales pop up as well.
fred wightman -- wolfe research -- analyst
perfect. thanks, guys.
operator
thank you. our final question comes from bret jordan from jefferies. your line is now open.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
hey. good morning, guys. on the 600 to 700 basis points of sequential margin decline, could you kind of carve out what you see as de-leveraging from lower volume versus the timing of some of the price benefits you've had? i think you mentioned that some of the material costs had come down as you had a higher price deal, but you'd renegotiated as of july to just sort of parse that volume versus pricing and that margin trend.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, i probably look at it today going into the third quarter and i'm roughing this out in my head right now, bret. so i'd say it's 25% price and 75% rv volume. so the rv volume is the key driver to that.
we did have a july one price decrease that went into effect that certainly reflected in the numbers that you're seeing for the report, the july number we reported, being only up 5% year over year. so i think we're back to a more normalized period right now. we benefit from these plus 50% type numbers for a while now. and we're back to more normalized year over year.
so expecting that july run rate to be consistent or a good proxy for the third quarter 5% to 7%. and that's got the price adjustment piece baked into it. and from a margin perspective, i'd say, to my pony earlier, it's probably more driven by just the absorption of the fixed costs on the rv decline.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
ok. great. and then a question i think earlier there was talk of on the m&a outlook, and i guess at 1.3 times levered on a trailing 12 month, and obviously there might be some decline in the forward 12 months maybe gets you closer to your actual leverage target of 1.5. do you think that you would be less active in the near term? is it sort of to look at the cycle or are you thinking that you'd be looking at m&a regardless of where we go in the next six or 12 months, because it's just stable enough long term?
brian hall -- chief financial officer
yeah. your point is -- you're spot on. leverage is lower today. we're benefiting from the high- record levels of ebitda that we've turned in.
so i would expect in the back half of the year for that leverage ratio to start to trend a little bit back up, but likely end up right around where our strategic target is at 1.5 times. so i think we'll be in a comfortable position to execute on what we need to from a strategic perspective. if the right opportunities are there, i think regardless of what's going on, i think that we have the ability to execute an m&a where we need to. i don't think we're looking to explode the balance sheet again.
so we're certainly very mindful of that, but it's certainly an option for us.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
yeah. we've always said we're comfortable with little north of two times. so i would tell you that you look at our history of 70-some acquisitions in the last 20 years, our sweet spot is 20 million to 50 million. we've made a lot of great acquisitions in that neighborhood price range.
there will be opportunities, and we're in a great position to take advantage of those opportunities. so, like brian said, we're not going to go out and likely do a $300 million acquisition, but there are a lot of smaller acquisitions that we can grow and develop and plug into our distribution network of customers and our markets. we're hopeful that we get to look at those opportunities in the coming months.
brian hall -- chief financial officer
the last point i would add was, regarding our own lippert inventories, we certainly have talked in the past. we've strategically increased those to be able to support the record levels of volume. i still think there's more than a couple hundred million dollars that we can pull out of inventory so that additional cash will certainly help from that perspective as well.
bret jordan -- jefferies -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
thank you. that concludes today's q&a session. i'll now refer you back to jason lippert for further remarks.
jason lippert -- president, chief executive officer, and director
i just want to call back to a comment i made in my initial remarks, which is these little down spouts on the rv business, they never last long and remind everybody that 80% of americans through a lot of surveys that they're going to take road trips this summer, 65 million people said that they're going to camp with their family this summer. the rv industry continues to grow and there's lots of opportunity for us and our peers in this business. so we look forward to talking to you on the next quarter's call. thank you.
bye.
