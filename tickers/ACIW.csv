[operator instructions] your first question comes from the line of peter heckmann of davidson.
peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
[technical issues] just, guys, could you give just a little bit more color on the bill pay? i think i missed the commentary there. could you actually talk about how bill pay did and give us your estimate of what type volume might have pushed into the third quarter?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. what i mentioned was that we had -- the biggest driver of ultimately the decrease in bill pay year-over-year was the shift in the tax payments. and so -- i didn't necessarily mention transaction volume, but the year-over-year q2 decline related to government tax payments was about $16 million.
peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
that's helpful. and have you seen that volumes then have a commensurate uptick in july?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
a good portion of that came back in july, but not all of it. i mean, obviously, we're going to have to see how the rest of the quarter goes and all the way through the extension timing to see if we get that all back. but a good portion came back in july.
peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
great, great. and then just one question on -- i know as capitalized software looks like it's up about 40% year to date, what are you thinking about that for the full year and what are some of the projects that are included in that you capitalized for the quarter?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
really, the only place we do that in is in our -- in parts of our on demand business, so it'll be the platforms. so we're going through right now platform consolidation, we're going through, especially in the bill pay side of the business, and the front end under -- what we bought under speedpay was the next-gen front end and we're continuing to develop that. so i wouldn't look at q2 as a trend by quarter going forward. obviously, there was -- there were certain work that could certainly be progressed more in the last 90 days than others because that's more internal piece of work.
peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
got it. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of mayank tandon of needham.
kyle peterson -- needham & company -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys. this is actually kyle peterson on -- for mayank. thanks for taking our questions. i just wanted to start out on gross margins. it looks like they were definitely one of the big drivers of the profitability upside this quarter. just wanted to see how much of that was organic improvement versus speedpay fully lapping and then trying to get any flavor as to how much of that might be sustainable to keep expanding on the gross margin side in the back half of the year.
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. well, if we just looked at the pure organic business, we had 25% increase in ebitda year-over-year, and that contribution came across pretty much all of our cost lines, so would have benefited at the gross margin line. and we saw a margin improvement in both the on premise business and the aod business. so, again, it gets into the scale of the business and scale of the cost structure.
really, i would say there was two -- there was two major cost reductions we did this year. if you recall, when we came into the year, we took out about $20 million annually in terms of operational efficiencies. those are what i'd call more permanent in nature. those are permanent parts of our cost structure. they -- so they survive this year, they'll survive covid.
what we actioned really in late first quarter, early second quarter was an additional $30 million of cost really specifically in reaction to covid. i would generally consider those more temporary in nature, things like travel expenses, some of our trade shows and things that didn't happen. we reduced contractors. and obviously those costs, as things normalize and things come back, obviously we'll get to traveling again, we'll get to the trade shows, and the contractor costs will come back as the growth comes back as well.
so -- but there is an element of -- again, if i look at just purely the organic business, there is an element of the improved profitability there, again 25% in the quarter, and part of that's coming from the $20 million we took out early in the year.
kyle peterson -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and -- and i guess just continuing on the $30 million costs -- in extra kind of covid related cost savings, how much of that was in the run rate in the 2q numbers and how much of that will kind of start to flow through into 3q? is it about 50-50 or is it mostly kind of baked in the run rate right now?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
i think q2 is probably a pretty good indicator. again, it has the full amount that we took out early in the year, and we auctioned the $30 million pretty quickly. and if we look at the course of the year, q2 probably had the biggest impact because a lot of things really kind of -- i don't want to say they came to a halt, but certainly things like travel and a lot of the trade shows and things have just really gone. so the benefit of that in our p&l -- we saw a lot of that benefit in q2. obviously, as we, in q3 and q4, when we start to see travel pick up, those costs will start to come back a bit. but i think q2 is a good indicator of the full amount of cost benefit for a -- for a 90-day period.
and the only other thing i'd go back to on -- you had mentioned you're focused more on the gross margin in your question. remember, on the biller side of the business, there is interchange costs with that revenue. so when i said the revenue declined in q2 on the tax side of $16 million, there is a pretty sizable interchange costs that goes with that, and so -- that's in the cost of goods sold. so we really have less of an impact on the company at the net revenue level and the ebitda level as a result of that tax -- those tax payments moving out.
kyle peterson -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then i guess last one from me and then i'll step back from the queue -- but just wanted to get -- the services revenue came in a bit lighter than our expectation. is there anything noisy going along there or is it just a little less demand during covid? just want to try to get the sense of when we might see some signs of stabilization there.
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
i wouldn't say anything in particularly noisy. i mean, we were able to continue projects during the last 90 days. if you look at our -- if you look at our new bookings, we had more new bookings in the quarter in on demand and we actually saw the decline in on premise. on premise is where we see the sales related to services work. so there is obviously a drop-off in the on premise business in terms of services sales, and that will -- that will impact q2. it may impact us a little more in the second half, but nothing other -- nothing other than that. it's not there has been a change in terms of what we're doing in terms of our services portfolio. i would say, part of it's covid and part of it's just the lower sales in the quarter.
kyle peterson -- needham & company -- analyst
all right. thanks for the color. nice quarter. thanks, guys.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of george sutton of craig-hallum.
george frederick sutton -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
good morning, odilon and scott. so we attended a interesting webinar you guys hosted about real-time payments, but one of the key themes really has been that real-time has been accelerated. when does this become a revenue driver in your view in the us or does it remain sort of a european-centric factor and how would you quantify the near-term addressable market?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
maybe i take that and then odilon can add some color. obviously, the biggest growth we've seen in real-time is outside of us but -- and that's both on new logos as well as add-ons to selling our real-time capability to our existing customer base. and we mentioned a -- an asian customer that purchased real-time this quarter. that that was revenue in quarter, that was an on premise sale, so that converts pretty quickly. but most of the growth we've -- has come from overseas. obviously, our us banks are -- we're selling that in addition when we -- especially when we go on with renewals. but in terms of a real tipping point in the us, i'm not sure when that will be. but certainly a lot of our growth in the -- 20 plus percent growth that we've seen over the last few years has -- a lot of that's really come in from overseas.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
thanks. just to complement, i think -- also we saw bookings are growing 50% plus, right, so that still is the trend. we are very much focused behind real-time payments, and that will be one of our pillars -- continue to be one of our pillars of growth. it already represents more than 10% of our revenue, so it's significant. and also, the other place that you can expect a lot of growth is emerging markets outside of us and europe. so, i think very much real-time is around the globe and specifically emerging markets.
george frederick sutton -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
just to clarify, did you say bookings for real-time were up 60% [phonetic]? or [speech overlap]
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, 50 [phonetic] plus percent, yeah, in a quarter, yeah.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
60 [phonetic].
george frederick sutton -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
and then, a quick follow-up. so you picked up on visa, mastercard and some others expanding click to pay to 80 new countries. can you talk about that a bit, sort of how are you involved and could that be a meaningful volume and revenue opportunity?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
well, we wouldn't speak to anything in particular with any of our customers or any of our partners in terms of -- obviously we're heavily involved, both going direct in real-time initiatives and also working via our partnership with mastercard already under the vocalink partnership that we have.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think you can expect a lot of activity [indecipherable] behind real-time payments and that will encompass alliances, that will encompass us going by ourselves. but it will be a clear area of focus for us.
george frederick sutton -- craig-hallum capital group -- analyst
great. thanks, guys. congrats on the quarter.
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

[operator instructions] your next question comes from brett huff of stephens, inc.
brett richard huff -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good afternoon, guys -- good morning, guys. hope you're doing well.
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, brett.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, brett.
brett richard huff -- stephens inc. -- analyst
two questions from me. i'll ask them both and then i'll get off. one is, really good bookings quarter surprisingly to us just given that we had seen some banks kind of pause spending. i think you said you had a couple of merchant deals in there. but wondering if you could give us an update on what banks are looking at buying and kind of their tenure of how they're thinking about spending. and then number two, i think you highlighted a little bit some of your initiatives that you can start working on. i think sales execution and maybe sales reorganization was one of them. can you just tell us a little bit more about that and kind of when we should maybe start seeing some of the fruits of that [technical issues]? thanks.
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
maybe, odilon, i'll take the first one.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yeah.
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
the new bookings growth in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year in a covid quarter, that's probably pretty good. q2 is not typically our strongest bookings quarter, in fairness. but like i said, we had a lot more growth -- we had a high growth in the on demand business., w actually saw a decline in the on premise business. but the growth we saw was actually -- most of it really wasn't from banks. our two biggest net new logos, one was a biller customer and the other was our secure e-commerce solution, so merchant solution. and then our biggest add-on was in real-time. so a lot of the growth we saw in the quarter was from billers, merchants and then, as odilon mentioned, the real-time up 65%. so...
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yeah...
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
and i'm not necessarily -- i wouldn't necessarily say that that's an indicator that banks aren't spending, but i'm just saying, for the quarter, that's where we really saw our growth.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. i think -- i think -- but we did see, as scott said, some impact on on premise new bookings. so clearly there are some clients that are delaying the decision, yeah. so that's consistent to what you heard before. just our on demand business did wonderful and that's what offset on the total bookings part. so we -- and we would expect that that trend on the on premise will continue. for us, it's a timing issue only because our products are, as you know, mission-critical. so it's a question of time when we're going to be able to sign those clients. but yes, there are some impacts on that. that's consistent to what you have been seeing. i think that's the first question.
the second one on the execution. just going to give you some data that we are working with our consultants and external team to date. in sales, for example, in the sales organization, we are going to centralize the sales organization. we are hiring a chief revenue officer. i think we're going to have announcement as soon as next week about the name of that chief revenue officer. and by centralizing that, just to give an idea how agile we're going to be, you can expect three levels of management between the ceo and the sales rep around the globe. so that give us an idea about the kind of change that we are going to be doing and how agile we are going to be. and together with that, we are revising everything. we're revising how we build compensation, how we manage the pipeline, how we evaluate the pipeline detail by detail on that. so you can expect, again, a very nimble, agile organization with decision power really in the field and with a strong process behind it.
brett richard huff -- stephens inc. -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
your next question is a follow-up from the line of peter heckmann of davidson.
peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
hi, thanks for taking the follow-up. i just wanted to see if you could provide us any insight into the ongoing process of some of the -- larger contract expansions in the pipeline and do you have any thoughts on timing there.
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah. i mean, we -- i think we said earlier this year that we were -- just to be clear, we weren't expecting any of those or forecasted any of those in this year's guidance. but obviously we continue to have conversations with our customers and even net new logos on a large -- large new opportunity. so nothing that i would say we're expecting here before the end of the year.
peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
okay. i guess one of my understandings was that when a customer goes through a large merger, they need to renegotiate the contract they got before they can consolidate their payment operations. is not -- is that not the case?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
well, no -- yeah, i would say it's generally the case because the license is very specific to the contracting user and their -- it's very specific to the usage. so if they were to actually expand that use to other parts of their operation, acquired operation, then, yeah, it would have to be recontracted. i will point out that, and we mentioned this earlier in the year too, one of the large mergers, they actually executed their renewal early. if you recall, it was a renewal from next year. they actually renewed it back in the first half of this year. so they've recommitted to the next five years. now, that is what, specifically what they're -- what they're using today. so it's not an expanded deal, but it's a recommitment to our technology for the next five years and that was [indecipherable] to renew next year.
peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
okay. all right. thank you. and then, odilon, just a question for you. i mean, do you see kind of the mix, the customer mix shifting at all in your outlook in terms of where you see opportunities from us banks, global banks, emerging markets increasing importance of the merchant channel? can you talk a little bit about how you see that the -- can you maybe -- [indecipherable] more of the sales coming from which of those -- which of those verticals over the next [indecipherable]?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, no, thanks for the question. you can expect a more -- a much more focused organization going forward. so we will have some pillars [technical issues] accelerate significantly. one of the pillars will be real-time payments. so that will continue to be accelerated. a part of it is already at the 60% plus growth in bookings that we have referred to and we are going to be -- continue to push that big time.
i think the other area of focus definitely that we're going to be seeing is emerging markets. we are defining a concept called fighting unit which is the intersection between geography rather than segment, and you're going to have around 20 fighting units around the globe that we are going to be investing heavily behind it. if you put all of that together, i can anticipate to you that real-time payments, overall, it's going to be an area of focus and emerging market, specifically, will be also an area of focus.
peter james heckmann -- d.a. davidson & co. -- analyst
helpful. thank you.
operator
your next question comes from the line of joseph vafi of canaccord.
joseph anthony vafi -- canaccord genuity corp. -- analyst
hey guys, good morning. just a follow-up on the real-time deals in the quarter, the indonesian bank and rabo, just to get a feel for how competitive are these -- are these types of situations for i guess the new customers, i guess, especially on the real-time front. and then secondly, do you think we see m&a for -- during -- or, i guess, i know you're going through some organizational changes. does m&a come after the organizational changes are done or could we see m&a while things are still being optimized here? thanks a lot.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
i will start. yeah. i will start with the last one and i will give the first one to scott. i think we are always looking at the m&a, right. we always like -- i have deals on my table that comes all the time and we are always looking into that. my very -- my focus now is really organic growth. i think we need to start and show this organic growth. and m&a could happen while we are doing this if we got like a spectacular accretive option. but at this point, my focus and the organizational focus is to assure that we position the company for continuous profitable growth. scott?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yeah, i think when it comes to the real-time, we have the relationships with the largest banks in the world and have for a long time with our -- with our retail payments engine. so in a lot of cases, we're a -- we're a natural to provide the real-time capability. so a lot of our success is coming from just selling into that existing base, whether it's a new application or expanding on some of the -- some of the real-time capabilities that they already have.
so on the net new logo, that's probably going to be more in what i'd call more in the central infrastructure where we -- they can either procure it as a licensed software, which is really our model, or if they want somebody to operate it, that's typically going to be provided by somebody else. and so, i would say probably more competitive in the central infrastructures but in terms of the connectivity to those central infrastructures, we're just a natural fit with our existing large bank customer base throughout the world.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the aci second quarter earnings conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker, mr. john kraft, vice president of investor relations and strategy. thank you. please go ahead, sir.
john kraft -- vice president, investor relations & strategic analysis
[technical issues] deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the sec.
on this morning's call is odilon almeida, our ceo, and scott behrens, our cfo.
before i turn it over, i'd like to share the company management will be attending the wells fargo virtual 5th annual technology services forum on august 11; the canaccord 40th annual growth conference, august 12; and the second annual needham virtual fintech & digital transformation 1x1 conference on august 19.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to odilon.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, john, and good morning, everyone.
thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. on our last earnings call in may, covid-19 and unprecedented global impact on people and economies was top of mind and the central focus of our discussion. now in august, we find ourselves in slightly different circumstances but with many of the same challenges. i hope you and your families are staying safe and well and we at aci remain committed to doing everything we can to ensure the health, safety and well-being of our employees as we seamlessly support our customers.
on today's call, i will begin with our second quarter financial results. importantly, i'd also like to share in more detail my vision for profitable revenue growth and long-term value creation.
we are living in a different world compared to even three or four months ago. while different parts of the globe are experiencing different stages and levels of severity of the pandemic, undoubtedly there are ways in which our world has changed from [technical issues]. as it relates to aci, the pandemic has heightened awareness and accelerated widespread acceptance of the essential role digital payment systems play in our modern economy.
starting with the second quarter, new sales bookings were $136 million, up 6% from q2 last year. we saw particular strength in our merchant business, signing two larger psp contracts, rs2 in europe and hyperpay in middle east, that will allow these partners to offer merchant acquiring and e-commerce services to their customers in new geographies. another area of continued strength in the quarter was real-time. we signed a long-term support agreement with our customer, rabobank, who was looking to expand its existing real-time payment offering by supporting batch payments. another existing customer, one of the largest interbank switches in indonesia, has selected aci to orchestrate all their alternative payments, including qr, early pay and other real-time offerings. despite our revenues being impacted by covid-19, our ebitda increased by 42% compared to q2 of 2019 with margin expansion increasing to 35%, up from 25% last year.
our efforts to improve operational discipline are working, and we continue to focus on maximizing profitability while advancing our pipeline of deals to position aci for future continuous, profitable growth.
as i mentioned last quarter, we are fortunate to have a resilient business model with significant recurring revenue, reliable cash flows and high customer retention, all of which are helping us weather the covid-19 related uncertainty. on our first quarter call, i shared with you my background and experience in realigning operations toward revenue growth, margin expansion and value creation. i also spoke about time i devoted to speaking with aci's customers, employees and leaders. since that time, i have also been getting feedback from our investors. these conversations have made clear to me that aci has a strong portfolio of customers in software-led payment solutions, and importantly the human capital and talent to succeed.
on the last earnings call, i have also communicated my initial and high-level perspectives on aci's growth potential and the three pillars of our strategy which will position the company for continuous profitable growth. today, i'm pleased to share additional details on our progress. over the last few months, we have engaged our best internal experts and industry-leading consultants to help us review our business and intensify opportunities for efficiency gains and growth optimization. these small consultant teams have worked with me on several similar efforts over many years. we have a playbook with a proven track record. although our work is not complete, we have identified key initiatives to support the three pillars of our strategy that will drive value creation opportunities for aci.
our first pillar, fit for growth, is the refining and realignment of our organizational structure and operating model to better position the company for organic growth. this involves reviewing the organization model and geographic footprint and designing an agile and nimble organization that is better at creating and sustaining continuous profitable organic growth. we are also designing a best-in-class global sales organization and culture. this initiative focuses on execution, and we will strengthen accountability, enhanced transparency and reduced duplicative costs throughout the company. we are very close to hiring a chief revenue officer and a chief human resources officer to complete the leadership team.
our second pillar is called focus on growth. we'll design an organic growth strategy that puts a disciplined focus on areas where we can optimize growth. we are reviewing our current solutions to identify the best opportunities to invest our operating and capital expenditures going forward. we will focus on a smaller set of growth-rich software-led solutions supported by differentiated innovation in specific geographies and market segments. we will ensure all of our priority solutions are cloud-first in terms of architecture, deployment and operations. we will prioritize investments that have the best market opportunities to generate the highest revenue growth and cash flows and would earn the highest roi. this will become a core discipline here at aci. importantly, this investment will come from cost discipline and reallocation, not incremental spend.
our third pillar is step change value creation through m&a. we've also continued to pursue accretive m&a to drive step change value creation for our shareholders and further expedite our growth.
executing on our three pillar strategy will encompass cost rationalization, which is already well under way. as we previously discussed, we actioned approximately $20 million in annual cash cost reductions in early 2020. during q2, we further increased this amount by approximately $30 million in cost reductions related to covid-19 by reducing the use of contractors, t&e expenses and other non-hr expenses for the rest of 2020.
in addition, as part of our new strategy work, we're identifying additional cash cost savings by flattening our organizational structure, eliminating duplicative costs across our new organization and reducing our global facilities footprint. a good part of the savings will be reinvested behind growth and reassure value maximization to our shareholders.
additionally, we are reviewing our capital allocation. our short-term priority is to continue to deleverage the business. in q2, we paid down $40 million and our net debt ratio has declined to 3.3 times as of q2 2020. in the medium term, we will also reallocate free cash flow to invest in our business, return capital to our shareholders through share buybacks and undertake accretive m&a.
we plan to provide an update on our progress implementing these initiatives on our q3 earnings call. we also expect a fulsome discussion during an investor day we are targeting for november 2020.
i know aci is under way and will be fully launched by january 2021. we understand there is much work to do, but i have said before, i strongly believe we have the right team to succeed. there is a sense of urgency as well as optimism throughout the management team as we execute our new strategy to reposition the business for long-term value creation.
to conclude, driving revenue growth is in my dna and will be in the new aci dna too. we have a clear vision. aci is well positioned to capitalize on the emerging trends in digital payments and specifically real-time payments. but we have plenty of room to improve in operational and go-to market discipline and execution. i have no doubt that by executing on our three 3 pillar strategy, leveraging our go-to-market experiencing and benefiting from a new cutting-edge sales process and culture, we will generate continuous profitable growth and significant value creation.
i will now hand the call to scott to discuss the company's q2 results. scott?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, odilon, and good morning, everyone.
i first plan to go through our results for the second quarter and then provide some high-level commentary regarding our expense reduction initiatives and outlook for the rest of 2020. we'll then open the line for question.
i'll be starting my comments on slide 7 with key takeaways from the quarter. new bookings were $136 million, up 6% from q2 last year as we continued to see strong growth in real-time payments as well as our bill pay solution. we ended the quarter with a 12-month backlog of $1.1 billion and a 60-month backlog of $5.8 billion. q2 revenue came in at $300 million, up 2% from q2 last year on a constant currency basis. the growth was driven primarily by having a full quarter of speedpay revenue in 2020 versus a partial quarter in 2019. excluding the impact of the incremental speedpay revenue, revenue declined on a constant currency basis by roughly 10%, primarily driven by the impact of covid-19.
looking at our on demand business which saw a 15% decline excluding speedpay, the largest portion of the decline is related to the shift in tax payments from q2 to q3 as a result of the irs and many of the state tax deadlines moving out 90 days this year. aside from the government tax payments, we have seen year-over-year declines in other biller segments as a result of covid-19, but those transaction declines have been offset by higher transactions from our secure e-commerce solution.
we saw less of an impact from covid-19 in q2 in our on premise business, which declined 2% compared to q2 last year. declines in nonrecurring license and service revenues were partially offset by higher recurring maintenance revenue.
we saw total recurring revenue grow 4% compared to q2 last year and now comprises 78% of total revenue versus 75% of total revenue in q2 last year. and despite the challenges related to covid-19, we continue to focus on maximizing profitability.
our efforts to improve our operational discipline helped generate significant profitability growth in the quarter with adjusted ebitda of $78 million, up 42% from q2 last year. consolidated net adjusted ebitda margin expanded to 35%, up from 25% last year, which represents nearly 1,000 basis points of improvement. it's important to note that this growth is not just a result of the incremental speedpay contribution as ebitda also grew on an organic basis, improving 25% compared to q2 last year. we saw profitability improvement in both our on demand and our on premise businesses on an organic basis.
turning next to slide 8. starting with debt and [phonetic] liquidity. the solid growth in ebitda delivered strong cash flow from operating activities of $68 million in the quarter, up more than 370% from q2 last year. and we have significant liquidity, as we ended the quarter with $129 million of cash and $300 million available on our revolver. we also paid down $40 million of debt during the quarter. our current debt balance is $1.3 billion, which represents a net debt leverage ratio of 3.3 times.
turning next to our outlook for the rest of 2020. as previously announced, given the uncertainties around covid-19, we've temporarily suspended our financial guidance for the rest of the year. so i won't give you full financial ranges, but i will say again that while revenues have been impacted by covid-19, we are very focused on maximizing profitability and cash flow.
as odilon mentioned, we've actioned approximately $30 million in cost reductions in response to covid-19 by reducing the use of contractors, t&e expenses and other non-hr expenses for the rest of 2020. this is in addition to the approximately $20 million in annual and ongoing cash cost reductions that we implemented as we entered 2020 pre-covid.
further, as a part of our new strategy work, the team here is identifying additional cash cost savings by flattening our organizational structure, eliminating duplicative costs across our new organization and reducing our global facilities footprint. we anticipate that a good portion of the savings will be reinvested behind growth initiatives. odilon and i and the rest of the management team are heavily engaged in this review and we plan to provide more details at our november investor day.
so that concludes my prepared remarks. operator, we are ready to open the line to questions at this time.

[operator instructions] your first line comes from the line of joe vafi from canaccord genuity. your line is open.
sammy -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you. this is sammy [phonetic] on for joe. strong new bookings in the on demand business in the quarter, can you offer any additional color on where you're seeing the most traction and maybe speak to it from a domestic and international perspective as well? and i have a follow-up.
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. and odilon cited some of that in his commentary, was the strength in on demand is coming from biller and e-commerce. biller is -- our biller business is entirely u.s. domestic. but remember, that's where we're getting the traction on our combination of aci with the speedpay acquisition. and then the e-commerce is international. if i look broader outside the u.s., i'd say -- and i would include here to the on premise sales as well. we're seeing -- we continue to see weakness in europe, in particular, but asia, we're seeing particular strength, albeit off a smaller base of our business, but if you want some geographic color.
sammy -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
got it. thank you. and on the mastercard collaboration, it seems like a great partnership. how should we think about the evolution of this collaboration as we look ahead to maybe next year or so? thank you.
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
yes. it's hard to be precise now. we are going to start this collaboration now. and when we start seeing the first countries that we go together, and we start to gain the rfps and so forth, you're going to be able to very quantify that. for now, i would say it's a very robust solution and we are -- we believe that it has a lot of potential.
sammy -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
great. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of brett huff from stephens, inc. your line is open.
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
brett, you there.
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
brett.
brett huff -- stephens, inc -- analyst
hey, guys. sorry about that. applogies, you were on mute. appreciate the time to ask questions as always. just wanted to touch base and understand any update kind of quarter-to-date on how the conversations are going with some of the larger license buyers? i know that it seems like some of them are just on hold. but trying to understand the mood or the tenor of those folks and when -- kind of when they -- if they have any visibility on maybe reramping some of those purchases?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
thank you. thanks for the question. brett, the -- it's very clear for us, there are some headwinds, and they will continue in q4. we don't see them getting better so we're not talking about renewals. again, renewals are coming pretty strong, and our products are mission critical, so we have no problem to renew the contracts, and that's going quite well. the part that is really being delayed are the new products and the new services to the new logos and existing logos. so we are seeing rfps being postponed or rfp is being canceled, in some cases. and it's very hard to predict when this is going to stop, but it's clear for us that we will continue, and it is continuing in q4.
brett huff -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then a question on the -- thanks for some of the insight or sort of the teaser on the analyst day for the places you guys are going to invest in emerging markets, global clients, etc. can you talk a little bit about the global client choice? i know that there's a number of products you guys picked up, be it fraud, be it gateways and things like that. that one was a more unique choice than maybe the other twos would seem more down the fairway. just give us the thoughts on -- i don't want to steal your sun from the analyst statements, but why the big global merchant focus?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
yes. the segment we're pursuing, it's quite clear for us. we have a great solution for what we call global sophisticated merchants, those ones that want to acquire agnostic solution, where they can really control the experience of their consumers. and that's where i think we come to play. if there is a merchant that wants just like a twin vanilla solution, probably we're not the best ones. you have the processors, the big processors and so forth. but if you want to something that really, again, it's acquire agnostic, more sophisticated when you control the experience of your customer, the merchant that's where i think we come to, brett.
brett huff -- stephens, inc -- analyst
okay. and then last question for me, and you may have addressed this already, but the license revenue was tough, we know, and that's very high-margin stuff. yet, you guys came in pretty nicely above where we thought on the profit. could you go through kind of the drivers of that? could you just give us the quick ones?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
yes, i'll give to scott, but i want to start because you really touched the part that i'm very proud of the team of here. i think that's called operational discipline, and we came very strong on costs during this year. there is also some help from speedpay acquisition, but the majority of it is organic. and i think you got the point. our most profitable by far segment is underdelivering. and even with that, we have 500 basis points of margin improvement. so very proud of the team, very proud of the operational discipline. i will give it to scott.
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. no, i would just add to that. it's -- obviously, as you recall, we implemented early in the year, $20 million of structural cost reduction in the business. and then in reaction to covid back, call it, late march, very early april, we quickly implemented another $30 million of cost savings that is continuing to benefit us. versus the september numbers, obviously, revenue came in better. but it's -- again, it's our continued and discipline around the cost side that we're continuing to look at. obviously, that's the area we can control more than we can control new customer deal. so obviously, we're very happy with our cost containment efforts.
brett huff -- stephens, inc -- analyst
great. thanks odilon. thanks for the color guys.
operator
your next question comes from the line of mayank tandon from needham. your line is open.
kyle peterson -- needham -- analyst
hey, good morning. this is actually kyle peterson on for mayank. thanks for taking our questions. just wanted to touch a little bit on some of the trends in the on premise business. i know you mentioned that you've -- that the trends have been tough here. but i guess now that we're in a couple of quarters in the covid, i guess, either quantitatively or qualitatively on the new business front, have you guys noticed any shift in conversations into whether new business is converting more postponements versus cancellations? or just kind of like broad-based, what you guys are seeing there now that we're a few quarters into the pandemic?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
i think -- thank you, kyle, i think the summary is, it's not getting better. i think it continues the same way. and the -- mainly the banks, they are delaying decisions on new investment on things that they can delay. so i think that's what's happening around the growth. there are some exceptions of some geographies around the globe, but most of it is really delaying decisions. as you could say that we are doing the same thing with expenses, like in some way, i think, that's what they're doing the banks around the globe. they really delay decisions and delay while they can. so you have like modernization of infrastructures, they will happen sooner or later because there are banks -- that once you go to the cloud, there are banks that have this long-term vision of modernization and the products to the mix. so that will happen. but those decisions are being delayed, and it's not improving month after month. i mean it's the same stage. would you agree, scott?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. i think the only thing i'd add to that is i think you mentioned the work canceled, certainly none of our projects that are in-flight have been canceled and we're not hearing for the marketplace that modernization type projects are being canceled as much as they're being delayed at this point.
kyle peterson -- needham -- analyst
okay. that's helpful color. and then i guess, just a follow-up on some of the trends in the payment volumes you guys are seeing, specifically on -- i know the tax season got shifted around and kind of switched around some seasonality this year. what impact did you guys have from the shifting of the tax deadline in 3q? and just any other color on how payment volumes are trending either year-to-date or so far in the quarter? any color would be helpful.
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. obviously, we're impacted by the shift in the -- in particular, the irs deadline shift from q2, q3 that we saw, so with all that volume shift. we didn't get it all back in q3. so i'd say whatever the miss we had from q2 on irs didn't all come back, a large portion of it did. but that is -- that's more about what i call a gross revenue story that kind is a lot of interchange. so you'll see the interchange also went up in q3, so not a lot of net revenue impact on that business. i think if you broaden out beyond the tax side, the biller volumes are -- have leveled off, but they had dipped back in, call it, april. may, they've come back a bit. we're still seeing some volume less than our target volume on the biller side.
but then on the e-commerce side, we continue to see high volumes there. so a bit of a balance, some volumes have gone up and some -- and when i say biller, it's particularly certain verticals.
kyle peterson -- needham -- analyst
all right, great. thats good color. thanks guys.
operator
your next question comes from the line of george sutton from craig-hallum. your line is open.
george sutton -- craig-hallum -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. i guess, can you talk a bit about the go-to-market for real-time payments in the u.s. a bit? i mean, so far, like adoption has predominantly been from some of the larger institutions. i guess, what's kind of a catalyst for greater adoption downmarket? is there any difference in how you're approaching that?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. i would say that most of our -- if you look at most of our growth over the last years, obviously, real-time is our fastest-growing segment. a lot of that growth has been international. i mean those -- internationally, those markets have mandated regulatory requirements for real time. we've had success in the u.s. selling capabilities, but to this point, we haven't seen a real critical mass in terms of adoption. i don't know, odilon, if you want to add any more to that?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
yes. i think it would be fair to say that if you think about your time around the globe, u.s. -- the us market is not a leading force. it's more of a falling force. and you have markets that are much more advanced than you have. so there's a lot of catching up to happen. we believe that will happend. and you catch up, united states do have [indecipherable] project. things are coming longer sale. we have a lots of services come to place. but for sure, there's a lot of progress yet to be made in the united states that if you compare it to other countries around the globe, it's kind of a lagging a bit.
george sutton -- craig-hallum -- analyst
got it. and then, i guess, will the partnership with mastercard actually help you grow in the u.s.? or is that predominantly internationally focused?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
you know, we are very excited about that. and also we're excited about that. but i have -- i'm very skeptical on everything that we start doing like those big items. this can be huge, don't get me wrong. it can be huge. but it's really like something that we're going to be backing together with mastercard and learning market-by-market. and don't forget that, i mean, real-time payments is not the global solution. last mile is very important, so it's all local. so it may work in one country better than other country and so forth. so it's going to be experiencing, experimenting, but i don't want to undersell this thing. i mean -- and not also oversell. i think it is a great initiative. and we are very a big time.
george sutton -- craig-hallum -- analyst
great. and then some of the on prem deals that were delayed. i know you said they were from new customers. i mean, is it possible that they switch to a on demand deal? or is that something you're actively pursuing?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
we track that with a lot of disciplines. so for example, we have a rate of wins, rate of losing -- losses in our deals, in rfps. and what i can tell you is that we are not selling more losses or less wins we have up here. so it's not about losing the project itself. it's more about delaying decision for not happening in the same amount of time that it was -- that we're expecting that.
george sutton -- craig-hallum -- analyst
make sense. thats it for me. thanks guys.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of peter heckmann from d.a. davidson & company. your line is open.
alexis huseby -- d.a. davidson & company -- analyst
good morning, guys. this is alexis on for pete. i just wanted to touch in on speedpay really quickly. could you help us with the organic growth number for speedpay in the quarter?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
well, q3, we had speedpay in all of last year. so really, there's no difference between speedpay and the core business year-over-year. it's 100% organic. we closed on that deal back in may of 2019. so q2 had a bit of an inorganic, organic mix, but q3 was fully comparable.
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
i think, scott, it would be fair to say that a significant impact that you saw was the tax, right, volume in q3, right?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
so yes, otherwise -- yes, if you look at it, if you're trying to get some color in terms of how it's tracking versus what we're expecting, speedpay has been tracking to our business case. you know, obviously, it also delivers a lot of marginal cash flow. so in hindsight, especially going through a year like this, when you're really focused on profitability and cash, speedpay has been a very good contributor to the business.
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
yes. we're very happy with the acquisition. and we look at it and say, there is still much more room to go scale and in bill payment.
alexis huseby -- d.a. davidson & company -- analyst
okay. understood. that's helpful. thank you. and then -- more broadly on demand, do you have -- when you're looking out, i don't know, next year or a couple of years, do you have a sense of when on demand will be able to reach a sustainable growth range in sort of the mid-single digits?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
yes. we're not giving like long-term guidance now, but what i can tell you is that november 10, we will be talking about that. so stay tuned, alexis and november 10, we will talk in detail about that.
alexis huseby -- d.a. davidson & company -- analyst
okay. fair enough. thank you.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the aci third quarter earnings announcement. [operator instructions]
i'd like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr. john kraft, vice president of investor relations. sir, please go ahead.
john kraft -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. today's call, like all of our events, is subject to both safe harbor and forward-looking statements. you can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the sec. on this morning's call is odilon almeida, our president and ceo; and scott behrens, our cfo. before i turn it over, i'd like to share that aci will be hosting a virtual analyst day on november 10 to discuss the new aci strategy. further information and a registration link are available on the investor page of our website.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to odilon.
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
thank you, john, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. covid pandemic has had an impact on nearly all aspects of our daily lives, and a lot of uncertainty still remains. however, i couldn't be prouder of our more than 4,000 employees in delivering very solid year-to-date results despite all the challenges. during this crisis, we have remained focused on delivering results by ensuring continuity of our services to our customers. this is very important as we begin the execution of the new aci strategy. since i have started, we continue to make progress in executing our three pillar strategy, which sets the foundation for the new aci to deliver continuous profitable organic growth and a step change value creation through m&a. our shareholders have high expectations for our performance and for our strategic improvement efforts. i want to emphasize that we share those expectations. we are operating with a sense of urgency and with a clear line of sight to what we want to achieve. let's start my comments by sharing some further detail on our financial results year-to-date through q3.
year-to-date revenue of $907 million was up 6%, and adjusted ebitda was up 25% as we have been very focused on cost management and profitability. this growth represented net ebitda margin of 31%, which is up from 26% versus previous year. we are pleased to report 500 basis points of year-to-date margin improvement in this challenging year. the bookings are up 15% year-to-date from the same period last year. despite bookings being up 67% in our on-demand business, new bookings were down 12% in our very profitable on-premise license software business due to covid-related temporary delays in purchasing decisions by our bank customers. the delays are not impacting renewals but are impacting new business in on-premise and the related license fee revenue. we expect this trend to continue in q4. our customer retention remains high, a testament to the aci's team commitment and our industry-leading product set. we had some exciting new wins in the quarter, particularly in our real-time solution. we launched a new important partnership with mastercard that expands our go-to-market capabilities and provides the most robust and complete set of real-time capabilities available in the market today.
we also built on our strong global customer base and had important renewal and expansionary bookings from companies all over the world in our on-premise segment, including barclays in the u.k., red link in argentina, otp in hungary, bc in indonesia and interac in canada, all for our retail payments offering. in our on demand segment, we saw significant booking strength, signing deals with two top credit card billers in the u.s., a top technology provider in the mortgage industry and one of the largest electric and gas utilities. in our merchant business, we signed e-commerce contracts with two u.k.-based telcos and expanded our relationship with a top athletic apparel company, adding our market-leading fraud prevention capability into their e-commerce offering and helping them expand their reach into the russian market. as part of our fuel and convenience store growth program, we secured a new private label open loop card issuing solution with existing customer, pilot travel centers. we are as committed as ever to providing best-in-class service and deliver superior solutions to customers at a time when digital payments are increasingly essential to our ways of life. turning now to our 3-pillar strategic plan. we recently finalized our strategy and have been implementing these priorities into our business with a sense of urgency. we are building an agile and able organization with a best-in-class global sales process, focusing on investment on real-time payments, sophisticated larger global merchants and fast-growing emerging markets. we'll continue to pursue m&a opportunities on top of consistent organic growth that will drive step change value creation. we look forward to sharing more details on the new aci strategy at our analyst day on november 10, 2020.
there is much work to be done to ensure we execute our new aci strategy and that we prepare the company to come out of this global moment in better shape than before. we have the right team, solutions, portfolio of diversified customers and strategy to relaunch aci to capitalize on the emerging trends in digital payments.
i will now hand the call to scott to discuss the company's q3 results in greater detail. scott?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, odilon, and good morning, everyone. i first plan to go through our results for the third quarter and year-to-date and then provide some high-level commentary regarding our outlook for the rest of the year. we will then open the line for questions. i'll be starting my comments on slide seven with key takeaways from the quarter. total bookings grew 43% compared to q3 last year, with some material renewals occurring in the quarter. year-to-date, total bookings are up 38% over last year. new bookings in q3 were down 5%, mainly driven by covid-related delays in our on premise software business. year-to-date, new bookings are up 15% over last year, driven primarily by strength in our on demand segment. we ended the quarter with a 12-month backlog of $1.1 billion and a 60-month backlog of $5.9 billion, both up from last quarter. q3 revenue came in at $316 million, which was down 11% from q3 last year, largely due to lower nonrecurring license fee revenues in our on premise business. year-to-date revenue was up 6% over last year, driven by the contribution from speedpay. in q3, our recurring revenue represented 77% of total revenue, up from 69% of total revenue in q3 last year. recurring revenue is going to be an important metric in our go-forward strategy to improve the predictability of our financial results, and we plan to discuss this metric further at our investor day next week. turning to our segments.
our on premise revenue was down 23% in the quarter and down 10% year-to-date. the impact of covid-19 that we've seen in q2 and q3 this year primarily relates to the nonrecurring license revenue from new sales. as you know, our products are mission critical, so it's not impacting our existing customer renewals, meaning we're not losing customers, but it is impacting license revenue from new sales, in particular from our bank customers. and we're expecting that trend to continue for the balance of the year. our on demand revenue was down 1% in q3 with higher e-commerce volumes and omnichannel merchant payments, helping offset covid-related slowing in certain verticals in our biller solution and our digital banking solution. year-to-date, our on demand revenue was up 19% due to the contribution from speedpay. from a margin perspective, we continue to focus on cost management and maximizing our profitability. while our on premise adjusted ebitda margin decreased from 61% to 55% in q3 due to the decline in the high-margin license revenue, our on demand margin continues to increase from 20% in q3 last year to 32% this year. we are very pleased with our profitability improvements in our on demand business. turning next to slide 8, starting with debt and liquidity.
q3 saw strong cash flow with cash flow from operating activities of $67 million in the quarter, up more than 100% from q3 last year. and we have significant liquidity as we ended the quarter with $134 million in cash and $340 million available on our revolver. during the quarter, we paid down $50 million in debt and our current debt balance is $1.3 billion. this represents a net debt leverage ratio of 3.3 times. we remain focused on reducing our debt and plan to be back to our targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 times by the end of next year. turning next to our outlook for the rest of 2020. as previously announced, given the uncertainties around covid-19, we have temporarily suspended our financial guidance for the rest of the year, so we won't give you both financial ranges, but i will say that we are comfortable with where we're seeing full year consensus ebitda lining up. so that concludes my prepared remarks.
operator, we are ready to open the line for questions at this time.

i think -- thank you, kyle, i think the summary is, it's not getting better. i think it continues the same way. and the -- mainly the banks, they are delaying decisions on new investment on things that they can delay. so i think that's what's happening around the growth. there are some exceptions of some geographies around the globe, but most of it is really delaying decisions. as you could say that we are doing the same thing with expenses, like in some way, i think, that's what they're doing the banks around the globe. they really delay decisions and delay while they can. so you have like modernization of infrastructures, they will happen sooner or later because there are banks -- that once you go to the cloud, there are banks that have this long-term vision of modernization and the products to the mix. so that will happen. but those decisions are being delayed, and it's not improving month after month. i mean it's the same stage. would you agree, scott?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. i think the only thing i'd add to that is i think you mentioned the work canceled, certainly none of our projects that are in-flight have been canceled and we're not hearing for the marketplace that modernization type projects are being canceled as much as they're being delayed at this point.
kyle peterson -- needham -- analyst
okay. that's helpful color. and then i guess, just a follow-up on some of the trends in the payment volumes you guys are seeing, specifically on -- i know the tax season got shifted around and kind of switched around some seasonality this year. what impact did you guys have from the shifting of the tax deadline in 3q? and just any other color on how payment volumes are trending either year-to-date or so far in the quarter? any color would be helpful.
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. obviously, we're impacted by the shift in the -- in particular, the irs deadline shift from q2, q3 that we saw, so with all that volume shift. we didn't get it all back in q3. so i'd say whatever the miss we had from q2 on irs didn't all come back, a large portion of it did. but that is -- that's more about what i call a gross revenue story that kind is a lot of interchange. so you'll see the interchange also went up in q3, so not a lot of net revenue impact on that business. i think if you broaden out beyond the tax side, the biller volumes are -- have leveled off, but they had dipped back in, call it, april. may, they've come back a bit. we're still seeing some volume less than our target volume on the biller side.
but then on the e-commerce side, we continue to see high volumes there. so a bit of a balance, some volumes have gone up and some -- and when i say biller, it's particularly certain verticals.
kyle peterson -- needham -- analyst
all right, great. thats good color. thanks guys.
operator
your next question comes from the line of george sutton from craig-hallum. your line is open.
george sutton -- craig-hallum -- analyst
thanks for taking my question. i guess, can you talk a bit about the go-to-market for real-time payments in the u.s. a bit? i mean, so far, like adoption has predominantly been from some of the larger institutions. i guess, what's kind of a catalyst for greater adoption downmarket? is there any difference in how you're approaching that?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
yes. i would say that most of our -- if you look at most of our growth over the last years, obviously, real-time is our fastest-growing segment. a lot of that growth has been international. i mean those -- internationally, those markets have mandated regulatory requirements for real time. we've had success in the u.s. selling capabilities, but to this point, we haven't seen a real critical mass in terms of adoption. i don't know, odilon, if you want to add any more to that?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
yes. i think it would be fair to say that if you think about your time around the globe, u.s. -- the us market is not a leading force. it's more of a falling force. and you have markets that are much more advanced than you have. so there's a lot of catching up to happen. we believe that will happend. and you catch up, united states do have [indecipherable] project. things are coming longer sale. we have a lots of services come to place. but for sure, there's a lot of progress yet to be made in the united states that if you compare it to other countries around the globe, it's kind of a lagging a bit.
george sutton -- craig-hallum -- analyst
got it. and then, i guess, will the partnership with mastercard actually help you grow in the u.s.? or is that predominantly internationally focused?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
you know, we are very excited about that. and also we're excited about that. but i have -- i'm very skeptical on everything that we start doing like those big items. this can be huge, don't get me wrong. it can be huge. but it's really like something that we're going to be backing together with mastercard and learning market-by-market. and don't forget that, i mean, real-time payments is not the global solution. last mile is very important, so it's all local. so it may work in one country better than other country and so forth. so it's going to be experiencing, experimenting, but i don't want to undersell this thing. i mean -- and not also oversell. i think it is a great initiative. and we are very a big time.
george sutton -- craig-hallum -- analyst
great. and then some of the on prem deals that were delayed. i know you said they were from new customers. i mean, is it possible that they switch to a on demand deal? or is that something you're actively pursuing?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
we track that with a lot of disciplines. so for example, we have a rate of wins, rate of losing -- losses in our deals, in rfps. and what i can tell you is that we are not selling more losses or less wins we have up here. so it's not about losing the project itself. it's more about delaying decision for not happening in the same amount of time that it was -- that we're expecting that.
george sutton -- craig-hallum -- analyst
make sense. thats it for me. thanks guys.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of peter heckmann from d.a. davidson & company. your line is open.
alexis huseby -- d.a. davidson & company -- analyst
good morning, guys. this is alexis on for pete. i just wanted to touch in on speedpay really quickly. could you help us with the organic growth number for speedpay in the quarter?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
well, q3, we had speedpay in all of last year. so really, there's no difference between speedpay and the core business year-over-year. it's 100% organic. we closed on that deal back in may of 2019. so q2 had a bit of an inorganic, organic mix, but q3 was fully comparable.
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
i think, scott, it would be fair to say that a significant impact that you saw was the tax, right, volume in q3, right?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
so yes, otherwise -- yes, if you look at it, if you're trying to get some color in terms of how it's tracking versus what we're expecting, speedpay has been tracking to our business case. you know, obviously, it also delivers a lot of marginal cash flow. so in hindsight, especially going through a year like this, when you're really focused on profitability and cash, speedpay has been a very good contributor to the business.
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
yes. we're very happy with the acquisition. and we look at it and say, there is still much more room to go scale and in bill payment.
alexis huseby -- d.a. davidson & company -- analyst
okay. understood. that's helpful. thank you. and then -- more broadly on demand, do you have -- when you're looking out, i don't know, next year or a couple of years, do you have a sense of when on demand will be able to reach a sustainable growth range in sort of the mid-single digits?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
yes. we're not giving like long-term guidance now, but what i can tell you is that november 10, we will be talking about that. so stay tuned, alexis and november 10, we will talk in detail about that.
alexis huseby -- d.a. davidson & company -- analyst
okay. fair enough. thank you.

operator
ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the aci third quarter earnings announcement. [operator instructions]
i'd like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr. john kraft, vice president of investor relations. sir, please go ahead.
john kraft -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. today's call, like all of our events, is subject to both safe harbor and forward-looking statements. you can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the sec. on this morning's call is odilon almeida, our president and ceo; and scott behrens, our cfo. before i turn it over, i'd like to share that aci will be hosting a virtual analyst day on november 10 to discuss the new aci strategy. further information and a registration link are available on the investor page of our website.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to odilon.
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer
thank you, john, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. covid pandemic has had an impact on nearly all aspects of our daily lives, and a lot of uncertainty still remains. however, i couldn't be prouder of our more than 4,000 employees in delivering very solid year-to-date results despite all the challenges. during this crisis, we have remained focused on delivering results by ensuring continuity of our services to our customers. this is very important as we begin the execution of the new aci strategy. since i have started, we continue to make progress in executing our three pillar strategy, which sets the foundation for the new aci to deliver continuous profitable organic growth and a step change value creation through m&a. our shareholders have high expectations for our performance and for our strategic improvement efforts. i want to emphasize that we share those expectations. we are operating with a sense of urgency and with a clear line of sight to what we want to achieve. let's start my comments by sharing some further detail on our financial results year-to-date through q3.
year-to-date revenue of $907 million was up 6%, and adjusted ebitda was up 25% as we have been very focused on cost management and profitability. this growth represented net ebitda margin of 31%, which is up from 26% versus previous year. we are pleased to report 500 basis points of year-to-date margin improvement in this challenging year. the bookings are up 15% year-to-date from the same period last year. despite bookings being up 67% in our on-demand business, new bookings were down 12% in our very profitable on-premise license software business due to covid-related temporary delays in purchasing decisions by our bank customers. the delays are not impacting renewals but are impacting new business in on-premise and the related license fee revenue. we expect this trend to continue in q4. our customer retention remains high, a testament to the aci's team commitment and our industry-leading product set. we had some exciting new wins in the quarter, particularly in our real-time solution. we launched a new important partnership with mastercard that expands our go-to-market capabilities and provides the most robust and complete set of real-time capabilities available in the market today.
we also built on our strong global customer base and had important renewal and expansionary bookings from companies all over the world in our on-premise segment, including barclays in the u.k., red link in argentina, otp in hungary, bc in indonesia and interac in canada, all for our retail payments offering. in our on demand segment, we saw significant booking strength, signing deals with two top credit card billers in the u.s., a top technology provider in the mortgage industry and one of the largest electric and gas utilities. in our merchant business, we signed e-commerce contracts with two u.k.-based telcos and expanded our relationship with a top athletic apparel company, adding our market-leading fraud prevention capability into their e-commerce offering and helping them expand their reach into the russian market. as part of our fuel and convenience store growth program, we secured a new private label open loop card issuing solution with existing customer, pilot travel centers. we are as committed as ever to providing best-in-class service and deliver superior solutions to customers at a time when digital payments are increasingly essential to our ways of life. turning now to our 3-pillar strategic plan. we recently finalized our strategy and have been implementing these priorities into our business with a sense of urgency. we are building an agile and able organization with a best-in-class global sales process, focusing on investment on real-time payments, sophisticated larger global merchants and fast-growing emerging markets. we'll continue to pursue m&a opportunities on top of consistent organic growth that will drive step change value creation. we look forward to sharing more details on the new aci strategy at our analyst day on november 10, 2020.
there is much work to be done to ensure we execute our new aci strategy and that we prepare the company to come out of this global moment in better shape than before. we have the right team, solutions, portfolio of diversified customers and strategy to relaunch aci to capitalize on the emerging trends in digital payments.
i will now hand the call to scott to discuss the company's q3 results in greater detail. scott?
scott behrens -- senior executive vice president, chief financial officer
thanks, odilon, and good morning, everyone. i first plan to go through our results for the third quarter and year-to-date and then provide some high-level commentary regarding our outlook for the rest of the year. we will then open the line for questions. i'll be starting my comments on slide seven with key takeaways from the quarter. total bookings grew 43% compared to q3 last year, with some material renewals occurring in the quarter. year-to-date, total bookings are up 38% over last year. new bookings in q3 were down 5%, mainly driven by covid-related delays in our on premise software business. year-to-date, new bookings are up 15% over last year, driven primarily by strength in our on demand segment. we ended the quarter with a 12-month backlog of $1.1 billion and a 60-month backlog of $5.9 billion, both up from last quarter. q3 revenue came in at $316 million, which was down 11% from q3 last year, largely due to lower nonrecurring license fee revenues in our on premise business. year-to-date revenue was up 6% over last year, driven by the contribution from speedpay. in q3, our recurring revenue represented 77% of total revenue, up from 69% of total revenue in q3 last year. recurring revenue is going to be an important metric in our go-forward strategy to improve the predictability of our financial results, and we plan to discuss this metric further at our investor day next week. turning to our segments.
our on premise revenue was down 23% in the quarter and down 10% year-to-date. the impact of covid-19 that we've seen in q2 and q3 this year primarily relates to the nonrecurring license revenue from new sales. as you know, our products are mission critical, so it's not impacting our existing customer renewals, meaning we're not losing customers, but it is impacting license revenue from new sales, in particular from our bank customers. and we're expecting that trend to continue for the balance of the year. our on demand revenue was down 1% in q3 with higher e-commerce volumes and omnichannel merchant payments, helping offset covid-related slowing in certain verticals in our biller solution and our digital banking solution. year-to-date, our on demand revenue was up 19% due to the contribution from speedpay. from a margin perspective, we continue to focus on cost management and maximizing our profitability. while our on premise adjusted ebitda margin decreased from 61% to 55% in q3 due to the decline in the high-margin license revenue, our on demand margin continues to increase from 20% in q3 last year to 32% this year. we are very pleased with our profitability improvements in our on demand business. turning next to slide 8, starting with debt and liquidity.
q3 saw strong cash flow with cash flow from operating activities of $67 million in the quarter, up more than 100% from q3 last year. and we have significant liquidity as we ended the quarter with $134 million in cash and $340 million available on our revolver. during the quarter, we paid down $50 million in debt and our current debt balance is $1.3 billion. this represents a net debt leverage ratio of 3.3 times. we remain focused on reducing our debt and plan to be back to our targeted net leverage ratio of 2.5 times by the end of next year. turning next to our outlook for the rest of 2020. as previously announced, given the uncertainties around covid-19, we have temporarily suspended our financial guidance for the rest of the year, so we won't give you both financial ranges, but i will say that we are comfortable with where we're seeing full year consensus ebitda lining up. so that concludes my prepared remarks.
operator, we are ready to open the line for questions at this time.
",2020-Q3,ACIW
0.9352,,0.687,0.6752,":
operator
[operator instructions] we have our first question from the line of mr. brett huff from stephens incorporated. your line is now open.
brett huff -- stephens inc. -- analyst
good morning, guys. how are you.
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
good morning.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, brett.
brett huff -- stephens inc. -- analyst
just a couple of questions. number one, congrats on the mastercard joint win. i think it was peru or somewhere in latin america. can you just give us -- unpack that a little bit? how did the sales process go? was it competitive? kind of what got you guys over the finish line from a decision point of view.
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
yeah, well, i'll answer that. yeah, it is peru. we had announced last summer that more enhanced partnership with mastercard, in particular, really targeting a specific list of countries to go to market on a joint effort, and that's really a product of that, that partnership that we announced last summer. so, it's obviously getting early traction and we're really confident in that.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, brett, its basically the national switch, and mastercard is going to operate and we are going to be the software. so that's the summary of it.
brett huff -- stephens inc. -- analyst
and so this is where you guys are doing most of the bank on ramp stuff, whereas mastercard is due in the central hub. is that kind of the division of labor?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
correct, correct.
brett huff -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. second question is just on the guidance. i think you guys said accelerating to mid-single digits in the back half, you had mentioned sort of mid-single digits, i think, over the next three years at the analyst day. is that a little bit of a shift? or we're just feeling a little bit longer covid negative impact in the first half? is that what's going on, or am i misreading that communication?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, brett. we don't believe it's a shift. we continue to have the same guidance of before we continue under covid-19 as you just said. so there is impact of covid-19 in the first quarter, no question about that. i mean, nothing changed, yeah, versus the q4 quarter. so we continue to see our banks delaying decisions on license revenue basically, so that's the only effect that we see. we also see some effects on the volume of bill payment that is also consistent with q4. and so the effects of covid-19 continues. we don't know how long they will be. we don't expect them to continue during the second half, and that's why we say mid digits by second half.
brett huff -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and then last one on the strategic review, any purview on that? i think you mentioned reviewing the portfolio, but kind of how broad or narrow is that? just give us -- i don't know how much you can say, now there is an 8k probably coming up soon. but just what are the kind of parameters of that? if you could give us any qualitative thoughts on it?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
it's a very broad. i mean, we are -- and that's what the third pillar is about, right. so there is no news here. i mean, we -- since the beginning, we said that the third pillar is to provide step change value creation to our shareholders through m&a, that could be through divestiture of no strategic assets or buying some assets also in a highly accretive way, and we continue to that. so it's very broad and continues to be very broad, so.
brett huff -- stephens inc. -- analyst
okay, great. that's what i needed. i appreciate the time, guys.
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
sure. thanks, brett.
operator
and our next question is from the line of peter heckmann from davidson. your line is now open.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
good morning, gentlemen. nice results in the fourth quarter. i wanted to see how you're thinking about both the renewal pipeline for 2021 as well as new business? if you can talk about where you might be seeing some rfp activity on country basis or a large financial institution basis that we should be keeping in mind?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
yeah, i'd say. in some of the comments i made in my prepared remarks. even with 2020, it wasn't really the renewal book that was the issue. we have a solid renewal book in 2021. i would say, really where we're seeing the growth opportunity is really going to come as those banks pick up spending in the second half of the year. and what i'm referring to there is more the net new sales versus versus existing renewals. that was really where we fell short in 2020, was to get not in renewals but in net new spend, whether new logos or cross-sell of new applications. that's where we see in our pipeline this year that picking up, and that's going to allow us here in the second half of the year to get to deliver our long-term targets of mid-single digit.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, aretakis [phonetic] had been making calls with ceo of banks here in the united states, in singapore. i was in meetings in brazil also with some ceos of some banks. and what i can tell you is that i start to see light in the tunnel for the second half of this year. so, they started to talk about the projects that they will not talk anymore about modernization, about going to the cloud. so i'm positive. i'm optimistic about the second half of the year. i think, things will get more to a normal state business wise by the second half of this year.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
that's great. that's great. and then can you just talk about the interplay and maybe in some of the countries that already have real-time payments, the interplay between kind of more traditional biller, direct bill pay and then real-time payments? maybe how much of the payment volume has shifted over to a direct account to account payment versus the card-based payments?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i can tell you, for example, we are. i'll give an example so that becomes more real. i guess brazil, the picks in brazil, right. i mean that has just been launched and is already like making as like 5 million accounts already, like a few months. so when it starts, it starts very fast. so they're basically three rails around the globe for payments, right. and all the others are variances of this three rails. you can have physical cash. you can have cards or you can have real-time payments. and what we expect going forward is that cash will continue to be stable and going down a little bit, and cards is not going to be growing as much as they have been growing the past, right 20% plus, it's going to slow down a little bit. and -- but the bulk of the growth is really being real-time payments, and that's what we're seeing. it's a much more effective, efficient rail, and that's why everybody is looking to that and that's why it's the center of our strategy.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. thank you.
operator
and our next question is from the line of mr. george sutton from craig-hallum. your line is now open.
george sutton -- craig-hallum capital -- analyst
thank you. and first my congratulations on your being responsive to shareholders with the upcoming board as i think that's going to be well received. i wanted to ask and maybe it's worth the thing. but also in your script and in the press release you talked about long-term shareholder appreciation. and as you may know, given the history, long-term has always been an amorphous kind of an item, and i wanted to look at that up against odilon your weekly sprints that you run in the business. just to understand the sense of timing that everybody has in this whole process? thanks.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yeah, i know. and thank you george for the question, because you just said. i think there is a flaw in the script, because we communicated i think did their own thing. we are here for the short-term, for the middle-term and for the long-term. so it's value creation now, it's value creation also in the long-term. and the -- i think, the most important proof for it is we are going to achieve the rule of 40 for the first time this year. so after you know nine months, now its one year almost that i've been in company. this is going to be the first year ever that the company will achieve the rule 40. so, and that creates value to shareholders, right. i mean, immediate revenue to shareholders. so, yeah, so great catch george. so it is about short, medium and long-term.
george sutton -- craig-hallum capital -- analyst
all right. i really appreciate that clarification. relative to your divestitures, you're talking about the slower growing areas, as you're increasing your investment in the faster growing areas, i'm just curious how are you thinking of the investment of those areas that may or may not be targeted for a potential sale?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so, basically you have areas of high growth, you have areas that are important for us, like billers and issuing and acquiring, that are not going to be growing by double-digits, but we will be growing by mid digits -- by close to mid digits, and we call protect and grow, and we have other divesture areas that we are looking to now, assets that are not strategic. so it is a fine balance on protecting the core areas, but releasing funds to invest heavily on the high areas. just to give you more color about that george, last year through bank, we went through the first i would say, zero-based exercise of the company, and they're real zero base. i was on top of it, scott was very much close to it. and with zero base, the investments of the company and we came from that point to see, ok what do we really need. and that's why, by that time, we were able to find $60 million this year and $75 million next year that we were able to reinvest in the business part of it and part of it i give it to bottom line, so.
george sutton -- craig-hallum capital -- analyst
perfect. i appreciate the thoughts.
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
thanks, george.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer

john kraft -- senior vice president, head of strategy and finance
thank you, and good morning, everyone. today's call, like all of our events, is subject to both safe harbor and forward-looking statements. you can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the sec. on this morning's call is odilon almeida, our president and ceo; and scott behrens, our cfo.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to odilon.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, john. hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. when we discussed our preliminary 2020 results in january, i shared my excitement about our strong performance and reinforces my confidence in the significant value creation potential of aci. today, we'll provide you with a more detailed update on the 2020 results, 2021 outlook and growth initiatives. let me start by providing some additional color on our financial results for 2020. our laser focus on rationalizing costs and maximizing profitability has driven significant year-over-year ebitda growth and net margin improvements, even against the backdrop of covid-19.
we are also pleased to be reaffirming the outlook we provided previously, including the rule of 40 for the first time ever in 2021. in 2020, our revenue grew 3% and our business environment highly affected by the pandemic. our adjusted ebitda grew 17%, and our net adjusted ebitda margin grew more than 450 basis points. we chose our focus on shareholder value creation. further, our consolidated new bookings grew 36%, and in particular, under eve aretakis's management, our demand segment bookings more than doubled. this results positioned the company extremely well to achieve our organic growth goals in the coming years.
turning to our strategic initiatives, we have made excellent headway, advancing the fit for growth, focus on growth and step change value creation initiatives we announced in november. on january 1, we launched our fit for growth organizational plan to become a more nimble and agile company. we have successfully flattened our organizational structure and centralized sales. we are excited about the benefits of this new structure and we are already seeing positive results, including faster decision making and increased responsiveness to our customers. we look forward to continuing to drive efficiency with activity and customer responsiveness through this flatter, linear model.
as part of our focus on growth initiatives, we have been targeting our investment spend on high growth product areas, such as real-time payments, e-commerce with large sophisticated global merchants and fast growing emerging markets. we are on track to meet our goal of increasing sales and marketing investment by 25% and increasing the number of sales associates by 35% in 2021. and we already delivered improved results, demonstrated by our recent bookings wins across the globe with both new customers and contract renewals from existing customers.
notable, q4 deals for our issuing and acquiring solutions include the top u.k. retail bank and the leading japanese international payments brand. in our merchant and e-commerce, we expanded our relationship with a leading european retailer and pharmacy chain, and one of the largest global furniture conglomerates. in the biller space, we signed many new customers, including a large u.s. financial services and insurance company, and a leading u.s. out of finance company, it's american. we also had an important real-time payments win as a result of our new partnership with mastercard. it was our first one to our mastercard alliance, and it happened in peru.
finally, under our third pillar of the strategic plan, we continue to sharpen our focus by evaluating and pursuing opportunities for accretive transactions, and we will undertake a complete review of our business portfolio to maximize aci's growth profile and deliver transformation of long-term value to our shareholders.
i am incredibly proud of the work we are doing, and i'm confident that the new foundation we have built for aci will empower us to deliver continuous profitable organic growth and step change value creation through m&a. with our strong fourth quarter performance and our continued momentum, i am confident that 2021 will be an important milestone year for aci.
in summary, we expect to achieve, for the first time ever, the rule of 40 in 2021 and in parallel, we are actively looking into investments and divestitures to maximize our growth profile and deliver transformational value to our shareholders. before i turn the call over to scott to discuss the financials, i'd like to briefly touch on an announcement we made today. pursuant to an agreement we reached with one of our shareholders, starboard value, our nominating and corporate governance committee, we will work with starboard to identify two new independent directors to be appointed to the aci board in march 2021. this announcement builds on our board's track record of refreshment, following the appointment of two additional independent directors over the past two years. we are pleased to have reached this agreement and expect these new directors will offer fresh and value perspectives as we continue our efforts to maximize profitability and create significant shareholder value.
with that, i will turn it over to scott to discuss the financials. scott?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
thanks, odilon, and good morning, everyone. i first plan to go through our financial results for 2020 and then provide some additional commentary regarding our outlook for 2021. we will then open the line for questions. for the full year 2020, total bookings were up 21%, while new bookings were up 36% compared to 2019. new bookings in our on demand business more than doubled over last year, while new bookings in our on premise license software business declined primarily due to covid-related delays in purchasing decisions by our bank customers, which impacted significantly our license fee revenues.
2020 revenue was $1.29 billion [$1.294 billion], up 3% from 2019, largely due to having a full year speedpay results, offset by declines in non-recurring license fee revenue. recurring revenue grew 10%, significantly above the total company revenue growth, and now represents 76% of total revenue in 2020, up from 71% in 2019. revenue from our on premise business was down 9% in 2020 due to lower non-recurring license revenue from new sales, primarily resulting from covid-related purchasing delays. as you know, our products are mission-critical, so it didn't impact our existing customer renewals, meaning, we are not losing customers, but it did impact license revenue from new sales, in particular, from our bank customers. revenue from our on demand business was up 13% in 2020, primarily due to the contribution from speedpay. in addition, on an organic basis, we saw higher e-commerce volumes and omnichannel merchant payments, helping offset covid-related slowing in certain verticals in our biller solution.
obviously, in 2020, we had little control over the macro-related headwinds impacting the purchasing behaviors of our bank customers and transaction volumes in our biller business, but we were laser-focused on the areas we could control, including profitability and liquidity. our efforts to improve our operational discipline helped generate significant profitability growth in 2020, with adjusted ebitda of $359 million, up 17% from 2019.
consolidated net adjusted ebitda margin expanded to 37%, up from 33% in 2019. and it's important to note that this growth is not just a result of the incremental speedpay contribution, as ebitda also grew on an organic basis. we saw significant profitability improvement in our on demand business from 19% in 2019 to 34% in 2020. we are very pleased with our profitability improvements in our on demand business. and even with the revenue decline in our on premise business, our cost control efforts were able to maintain our 55% margins in 2020, which were in line with 2019.
our ebitda growth contributed to strong cash flow growth in 2020, with cash flow from operating activities of $336 million, up more than double from 2019. and we ended the year with significant liquidity, including $165 million in cash and $444 million available on our revolver. during the year, we paid down $223 million in debt and repurchased 1 million shares of our stock for 2019. we ended the year with $1.2 billion of debt, representing a net debt leverage ratio of 2.8 times.
and finally, turning to our outlook for 2021. while we currently expect covid-19-related headwinds to persist through the first half of 2021, we expect growth to accelerate to the mid-single digits in the second half of the year. for the full year 2021, we expect adjusted ebitda to be in a range of $375 million to $385 million, which assumes net adjusted ebitda margin expansion. this excludes one-time cost related to cost reduction initiatives we discussed at our analyst day in november. for q1 2021, we expect revenue to be in a range of $270 million to $280 million, and adjusted ebitda to be in a range of $25 million to $35 million.
so with that, i will now pass it back over to odilon for some closing comments. odilon?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, scott. in closing, we are pleased with the company's performance in 2020, and look forward to continuing our momentum in 2021. we are well positioned to advance our three-pillar strategy, and we are confident that we will continue to recover within our new organizational structure and increased focus on our higher growing areas. in parallel, we are actually looking into investments and divestitures to maximize our growth profile and deliver transformational long-term value to our shareholders.
i look forward to update you on our progress. we are now happy to take your questions. thank you.

operator
[operator instructions]your first question comes from the line of mayank tandon from needham.
kyle peterson -- btig -- analyst
this is actually kyle peterson on for mayank. thanks for taking the questions. so let's see if i can get an update on, real-time payments. it seems that there's been some pretty healthy growth in the market during the pandemic. how should we think about when some of that increased interest and adoption should start to show up in the p&l, and how we should think about that moving forward?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
yes. kyle, this is scott. well, a lot of the implementations that we've sold over the last call, at 18 months or so, are still in the implementation process. we've sold them with, what i call, kind of a low capacity commitment. so the key is, i guess the question you're asking is when do we start to see, critical mass in terms of adoption of those volumes? i don't think we can predict when that critical mass is going to happen.
but when it does it ultimately show up as license fee revenue and really come in at it a pure margin. once installed, those real-time networks really do not have any incremental fulfillment costs with them. but ultimately when that volume does come, it'll come through as licensed revenue. i would say that we don't necessarily anticipate, say a tipping point in critical mass, say over the next, over the rest of this year, or at least we're not expecting it, but obviously monitoring it in many markets throughout the world.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
and kind of just to compliment, we have a strong pipeline. our agreement with mastercard continue to evolve after the win in peru. so we are very positive about real-time payments.
kyle peterson -- btig -- analyst
got it, that's helpful. and then i guess just, if you guys could provide an update, you guys have been looking at potential m&a opportunities, or kind of evaluating whether there's any businesses that might make sense to prune off, to better position you guys for long-term growth. is there any update on either of those initiatives, right now?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
it's a continuous exercise, kyle, it's part of our third pillar, right? a step-change value-creation through m&a and it includes the divestitures and investments. so we are always considering those and more to come during the year, right?
operator
your next question comes from the line of peter heckmann from davidson.
peter heckman -- davidson -- analyst
morning, everyone. i had a few questions. number one, just on the new reporting methodology for the three vertical industry segments. do you anticipate reporting those on both a license versus subscription basis to help the analysis? or is it just going to be one number that includes everything?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
yes, we'll, disclose that on a, by a fee type.
peter heckman -- davidson -- analyst
okay, great. and do you anticipate putting out an ak or something with the historical numbers for these new breakdowns?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
yes, we will.
peter heckman -- davidson -- analyst
okay, great. and then just, in biller, looking at it, your ex interchange looks like revenue is down about 3% year-over-year. just wanted to see if there were some other factors, potentially, maybe tougher comps with the pandemic, but what's your best guess in terms of when we can see billers start to move into the positive, mid, single-digit growth range?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
pete, i'm very positive about billers. what happened is we saw, a volume upside by the end of the quarter, with the stimulus checks and that continues. so i'm very positive about that, and soon enough, i think we're going to see billers going to the positive part to the positive side.
peter hackman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay great.
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
yes. maybe i, just to add to that, i think that's where, if we look at our q1 overachievement versus what we're expecting, when we went out with q1 guidance. that's really where we saw the uptick, pleasantly surprised with the uptick and transaction volumes that came in the biller segment, in late march. and so that -- and that biller business is all us-based.
so not sure if that uptick was from stimulus, if it was from just the increase in economic activity. but obviously kind of that, the results for q1 and what that means for the rest of year. i think that ultimately gives us more certainty and more confidence, about the recovery and about our outlook for the year.
operator
[operator instructions] your next question comes from the line of george sutton from craig-hallum.
james -- craig-hallum -- analyst
this is james [phonetic] on for george. can you give any incremental color on the progress you've made in converting licensed customers to more of a subscription model? or just sort of how those conversations are progressing?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
yes. again, we're this would be the first year that we introduce that new construct. and so far we haven't had any of those conversions, most did the renewal of business, and that's really where it's targeting the renewal book, is in the second half of the year. and we'll also target net new customers that we are in conversations with, deals that we expect to close even as early as q2. so right now we're in conversation with both existing and new customers, but a lot of the renewal business sits out in the second half of the year.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think, if you look at the pipeline again, we see more deals, they prefers subscription than, one time license. so that is the trend that we are seeing, and we are managing some way that we can keep our guidance and keep growing this company, while we make that conversion. that is our commitment, right?
james -- craig-hallum -- analyst
that's great to hear. and then, in terms of, some of the international growth markets, you've mentioned, sort of trying to put more boots on the ground there, are you at a level where you think you need to be at? in terms of adding reps in those, those markets, or what are you seeing in terms of productivity of those that are up so far?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
james, that's a great question. i just had a meeting last week and we were talking about that, with the teams, the place that i'm not going to save money is boots on the ground. so i'm going to find them handling the company, in any place that we can. so if i need to continue doubling the sales force, i will, without impacting the bottom line.
i see tremendous opportunity to further increase the sales force in asia, pacific for example, and in latin america. and i think that the deficiency of those increases will be very high end and we pay it back very fast. so we continue to invest. we will continue to invest without affecting the bottom line.
james -- craig-hallum -- analyst
great. one more from me, if i could, then i'll hop back in the queue. it's good to see the 22% growth in the merchant segment. do you think that's a sustainable growth rate going forward? and is there anything you're doing strategically that could possibly cause that to accelerate?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
well, yes. we've got a number of initiatives we're working to accelerate. i'd say, that's obviously been the bright spot going back into the end of the pandemic. obviously, it's continued here in q1 and we don't see it slowing down. but yes, there's a number of initiatives going back to last year when we kind of did our zero-base planning process to really, take dollars from lower growth parts of our portfolio, and reinvest. this was the e-commerce merchant omni-commerce was an area that we're reinvesting in. so we expect that to pay dividends.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
i think, just to answer that. that would be fair to say, scott, that also, we have some more savings planned for next year.
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
right. oh, yes. looking back at just the savings that goes back to the growth and ebitda year-over-year, the growth in cashflow a year-over-year. really a lot of the work we did last year in terms of, restructuring the cost base, really sets us up well as we exit the pandemic, and we can layer on that incremental revenue on top of that cost base. but we said going into this year, we had about $60 million of cost savings.
those actions were affected early in the year. there's an incremental, there's certain initiatives that will roll off this yes, and we'll get an incremental full year run rate benefit next year of an additional $15 million. so we'll either redeploy that in investing in areas such as e-commerce or into the sales force and emerging markets, or that'll drop the profitability. but those initiatives are all still on track.
operator
your next question is from the line of peter heckmann from davidson.
peter hackman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, just a couple of follow-ups. so on the new arr metric, that that won't include renewals. but do you anticipate providing a more regular update, like on retention, to give us a feel for net new business?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
yes, we can, if there's any significant changes in retention rates. but i will say on that metric, it's really a sub-component of what was previously our new bookings, but it's just focused on the recurring revenue. and so, if you look out and say, when would this annual recurring revenue expect to, when would we expect it to start to show up in the p&l? our products can go from anywhere to, six month implementation to an 18 month, depending on whether it's, cloud deployed, on premise. so you could probably look at, on average, us start to see a run rate of that into our recurring revenue in probably 12 months or so depending again on the mix.
peter hackman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
got it. okay. and then any thoughts on the ongoing process of the federal reserve here in the us, looking to build their own platform for fednow, for real-time payments? can you talk a little bit about how aci is working with the fed on that?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yes. no, we are very involved peter, thanks for the question. we are very involved. we are very involved though around the globe, in every and each real-time payment initiative and the united states is no different. as you know, i mean, united states is lagging behind the rest of the other markets around the globe or the main markets like india, malaysia, uk, even brazil now.
so -- but we are very positive about that. we are working very close to the fed about that, on the fednow initiative. we have even people from our company sitting on the board of the initiative today and we are very part of it. so our plan is to be very, very engaged.
peter hackman -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay, great. we'll look forward to additional commentary there. i mean, is that something that appears that it's on relative track for late 2023, early 2024 type roll-outs?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
it is. i think, look, real-time payments is irreversible, right? i mean, this is something that com -- that's where -- that's the rail that's going to be growing, a good like, more than 45% next year. so you can expect the real-time payments growing around the globe, 40 plus for the next years.
and again, united states is no different. the united states understands that you have already initiatives like cell, but i think the more, this is taking more time, as i said than the rest of the countries. but when it comes, it will come really strong. so i'm very positive about that. i think we're going to see a revolution in real-time payments in the next five years in united states.

good day, and thank you for standing by. welcome to the aci q1 earnings announcement. [operator instructions] [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, mr. john kraft. please go ahead, sir.
john kraft -- vice president-investor relations and strategic
thank you, and good morning, everyone. today's call, like all of our events, is subject to both safe harbor and forward-looking statements. you can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today. the copy of which is available on our website as well as with the sec. on this morning's call is odilon almeida, our president and ceo; and scott behrens our cfo.
with that, i'd like to turn the call over to odilon.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, john. hello everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. when we last spoke in february, we discussed our strong q4 results and that our 3-pillar strategy was progressing and already making the difference. today, i'm happy to report another strong quarter with results coming in, above our expectations.
let me start by providing some color on our financial results. as expected and unlike q1 last year, q1 this year was impacted by covid-19 related headwinds. despite of these headwinds, we were very pleased with our results and execution against our 3-pillar strategic plan. our q1 revenue of $285 million was down slightly versus previous year, but came in above our forecasted guidance range. importantly, our recurring revenue grew 1%, adjusted ebitda in the quarter was $45 million up 19%, which was also above the high end of our guidance.
our net adjusted ebitda margin was 23%, which despite the revenue reduction was up 400 base points from last year, as we remain focused on cost management and profitability. for the full year, we're reaffirming our guidance and as previously discussed, we expect to reach the rule of 40 this year, for the first time ever. we had some exciting new wins in the quarter, across all segments. note, we are pleased to sign a new speed pay deal with cascade financial, a home loan finance company, which we will allow cascade's customers to benefit from more ways to pay their mortgage, including via mobile wallet, using our wallet room application.
we are also increasing our focus on securing with large, sophisticated and global merchants. in the quarter, we signed a new deal with red lobster to consolidate their payment infrastructure to one vendor, for both, their in-store and e-commerce businesses, creating a similar payment experience across all channels. we also signed a notable contract with a middle eastern payments facilitator, for our omni-channel commerce solution. in europe, we signed an acquire agnostic e-commerce contract with a new uk based payment service provider.
in the banking sector, we signed a new real-time contract with stax, the largest ach processor in france as well as an expansionary contract with union bank of india. importantly, we are hearing positive feedback from our customers that we affirmed the benefits of our new fit-for-growth organizational structure, which has allowed for faster decision-making and increased responses.
while we anticipate headwinds resulting from covid related delays to continue through q2, our strong first quarter results reaffirmed my confidence in our business. as we progress on our strategy, amid an improving economic outlook. we anticipate a strong second half performance. in addition to organic value creation, we continue to make progress on a complete strategic reveal of our business portfolio to enhance aci's growth profile and maximize long-term value to our shareholders.
with that, i will turn it over to scott to discuss the financials. scott?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
thanks odilon and good morning everyone. i first plan to go through our financial results for q1, and then provide some additional commentary regarding our outlook for the rest of 2021. we'll then open the line for questions. as we discussed at our analyst day, last november, we are introducing a new booking symmetric that we hope will be easier for investors to interpret, and be more helpful in allowing you all to compare our results on an apples to apples basis, and model the financial impact going forward.
the metric also more closely aligns us with industry standards and peer practices and importantly, the metric better aligns with our focus on growing recurring revenue. as you know, driving recurring revenue is one of our strategic priorities. the bookings metric is called annual recurring revenue or arr from new sales. and it's defined as the annual revenue expected to be generated from new bookings in the quarter. so new accounts, new applications, and add-on sale contract signed in the quarter. in q1 2021, ar was $10 million, which is down compared to q1 last year, as last year's arr bookings were unaffected by covid-19. the covid-19 related headwinds really started hitting us in q2 last year. so while q1 was a tough comparison this year, comparison should ease up going forward.
recurring revenue is up 1% to $246 million while total revenue came in at $285 million, which was down 2% from q1 in 2020, again, due to the tougher covid related comparisons. we saw strong growth on adjusted ebitda in the quarter, which increased 19%, $45 million compared to $38 million in q1 2020. our net adjusted ebitda margin increased to 23% in the quarter, compared to 19% in q1 2020, as you see the year-over-year benefits of our cost reduction initiatives, as we continue to focus on profitability and drive toward achieving the rule of 40.
also new going forward, will be the reporting of our operating segments, which we believe provides increased transparency to our analysts and investors. we are going to report revenue and adjusted ebitda separately for each of our three target markets of merchants, billers, and banks. this aligns us closer to how we manage our operations and differs from the previous delivery based reporting segments of on-premise and on-demand. in q1, our merchant segment revenue grew 22% to $39 million, and merchant segment adjusted ebitda more than doubled increasing 129%.
in our billers segment, revenue declined 2% to $151 million, while billers segment adjusted ebitda actually increased 13%. our bank segment, which continues to be hardest hit by the covid pandemic, revenue decreased 9% to $96 million while banks segment adjusted ebitda decreased 12%. we also saw a strong cash flow from operations, which were up 22%, $70 million. aci ended the quarter with $185 million in cash on hand and $459 million available on our credit facility.
we paid down $25 million in debt in the quarter, and we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of debt representing a net debt leverage ratio of 2.6 times. turning to our outlook for the rest of 2021, we expect covid-19 related headwinds to persist through the first half of the year and for growth to accelerate to the mid-single digits in the second half of the year. for the full year 2021, we continue to expect adjusted ebitda to be in a range of $375 million to $385 million. i will add here, that we are comfortable with where full year street consensus for revenue and ebitda are lining up. and finally, for q2, we expect revenues to be in a range of $295 million to $305 million and adjusted ebitda on a range of $50 million to $60 million.
with that, i will now pass it over to odilon for some closing comments. odilon?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, scott. in closing, we are pleased with the company's performance in the first quarter, as aci's focus on dedication continues to pay off. we look forward to accelerating our momentum during the second half of 2021, as we continue ramping our strategy and as the economic outlook improves. this will enable us to achieve the rule of 40, for the first year ever. we remain confident that we will deliver transformational, long-term value to our shareholders.
with that, operator, we are ready to open the line for questions.
",2021-Q1,ACIW
,0.95535,,,":
operator
[operator instructions] and the first question comes from peter heckmann from d.a. davidson.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
hey, good morning everyone. thanks for taking my question. i was wondering, could you go through some of the things that may not be evident in the press release that you talked about increasing your confidence in revenue acceleration in the back half, don't really see it in like the arr bookings number. so can you talk about maybe some contracts that you've signed since the quarter closed or some larger software deals that have either closed or you think are imminent that are giving you that confidence?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. i think, thank you for the question, peter. i'd like to start saying what i've been talking to the ceos of banks around the globe. there are those countries that are just getting back to the table finally. and i'm seeing those new logos, lots of deals that we have been discussing for a good period of time that will definitely come to closure, within q3 and q4. more in q4 than q3, i would say, that's what we're shooting for. so that's one part of the confidence i have. and the second point is we have a big backlog of renewals in q4, very considerable. so you put those two together, and i feel very confident about q4. pete, let me give some insight. this is the fourth quarter that we delivered what we said we will deliver. and that's part of the culture here. so we have like plan a, b and c for the numbers that you see in q3 and q4. so i'm very, very confident about those.
scott w. behrens -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
yes. i think, pete, i think the only thing i'd add to that is if you recall at our investor day last november, we said that we were, we had taken some structural cost reductions, but we were reinvesting pretty heavily into the go to market and particularly, the sales organization. so we started that ramp up late last year, early part of this year, spent the first half really not only hiring but really building out that pipeline. and if you actually look a little kind of peel back on the q2 arr growth, we actually started seeing a pickup in north america. north america was actually up 6% in q2, that was offset by declines in the international markets more impacted still by covid. but started to see that spending pick up in q2, had a new logo win in the quarter in the u.s., had a major wires transformation projects sold to one of our customers in canada. so the spending certainly picked up in north america. but based on our pipeline, we're comfortable that what we're seeing in the second half of this year is arr growth that should come in, in the high single digits growth over the second half 2020. and that, combined with, as odilon said, the renewal book that we have. and again, those are just, those are contracts that renew this year pretty heavily. some of them have already signed. it's just that you have to wait until the new term period begins to recognize it. that's going to, that's why we were comfortable putting out the revenue range for the year. and that if you do the implied growth there, second half revenue growth over the second half of 2020 is projected to be somewhere between 6% and 8%. so i think it goes back really to the investments we're making in go to market. that's driving the pipeline that started to drive arr bookings in the second quarter. and we're comfortable with what we're seeing here in the second half from both that pipeline that's been developed as well as the renewal book in the second half to get to that 6% to 8% second half growth.
peter heckmann -- d.a. davidson -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and just maybe a housekeeping question, but it looked like interchange took a big jump in the quarter year over year. i think that was related to the anniversarying of the cfa deal. just curious how that, why that happened?
scott w. behrens -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
no. actually, it was the movement in the tax filing deadline from q3 to q2. and so that's the federal and state taxes that moved into the second quarter. most of the, that's generally a pretty high interchange business for us. i would say, at the net revenue level and at the ebitda level, that tax business is essentially breakeven. so it brings in gross revenue, it brings an interchange, but doesn't really impact us much the net revenue or ebitda level.
operator
our next question comes from george sutton from craig-hallum.
george sutton -- craig-hallum -- analyst
hey guys, good quarter. thanks for taking my question, this is james on for george. so obviously, the renewal activity sounds like you have a lot of confidence in sort of the stronger q4 compared to what you normally see. just kind of curious on your thoughts on some of the other segments as well? and how those might contribute to strength into the back half?
scott w. behrens -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
well, yes, i would say, i wouldn't look at necessarily q4's renewal. i think it's, yes, i think if you look back at our history, a lot of it sits in the fourth quarter on the license side of the business. and so that drives license fee, and that comes in at pretty high margin. there's not a whole lot of incremental fulfillment costs that comes with that license fee on a renewal. but on the rest of the business, again, it's in terms of the pipeline health that we're seeing as we hit the midpoint of the year. and so i'd say, the confidence in the full year revenue and in particular, the fourth quarter is the combination of that size of that renewal book as well as the progress on the pipeline.
george sutton -- craig-hallum -- analyst
got it. and then on the expansion of your relationship with microsoft, i guess could you go into some detail there? sort of what does that allow you to do that you couldn't have done before? or what's changed there?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer and director
sure, george. it's good to talk to you. so i think i could start about the fundamentals of our offering in the cloud. we, today, i would say to you that we are cloud enabled. so we have a very competitive service in the cloud, which has been with a high win rate. and as you can see from the examples that we gave around the globe. but i think we can do much better. i think this is evolving very fast. technology has evolving very fast. so this conversation and this agreement with microsoft, first of all, is about innovation. it's about bringing to the market what the market doesn't have. and that's why [indecipherable] so successful. that's what we did with base24, a long period of time ago and with lots of other softwares, and we want to continue that treasurtory.
i mean we are not here just to fulfill the legacy needs of our clients, we are here to innovate, and really bring to the table things that are not there. so i think that's number one. number one is, it's a hub of innovation. it's about hub of of creating offerings that don't exist in the market today. so that's number one. number two is go to market. it's a very strong go to market like talking to clients together, and really selling together to the most important banks and facilitating those banks. i have been talking to the ceo of big banks around the globe and everybody talk about digital transformation, everybody talks about moving to the cloud. but i'm not saying that they are lost, but i would say they need help, they need direction. and i think aci and microsoft is better than clone. so i think that's the second part of it. and the third part is we are co-investing in all of this. so we are co-investing in the market. we are co-investing on the development of those softwares and so forth. so i think those are the three pillars. and we are very, very enthusiastic about that. i think this is one of the most important alliances that we, you're going to hear from us in the next years. and i can tell you that because the future is cloud. and i think microsoft will be a wonderful partner.
george sutton -- craig-hallum -- analyst
got it. and then just one more, if i could. so in that press release, i mean, you talked about a win with a leading digital bank, banking as a service player in latin america. could you sort of just go into, i guess, what pain points you're helping them solve were these competitive deals? and i guess, any feedback that you've gotten from them so far around why aci?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. i think number one, because they know we know how to scale. so you'll talk, for example, to those companies, those start-ups. i mean they're very hyped, they're very fast there and they're very nimble. but the question is, can you scale to a big contract without giving you the name? like we are helping a global bank, and we have a launch like two or three countries already, going to the fourth country now in the cloud in latin america. and we keep doing that, and they are not concerned about our possibility of scale. and so i think that's what we bring to the table number one. it's our brand, our, we know how to do, how to move big amount of transactions, a big amount of money. and our clients know that. i think that's number one. i think number two is also our presence. let me give an insight here, why i'm so confident about our sales force. we brought the head of the international markets, a new head of the international markets in the beginning of the year, and we have a whole new team in latin america, for example, the head of latin america, the head of brazil, the head of other countries also. so it's not only about the structure and increasing sales, we are now qualifying sales. we are bringing the best executives of the market, and we are starting to see the results of this. so i think you put all of those things together, and that's why we're so positive about the second half.
operator
our next question comes from mayank tandon from needham & company.
mayank tandon -- needham & company -- analyst
this is actually kyle peterson on for mayank. so i just wanted to touch on the sg&a leverage. it's been really impressive here. and you guys have been able to keep driving those higher and get more kind of lean and mean. is there any more room or efficiencies left to extract? or is this like a run rate that you guys think you need really to drive like new product growth and stronger like arr moving forward?
scott w. behrens -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
well, i think if you look at across the various cost line items, we, you'll see that the selling and marketing expense, in particular, is up over last year. i think a lot of the other areas, we, as a part of the cost exercise we did last year, those are areas where we where we took cost out and we reinvested pretty heavily in the selling and marketing area. so i would say that, yes, i think this is, we've invested heavily in starting this year. we'll probably get even, i would say, we probably get a little bit higher run rate on selling and marketing expense going forward. but i think what you're seeing in terms of the r&d selling and marketing and g&a, is a pretty good run rate of cost structure. but i'd say, if you look at it year-over-year, you're seeing the dynamics of where we zero based our cost structure and where we're reinvesting in sales and growth.
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer and director
yes. i think scott, that wold be fair to say that we, last year, we improved margin by 600 basis points. and now what we're saying is that we're going to continue to increase margin, but it's going to be more like 50 basis points a year, right? i mean something more...
scott w. behrens -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
more of a function at this point really of layering on that incremental revenue on top of that cost base. so i think we've got a pretty good cost structure that we can scale.
mayank tandon -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. that's good color. and then maybe if you could just remind us on some of the priorities around capital allocation. i know it seems like you guys nibbled at the buyback and paid down some debt. but like, how would you guys kind of rank order, whether it's buybacks, m&a or like reducing leverage? like how do you guys think about kind of those different priorities here?
scott w. behrens -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
yes. i don't know if i'd rank order them per se. obviously, in the quarter, we got in and bought one million shares. i think historically, we've been pretty disciplined with kind of one by three of our cash flow on debt service, one by three on share buybacks and one by three on tuck-in type acquisitions. obviously, as we exit this year, i know we've said for a long time, our targeted leverage is 2.5 times. at midyear, we're at 2.8. we probably exit the year somewhere around 2.3, 2.4. so obviously, deploying that cash is going to those, we're getting more flexible in terms of the deployment of that cash. obviously, over the last 18 months, it was really focused on delivering. but we're certainly getting more flexible in terms of how we deploy that cash going forward. but obviously, in the quarter, we were in about one million shares.
operator
our next question comes from mike del grosso from compass point.
mike del grosso -- compass point -- analyst
most have been asked and answered. but i wanted to ask a higher level one on your third pillar, odilon, step change value creation through m&a. can you provide any progress on this pillar specifically? and then i guess, you talk about accretive m&a. what are some of the criteria? and specifically, when you talk about accretion, are you talking to eps or to revenue growth or ebitda? i guess just a refresh there would be helpful.
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer and director
sure, mike. sure. i think this third pillar is about our, it's about our communication to investors how friendly we are about value creation and how prioritize value creation to our investors. so we are very open. again, i'm talking about [indecipherable], i'm talking about bios parts of our portfolio. and we are actively looking to that. i don't have anything to announce today. but i can tell you that i do have lots of things on my table, and i have them, it's part of my day today. and i can tell you that we are going to be very active in this third pillar going forward. we have not been able to announce anything yet, but there is a lot of work. and i want to communicate that very clear to our investors, so there are no surprises, right, when that happens. but what you can expect is, i don't believe in buy and promise, i believe in buying and showing. so what you're going to see is if we buy, when we buy, if we sell when we sell, it will be highly accretive to our shareholders in the first moment, and that's what we are working for.
mike del grosso -- compass point -- analyst
okay. and then when you say accretive, i guess, just do you mean to growth? or what are some of the specific items you're looking at when you need to fine accretion?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer and director
i would say value creation. so could be ebitda right away, could be top line growth, but should create value right away.
operator
our next question comes from joseph vafi from canaccord genuity.
joseph vafi -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
could you give just, i guess, a real-time update on real-time payments in the u.s. and then globally. and then secondly, it was intrigued with the fintech win and clearly, historically, aci has done a lot of work with established businesses. and how you see the broader fintech opportunity for the company moving forward as a growth driver?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you so much for the question. you really give me the line here to talk to you about the big change that we are seeing. we are not, i would say that in [indecipherable] intermediate areas, if you look backwards we were positioned in the past. we have this very solid offering, like base24, the aci issuing and acquiring very solid offering to our current customers, big banks around the globe and so forth. what we have been changing and microsoft to accelerate that now a big, big time. we are positioning ourselves for this new generation of fintechs. and i can talk about, you about the banks in brazil. digital banks in brazil, they're like four years old. i can talk to you about other fintechs that are just starting and scaling like raising real-time payments. and we are being very competitive, and now winning rate is pretty good on those offers in the cloud in azure. so i think that growth going forward, if you think about our cash flow, our cash flow will continue to be with the big banks. and we don't have a lot of attrition, they will continue with us. but growth will come from the fintechs, growth will come from the modernization of the banks. and in that case, we need to offer the products of the future, not the products of the past. and that's why the microsoft alliance is so important, and that's what you're starting to see now. the microsoft alliance went step further now. like we went to the, i would say, end game with our alliance now, we are very much together. but we have been working with microsoft for the last two or three years, and you're seeing the result of it. now with this fintech, with the real-time payments in indonesia and so forth, right? so i'd like to repeat that, joe, it's all about cloud, and it's all about aci now positioning itself on the future instead of in the past, right? so scott?
scott w. behrens -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
yes. i think the only thing i'd add to that is, yes, i think q2 is an example of a key win in the central infrastructure in indonesia. and i look at that one very similar to the malaysia where we power the central infrastructure there and also the bank connectivity. i mean those are not big revenue producers in the quarter. but really, it's critical to be a part of that infrastructure as it's being implemented in these markets. and then once it's implemented, it's really waiting for the transaction volume growth. but it's absolutely critical. that's why we highlighted that win, being a part of both the central infrastructure as well as the connectivity of the banks. it's really laying the infrastructure for that future growth in real time. so i think q2 is a prime example in the highlight of the central bank of indonesia, is a key win for us.
operator
and we have no further questions at this time. i will now turn the call back over to john kraft for closing remarks.

welcome to the aci worldwide, inc. second quarter 2021 financial results conference call. my name is sylvia, and i'll be operator for today's call. [operator instructions] i will now turn the call over to john kraft. mr. kraft, you may begin.
john kraft -- vice president of investor relations and strategic analysis
thank you, and good morning, everyone. today's call, like all of our events, is subject to both safe harbor and forward looking statements. you can find the full text of both statements on the first and final pages of our presentation deck today, a copy of which is available on our website as well as with the sec. on this morning's call is odilon almeida, our president and ceo; and scottbehrens, our cfo. before i hand it over, please note, aci will be attending the wells fargo fintech and technology services forum and the canaccord annual growth conference, august 11 and 12 as well as the needham virtual fintech and digital transformation conference, august 18. with that, i'd like to turn the call over to odilon.
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, john. hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. when we last spoke in may, we discussed our strong first quarter performance and share updates on our progress, executing on our three pillar strategy. today, i'm happy to report another solid quarter. in q2, we delivered results at the high end of our expectations with revenue of $302 million and adjusted ebitda of $60 million. importantly, our recurring revenue was $250 million in q2, an increase of 7% year over year with positive recurring revenue growth in all three segments. i'm pleased to report increasing strength in our global sales organization. in the quarter, we recorded key wins in all three segments. these wins included an impressive list of new logos. let me share some highlights. in our banking segment, we expanded our relationship with a major canadian bank. we will consolidate their global wire processing and to aci's real time payment solutions in the cloud, creating a single functionally rich ecosystem. we also contracted with a well-known u.s. based financial technology disruptor with plans to move their issuing business to the cloud. in addition, we secured a real time payments win with the central bank of indonesia. this comes up to nearly two years of work, and is an important win for aci that cements our growing lead in the real time market in asia. in our merchant segment, we secured important wins, including a deal with a leading fuel and travel operator to upgrade their point of sale operations to aci's omnicommerce software. finally, in our biller segment, we signed several very large contracts, including one significant competitive win. this customer plans to use our alternative payment channels and benefit from our solutions ability to offer lease cost routing. moving to another topic. i'm excited to announce that aci expanded our collaboration with microsoft, forming a global alliance to deliver best in class payment solutions in the cloud. the agreement to expand and accelerate aci's cloud offerings, and we allow both companies to capitalize on growing global demand from financial institutions, driving toward digital modernization.
the alliance strength is how aci and microsoft cooperate in key areas, including go-to-market and customer onboarding. it also creates pathways to power innovation. our growing pipeline, combined with an improving broader economy, provide us with increasing confidence that we are well positioned to drive growth and deliver strong and accelerating performance in the second half of 2021 and beyond. we remain laser focused on continuing to build a robust pipeline that will support our long-term growth objectives. importantly, we expect to achieve the rule 40 in 2021 for the first year ever. we remain actively engaged in the review of our business portfolio and m&a opportunities to ensure we are maximizing short and long term value creation to our shareholders. with that, i will turn it over to scott to discuss the financials. scott?
scott w. behrens -- executive vice president, chief financial officer and chief administrative officer
thanks, odilon, and good morning, everyone. i first plan to go through our financial results for q2 and then provide some additional commentary regarding our outlook for the rest of the year. we'll then open the line for questions. as odilon mentioned, we've delivered results at the higher end of our expectations. recurring revenue grew 7% to $250 million in q2 and was 83% of our total revenue, up from 78% in q2 last year. and importantly, recurring revenue was up in all three of our segments compared to q2 last year. total revenue was $302 million in the quarter, which was up 1% over last year. adjusted ebitda in the quarter of $60 million, was down from $78 million in q2 last year. the one thing to point out here, more of our license fee revenue from in year renewals will come in the second half of this year compared to 2020, and that's just based on the timing of the contract expirations for those contracts that renewed this year. and as a reminder, those license fees come with very high flow through to ebitda as well. so looking at our three segments.
in our banking segment, which has been the most impacted by covid-19 related purchasing delays, we saw recurring revenue growth of 2%, with recurring revenue representing 56% of its segment revenue compared to 50% for q2 last year. adjusted ebitda in our banking segment was down in q2 due to the decline in non recurring license revenue. and again, that will pick up here in the second half. in our merchant segment, we saw recurring revenue growth of 5%, with recurring revenue representing 95% of its segment revenue compared to 91% in q2 last year. adjusted ebitda in our merchant segment improved 2% compared to q2 last year. and finally, in our biller segment, which is entirely recurring revenue. we saw recurring revenue increased 9% from q2 last year, and adjusted ebitda increased 1% compared to q2 last year. as we've been discussing, this year, we introduced a new bookings metric, annual recurring revenue from new contracts signed in the quarter or arr. this quarter, new arr was $18 million, down from $22 million in q2 last year. we actually saw a new arr rebound in north america in q2, delivering 6% growth over q2 last year, offset by declines in our international markets. as odilon mentioned, as we begin to see the international covid-19 related headwinds dissipate and we see the overall improving business environment, we're confident that new arr and revenue growth will accelerate in the second half of this year. aci ended the quarter with $146 million in cash on hand and $474 million available on our credit facility after paying down $25 million in debt in the quarter. we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of debt, representing a net debt leverage ratio of 2.8 times.
and i'll just say here, we are very pleased with the pace we've been able to delever following the speedpay acquisition, and expect to be back at or below our targeted 2.5 times leverage exiting 2021. and also of note here, we've repurchased one million shares of our stock during the quarter. and finally, as we look ahead to the outlook for the rest of 2021, we are increasingly confident that we'll see new arr and revenue growth accelerate in the second half of the year with particular strong results in q4 as we end the year. so with that, we are introducing revenue guidance for the full year 2021 with expectations to generate full year revenue in the range of $1.335 billion to $1.345 billion. we are reiterating our adjusted ebitda expectations of a range of $375 million to $385 million. and for q3, we expect revenue to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million and ebitda to be in a range of $70 million to $80 million. with that, i will now pass it back over to odilon for some closing comments. odilon?
odilon almeida -- president, chief executive officer and director
thanks, scott. i'd like to reiterate that q2 was another strong quarter with results coming in at the high end of our expectations. we expect considerable growth acceleration in the second half and especially in q4 this year. we are extremely happy with the prospect of delivering the rule of 40 for the first year ever in 2021. in closing, we would like to leave you with three takeaways: number one, with the implementation of our two strategic pillars, fit for growth and focus on growth, we are starting to generate and will continue to generate healthy and predictable organic profitable growth; number two, with our third pillar, transformational growth through m&a, we remain actively engaged in the review of our business portfolio and m&a opportunities; number three, our ultimate objective remains quite clear, aci worldwide will create transformational short and long term value to its shareholders. we will now open the call for questions. operator?

[operator instructions] we have our first question, comes from the line of pallav saini from canaccord genuity.your line is open please go ahead.
pallav saini -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thanks good morning everyone thanks for taking the question. odilon, you're clearly getting some good results from your recent sales hires. how do you feel about your go-to-market infrastructure now? is there more to be done here? or all the pieces are in place from your perspective? and how do you feel about your pipeline going into 2022. and i have a follow-up.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yes. thank you, pallav. thank you for the question. there's still a lot to be done, let me start there. but we have done a lot already. so we have changed the leadership. we have brought new leadership to the company. also, for example, the head of the international markets, we have a very high talented executive called mandy that is now managing the u.s. and canada. we have changed the whole team in latin america, some leaders across the globe. and that continues, i think. that refinement continues. what i can tell you is that i'm very satisfied with the results so far. we have never had this amount of pipeline. and for example, in bill payments, seeing like 30% of our pipeline, which is a record, already coming from the new hires shows that, that is working. so i'm very happy to what i see now. but there is still a lot to be done.
pallav saini -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
thank you got it. and congratulations on your partnership with affirm. can you give some additional color on this partnership, maybe the timing of implementation? and when should we expect to see some contribution from this deal? thank you.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
sure, pallav. so you're referring to the educational vertical, right?
pallav saini -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
yes -- deposits with that -- with affirm, i believe?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
by now pay later.
pallav saini -- canaccord genuity -- analyst
the buy now pay later, yes.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yes. no, i think we are very happy about this partnership. but thanks i think that it put us in the middle of the revolution, right, of again now and pay later. and basically, we're going to be the software enabling their payment system. and that shows -- and that's -- and thanks again for the question. that shows that we are the solution, yes, for those very important and big banks around the globe, but we are also the solution for this new fintech and new payment system is coming around the globe. so we are very linked to the innovation overall. i think that's why we are mentioning this deal, right?
operator
our next question comes from the line of mayank tandon from needham & company. your line is open please go ahead.
sam -- needham & company -- analyst
hey guys good morning. this is actually sam [phonetic] on for mayank today thanks for taking my question. so my first question is -- i was just curious if you guys could provide a little bit more color on having 99% of the 2021 guided revenue signed? is everything signed and committed to be delivered before year-end? or are there any deals that could potentially slip to the first few weeks of january?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
good morning, this is scott. i think the answer to that is the reason we put out the confidence, sam, is because most of that is under contract. it's going to be license fee. q4 is traditionally a very large quarter for us in terms of sales and renewals. but what we really saw, i'd say, in the third quarter has set us up well for fourth quarter revenue. and i say that because if you look back at q2, we started to see the sales really pick up in north america. i haven't seen it yet in the rest of the world, sales picked up in north america, particularly north american banks.
in q3, we saw a much broader strength in our sales. north america continued to be strong, doubled over last year, but much broader in banks, merchants and billers, but also saw a doubling of sales in our region. so i would say that success in sales in q3 has really set us up here early in the fourth quarter to deliver that revenue. i would say we're pretty comfortable at that 96% for q4, 99% on the year. what's left, there's a number of paths in terms of it's renewals and/or new business, a number of paths to get to that. so not particularly concerned about deal slippage. that's why we put out the high percentage of -- really to demonstrate our confidence in delivering it.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
sam, just to add to what scott is saying. i heard a comment from a sales leader that really gives a lot of color to it. the sales leader came to me and said, this is the first time in my career at aci that we start to work in the next year during q4 of the year. and that shows the change and how different this company is, right?
sam -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. that's super helpful. and it's great to hear. and then just a quick follow-up. i was wondering if we could just get an update on growth within the real-time payments? and were there any notable wins in that segment this quarter?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
yes, we did. we actually had a -- we actually had a, call it win back. it's an existing customer but had moved some of their modernization upgrades to a competitor and brought them back on a win back here this quarter, and that was one that odilon mentioned. so we saw pretty good strength in real-time revenue in the quarter. and a lot of that is comes from a license fee. so you'll see that we'll disclose in our 10-q here later today that you'll see real-time revenues up pretty strong over last year.
operator
our next question comes from the line of george sutton from craig hallum. your line is open please go ahead.
george sutton -- craig hallum -- analyst
thank you odilon, that was a very larry-ellison-like list of wins in the quarter, so congratulations on that. i wondered if you could talk about a couple of things you said in the prepared comments. you mentioned that you're seeing a speeding up of decision-making from customers. that, of course, was one of the big questions when you said you were going to meaningfully expand the sales force. so i just wondered if you could identify that sped up process a little bit? and then also relative to your this disciplined approach to deploying capital. can you just talk about the product road map, the r&d process, sort of what has changed there? is it just a more focused process? are you developing product and upgrading product differently? i just wanted to get clarity on that. and that's it for me. thank you.
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, george. yes, we -- i think we spent a good amount of time talking about deals, and i'm very proud of it. i'd love to do that. so to your first question about speed up in the decision-making, i think i can give you an example. i was talking to a ceo of top four bank in u.s. and i was explaining to the ceo that before this change, i had like five levels between myself and the account representative. now i have only two levels. and that's how the change happens. so i'm involved, and i know in my position what is happening with the most important clients, which never happened also before.
and that expedites decision because when you have much fewer layers, the layers the front players get much more empowered. and the clients have been telling us that, like we are coming with new conversations like long-term value like we want to be together for the next 10 years. it's not about the revenue of this quarter. and all of that conversation is happening today. and i think a good reason and an important reason because it is happening is because we don't have that amount of layers anymore. so i think that's for the first question. scott, do you want to get the second one?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
yes, i think there was -- i think kind of two parts on that, george. one was our r&d and the other's on our capital deployment. on r&d, last year, on the focus on growth initiatives that we went through, we really zero-based our r&d spend. and so we didn't -- we aren't spending less or more per se, but we're redeploying that to where we can get the most optimized return on that r&d over the next one to three years. so i'd say that was a different approach. the focus on the r&d is really modernization. and that's one thing we're going to be talking about here in a couple of weeks at our analyst day to provide what those modernization strategies are by each of our segments. and then kind of on the capital deployment, i don't know if that's the same as the r&d question, but our capital deployment model really hasn't changed. it's consistent with what we've done in the past. but again, we'll have some further updates on that here in a couple of weeks at our analyst day.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from the line of mark palmer from btig. your line is open please go ahead.
mark palmer -- btig -- analyst
yes thank you. had a question on your -- kind of regard to the step change in value creation via m&a and the fact that you're reviewing your portfolio. can you give a little bit more color along those lines? and would that involve selling parts of the portfolio buying parts of the portfolio are both on the table?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
yes. no, thank you, mark, for the question. yes, i'd like to start to say that the value creation through m&a is not an extrinsic part of our strategy, right? it's not something that happens by this side. that is intrinsic part of our strategy, is our third pillar. so we are doing that all the time. i've been spending a significant amount of my time looking at possibilities of divesture and investor. we are talking about anything that builds and maximize shareholder value in the short and long term. so we are open to anything that, when you put the math together, maximize shareholder value. can we sell can be by, can be part of the portfolio can be by part of the portfolio, and we are analyzing that all the time, right?
operator
and there are no more further questions at this time. john, please continue.

odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, john. hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. i will summarize by saying that we are pleased with our progress to date, the results we are seeing and confident in delivering our full year financial commitments. we now expect organic revenue growth of 5% and ebitda growth of 6% to 7% in 2021. this organic revenue growth is well above the past trends. as a result, we are raising our 2021 guidance. and importantly, we are on track to deliver the rule of 40 this year for the first time. i would like to share more details on how we have been moving our 3-pillar strategy from design and implementation to delivery of results. starting with our first pillar, fit for growth. in 2020, we launched a new strategy to transform the aci organization. we call it fit for growth.
that work was all about rethinking how we approach our business, streamlining our structure, sharpening our go-to-market strategy and getting us ready to take the next steps in our evolution. in an environment of pressures from the covid pandemic, we focused on cost discipline and profitability improvement. by year-end 2020, we implemented a new and optimized organizational structure to streamline internal processes, making the company leaner and more efficient. in doing so, we achieved $60 million in annual savings. these actions helped us grow adjusted ebitda by 17% and increased our net adjusted ebitda margin by more than 450 basis points in 2020.
we're encouraged by this growth in 2020. this growth has occurred in a challenging year where most of our customers were contending with the covid pandemic. but fit for growth is also about our customers. we have worked to ensure customers remain at the center of what we do at aci. we streamlined our organization to enable those closest to the action to make decisions, which was the goal of our new structure. customers are telling us our efforts to simplify have sped up decision making. in establishing a new commercial function, we significantly increased our sales force, feet on the street presence. this group represents most of our customer-facing roles, and is already generating success. for example, roughly 1/3 of our bill payment segment pipeline originates from recently hired salespeople.
our robust and energized sales force now has more urgency to deepen relationships and build continuity with customers. with a more empowered workforce that can work more directly with customers, the result is a faster time to market while elevating our customer experience. we increased our sales and market investments significantly. along with these investments, we also implemented a disciplined and analytic approach to deploy our capital strategically. it means our product strategy aligns with high-return areas. as we near the end of 2021, these efforts are showing results, and we're increasingly optimistic about our future growth prospects. moving to our second pillar, focus on growth. we have continued investing in our customers' digital transformation as they modernize their payment systems.
our priorities such as cloud, real-time and last mile technologies are also priorities of our customers. we also converged our merchant platforms, allowing customers to leverage the combination of e-commerce and point of sale. our integrated solutions bring together online gateway, fraud management and omnicommerce capabilities into an integrated solution. at the highest level, our three focus on growth initiatives are: real-time payments covering both low and high value real time as well as investments in last mile, sophisticated global merchants with focus on innovation in omni and e-commerce. emerging growth markets, specifically across latin america, the middle east, africa, asia and south pacific. when you take all these efforts together, you begin to see what we are doing differently. we have a targeted strategy, and we also have the organizational structure and culture alignment to win.
we are firing on all cylinders and are now seeing the results. our sales efforts produced consolidated net new arr bookings up 50% from the third quarter of 2020. as we mentioned last quarter, covid pressures dissipated earlier in the north american market and third quarter arr in the americas nearly doubled from last year. we are seeing improvements in international markets, although these areas are still soft. our q3 revenue and ebitda were both once again within the range we provide you. to date, in 2021, we have signed 96% of our expected revenue for the fourth quarter or of the guided revenue for the full year. this progress to date is considerably above previous years. we are confident in our expectation for accelerated organic and recurring revenue growth this year. and to repeat, we expect to achieve the rule of 40 for the first time in 2021.
i want to highlight some of our critical wins in the third quarter, a testament to the strength of our global sales organization and our strategic focus. many of these wins are from established global, regional and national organizations, across the spectrum from corporations to central governments. we also see increasing demand for our services from fintech companies, including cryptocurrency and buy-now-pay-later firms. we recorded wins across all three business segments in north america, asia, middle east, europe, africa and latin america. in north america, we renewed and struck a new deal with a longtime aci customer. they will utilize the aci enterprise payments platform to create a growth and modernization path. a top u.s. bank selected aci for domestic and international wires and pave the path to converge more payment types on the same platform. we made a significant win back with a major bank, one of the top 15 banks in the u.s., utilizing aci high-value real-time payments to address both u.s. and non-u.s. payments needed for the critical [indecipherable] mandate.
we are partnering with a major information technology firm to provide support and services to a leading bank in canada to implement their payments modernization strategy. in asia, cimb bank berhad, a large malaysian based bank with a footprint spanning the region will utilize aci high-value real-time payments. this win was a competitive takeaway. cimb and other wins recognized our ongoing focus on high-value real-time payments modernization. we had two important wins in india with one of the country's largest banks and the leading white label atm service provider, both signed on to use aci issuing and acquiring. these wins, with established and new aci customers, are built on our ability to provide global solutions as customers focus on this critical area of issuing and acquiring. jcb, a major global payment scheme, has selected aci as its next-generation digital payment partner.
turning to the middle east, one of our key focus on growth geographies. we had a renewal and the new deal with two major financial institutions in saudi arabia. they will utilize the ai enterprise payment platform with platform extensibility and the path to modernize as part of saudi arabia's vision 2030 program. in europe, a leading richest payment service provider renewed aci issuing and acquiring. in latin america, one of the largest processors and acquirers will leverage aci issuing and acquiring to replace several in-house platforms they use for chargebacks. in africa, a leading zimbabwe-based payment service provider that enables banks to provide their customers with innovative and agile technology platforms, renewed the agreement for aci issuing and acquiring.
in our merchant segment, we saw continued progress in our grocery vertical, while we're also cementing several new e-commerce deals. albertsons, one of the u.s. top 10 supermarkets, has selected aci omnicommerce to help simplify its payments processes, and manage its service in our cloud, supporting our multi-acquiring offer. one of the u.k.'s largest grocers renewed and extended their in-store payments, e-commerce and fraud solutions relationship with aci. these wins grew out of our continued focus on the grocery segment around the world and the ability of our payments orchestration technology and cloud services to meet the digital transformation needs of these customers. i also want to mention a new deal with the european merchant that will facilitate access to new acquirers and provide new services with aci secure e-commerce and fraud management. some of our wins in the biller segment include a new deal with a leading high education erp system as their preferred partner.
this deal will replace payment processing for 150-plus institutions and universities currently utilizing paypal payments pro. this win grew out of aci's focus on the higher education segment and our continued innovation, including areas like student portal. a new deal with bcu, a top u.s. regional credit union, which will upgrade their current systems to aci speedpay. road runner account services, a leading finance company for recreation of vehicles, has chosen aci speedpay to modernize its payment systems and offer mobile technology to customers. leading global industry research firms also recognized aci solutions leadership. we achieved the best-in-class ranking in the 2021 it metrics leading u.s. cash management vendors, landscape report.
we are named a leader in corporate digital banking platforms by celent, which highlighted our solid customer base and support. we won several awards from juniper, including payments, innovation of the year for aci secure e-commerce. additionally, we received full patent approval for our incremental learning technology and an innovative industry-first approach to machine learning. before handing the call over to scott, i want to say that i'm incredibly proud of the aci team and what we have achieved for our customers and our business so far. i am enthusiastic about what the future will bring.
with that, i will turn it over to scott to discuss financials. scott?
scott behrens -- chief financial officer
thanks, odilon, and good morning, everyone. i first plan to go through our financial results for q3 and then provide some additional commentary regarding our increased outlook for the rest of the year. we'll then open the line for questions. we had a solid third quarter and once again delivered results within our guidance range. we have now delivered a string of quarterly financial results in line with or above our guidance. recurring revenue in q3 reached $245 million representing 70% of our total revenue for the quarter and up 1% compared to q3 last year. as odilon mentioned, we also made significant progress in advancing our full year bookings pipeline, and have now signed contracts representing more than 99% of our full year 2021 revenue outlook. our pipeline momentum is notably higher than we've typically recorded by november, which allows us to raise our forecast for the year and reinforces our confidence in delivering on this increased full year guidance.
total revenue for the quarter was $317 million, up slightly from q3 last year. adjusted ebitda in the quarter was $74 million, down from q3 last year, primarily due to the timing and mix of higher-margin license contracts. turning to our three business segments. in our banking segment, recurring revenue increased 2% and total revenue increased 5% as financial institutions started to revisit projects previously delayed by covid. in our merchant segment, recurring revenue increased 11% as we continue to see double-digit transaction growth in our e-commerce solution. and finally, in our biller segment, recurring revenue and total revenue declined 2% versus q3 last year. if you recall, last year, our biller segment had significant tax payment related volumes as the tax deadline for federal and state tax filings was pushed into q3 last year.
we ended the quarter with $141 million in cash on hand and nearly $500 million available on our credit facility after paying down $35 million in debt in the quarter. we ended the quarter with $1.1 billion of debt, representing a net debt leverage ratio of 2.8 times and expect to be at or below our targeted 2.5 times net leverage ratio as we exit 2021. looking ahead, we are increasing our revenue guidance and now expect full year 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1.355 billion to $1.36 billion, up from previous expectations of $1.335 billion to $1.345 billion. we now expect adjusted ebitda to come in at the high end of our range. so we're now expecting ebitda to be in the range of $380 million to $385 million.
and it is worth repeating that we have 99% of the year's top line revenue already signed and under contract, and are simply waiting on the calendar to recognize the revenue. this fraction is notably higher than in past years, which gives us high confidence in our increased guidance targets. and the higher revenue growth as we exit 2021, combined with the strength of our arr bookings we're seeing here in the second half of the year, are setting us up well for accelerating growth as we enter 2022.
with that, i will pass it back to odilon for some closing comments. odilon?
odilon almeida -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, scott. i want to say again how pleased we are with the execution of our strategy and the performance and results we are seeing. i want to thank the aci team for their hard work and our customers for trusting us with their most critical software needs. as the world's premier provider of payment software, we are in a prime position to modernize the world's payments ecosystem. we are the first choice for large commercial and central government entities globally, including fintechs, to modernize and build their digital payment platforms politically. in 2020, we launched a new strategy and delivered on our first pillar, fit for growth. this year, we are delivering on our second pillar, focus on growth.
and we remain laser-focused on continuing to build a robust pipeline that will support our long-term growth objectives. i want to enforce that our efforts on our third and important strategic pillar, step-change value creation through m&a continue. we continue to review our business portfolio and m&a opportunities to ensure we maximize short- and long-term value creation for our shareholders. we have delivered on our financial promises and are raising our financial guidance for the year, achieving organic growth and accomplished the rule is evidence that our strategy and execution are working.
thank you. we will now open the call for questions.
