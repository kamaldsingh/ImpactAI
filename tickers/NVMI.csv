eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, miri, and thank you all for joining our first quarter financial results conference call. i sincerely hope that you and your families are safe and healthy in this extraordinary time. i would like also to extend my wishes to our partners, suppliers and customers.
i will start the call today by speaking about our first quarter results and performance highlights, including our extensive plans to meet the company's strategic targets amid the global spread of covid-19. following my commentary, dror will review the quarter's financial results in detail and will conclude the guide -- will conclude, sorry, with the guidance for the second quarter of 2020.
nova delivered strong results for the first quarter of 2020 with both revenue and profitability exceeding the high end of the previously announced guidance. these results demonstrate our solid execution capabilities, as well as our agile operating model, which allow us to adapt quickly to volatile market conditions. our sound achievements in diversifying our customers and products in recent quarters allow us to successfully mitigate cycles in the different market segments. our sustainable operating model and long-term strategic objectives will continue to provide us with a solid framework to meet our customers' demand even in these unprecedented times.
before i discuss our performance highlights for the quarter, i would like to share with you our main actions and priorities in addressing the challenges caused by the spread of covid-19. our well-organized comprehensive plan is aimed at confidently navigating the company through market uncertainties and constant changes. our collective experience in managing frequent delivery challenges in israel due to other reasons allowed us this time to respond effectively to the evolving situation by adopting our well-practiced disaster recovery plan.
our plan is focused on four elements that have been implemented since the beginning of march. first and foremost, our top priority remains the health, safety and financial well-being of our employees, partners and their families. we are complying with all local and global directives in order to prevent infection and spread of the disease. as part of our fast response, we offered employees remote working arrangements, we restricted work-related travel and limited customer interactions. beside the health measures we implemented, we are also proactively offering financial support to our employees and partners that may be affected from the pandemic's economical aftermath.
second, we took proactive measures to secure our supply chain and business continuity in order to meet customers' varied demands. although the pandemic has a global impact, we have worked extensively to strengthen our supply chain, including qualifying new suppliers as part of the mitigation plan for unpredicted risks. as part of this plan, we are also securing inventories and spare parts throughout the year and aiming to maintain full production capacity to mitigate volatility and shortage once the situation recovers. this may be reflected in the company inventory levels in the coming quarters. additionally, we have moved all our production team to work in shifts and split turns, isolated from the rest of the company with a clear mindset to meet any customer needs within a reasonable lead time.
third, we are focused on strengthening the capabilities and expertise of our regional teams and offices to meet our customers' local requirements. although we anticipate cross-region travels to resume gradually only in the third quarter, we are working closely with our customers to minimize delays in installing new products.
finally, as nova plays a major part in the local communities around the globe, we are proud to have multiple volunteering initiatives in various places, including medical equipment and fund contribution. this is part of our corporate social responsibility policy, and i am proud of all the projects we led in the last three months to support the fight against the corona spread.
turning now to our performance highlights, during the first quarter of 2020, our performance continued to be supported by a diversified customer portfolio, which drove a balanced revenue mix between memory and foundry/logic. our customer mix for this quarter comprises of three major customers, including the largest foundry in the world and two leading memory customers.
during the quarter, we achieved a major milestone in our continued effort to strengthen our position with the top-tier customers. following our press release from may 5, we are proud to have selected by the world's leading logic manufacturer for its global manufacturing sites. the customer selected nova's optical cd solution due to its unique combination of advanced hardware and software, including advanced deep tech algorithm. we have already received multiple orders and recognized initial revenues this quarter.
following the strong customer traction we had during the first quarter, we entered the second quarter with significantly improved book-to-bill pace, driven by record quarterly bookings. this achievement exemplifies the important role nova plays in our customers' r&d phase in the most leading edge nodes. as a result, a decent portion of our revenue came from customer investments in strategic developments, which are more resilient to the current market volatility.
these encouraging milestones demonstrate soundly the contribution that our diversified product offering and balanced customer mix bring to the company resiliency. moreover, we believe that once markets fully recover from the pandemic implications, our growing position will support our profitable growth plans in the future.
let me now turn to our product portfolio and development highlights. as we discussed in the last several earnings calls, we are in the process of introducing new dimensional and material solutions for the advanced front-end semiconductors. the first harbinger was the prism optical platform that was introduced in the third quarter of 2019. since then, we have conducted several evaluations simultaneously with leading customers, and we are pleased to inform today that initial revenues were recognized already in the first quarter.
in addition to the prism, we are extremely focused on introducing two new platforms that are aimed at converting laboratory techniques into semiconductor high-volume production tools. by nature, these are very long evaluations as they change the way the customers are working and qualifying their devices. although we see good progress with several field evaluations, we are experiencing some schedule deviation due to the covid-19 restrictions, including customer site isolations and travel limitations.
another meaningful effort to mention in regard to our product road map is our software and advanced algorithm development. as part of our strategic approach to enter more into the deep tech capabilities, we are seeing increased adoption of our machine learning and modeling solutions in high volume manufacturing. currently, our main investment is to bring together combined hardware and deep tech solutions like machine learning, big data in adaptive training into the heart of semiconductor manufacturing. in all of our last wins, we proved that this combination allows our customers to tighten their process control, improve yield faster and shorten time to market.
before i conclude my prepared remarks, i would like to briefly highlight some market dynamics and their relevance to nova's performance. though we are very encouraged by the business pace in the first half of 2020, which is higher compared to the same period last year, the visibility for the second half is still low. despite several announcements of covid-19 exit plans in asia and europe, the recovery pace and demand behavior are still hard to predict. nevertheless, we still believe that in the long term, demand fundamentals remain solid and will continue fueling the market beyond the interim conditions. amplified by the current environment, we believe that demand for enterprise and cloud applications will grow along with demand for advanced data infrastructure and 5g ecosystem.
to summarize, we are dealing with a challenging period, facing global uncertainties and frequent dynamic changes. but against the evolving backdrop of the pandemic, nova has proven its ability to adapt quickly without compromising either the safety of our people or the aggressive execution plans to meet our strategic goals. while we should keep being prudent in our approach to the current dynamic environment, we strongly believe in the company's long-term prospects.
i would like to conclude my remarks with stating again our main focus today, which is to secure the safety and health of our employees and their families, while ensuring the business continuity of the company.
now, let me hand over the call to dror to review our financial results in detail. dror?
dror david -- chief financial officer
thanks eitan. good day, everyone. total revenues in the first quarter of 2020 were $61 million, exceeding the company guidance range for the quarter. product revenues included revenue recognition of the first tools sold to a new logic customer in connection with the selection win we announced several weeks ago. product revenue distribution was approximately 55% from logic and foundry and approximately 45% from memory. following an uptick in service revenues in the previous quarter, service revenues in the first quarter came in at the normalized level of $15.3 million.
blended gross margin increased in the first quarter of 2020 to 56% on a gaap basis and 57% on a non-gaap basis. the increase in blended gross margins was attributed to improved product mix in the quarter and to higher service gross margins, which came in at 44%.
operating expenses in the first quarter of 2020 totaled $21.5 million on a gaap basis and $19.8 million on a non-gaap basis. gross r&d expenses were stable during the quarter, while r&d income came in at a normalized level of $1.5 million relative to $3.7 million in the previous quarter. sales and marketing expenses reduced significantly, mainly due to a different regional sales distribution and related lower sales commissions.
operating margin in the first quarter of 2020 was 21% on a gaap basis and 24% on a non-gaap basis. effective tax rate in the quarter came in at approximately 16%. company profitability in the first quarter of 2020 was better than expected despite the covid-19 impact. this result was driven by strong demand for the company products, leading to outperformance in revenues, improved product mix and related gross margins for products and services, and lower international travel expenses, which more than mitigated increased costs related to covid-19.
as a result, earnings per share in the quarter were $0.41 per diluted share on a gaap basis and $0.47 per diluted share on a non-gaap basis, exceeding the high end of the company guidance.
moving to the company outlook for the second quarter of 2020, we expect the following: revenues between $58 million to $66 million, gaap earnings per diluted share between $0.29 and $0.43, non-gaap earnings per diluted share between $0.37 and $0.51.
at the midpoint of the second quarter guidance, we expect the following. blended gross margins are expected to be approximately 56%. given the covid-19 pandemic, the company is working diligently to create backup resources across its global workforce. in addition, the company is gradually increasing its supply chain commitments and related inventory in order to secure the ability to manufacture and deliver products and services as much as possible across different locations and territories and throughout the year. in that respect, operating expenses are expected to increase in the second quarter to approximately $23 million on a gaap basis and approximately $21.5 million on a non-gaap basis. the majority of the expense increases are expected in r&d and sales and marketing, while g&a expenses are expected to reduce.
with that, i will turn the call back to eitan. eitan?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dror. with that, we will be pleased to take your questions. operator?

[operator instructions] our first question comes today from patrick ho of stifel. please go ahead.
patrick j. ho -- stifel -- analyst
thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter and outlook, and glad to hear everyone is well. maybe for both of you, eitan and dror. as it relates to covid-19, can you give a little more color of some of the, i guess, supply chain, manufacturing and parts procurement challenges you faced? and you did mention in the prepared remarks some of the issues you're trying to do to mitigate it on a going forward basis. what are some of the restrictions that are still potentially hindering you as you go into the june quarter?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thanks patrick for the question. so, there are a few levels of -- in the questions, and i'll answer each one of them. so first of all, regarding the production facilities, in all the production facilities, we are-we move to work in shifts and split turns around the clock. so, we don't see any damage to any supply chain capabilities as a result from the production capabilities on our clean rooms and production facilities. for that, we are doing the upmost in order to isolate those places, so nobody can enter and make a damage or distribute something that we don't want. this is on the first level.
second level is the supply chain. so, every place that we thought that we have a risk, we qualified already a second vendor, which is very challenging in this pandemic because the pandemic is attacking globally. so at the beginning, we'd like to find some sources to the chinese supply chain. and after that, we came back to china. but nevertheless, we currently have secured the dual vendors to the whole critical parts. and therefore, we are pretty safe on that. we're of course having a risk management plan where we're placing those suppliers then even offer them some financially help in order for them to supply the whole capacity. so this is the second one.
the third one, as i said in my prepared remark and dror mentioned it as well, you probably see some dynamic changes in our inventory going forward because our belief is that, the target right now is to produce as many systems as we can in our production line. in order for us to be prepared to the day when everything will be finished, so everybody will go to the same suppliers. so we are trying right now to secure as much inventory as we can until the end of the year. so we will not be dependent on any economy or any hit that will happen during this period.
so i think that those three levels should secure the deliverables that we have for -- until the end of the year. talking about that, we need to take it with a very prudent approach that the pandemic hits everybody everywhere. so at the end, there might be some suppliers that will have some hit and maybe will delay some of their parts. but currently, when we're looking at least for the next quarter, we don't see such a problem.
patrick j. ho -- stifel -- analyst
great. that's really helpful. and maybe as my follow-up question, it was great to see the recent announcement of the win by the logic customer. obviously, that's a great penetration on your end. have you looked at additional application opportunities? given their strategy of using basically a copy exactly anywhere across the globe, what's your efforts now to get additional applications with this customer?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so i want to-patrick, i want to be very careful with my answer because we are -- we don't want to reveal anything competitive-wise with this specific customer. but i think that it's a great achievement for nova entering into this customer. it was a real battle for the last couple of years. and the jewel in the crown was always getting into the logic part because we are partners of this customer in the memory side. so when we went in, in the logic side, of course we went in, in a very challenging application and we are now, and we will be in the next couple of quarters, working with this customer evaluating other applications as well. when, i'm saying other application, it's not only optical. so this customer is very advanced in materials metrology as well. and there is a match between the demand of this customer and the requirement to our portfolio. so, i'm pretty sure that we will see more application coming in on the ocd platform. and if i can look right now on the strategic partners with this customer, there is a lot of potential on the materials as well.
patrick j. ho -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you very much.
operator
thank you. we take our next question from quinn bolton of needham. please go ahead.
n. quinn bolton -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
hey, guys. congratulations on the nice results and outlook in a challenging environment. wanted to follow-up on patrick's question about the new customer, so a couple of questions there. it sounds like the wins, the applications were critical applications. but just wanted to confirm, these were sort of critical applications at this customer rather than say semi-critical. and then, a follow-on, you mentioned that you already have multiple repeat orders from this customer. just wondering, are those orders scheduled for delivery later this year? or are those potentially further out into calendar '21?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so, quinn, i will answer the first one and dror will take the second one. so, i can tell you very shortly that this win is on the most advanced production application for this customer in the logic advanced nodes, ok? so it's not any r&d or a small win. it's a win in the center of the activity in this customer's production. now, dror will answer you regarding the orders.
dror david -- chief financial officer
yes. we definitely -- hi quinn, we definitely expect additional revenues throughout the year -- additional deliveries and revenues from this customer.
n. quinn bolton -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
great. and then, just my follow-up, eitan, you had mentioned the new materials and dimensional technologies were facing some perhaps qualification or eval [phonetic] delays as a result of covid. wondering if you might be able to update us on any expectations when you think those new technologies might be able to rev rec. is that something now that might push into the second half of the year where its visibility is just too low to trying to time when those tools and new applications may rev rec?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so, we are not talking here on major delays. so, i think that we can expect them to be recognized in the second half.
n. quinn bolton -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
great. thank you.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
thank you. we'll take our next question from mark miller of benchmark company. please go ahead.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
thank you for the question, and congrats on another good quarter and outlook. and i'm glad everyone has been safe at nova. just trying to get a little more color on revenues, in particular, in terms of software related and x-ray characterization related revenues. can you give us a little more color on those revenues? how they have been trending and what you expect?
dror david -- chief financial officer
so, obviously, we don't -- we do not break down the revenues per product line. in general, the revenues in the first quarter were a little bit more lenient to the -- with [phonetic] more software revenues and with the products which include a little bit more products on the high end with higher gross margins. we should remind that we have a target model for software revenues to become up to 10% of our product revenues. we hope that this year, we will be able to see some growth in software revenues and it's already started in the first quarter.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
thank you. there's been some talk -- more us restrictions, especially in shipping into china. do you see that is having any impact on your sales?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so, there are two things on that. so first of all is the old restrictions or the previous situation with the trade war between the us and china. as you know, we have facility both in the us and in israel. and we're mostly restricted in the us and we follow that. at that time, there was only one customer, jhicc, that wasn't a big issue from the us administration to ship tools, and we were banned from doing anything, according to the federal rules, with this customer as well. nevertheless, there are less restrictions on the israeli entity. and therefore, we don't expect any kind of effect on the israeli side shipping equipment to china. we're definitely looking and learning and analyzing all the time, the new rules coming from the us.
i just want to say that, it might be an opportunity for us to enjoy from [indecipherable] because we have less restriction in israel and therefore we can compete more. and as a result of this, those restrictions, we might see more semiconductor fab in the us, and then we enjoy again. so i think that this is not a healthy situation, but i don't see an impact on our strategic plans following those kind of restrictions, unless it will go into some kind of economical -- global economical crisis that will affect the whole semiconductor.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
thank you.
operator
thank you. we'll move now to krish sankar of cowen and company. please go ahead.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. i had two of them. firstly, just to follow up on your earlier comments, is it fair to assume, if things do get worse with the us-china relations, it's only your xps product line, which is being made in the us, would be impacted, not the optical cd line? and then i had a follow-up.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so, first of all, yes. so, most of our x-ray tools are going out from the us and they will have those restrictions. we need to learn them carefully and they will have a restriction like other us-based company. regarding the israel facility, so -- the israel facility is not producing only optical cd, it's producing optical tools. some of them are doing materials. some of them are doing cds. but israel -- as i said before, the israeli facility is not fully obliged to this -- to those rules coming from the trade war.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. that's very helpful. and then, as a follow-up, is there a way to parse out, your q1 numbers, growth year-over-year, how much of that was underlying industry growth? how much of it was share gains?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
can you repeat the question?
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
the march quarter revenue strength you saw on a year-over-year basis, it was up 8% year-over-year, how much of that was the industry growing and how much of it was from your share gains?
dror david -- chief financial officer
i think, i would assume that most of it is related to either new products or penetration into new customers, rather than the industry growth.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
krish, it's eitan. so, it's a stronger quarter in a very cyclical environment. so, you can imagine that both the market share and the position was strengthening a lot during this quarter. so, you see right now the rest of our results, and i assume that decent portion of the revenue came either for -- from selection to strategic investment by our customers that are less influenced by the covid, as well as a great portion coming for market share.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. thanks eitan and dror, and congrats on the interesting results.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you very much.
operator
[operator instructions] we'll now take a question from jaeson schmidt of lake street. please go ahead.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets, llc -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. just curious if you could quantify the amount of revenue that was impacted in q1 due to supply constraints?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so, jaeson, we -- the impact that we see on the supply chains are -- the most of it, it's maybe delays from one quarter to another. so we don't see any capability that was damaged so far by the supply chain. i think that starting from the crisis in china somewhere in january, beginning of february, we started immediately to elevate our inventory and chasing after our suppliers. so, there are suppliers that we -- by nova kept alive and open during the crisis in order to supply our production capabilities and supply chain parts. of course, there are some challenges in the way. but if i'm looking right now on the damages or some challenges that we had in the first quarter, it's just delays that moved to the second quarter. we don't see any cancellation. we don't see any major delays right now from the customer demands that we have.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets, llc -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and looking at the opex line, understanding sort of the moving parts in q2, should we expect this sort of elevated level to be consistent throughout the remainder of the year? or is this sort of a near-term bump and then going back to more normalized levels?
dror david -- chief financial officer
no. so, as i mentioned, we are increasing our, i would say, redundancies across the world to ensure delivery and customer presence. so, i would say this is a new level, and you should see across the second half maybe low-single digit growth every quarter starting q3 until the end of the year.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets, llc -- analyst
okay. thanks a lot, guys.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.

operator
good day, and welcome to the nova's second quarter 2020 results conference call. [operator instructions]
at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to miri segal of ms-ir. please go ahead.
miri segal-scharia -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator and good day to everybody. i would like to welcome all of you to nova's second quarter 2020 financial results conference call. with us on the line today are mr. eitan oppenhaim, president and ceo; and mr. dror david, cfo.
before i begin, may i remind our listeners that certain information provided on this call may contain forward-looking statements and the safe harbor statement outlined in today's earnings release also pertains to this call. if you have not received a copy of the release, please view it in the investor relations section of the company's website. eitan will begin the call with a business update, followed by dror with an overview of the financials. we will then open the call for the question-and-answer session.
i will now hand over the call to mr. eitan oppenhaim, nova's president and ceo. eitan, please go ahead.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, miri and welcome, everyone to our second quarter financial results conference call. on behalf of all of us in nova, we hope both you and your families are safe and healthy at this volatile period. i extend these wishes also to our employees, partners, suppliers and customers. i will start the call today by speaking about our second quarter results, including the latest updates about our continuous efforts to meet the company's targets amid the various global uncertainties.
following my commentary, dror will review the financial results in details. and we'll conclude with the guidance for the third quarter. despite several challenges, including the spread of covid-19 and other geopolitical and macroeconomic disruptions, nova delivered strong financial results in the second quarter of 2020 with both revenue and profitability, meeting our mid-guidance and significantly outperforming the same period last year. although, the environment is still fluid, we currently expect that the strong demand for our products combined with several meaningful share wins we had during the first half of the year will positioned 2020 as a growth year for nova with solid momentum expected to continue also into 2021. this is a clear demonstration of our execution capabilities and agility to adapt quickly to fast-changing markets.
our decisive actions during the last few years to diversify our products, customers and geographies continue to support our growing resiliency during this period and propel our plans to emerge as a stronger partner once the environment is stabilized. we are very proud of our ability to capitalize on several strategic opportunities, especially through this period when our teams are aggressively investing in gaining market share and securing further growth.
in spite of the continuous struggle, with the spread of covid-19 and as a result of our employees' dedication and outstanding efforts, we managed to quickly ramp up our production lines and development capabilities to respond to demand volatility and fast changes in the semiconductor market. since we expect that the virus is here to stay for a longer period than we've seen previously, we have changed our working procedure to ensure employee safety at all times, high production capacity, supply chain resiliency, and customer support continuously. we have adopted protocols to continue the work from home hybrid method for as long as needed, without disruptive -- sorry, without disrupting any of our business or whatnot development targets.
our aim as demonstrated in the last two quarters is to continue executing our strategic goals despite the rapid changes. beyond the common measures we have taken to fundamentally change our working methods, we are also focusing on strengthening our local entities in order to continue servicing our global customers and capitalize on various emerging opportunities.
our plan to increase production capacity specifically in this period is started to accommodate the supply chain disruptions as well as customers demand for shorter lead times. as a result, we may experience some inventory volatility during the next few months yet without changing our long-term operational model. our confidence in our new product portfolio and our ability to transform short-term pipelines into long-term growth engine dictate our operational goals currently independent of the current interim disruptions.
turning now to our business highlights in the second quarter of 2020. our performance continued to rely on breadth and depth of our customer mix, which was driven by five major customers, including three foundry logic customers and two large memory providers. as reflected in our customer mix, we are very proud to achieve two new share wins with both our stand-alone and integrated tools in china. this mix of customers highlights the growing demand for our solution in both memory and logic, which is affected by growing demand for nand devices, as well as for wide range of logic devices, starting from 40 nanometer all the way down to 3 nanometer.
this outcome represent the overall positive momentum in the semiconductor industry that is dictated by the covid-19 implication on the way we work, communicate, interact, stream data and rely on remote applications. in our service business, we are expecting meaningful growth this year, as we continue to offer proactive service packages to our customers to improve their install base productivity and metrology capabilities as well.
beyond revenue contribution from service contracts and time and materials services, our goal is to significantly increase the overall contribution from value-added services that are developed specifically for our customers, enabling them to better utilize the aging install base and to extend their life cycle.
finally, for this part, i would like to mention again, our strong operational model, which is the basis for our continuous growth and ability to invest in our development roadmap, even when facing uncertainties. the value of our products, along with nova's unique offering and efficient manufacturing capabilities, support our profitability model and are reflected in our strong cash flow generation during the first six months of 2020, which was much higher compared with the same period last year. embedded in our strategy, this cash position should accelerate our organic and non-organic plans specifically in this period.
let me now provide some highlights as for our product portfolio and roadmap development progress. the first highlight to mention is our announcement from july 27, about new additions to our optical cd integrated solutions. the need for better in-die and in-wafer metrology performance in the most advanced logic and memory nodes is converging with our legit leadership in the integrated metrology market and supporting our aggressive future roadmap.
our tight partnership with customers and our leadership position were both reflected strongly in the second quarter with record high revenues for integrated metrology across all front-end segments. the new announced platform, the i570 and astera extends nova's leadership in integrated metrology process control and targets the development and manufacturing of next-generation ic architecture.
the nova astera platform is the first of its kind in the industry, providing stand-alone level performance in a compact form factor of integrated metrology. the new platform utilizes multi-channel measurement, providing the best solution in the market in term of accuracy, precision, tool-to-tool matching and extendibility.
this platform is targeted to support the development of next-generation device technologies beyond 3 nanometer logic and 256 layers multi-deck 3d nand nodes, and as such is expected to enter the market over the course of the coming years through r&d line first. the second new solution is nova i570, single channel -- sorry, single channel sr platform, which is in the center of nova's mission, as the integrated metrology market leader to provide the most reliable and highest performance integrated metrology platform solution for high volume manufacturing fabs. the new addition offers the highest throughput in the market supporting the new faster cmp polishers and new etchers allowing better within-wafer variation control by measuring more sites, as well as pre and post-wafer measurements.
by introducing these platforms, nova expands its leadership position by offering a wide range of integrated solutions from single channel thin film fast solutions to multichannel ocd complex solution for cmp deposition and edge. with this announcement for new integrated metrology platforms, along with the new prism stand-alone ocd market rollout and the new technologies that are evaluated currently in the field by multiple customers. we are planning to enter 2021 with a completely differentiated and unique portfolio that will support the expenditure of our total served and available markets going forward.
as part of our strategy and at the heart of the technology roadmap, we'll continue to invest in enabling software technologies that support innovative hardware developments. our main efforts in this part are to embed more deep step capabilities in our solution, including machine learning, ai, big data and adaptive training. all our latest product announcement includes an element of advanced software engines to enhance hardware capabilities and overall metrology performance. as a result of these efforts, we received a significant order from a logic customer this quarter to enhance their entire new install base with the complete machine learning solution that allows them to tighten process control schemes, improve it faster and shorten time to markets.
before i conclude my prepared remarks, i would like to briefly highlight some market dynamics and their relevance to nova performance. though we are very encouraged by the business space in the first half, and the improved momentum toward the second half of 2020, which is significantly higher compared to the same period last year, we remain watchful for possible changes in the market and their effects on nova. as for the current demand characteristics, we believe that the global pandemic and the changing in social behavior, it is dictating -- it will accelerate key long-term technology inflections.
these changes are driving investments mostly in cloud-based services, advanced communication ecosystems to allow better streaming and video calls, growing needs for automation and ai, stronger compute power and memory capabilities in every device. these hi-tech application, right technologies, enhancement in both logic and memory and create a solid demand for more metrology control. although covid-19 will continue to present some challenges and fluctuations, we still believe that all these triggers create a compelling event for solid wfe spending in 2020 and 2021.
to conclude, we delivered strong results for the first half of 2020, and we are guiding the third quarter to continue performing at the same elevated levels. we are seeing positive momentum in our efforts to gain market share, expand our available markets and rollout new technologies. this soundly demonstrate the contribution that our diversified product offering and strong customer brace bring to the company resiliency, which in turn drives our ability to adopt quickly and perform well even in challenging periods. although, we've yet to know the full impact of covid-19 on global economies, we still believe in the long-term semiconductor technology innovation and the significant opportunity present to nova in the long run.
now let me hand over the call to dror to review our financial results in details. dror?
dror david -- chief financial officer
thanks, eitan. good day, everyone. in the second quarter of 2020, the company continued to perform well. the financial results met expectations and company guidance, despite the turbulent global economy environment caused by the covid-19 pandemic. total revenues in the second quarter of 2020 were $62.6 million, 3% higher than the previous quarter and 22% higher than the second quarter of 2019.
product revenue distribution was approximately 70% from logic and foundry and approximately 30% from memory. service revenues grew sequentially and came in at $15.5 million. geographically, product revenues were well distributed between the major semiconductor manufacturing territories with approximately 30% of product revenues generated from each of taiwan, korea and china. on a per customer basis, five major customers contributed 10% or more to the company product revenues, including two local chinese manufacturers.
blended gross margins, significantly increased sequentially by more than 220 basis points on both gaap and non-gaap basis and came in at 58% on a gaap basis and 59% on a non-gaap basis. the increasing blended gross margins was attributable to improved product mix in the quarter, which led product gross margins to increase to 64%, while services gross margins remained at the higher than usual level of 44%.
operating expenses in the second quarter of 2020, totaled $26.3 million on a gaap basis and $21.5 million on a non-gaap basis. g&a expenses in the second quarter on a gaap basis included a one-time expense related to an incident in which a financial institution used by the company for certain financial transactions wired-out company found without company authorization. these wire transfers were executed based on instruction given by a fraudster directly to the financial institution. based on us gaap accounting rules, the company was required to provide a one-time expense for the related amounts in the second quarter financial results.
the company is taking appropriate measures with the relevant parties to fully recover the fraudulently transferred amount. the related amounts were adjusted for the presentation of non-gaap financial results in the second quarter of 2020. operating margins in the second quarter of 2020 came in at 19% on a gaap basis and increased to 25% on a non-gaap basis. effective tax rate in the quarter came in at approximately 19% on a gaap basis. earnings per share in the quarter were $0.30 per diluted share on a gaap basis and $0.48 per diluted share on a non-gaap basis.
moving to the main balance sheet items. trade accounts receivables reduced by approximately $11 million as a result of effective collection during the second quarter, and days sales out came in at 72 days. as expected, the company recognized higher than usual inventory levels due to business continuity measures taken as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. we expect to continue to gradually increase the company's supply chain commitments and related inventories in order to secure the production and delivery of products and services, as much as possible across different locations and territories throughout the year. inventories at the end of the second quarter accumulated to $56.6 million with inventory turns of 2 times a year.
during the second quarter, the company generated $19.1 million of operating cash flow accumulating to $32.5 million of positive operating cash flow in the first half of 2020. pre-cash flow in the same period, the first half of 2020 was approximately $30 million representing a healthy free cash flow generation of 24% of total revenues. as a result, overall cash reserves at the end of the second quarter accumulated to $218 million, a level which will enable the company to explore different business opportunities during the covid-19 global pandemic crisis.
regarding the company outlook for the third quarter of 2020, we expect the following. revenues between $58 million to $66 million, gaap earnings per share between $0.25 and $0.39, non-gaap earnings per diluted share between $0.34 and $0.47. at the midpoint of the third quarter guidance, we expect the following, blender gross margins are expected to be approximately 58%, given the covid-19 situation, the company continues to build backup resources across its global workforce. in parallel, we continue to focus on introducing and proliferating new products globally.
in that respect operating expenses are expected to be approximately $25 million on a gaap basis and to increase to approximately $23 million on a non-gaap basis. most of these expense increase is expected in r&d expenses. effective tax rates are expected to be similar to the second quarter of 2020.
with that, i will turn the call back to eitan. eitan?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dror. with that, we will be pleased to take your questions. operator, please.
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we will now take our first question from charles shi from needham. please go ahead. your line is open.
charles shi -- needham & company -- analyst
hey, eitan, congratulations on the nice results and solid guidance. i have a few questions, first off looking at intel recently announced 7 nanometer push out. what is your view, the impact on your business especially any impact on the revenue ramp of the present product run?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thanks for the question. so regarding the big logic customers that we announced, i think that in our business model, the revenue perforation coming from this account will start this year and will it grow gradually next year, and we took into account that the 7 nanometer will start the investment -- the real investment actually will start next year.
so it's embedded in our plans where we thought, and we planned that we'll have few systems going in this year and then more system going in next year when they start ramping up the 7 nanometer. although, they are one of the customers for this technology, we have other customers that are using the prism, we always say that there are multiple installations with these tools for stand-alone in both memory and logic. therefore, we still expect multi-million revenues from this tool this year.
charles shi -- needham & company -- analyst
okay. thank you very much. any impact, i mean, for the same logic customer to push out of the ram and impact on the new technology quantification? i know you got the new technologies that are being evaluated by multiple customers, but that does -- this one project customer impact -- are you still expecting some revenue recognition in second half this year?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so as we said last quarter and we continue talking about the new technologies, we said that there are three things, right. we said that there is prism, which we just talked about. and we said there are two more technologies that are being evaluated with leading customers, and they are evaluated in customers, which is different than this specific logic customer. so we don't see any disruptions into the acceptance process because of these delays. actually, if the fact will be proven true that the capacity of this logic customer going to another leading foundry, then we'll enjoy from that even more with the new technology next year.
charles shi -- needham & company -- analyst
great, great. and then one last question from me. definitely, we saw that the foundry logic revenues, as the percentage is coming up, going into third quarter, do you -- what is the general trend line here? do you continue to see foundry and logic remain at a high level, like 70% plus, minus? just the reason why i asked this is kla yesterday apparently guided foundry logic systems revenue as a percentage will go up sequentially. i wonder whether you guys seeing similar trends here? thank you.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so, as we talked many time about the diversified portfolio we have, and the customer mix, which is balanced between memory and logic foundry, i think that what we saw in the last two quarter was starting with an even portfolio then because of the leading foundry that went into 5 nanometer, we started to see growing revenue from foundry. and in the third quarter, we expect to see that we will have some foundry growth mainly from china, which will move the portfolio to be much more or more weighted into the foundry.
nevertheless, when we're looking on the fourth quarter, we're starting to see that the mix is starting to be evenly distributed because of nand recovery in the market and more orders coming from memory customers in asia. so we see that as -- if you look at the end of the year, probably you will say that it will probably be at 160% foundry, 40% memory in 2020.
charles shi -- needham & company -- analyst
thank you very much.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
we will now take our next question from jaeson schmidt from lake street. please go ahead. your line is open.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. just want to make sure i heard correctly. i mean, you guys are still anticipating some supply chain disruptions in q3. and if that's the case, just curious if you could sort of ballpark or quantify what sort of headwinds do you think that is impacting this quarter?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so i want to clarify jaeson that we said that on the second quarter, where we had to secure our supply chain disruption, and therefore, we continue to ramp up our production lines, but we don't see any disruption beyond what we already saw in the last few months in the coming quarter. so we don't see it as an issue.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then just to follow-up on service gross margin, it remains very elevated here, is this sort of the level we should be thinking about going forward?
dror david -- chief financial officer
so as you know, our model for service gross margins is 40% and above. i do believe that in the third quarter -- gross margins for services trending a little bit down to the 40% level. and, again, in order to balance between the need to have a very good service level to our customers in terms of availability of resources and headcount at customer sites and profitability, our model remains 40% and this is what you should expect looking forward.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
okay. thanks a lot, guys.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and we'll now take our next question from patrick ho from stifel. please go ahead.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
thank you very much and congrats on a nice quarter. maybe following up on the services question, you guys posted some strong results in that business, given the covid-19 environment. what changes, how are you adjusting? are you doing more remote type of services to help your customers out, given some of the restrictions that are still out there, given the strong revenues and the margin profile? what efforts have you taken there to continue the growth in that business segment?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
patrick, thank you for the question and i think that there are two levels to this answer. the first level is that nova during the last few years strengthened a lot to the independency of the local entities. so, we are very much independent on their capabilities to sell, service, market our equipment. so in the regular mainstream products, we don't see an issue with this covid-19, as we don't need to fly any way people to support these products. and the main centers in korea, taiwan, china, japan are very strong entities.
on top of that, when we started the covid, we strengthened even more, the technical capabilities of this group with extra spare parts, extra people and things like that because we understood, it will take time until we'll come back to the regular flight mode. so in that respect, we didn't -- we are not worried and it's going according to our strategic plans and everything is ok.
we did see at the beginning -- this is the second level, we did see at the beginning some disruptions to the new products and the new technology that we are providing to our customers because we have multiple evaluations with the new technologies and multiple evaluations with the prism and the new integrator, which required some support from the headquarters, either us or israel. in that matter, we adopted everything that is needed in order to do remote.
so even the customers are open up a bit more the ip restrictions in order to have remote access so everything that can be done remotely is been done remotely. additionally to that, we adopted some standard of augmented reality capabilities. so we have people in the headquarter sitting and have all these augmented reality to activate the system from remote.
and it's been proven as a good interface with those systems. so we are going to adopt it in the future as well. so beside the fact that we had to ramp up a bit different approach to the remote access we see right now that in the -- going into the third quarter, we don't see almost any disruptions because of service capabilities, not to the existing install base and the existing tools installations, as well as the new technology evaluation.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
great. that's really helpful. maybe as my follow-up question, your business in china also continues to increase and diversify and expand. you have both memory and foundry/logic customers. maybe in the foundry/logic end, there's a higher mix in china right now, trailing-edge type of capabilities versus the leading-edge where you've made a lot of gains in other regions. can you maybe give a little bit of qualitative color in terms of the opportunities on the trailing-edge side, given that in china itself, the advanced technologies are somewhat limited to one player today?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
no, we are -- we didn't break down the foundry logic segments into a trailing-edge and advanced node but i talked about it in my prepared remarks, where it can be understood that there is a major portion of the foundry capacity and the contribution of revenue it is coming from trailing node. and by the way, it's china with two to three major customers over there, that got boosted because of the trade war with the us and it's coming also from the leading foundry that invested also in this trailing nodes, mainly in 28.
so overall, when we look right now in the capacity of foundry in the second quarter and it will go through the third quarter as well. we see a wide range of extensions coming from 28 nanometer all the way to 16, 14, and even seven and five. so it's a mixed range of capacity coming from foundry. of course that the major capacity is led by taiwan with the advanced nodes, but in the rest of the region, we see a mixed nodes coming from the trailing node. i can say that in the last few months, because of the political situation in the us coming into november, and also the trade war between the nation, we starting to see more investment in the chinese local or domestic foundry customers to start ramping even advanced nodes like 10 and 7 nanometers. so this is overall the mix of foundry.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
great. that's very helpful. thank you very much.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, patrick.
operator
[operator instructions] we will now take our next question from mark miller from the benchmark company. please go ahead. your line is open.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
taiwan semiconductor announced that they were increasing their capital -- capex budget by about $1 billion. they're also planning a new fab in arizona. are you starting to see increased traction there? i know that's always been a major customer. are some of these plans starting to show up in your orders?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so we do see if we try to anticipate the end of the year of 2020, we do see a stronger year in this customer from what we previously expected. it's composed from investment in the trailing nodes, as i said, like 28 and 16 but also from elevated spending in the 7, 5 nanometer. so we definitely see a stronger capex investment by this customer. it's too early to look and understand what will happen in both the arizona case, as well as the intel comment about capacity. but yet, if we're looking on 2020 and 2021, we expect elevated use from these customers.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
great. thank you. a lot of firms are starting to see some attraction from the ramp of 5g. do you see any evidence that 5g starting to impact your business in terms of opportunities?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
we definitely see that. okay. so we see -- we saw some hiccups in the first half when investment in the handsets that are driven for 5g as well as the ecosystems are delayed a bit. but when we're looking right now on the mix of the results that we have for the second quarter as well as the prediction for the forecast for the third quarter or the second half, we do see more spending in the 5g both the ecosystem as well as the handset-driven 5g.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst

we will now move to our next question from quinn bolton from needham & co. please go ahead. your line is open.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
hi, guys. i apologize because i missed some of your prepared comments. but just wanted to ask on the competitive front, onto innovation announced new family, both stand-alone and integrated ocd system. just wondering competitively how do you see the atlas v standing up to the prism tool? and then any comments on the competitive dynamics on the integrated metrology side would be great. thank you.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, quinn. so i'll try to -- want to talk about it without getting into the complicated competition struggle. but as i said, in my remarks, and i keep on saying it in every summary that i have, that we step aside from this rush competition on every nanometer of measurement and came with a full portfolio, which is innovative and differentiated from our competition.
actually, it's different from both competitors. but if we're looking right now on our portfolio, the prism is totally different from their line of products is bringing sr plus interfor method into the game, which they don't have. in the integrated, we are bringing a multi-channel, which they have only single channel. and if we're looking right now on the material world, we are looking on material metrology coming out from x-ray, which i think only us and kla have for the metrology. so i think that looking specifically on this tool announcement, i don't see it competing with us at all.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst

good day and welcome to the nova measuring instruments limited third quarter 2020 results conference call. today's conference is being recorded.
at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to miri segal, ms-ir. please go ahead.
miri segal -- investor relations, ms-ir llc
thank you, operator, and good day to everybody. i would like to welcome all of you to nova's third quarter 2020 financial results conference call. with us on the line today are mr. eitan oppenhaim, president and ceo and mr. dror david, cfo.
before we begin, may i remind our listeners that certain information provided on this call may contain forward-looking statements and the safe harbor statement outlined in today's earnings release also pertains to this call. if you have not received the copy of the release, please view it in the investor relations section of the company's website.
eitan will begin the call with a business update, followed by dror with an overview of the financials. we will then open the call for the question-and-answer session.
i'll now hand over the call to mr. eitan oppenhaim, nova's president and ceo. eitan, please go ahead.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, miri, and welcome everyone to our third quarter financial results conference call. i will start the call today by speaking about our quarterly results and performance highlights. following my commentary, dror will review the quarterly financial results in detail, including the guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020.
our outstanding results for the third quarter exceeded the company's previous expectations and guidance. despite the market dynamics, we continued to demonstrate strong financial performance, solid cash flow generation, and sound execution against our long term strategic targets. along with our guidance for the fourth quarter, we are currently forecasting 2020 to be a growth year for nova, while we outperform the industry growth rate projections year-to-date.
we remain confident in our strategy and the long term value we bring to our customers as they progress to their next generation across all technologies and segments. although the industry is experiencing various demand shifts during this disruptive year, our technical value continues to resonate with the market, demonstrated by our customer wins in the third quarter, including selections for our traditional and new technologies.
our well-executed plan is strongly reflected in our financial results for the third quarter where both our revenue and eps exceeded our previously announced guidance. moreover, both our product revenue, optical cd stand-alone and software sales reached record highs. this is a result of continued demand for our products by our customers, outstanding execution by our global and local team, and the resiliency of our operating model.
turning now to the business performance highlights for the quarter. our quarterly revenue included a diversified customer and territory mix, which was primarily made up of four large customers, two global memory providers and two logic foundry manufacturer. as expected, demand from foundry for both advanced and trailing nodes remained strong this quarter.
exiting 2020, we expect the healthy revenue stream from foundry customers to continue in 2021 as well as they prepare for growing demand in several key applications and manage structural changes in manufacturing dynamics across customers and territories.
although this quarter was weighted toward logic, we continued to see high utilization in the memory side and expect recovery in 2021. the relative softness in memory during 2020 allowed us to further penetrate this segment and enabled us to continue the proliferation of our new and existing products in this segment.
one indication of our growing market share is our recent announcement that a top memory customer selected novaprism for its most advanced memory fabrication sites. following the selection, the company expects to deliver multiple tools to multiple sites throughout 2021. based on our long term trajectory, which combines both organic and inorganic growth drivers, we have decided also to raise capital to support our next level of expansion.
in october, we completed a successful private convertible note offering of $200 million. we initially announced an offering of $150 million, but upsized it due to a strong demand. the offer was closed at attractive condition of 0% interest on a conversion premium of approximately 27.5%. the fact that over 100 institutions applied to participate in the offering was a very positive indicator to us with interest extending beyond u.s. borders, including europe and israel.
beyond the fact that this recent move create a favorable position for us to leverage our company assets for inorganic expansion, it is a broad vote of confidence in nova's business trajectory. following the transaction, we will continue to seek investments in disruptive new technologies, pursue attractive merger and acquisition opportunities and enhance shareholder value.
during the last quarters, we remained focused on realizing our strategy to build nova's growth engine by constructing a disruptive portfolio in both dimensional and materials metrology solutions. our goal is to continuously develop and introduce disruptive solutions to the market that sets us apart from the competition and allow our customers to overcome new emerging challenges. as part of this strategy, we enhanced all our traditional product lines with new generation platforms to continue supporting our customers' future complex challenges across all semiconductor segments.
the new set of platforms that were introduced in the last 12 months, including the prism optical cd stand-alone veraflex iii x-ray platform, i570 and astera integrated metrology tools, and our new deep tech software and machine learning engines are all generating strong customer traction with multiple orders and installations.
additionally, the fundamental part of our 2020 strategy was to develop a pipeline of new technologies that will expand our total available market and gain us share in non-traditional metrology steps. these disruptive technologies aim to create new application space in the in-line, in-die production environment in order to shorten time to market in the most advanced node.
by introducing these new platforms, we are working with customers to fundamentally change their process control scheme to overcome new challenges that are not met today by traditional ocd or ir systems that have existed in the market for decades. although our plans met some challenges due to the covid-19 spread, we are back on track with multiple installations in leading customer sites. we still expect initial acceptances [technical issues] 2020. it is worth mentioning that according to our procedures and cautious approach, we only announce new products after they reach a certain level of maturity, typically following multiple installations and receiving actual purchase orders.
following the quarterly highlights, i would like to spend few minutes on and explain our long term hardware technology in more details. since the semiconductor market is very aggressive in moving to the next generation chip technology, our product portfolio is always built to meet the future technology trends of our industry. in our view, the industry is undergoing a major evolution where critical dimension-driven scaling can no longer be the sole process used to deliver improvements in performance. along with traditional scaling, one of the main avenues of advancement is the introduction of new materials, compounds, and alloys in the most advanced process steps, including litho, etch and deposition.
as a result, the surge in complexity also raised the bar for material metrology platforms, creating a strong need for a novel solution capable of measuring and controlling materials' properties such as ultra-thin film, composition, stress, strains, surface properties, and more. customer requirements already span multiple performance factors for such advanced tools, including high productivity and extremely accurate non-destructive material property analysis.
nova's non-destructive veraflex x-ray solution is the industry standard for in-line compositional and ultra-thin films analysis with dozens of distinct use cases in each major segment. it has the unique ability to measure in-die, in-production, on patent wafer, with sensitivity fulfilled below 100 angstrom where most of the critical composition control happens. while nova continuously evolves its x-ray performance, we are also developing new materials analysis technologies, including optical and other spectrometry methods capable of expanding to new application space and addressing critical units.
in the dimensional metrology space, led by the optical cd solution, the growth in complexity, driven by continued 3d scaling and high aspect ratio devices, produces new metrology challenges. while in the past, there was a clear distinction between optical metrology used to measure critical dimensions and x-ray used to measure materials, our portfolio vision aims to converge the technologies where x-ray metrology will address in-die dimensional application as well.
the new directions of x-ray metrology are non-destructive methods and will solve applications that optical methods cannot solve physically today and in the future. we definitely expect our cd portfolio to be driven in the future by a combination of optical cd and x-ray capabilities, which will complement each other with extra sensitivity.
let me turn now to the company operational status. in terms of our growing efforts to overcome the covid-19 pandemic, we are very pleased with the comprehensive actions we take to strengthen our global operational infrastructure in the last three quarters. we proactively managed supply chain disruptions and successfully executed high-volume manufacturing, while maintaining the health and safety of our global workforce. as a result of our employees' dedication and outstanding efforts, we quickly ramped up our production lines and development capabilities to peak levels. since we expect the virus to remain a global concern during 2021 as well, we have fundamentally changed our working procedures and implemented them as the new normal environment for at least the next 12 months.
as we continue to ensure our business continuity, our go-forward focus is on strengthening our local entities in order to maintain top quality service for our global customers and engage in various emerging opportunities with a reliance on remote capabilities and a minimal headquarter support. the confidence we have in our new product portfolio and our ability to transform short term pipelines into long term growth engines dictates our operational goals currently despite the interim disruption.
the significant step toward our long term goals is the recently announced construction of the new large clean room in israel planned for manufacturing nova's most advanced platforms by utilizing state-of-the-art production and industry 4.0 methods. the new facility will allow for flexible capacity changes, facilitate shift work for better social distancing and swift adjustment of production line focus and will ensure our long term agility and business continuity in various recovery scenarios. looking forward, and despite the severe disruptions we had this year, nova is well-positioned for a strong finish to the year, outperforming the industry's latest growth projection of wafer fab equipment spending.
to conclude, we delivered strong results in the first three quarter of the year and our guidance for the fourth quarter assumes similar level of performance. exiting 2020, our outlook is positive in term of overall market growth and nova expansion. coupled with our diverse customer base and product offering, we are well-positioned to deliver on our long term strategic goals.
now, let me hand over the call to dror to review the financial results in detail. dror?
dror david -- chief financial officer
thanks eitan. good day, everyone. in the third quarter of 2020, the company continued to perform well, so the financial results exceeded the initial expectations and guidance.
total revenues in the third quarter of 2020 were $69.5 million, all-time record quarterly revenues, 32% higher than the third quarter of 2019. product revenue distribution was approximately 65% from logic and foundry and approximately 35% from memory. geographically, china, taiwan and the u.s., each contributed more than 20% to our product revenues. the higher than usual contribution from the u.s. was related to a recent penetration to a new customer in that region and to the adoption of the novaprism by another u.s.-based customer.
on a per customer basis, four major customers contributed 10% or more to the company product revenues, including two foundry customers and two memory customers.
blended gross margin came in at 57% on a gaap basis and 58% on a non-gaap basis, within the company target model of 56% to 59% on a non-gaap basis. operating expenses in the third quarter of 2020 increased to $24 million on a gaap basis and $22 million on a non-gaap basis. these incremental increases are across all company operational activities aimed at aligning the company resources and redundancies to the growing business levels and the covid-19 environment.
operating margins in the third quarter of 2020 increased to 22% on a gaap basis and to 26% on a non-gaap basis. effective tax rate in the quarter came in at approximately 15% on a gaap basis. earnings per share in the quarter increased to $0.48 per diluted share on a gaap basis, and $0.57 per diluted share on a non-gaap basis.
moving to the main balance sheet items, trade accounts receivables further decreased by approximately $3 million as a result of effective collection during the third quarter and days sales out came in at 55 days. as expected, the company inventory levels continue to increase due to the higher business volumes and due to business continuity measures taken as a result of the covid-19 pandemic.
we expect to continue to gradually increase the company's supply chain commitments and related inventories in order to secure the production and delivery of products and services as much as possible across the different locations and territories. inventories at the end of the third quarter accumulated to $62 million with inventory turns of 2 times a year.
during the third quarter, the company generated approximately $22 million of operating cash flow, accumulating to approximately $54 million of positive operating cash flow in the first three quarters of 2020. as a result, overall cash reserves at the end of the third quarter increased to $238 million. in parallel, in october 2020, the company successfully concluded a 0% interest convertible bond offering in the amount of $200 million. the company used $10 million of these proceeds to buy back shares during the offering process.
the company guidance for the fourth quarter has already taken into consideration the accounting impact of the convertible debt issuance on the company gaap results. we expect to charge approximately $1 million in amortization of debt discount and issuance costs for gaap purposes on a quarterly basis. this amortization is expected to be presented as financial expense in the company's consolidated statements of operations on a gaap basis starting the fourth quarter of 2020. the company intends to adjust this amortization cost for non-gaap purposes and investors can view the specific breakdown and reconciliation of gaap to non-gaap results as it relates to the fourth quarter guidance at the end of the quarterly press release.
the convertible debt is due in five years and the company has the intention and is expected to have the ability to redeem the par value of the convertible debt in cash at the maturity date. as a result, for purposes of diluted earnings per share, the underlying shares related to the convertible debt are not expected to impact the share count of the company in the near future. such impact may occur partially or fully if nova share price is higher than the conversion price or when the company adopts new accounting standards which relate to the convertible debt.
moving into the details of the company outlook for the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect the following: revenues are expected to be between $66 million to $73 million; gaap earnings per diluted share between $0.32 and $0.43; non-gaap earnings per diluted share between $0.56 -- between $0.45 and $0.56. at the midpoint of the fourth quarter guidance, we expect the following. blended gross margins are expected to be approximately 57%. given the covid-19 situation, the company continues to build back-up resources across its global workforce. in parallel, we continue to focus on introducing and proliferating new products globally.
in that respect, operating expenses are expected to increase to approximately $26 million on a gaap basis and to increase to approximately $23 million on a non-gaap basis. most of this increase is expected in r&d expenses. effective tax rates are expected to slightly increase in the fourth quarter as a result of annual provisions and tax closing processes.
as we conclude 2020, which is expected to be a year of record revenues for the company, gross overall cash reserves are expected to accumulate to more than $400 million. we believe this level will enable the company to explore different business opportunities during and after the covid-19 global pandemic crisis.
with that, i will turn the call back to eitan. eitan?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dror. with that, we will be pleased to take your questions. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] and we will take our first question from quinn bolton with needham & company.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
yes. nice job on the third quarter results and the fourth quarter outlook. i wanted to start first with your outlook for the specialty foundry segment of the market. obviously, the u.s. commerce department actions on smic will result in u.s. companies needing export licenses. wondering if that's having any impact on your shipments to smic. i don't believe your ocd business requires an export license, but just wondering if you've seen any change in demand from that customer as a result of export control. and then i've got a couple of follow up questions.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so, most of the demand -- sorry, quinn, thank you for the question. it's eitan here. so most of the demand in smic for our tools came for the ocd tools that are coming from israel. therefore, we don't see any shift in demand. we do see pull-in for part of the tools as an overall phenomena of smic trying to pull-in tools from the rest of the vendors. so we see it as well. we don't see a reduction in capacity nor the demand.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
okay, great. and then for the comments you made, the u.s. was more than 20% of revenue in the third quarter, and that reflected the prism win at a large logic manufacturer, but then i think you may have said that you also shipped prism to a second customer in the u.s. wanted to make sure i heard that right. and if i did, could you provide any more color whether that's prsim for logic or memory or any more detail would be helpful?
dror david -- chief financial officer
yeah. so what i said in the prepared remarks is that the increase in u.s. product revenues in the third quarter was related to the win that we announced earlier this year for a u.s.-based customer and to another u.s.-based customer, which was in the logic area which adopted the novaprism as well.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great. and then just, dror, a couple of quick clarifications. on the revenue guidance of $66 million to $73 million, you had mentioned in the script that you still expect rev rec on a new tool. wondering if the $66 million to $73 million includes rev rec or to the extent you do rev rec in new tool whether that would be additional to that $66 million to $73 million?
dror david -- chief financial officer
so as eitan mentioned, we do expect initial acceptances from the new technologies in the fourth quarter already in 2020. the range of the guidance reflects all elements related to our projections for that quarter, including the new technologies.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
got it. great. and then just lastly on the inventory. i know you said that you increased the inventory, one, for business continuity reasons, but also support higher level of demand. wondering also if there are any -- is there an increase into your eval units included in that inventory figure either for prism at new customers or for some of the new technologies. thank you.
dror david -- chief financial officer
yes, the increase in inventory, not necessarily in the third quarter, but across 2020, also relates to new evaluations of the new product.
quinn bolton -- needham & company -- analyst
great. thank you.
operator
we will take our next question from jaeson schmidt with lake street.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. i think your previous expectation for q4 was for logic and memory to be a bit more even here. is that still the assumption?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
if we're looking right now on the fourth quarter, we still expect that foundry will be a bit stronger, although we do expect that memory will come up. so it will not be the same allocation as we see right now around 70-30, but definitely in a more equal way. nevertheless, the foundry will still be stronger in q4.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
okay, that's helpful. and i'm just curious if you're seeing any supply constraints at all across the channel?
dror david -- chief financial officer
no, in general, we do not see any significant disruption. obviously some of the suppliers have some difficulties during these times, but nothing which is of significant and as mentioned before, we are securing the supply chain with both orders, inventory at hand and also inventory at supplier facilities. so we do not have disruptions to-date.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
okay. and then just the last one for me and i'll jump back into queue. obviously, the service revenue is a bit more macro sensitive. how should we think about that rebounding going forward? do you think q3 was the bottom? or -- i mean, i think at one point the goal was to grow that line about 10% on an annual basis. i mean, is that still the target, even with all the uncertainty out there?
dror david -- chief financial officer
yes. so as we've discussed before, the growth of the service business is highly correlated to the increase in the installed base. generally, this increase is between 5% and 10% a year, maybe 5% to 8%, and we still expect such growth rates in the future.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets -- analyst
okay, thanks a lot guys.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
we will take our next question from patrick ho with stifel.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
thank you very much and congrats on the nice quarter and outlook. eitan, maybe first off, aside from the smic situation, can you give a little bit of color of the traction you're seeing on the trailing edge foundry logic end at this time? it looks like that, that business segment is picking up ocd metrology, fits in well with some of the product in markets that are at the trailing edge. can you give a little bit of color on what you're seeing out there broadly speaking?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
yeah. so when we're looking right now on the demand and the foundry drivers across advanced nodes and trailing nodes, we roughly see a solid distribution over the year of around 70% coming from advanced nodes and around 30% coming from trailing nodes. the 30% that is coming from trailing nodes are divided between taiwan and china, where we see a growing demand coming from china along the quarter, where we definitely see the next -- at least the next two quarter is growing from this foundry demand from trailing edge in china.
there are two major foundry provider in china, and both of them actually grew significantly this year. and unless something is changing in the u.s.-china trade war next year, we expect that definitely one of them will continue growing. so if i need to expect what will come in 2021, it's the same distribution of around 70%, 30% where we have this leading foundry that will increase capacity and also the trailing edge nodes that will keep modestly growing next year as well.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
great, that's really helpful, eitan. and maybe as my follow-up question, obviously ocd metrology has been a beneficiary of the industry shift to 3d nand and the growth of wafer starts capacity in that marketplace. can you give me your thoughts on the dram space, both from a market perspective and what you think may occur? and secondly, the capital intensity trends, particularly as they go to 1z and 1 alpha, the need for more ocd metrology and possibly x-ray as well for those most advanced nodes.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
all right. so, when -- i need to divide it between the x-ray capabilities and materials shipments versus the ocd and the traditional dimensional demand. so if we're looking right now on ocd, currently, the most advanced sites are the foundry logic ones and every new node that is coming in, the intensity and the demand is growing per 1,000 wafers. after that, it's the vnands, that once you increase the cells or the number of cells, you increase the layers. but you also increase the stacks, from one stack to two stacks, which increase the number of layers that require ocd. and the third one is the dram. even scaling dram from 1x, 1y, 1z and even further actually increase a bit the intensity. but it's not large as vnand and vnand and -- sorry, nand and the foundry and logic.
if i'm going into the memory, i think that in the first place is the memory, including vnand and dram and the second place is foundry. so this is the way it goes. and the scale is the same, which means every new node that is coming in, the attach rate for x-ray tools, the xps' are actually increasing. so every new node that's introduced in memory is having more attach rate than foundry.
patrick ho -- stifel -- analyst
great, thank you very much.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, patrick.

[operator instructions] we will take our next question from mark miller with benchmark company.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
congrats on the quarter and your outlook. just was wondering, you indicated two new customers in china, were you shipping in the third quarter to these customers?
dror david -- chief financial officer
yes.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
and you anticipate shipping in the fourth quarter also?
dror david -- chief financial officer
yes.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
yes.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
you mentioned a higher attach rate for x-ray, just was wondering, next year, do you see x-ray and then software being a greater percent of your sales or similar to what you had this year?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so i referred to that -- to part of it in my script, when i said that we would like to converge x-ray to be a dimensional tool as well. so if i'm looking right now on next year, i'm looking right now on the x-ray tools to be driven by demands of both dimensional and materials, and we definitely see the x-ray tools' demands growing next year. okay? it's growing from attach rate perspective, it's growing from new customers, it's growing from the fact that it's growing in line and it's worth mentioning that our x-ray is non-destructive, very fast in-line tool. so it's growing with capacity and therefore we are definitely looking on x-ray growing next year.
regarding software, our long term model is talking about staying at around 10% of our product revenue. so if the product revenue will grow next year, the software revenue will grow as well. we are not taking it outside of the metrology space. so as we look on that, we would like to stick to the 10% number.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
with the x-ray growing next year, what is the impact on margins? will that be a slight improvement or stay the same?
dror david -- chief financial officer
more or less the same.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
okay. thank you.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer

good day, and welcome to nova's fourth quarter 2020 results. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to miri segal of ms-ir. please go ahead.
miri segal -- ms-ir llc, investor relations
thank you, operator, and good day to everybody. i would like to welcome all of you to nova's fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results conference call. with us on the line today are mr. eitan oppenhaim, president and ceo; and mr. dror david, cfo. before we begin, may i remind our listeners that certain information provided on this call may contain forward-looking statements, and the safe harbor statement outlined in today's earnings release also pertains to this call. if you have not received a copy of the release, please view it in the investor relations section of the company's website. eitan will begin the call with a business update, followed by dror with an overview of the financials. we will then open the call for the question-and-answer session.
i'll now turn over the call to mr. eitan oppenhaim, nova's president and ceo. eitan, please go ahead.
eitan oppenhaim -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, miri and thank you all for joining us today. i will start the call by speaking briefly about our fourth quarter results and performance highlights. i will then spend some time summarizing 2020 and our main achievements for the year. following my commentary, dror will review the quarterly and annual financial results in detail including the guidance for the first quarter of 2021. nova reported remarkable results for the fourth quarter with revenue exceeding the guidance and profitability reaching the high-end of the guidance demonstrating our growing agility and solid execution capabilities the company resilience amid the pandemic led by our global teams drove exceptional performance in the quarter and throughout the year.
our robust quarterly results concluded a record year representing an annual growth rate of 20% in our revenue and 30% in our non-gaap earnings. this was a strong conclusion to a well-performed year during which we continued to innovate and expand our differentiated technology to support our customers' growing demand. the positive market reception of our product offering and our sound operational model support our momentum to continue our growth in 2021 as well. the accelerated demand for new complex semiconductors across the industry represent a significant compelling technology event affecting all semi segment including logic dram and flash nand.
these trends continued to expand our available markets and increased the attractiveness of our materials and dimensional portfolios in the coming years. following our successful product introductions in 2020 we believe that nova is well-positioned to increase its footprint and market share across multiple customers in 2021. our accomplishments this year highlight the agility and resiliency that the company developed along the year to support our growing activity despite the challenging environment imposed by the covid disruptions. turning now to our quarterly highlights, our performance was driven by a mix of technology enhancement, product introductions and business wins reflecting our progress to meet nova's long-term organic targets. the revenue for the quarter reached a record high representing 10% sequential growth from the third quarter of 2020.
based on the recent market dynamics, our quarterly sales were driven primarily by strong demand in logic. the current demand for both advanced and mature logic devices concluded a very healthy year for our logic customers. in the current environment, the leading edge customers are required to accelerate their advance node transitions to meet the growing demand for high computing applications like 5g, ai and hpcs. on the other hand, the acceleration in digital evolution in many applications also drive demand for the more mature nodes across various markets such as consumers, automotive and industrial. as a result, our quarterly mix was weighted toward logic with around 72% of the revenue derived from this segment.
although we just started 2021, we expect the same healthy demand to continue across various logic generations this year as well. although 2020 was more robust in logic demand, our memory customers also started to increase their investment in the fourth quarter mainly in dram, which grew more than 25% sequentially in our quarterly revenue mix. we expect this moderate growth to continue in 2021 as well in other various memory segments. the evolving semi market during covid is also fueling memory demand across broadening application space. as a result of decreasing inventories and more balanced supply demand levels we expect a better investment cycle in memory both in nand and dram throughout 2021.
our progress along the year to balance our revenue mix is highlighted also this quarter by the customer mix, which yielded three major customers that contributed more than 10% each to our revenue. this includes a leading foundry manufacturer, a leading memory provider and a growing foundry in china. one of the more notable achievement in the fourth quarter was the record revenue contribution from our materials metrology sales. during the quarter we received multiple orders from multiple leading logic customers for our most advanced material metrology solutions. the bookings were for nova's veraflex materials metrology platform, which provide breakthrough thin film thickness and composition process control capabilities for the current and emerging technology nodes.
the recent wins marks nova's growing penetration into all leading industry manufacturer and cement nova's position as a material metrology leader. as part of a consistent approach to expand our exposure to more materials applications we announced in december the launch of nova elipson a revolutionary materials metrology solution. the new in-line stand-alone metrology platform is designed to measure materials properties such as stress, strain and surface for both memory and logic applications. following the announcement and the outstanding progress we had with multiple customers we recognized the initial revenues from several accounts already in 2020. let me now shine some light on our yearly benefits. nova's quarterly performance signifies an optimistic add note to a challenging year in which covid-19 threatened world stability.
we concluded the year better than previously anticipated -- growing our revenue to a record high representing a compound annual growth rate of 13% for the past plus five years. our profitability continued to strengthen as well with net income earnings growing significantly also year-over-year. during these disruptive periods multiple factors contributed to our strong performance in 2020 and i would like to mention four major ones. first, is the advanced operational model that we built during this period to allow better agility and resilience, which allow nova to function well and adopt faster to the changing conditions. this model is currently guiding our product development cycles, go-to-market strategies, flexible lead times, tighter supply chains, a safer environment for employees, stronger territories support and robust recovery plans.
as a result we continue our manufacturing plans according to customers' demand and increased capacity by around 25% without a single shutdown day. additionally and in light of the continued travel restrictions we invested significantly this year to strengthen our global teams by increasing professional headcount and expanding the facilities around the globe to shorten customer response and time to service. second is the enhanced product portfolio we introduced during the year. our investment in research and development, which grew at around 20% year-over-year was focused on two main pillars; introducing new product generations both in the optical and x-ray lines, and the development of entirely new products from the ground up. in light of the technology involvement in the industry we introduced a new generation platform to all our traditional product lines including the integrated and stand-alone ocd, the advanced software package and xps.
all of them are already installed, accepted and generating revenues. regarding our new innovations we continue to proliferate the newly introduced prism platform in multiple accounts gaining share and winning new positions in both memory and logic. on this front, we are also excited this year to introduce the elipson, a new materials metrology platform based on raman technology that aims to deliver additional materials information like stress and strain unmatched by any other inline materials metrology system. as a result of this product initiatives in both our sustained and new innovative portfolio we could reach record annual revenues in both the stand-alone and integrated optical cd metrology growing significantly year-over-year.
the third highlight i would like to mention is the continued diversification of our revenue mix that allows us to mitigate different demand cycles in the industry. although this year was weighted toward logic with roughly 68% of revenue contribution, we also had significant win and penetrations into other customers including a large ibm global memory manufacturer and other accounts in china. this creates a healthy balanced mix that will continue to support our long-term strategic targets and interim growth plan in 2021. the last highlight i would like to mention in regard to 2020 is the growing importance we have been given to our social responsibility plan. the reality of covid-19 solidified our commitment to support communities across the globe.
over the past year, we proactively supported our partners and customers as well as families, individuals and health organizations in the communities. our recently announced corporate social responsibility strategy is a natural evolution of our ongoing practice aiming to continuously enhance our ethical, social and environmental performance. we are committed to incorporating social responsibility into our daily operations and business management while inviting all stakeholders into our socially responsible ecosystem. to wrap up and before i hand over the call to dror let me briefly summarize our results and market position going into 2021.
despite continuous disruptions and growing challenges associated with the pandemic spread, nova's global teams adapted quickly to the new dynamic environment performing well and driving a solid growth year. while the industry is going through tremendous structural changes and adjusting to the different demand catalysts as a result of the accelerated transition to a more data-driven world, our offering is rapidly evolving to meet these changes and expand our available markets. even our agile operational model, innovative portfolio, new product rollouts and growing exposure to a broader opportunity range we believe that nova is well-positioned to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities in 2021 as well.
now, let me hand over the call to dror to review our financial results in details. dror?
dror david -- chief financial officer
thanks, eitan. good day everyone. total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020 exceeded our previously announced guidance and reached an all-time record of $76 million, 18% higher than the fourth quarter of 2019. product revenue distribution was approximately 70% from logic and foundry and approximately 30% from memory. geographically, taiwan and korea each contributed more than 20% to our product revenues while china contributed slightly less than 20%. on a per customer basis, three major customers contributed 10% or more to our product revenues including two foundry customers and one memory customer. blended gross margin in the fourth quarter was 55% on a gaap basis and 56% on a non-gaap basis.
product gross margin increased to 63% on a gaap basis and 64% on a non-gaap basis due to favorable product mix. service gross margin reduced to 22% on a gaap basis and 23% on a non-gaap basis due to lower revenue levels, less favorable mix between contracts and time and materials, higher materials consumption for warranty and contracts and end of year inventory related adjustments. operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 on a gaap basis increased to $25 million and included a one-time income of $2.9 million presented in general and administration related to cash recovery of an unauthorized transaction previously made by a financial institution.
operating expenses in the fourth quarter on a non-gaap basis increased to $26 million reflecting increased headcount and end-year closing costs as well as the impact of unfavorable israel currency exchange rate. in the fourth quarter of 2020 the company presented net financial expenses on a gaap basis due to $0.9 million of expenses related to amortization of debt discount and issuance costs from the october convertible note issuance and $1.4 million of expenses related to the reevaluation of our operating lease liabilities as a result of the unfavorable israel currency exchange rate. both of these financial expense elements were adjusted for non-gaap purposes. earnings per share on a gaap bases in the quarter were $0.47 per diluted share above our guidance of $0.32 to $0.43 for the quarter mainly as a result of the previously mentioned onetime income of $2.9 million.
earnings per share on a non-gaap basis in the quarter were $0.55 per diluted share at the high end of our guidance of $0.45 to $0.56. on an annual basis, revenue grew 20% year-over-year to over $269 million in 2020. product revenue distribution on an annual basis was approximately 70% from logic and foundry and approximately 30% from memory. geographically, taiwan, korea and china each contributed between 20% and 30% to our product revenues. on a per customer basis, three major customers contributed 10% or more to product revenues including two foundry customers and one memory customer. annual blended gross margin was 57% within our target model range.
product gross margin grew to 62% on a gaap basis and 63% on a non-gaap basis as a result of significantly higher revenues utilizing similar infrastructure as well as favorable product mix. service gross margin reduced to 37% on a gaap basis and 38% on a non-gaap basis mainly due to higher personnel and material costs. operating expenses in 2020 grew approximately 15% year-over-year mainly in research and development reflecting the significant investments in developing, introducing and proliferating new technologies and products. operating margin in 2020 grew to 21% on a gaap basis and 24% on a non-gaap basis. effective tax rate in 2020 was approximately 15%.
in 2020, earnings per share on a gaap basis grew to $1.65 per diluted share, while earnings per share on a non-gaap basis grew to $2.06 representing a 30% year-over-year growth, which significantly outpaced the revenue growth in the same year. in 2020, we generated free cash flow of $54 million and in parallel successfully concluded a 0% convertible bond offering in the amount of $200 million. as a result, we enter 2021 with gross cash reserves in excess of $420 million, which enables us to pursue business opportunities within the year.
moving into our outlook for the first quarter of 2021, we expect the following: revenues to be between $76 million to $83 million, gaap earnings per diluted share between $0.41 and $0.53, non- gaap earnings per diluted share between $0.55 and $0.66. at the midpoint of the first quarter guidance, we expect the following: blended gross margin to be approximately 57%, while service gross margin is expected to increase to between 35% to 38%. operating expenses to be approximately $27.5 million on a gaap basis and approximately $25 million on a non-gaap basis. effective tax rate to be approximately 15% in the first quarter of 2021 and throughout the year.
with that, i will turn the call back to eitan. eitan?
eitan oppenhaim -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, dror. with that we will be pleased to take your questions. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] we now take our first question from quinn bolton from needham and company. please go ahead. your line is open.
n. quinn bolton -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
hey, guys. congratulations on the strong finish to 2021 and a very strong first quarter guidance. i guess my first question for you as you sit here today looking into 2021 you've guided us to a very strong first quarter. i'm wondering if you could make any comments about how sustainable you think that that revenue level is? there's been a debate among some of your wfe peers about whether spending in 2021 would be sort of front half loaded, balanced or second half weighted? i'm just -- would love your perspective as you sit and you look at your order book and your backlog. what do you think your revenue profile this year is front half weighted or more balanced through the year? thank you.
eitan oppenhaim -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, quinn and it's eitan here. so regarding the market review and what we should expect in 2021. so as i said in my prepared remark entering in 2021 there are two main catalysts that fueled the growth at least in the first half, which is the healthy demand in logic foundry that will continue at least in the first half. and secondly, is the growing investment in dram. now regarding the second half as you know although we don't guide for the year and the visibility right now for the q4 is not so great. i can be cautious and say that i support the analysts and the prediction in the market that saying that the wfe in 2021 will grow at around 10% to 15%. i think that if you looking right now on the segments i think that h1 probably will be fueled by logic and foundry. if i'm looking on the second half, the foundry and logic will continue on the same healthy demand basically on the 7 nanometer, 5 nanometer, 3 nanometer. and i think that that nand -- mainly vnand will be added in the second half as well, ok? so i am looking right now on a balance here at least from our prediction.
n. quinn bolton -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
great. and then for dror, you mentioned that the appreciation of the shekel was one of the things that added to costs in the fourth quarter. just wondering as you're looking to 2021 you've given us opex guidance for the first quarter. how are you thinking about foreign currency exchange? do you expect that those are going to remain elevated costs and leads to higher opex this year, or how are you thinking about that sort of that foreign exchange effect on opex in 2021?
dror david -- chief financial officer
yeah. so obviously it's hard to predict these economic elements of the market. what i can say is that during the first quarter the foreign exchange rate did hit some kind of a low level and started recovering since then. our guidance for the first quarter is already embedding an additional small impact as a result of that and assuming the currency will remain stable at these levels again. it did hit some kind of a low in january. so expenses will not get another hit from that aspect in the coming quarters.
n. quinn bolton -- needham & company, llc -- analyst
okay, great. thank you.
eitan oppenhaim -- president & chief executive officer
thanks.
operator
we will now move to our next question from atif malik from citi. please go ahead. your line is open.
atif malik -- citigroup -- analyst
hi. thank you for taking my questions and good job on the [indecipherable] guide. eitan, first on the logic demand very strong last year, if you can parse the metrology demand between matured technologies versus leading edge? and also if you can comment on the intensity of your products as you move to 3d be it all around devices, the 5 nanometer and 3 nanometer?
eitan oppenhaim -- president & chief executive officer
thanks, atif for the question. so if we're looking right now on metrology intensity, well, there are two pillars. the first pillar is that always in logic foundry the intensity is higher or the highest in the semi segments after that is the dram and at the end is the vnand, ok, or the nand. this is the way that the intensity has been allocated. the reason is that mainly that in foundry there are many products and there are changes also in the materials and the dimension. and as you go along to the dram and the vnand the number of products is reduced and it's more a stable product.
so the intensity wise is always higher in the logic foundry. so this is one pillar. the second pillar is always when you are moving to a new generation of a chip and you are moving to a new complex device and the current movements that we see that -- the logic is moving to a three and two in -- and changing also the architectural structure to go to nanowires and changing the materials and also if you're looking right now on the memory as well, when you are scaling down the device, of course every change on every -- a move to a new generation is increasing the intensity itself for the segment.
so if you have both logic and the memory as we see that in 2021 replacing generations and also changing and replacing materials and going to a very complex devices of course -- the intensity is going up. we need to always when we're talking about intensity try to offset it by the capacity, right? so if your intensity is going higher and capacity is not going on the same level. so then you have some offset, but if you are normalizing it to 100 wafers or 1,000 wafers always logic and foundry is higher and when you're looking right now on the next one year all the intensity and the tax rate in all the new technology nodes are going to be higher as well.
atif malik -- citigroup -- analyst
great. and as my follow-up, if you can talk about what's driving the service gross margins higher in the march quarter? is it just the volume and thank you for baking out the two margins?
dror david -- chief financial officer
yeah, sure. so obviously the phenomena in q4 was a one-time phenomenon related to the aspect that i mentioned before more materials consumption in the specific quarter and end-year adjustment. so actually what we see in the first quarter is that service gross margins are returning to the normalized level. and this is what you should expect along the year. if we will see pickup in service revenues along the year, margins can even further improve from these levels.
atif malik -- citigroup -- analyst
thank you.

we will now move to our next question from mark miller from the benchmark company. please go ahead. your line is open.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
based on the midpoint of your guidance it appears, r&d went up significantly last quarter and it looks like that trend is going to be continuing in 2021. is that correct?
dror david -- chief financial officer
yes.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
okay. taiwan semiconductor is putting up a major fab in arizona. it's a key customer view. are orders starting to flow in from that or is that could be later in this year?
eitan oppenhaim -- president & chief executive officer
so the orders for the arizona fab will probably start to arrive and then i don't know the orders and i don't know when exactly they are going to come but probably toward the end of the year.
mark miller -- the benchmark company -- analyst
thank you.
operator
and we'll now move to our next question from jaeson schmidt from lake street. please go ahead. your line is open.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets, llc -- analyst
hey guys. thanks for taking my questions. i think at one-time there was talk that the goal for the service revenue line would be sort of targeting 10% growth. is that still a good ballpark growth rate to think about for that revenue stream?
dror david -- chief financial officer
well, i would say the following, our current assumption for services growth is between 5% and 10% depending on the install base growth and also value-added services in this specific year. so obviously this year it was around 5%. there could be years where it's going up to approximately 10%. but it's between this level, 5% to 10% a year.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets, llc -- analyst
okay. that's helpful. and then just as a follow-up, just curious if you saw any constraints on the supply side in q4 or if you are anticipating any going forward here in the near term?
eitan oppenhaim -- president & chief executive officer
so jaeson, if you're talking about the supply chain for our production facilities, i think that we managed very well in 2020 trying to secure everything that we can in the supply chain. so, it means that we increase the inventories and you'll see that in our financial reports. and also we tried to qualify actually a second or third supplier in each one of our elements in the supply chain. and the way that we are looking forward is trying to -- try to order and try to make sure that we have enough capacity for the next six to nine months and this is secured. and we need also to remember that we need to secure extra capacity because we see a growth in the production. but regarding the bottom line, we don't see any disruption currently. so if the worst is behind us through 2020 and we could succeed increasing the production, i think that 2021 can be the same and even higher.
jaeson schmidt -- lake street capital markets, llc -- analyst
okay. thanks a lot guys.
operator
and we will now take our next question from patrick ho from stifel. please go ahead. your line is open.
patrick j. ho -- stifel -- analyst
thank you very much, and congrats on the nice finish to the year. eitan, maybe first off on the materials metrology front, it's good to see the traction and the adoption very quickly for these new products. as you look at the memory side of things and you mentioned dram has higher metrology intensity. can you maybe give a little more color on some of the applications and some of the potential wins on the memory side with the materials, metrology offerings that you have today.
eitan oppenhaim -- president & chief executive officer
yeah, thanks patrick for the question. so the two main applications that are running on the -- specifically on the x-ray or the previously revera products is the composition, material composition and ultra-thin thickness measurement, ok? this is the two main applications and we are running on these two applications in all the customers. now, because it's a unique metrology capabilities, the way that it started, it started from taking it from 2015 from the lab to fab, which started with a couple of system per phase or per fab. some of them were in r&d, some of them were in production and in the last five years we could move those tools to be real in-die, in line production tools so once you move them to in line and in production you also improve the attach rate and the intensity.
so once you start to get the customer's confidence because it's non-destructive and it's becoming a very fast meteorology capability you start to get into the fab with more capacity, more attach rate and more intensity. i can say that without getting to the exact numbers but the distribution between memory and foundry or logic it's around 50%, 50% so we have applications coming from the memory mainly the win on sides when they're changing materials and they're starting to have a very old thickness applications and also for the logic and foundry when they are moving to a new structure. so it's two different directions. but both of them are increasing the intensity of the usage once we move to be in line and in-die systems that have the capability to measure really fast.
patrick j. ho -- stifel -- analyst
right. that's really helpful. and maybe as my follow up question it's good to see the services business continue to grow. and you mentioned the margin improvements as we move forward into 1q. maybe draw from that standpoint on the margin improvements. how much is the service business evolving where you're helping customers more not only with the traditional type of services -- breaking fixed type of model but would enhance features and enhance products, upgrade. how much of that is contributing to the services growth as well as the uptick in margins?
dror david -- chief financial officer
that's a good point, patrick, because actually in 2020 at least in the first half of the year because of the situation of the covid-19 the ability to enter the fab and do these mega projects of upgrade cycles was a little bit limited. and this probably had some impact on the growth of the services in 2020, which was at the low end of the 5% to 10% that i mentioned. looking forward when we move into 2021 obviously these limitations are less significant. and hopefully this can contribute more to our revenues in 2021 and hence accelerate the growth of services in [indecipherable]
patrick j. ho -- stifel -- analyst
great. thank you very much again.
eitan oppenhaim -- president & chief executive officer
thank you, patrick.

[operator instructions] we now take our next question from krish sankar from cowen and co. please go ahead. your line is open.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the really strong results. eitan or dror, one quick question now look at your calendar '20 numbers. you guys definitely seem to have grown really nicely both the outperformed industry growth and also some of your peers. so i'm kind of curious is there a way you can quantify how much of your growth came from share gains and which vertical were those share gains? was it in foundry, logic or memory? and then i had a follow up.
eitan oppenhaim -- president & chief executive officer
so krish, thank you very much for the question. so we are looking right now on the average growth in the market, as you said it was around 15%. and if you're looking right now on our products, growth rate in the year was above 25%. so i think that there were two strong catalyst to our growth. one of course is capacity because capacity demand is growing in all segments. and the second is purely share gains but i they cannot mention exactly where. but once you are doing outperformance, it's either you open a new market or you're taking a market share in this specific year. as i said in my prepared remark, we took market share in a one big idm as i discussed before and i mentioned it in a couple of my calls as well as in a global memory customer that took our old portfolio starting from integrated stand-alone as well as materials and software.
and it's also adding to that is couple of other customers in china that in some of them we are holding a high percentage of market share in light of the performance this year so definitely there is increase in market share this year on top of the demand. and i also would mention that if we're looking right now on 2021, it's the new product that we are bringing in will probably open new applications that were not answered in production for many years. so we can increase beside the market share also getting applications that were measured before in the lab and now is moving to in-line production.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. got it. very impressive. and then i just had a quick follow up. thanks for the color on the service and product gross margin. at a op margin level, is it fair to assume service and products have similar op margins?
dror david -- chief financial officer
can you repeat the question?
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
the service and product divisions from a op margin level, are they similar to corporate average? in other words, services has lower opex, lower r&d. so it's similar to that op margin level similar to products?
dror david -- chief financial officer
yeah. so actually the situation is that the service business as a whole is heavy on personnel and headcount and field service engineers in the field, relative to maybe products, which is more heavy on materials. so practically this is the main reason for the difference between gross margins of services and products. service is around 40% and product is around 60%. again the main reason is that the infrastructure of the service organization is heavy on headcount and personnel across the globe -- it's 150 sites and so forth.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. all right. thank you very much appreciate the color. thank you.

operator
good day, and welcome to nova's first quarter 2021 results. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to miri segal of ms-ir. please go ahead.
miri segal-scharia -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator, and good day to everybody. i would like to welcome all of you to nova's first quarter 2021 financial results conference call. with us on the line today are mr. eitan oppenheim, president and ceo; and mr. dror david, cfo.
before we begin, may i remind our listeners that certain information provided on this call may contain forward-looking statements and the safe harbor statement outlined in today's earnings release also pertains to this call. if you have not received a copy of the release, please view it in the investor relations section of the company's website.
eitan will begin the call with a business update, followed by dror with an overview of the financials. we will then open the call for the question-and-answer session. i'll now hand over the call to mr. eitan oppenheim nova's president and ceo. eitan, please go ahead.
eitan oppenhaim -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, miri, and thank you all for joining our first quarter financial results conference call. i will start the call today by speaking about our first-quarter results and performance highlights. following my commentary, dror will review the quarter's financial results in detail, and we'll conclude with the guidance for the second quarter of 2021. nova continued to perform well in the first quarter of the year, delivering outstanding results and exceeding both our revenue and profitability guidance.
the growth in our business momentum as reflected in our financial results is driven by our entire product portfolio across markets, customers, and technology nodes. our revenue grew a 38% year-over-year to a record high, while our non-gaap net profit grew at 52% year-over-year to a record level as well. during this remarkable quarter, we also achieved record bookings and operating cash flow. the solid growth momentum this quarter and the outstanding performance we demonstrated along the last year could be accomplished only by consistently executing our strategic road map while creating greater agility in our operational model. the flexibility we have built into our operating model, combined with the investment we have made to secure our supply chain during covid-19, enabled us to ramp up our production capacity by more than 30% to meet on-time delivery in these surging markets.
our differentiated portfolio, honed by our commitment to innovation continues to amplify our position with leading customers as we address their challenging technical transition to new generations of semiconductors, which combine innovative complex architectures with new novel materials. our achievement this quarter marked another successful milestone in our healthy growth trajectory for this year as we expand our market presence and deploy our new leading-edge technologies.
nova's diverse revenue across multiple device segment is a result of the growing demand at the end markets for the electronics, which continues shaping the growing demand at the semiconductor fabrication supply chain. the main catalysts are driven by the growing digitization of multiple industries and include improvements in data management, network infrastructure, and broader usage of ai in different markets. in addition to pure demand for silicon, and in order to support these dynamic changes, the complexity embedded in building next-generation technology nodes requires a breed of innovative products, specifically in process control, to support the development and fabrication of new advanced memory and logic devices.
furthermore, in addition to these current demand factors, customers are more focused on growing their investment by optimizing productivity and diversifying their investment across multiple regions. when combined, these elements of accelerated technology transitions increasing complexity in new advanced nodes and new investments in geographical distribution drives strong healthy wfe spending in 2021 and beyond. in this favorable environment, nova is well-positioned to capture more opportunities with its dimensional and materials unique process control solutions. zooming into our quarterly achievements, i would like to highlight several business and technology milestones, which will also impact the rest of the year.
this quarter's revenue was driven by record contribution from both our products and service sales, which included a mix of technology, functionality, and productivity enhancements to the installed base. the growth in our traditional ocd and xps business, along with several new technology and business wins and the increasing volume in our service business reflects our progress and the momentum to meet our long-term organic targets. the broad diversity in our revenue stream across segments, territories, and customers was maintained in this first quarter reflecting ongoing robust demand for both trailing edge and advanced 5, three, and 2-nanometer logic devices across customers and territories. in addition, memory grew significantly compared to the previous quarter as we leveraged our strategic exposure and new technology wins in both dram and vnand.
the wide exposure we have built to both logic and memory is reflected also in our customer mix, with four major customers that contributed more than 10% each to our revenue mix. this includes two of the world's leading memory customers, the world's largest foundry and a leading chinese customer. this mix of different customers in different geographies is reflective of our wins in different markets and will accompany the company throughout the year. during the current investment cycle, the leading customers are going through fundamental technology changes in the way they process new devices. in the 3d nand road map, we have started to see evolvement to multi-stack scaling to contain more memory layers.
the new design creates new challenges in both higher-spec ratio applications, tilting, and ultra team layers with new materials. the prism with its unique channels and advanced data interpretation was created in order to provide the right sensitivity to these dimensional challenges. following the introduction of the platform, we are expanding our penetration to more memory customers globally, which benefits from faster time to solution and advanced process control that can't be achieved with any of the traditional optic methods. in the first quarter, we continued our penetration efforts and established multiple new evaluations with leading memory customers that will decide on their capacity expansion later this year.
on the material side, these new devices require a better approach to the way composition and ultra tim sims are controlled. and following our introduction of the veraflex iv xps platform, we see more traction with memory customers as demand for high throughput and high-precision inline metrology growth. i would like to mention again and refer to some competitive comments that this is non-destructive in-line high productivity tool, which measures tens of wafers every hour. as a result of this growing demand, xps sales contribution maintained its record sales level in this quarter as well. in the logic foundry, new device architectures are introduced as well to meet the required performance of the high-end market. beyond continued scaling to three and two nanometer, the leading manufacturers are adopting 3d structures like gate all around and nanochips.
the combination of scaling and new dimensional structures creates new process challenges, which drive higher metrology intensity and new measurement schemes around in-die in-line capabilities. the surge in demand for logic chips, along with the technology transition to enhanced architecture drove high demand for all our platforms with integrated metrology, reaching another sharp increase to a record high. in this manner, we are very encouraged with the market adoption of our newly introduced i-570 integrated metrology platform that was designed to measure complex 3d structures, improving precision, productivity, and sensitivity. multiple tools have already been installed in the field and are forecast to grow during the year. another highlight i would like to mention in the progress we are making in introducing new products, which is the software solutions.
hanging high-end applications in advanced nodes calls for more innovative solutions as tighter process specifications require more complicated metrology measurements while maintaining fast pints of solution. our product strategy is built on combining advanced hardware platforms and state-of-the-art machine learning and ai software engines. our software strategy brings a holistic approach that is built on four elements, physical modeling enhanced with mathematical modeling for accurate and fast measurements and fleet management with automatic preventive maintenance, which focuses on two performance control and enhancements. by adopting more software elements, we opened the metrology ecosystem to other references of other process control technologies and by that improves nova's capabilities to provide better results to its customers. our long-term software revenue goal beyond the system traditional sequencing software remains intact with the efforts to reach at least 10% of our product revenue.
finally, all these successful business and technology milestones are reflected in our growing bookings, which reached new quarterly record and drove a strong book-to-bill ratio. the fundamentals in the current market, along with our achievements in the first quarter, support our ambition to outperform this year as well. before i hand over the call to dror to explain our financial highlights in more detail, i would like to recap our position post-q1 results. we are in an environment where industry fundamentals are strong, demand is healthy, and complex technical transitions are taking place. moreover, semiconductor manufacturers are spending in large breeds of technology nodes, geographical presence, and new process methods, combining new materials with dimensional scaling.
based on our newly introduced products and technologies, nova is well-positioned at the four front of technology innovations to meet customers' requirements and road map. based on our diversified portfolio and exposure, solid operational leverage that has proven itself during covid-19 pandemic, and our strong local teams we expect to continue our organic growth in the current cycle to meet our long-term strategic goals. alongside with the guidance, we provided for the second quarter of 2021, we expect roughly 40% growth in revenue in the first half of 2021 versus the first half of 2020. now let me hand over the call to dror to review our financial results in detail. dror?
dror david -- chief financial officer
thanks, eitan. good day, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2021 conference call. total revenues in the first quarter of this year exceeded our guidance and reached an all-time record of $84 million, representing a 38% growth compared to the first quarter of 2020. looking at product revenue distribution, approximately 65% was attributed to logic and foundry and approximately 35% to memory.
geographically, taiwan and korea, each contributed more than 25% to our product revenues, while china was slightly under 20%. on a per-customer basis, four major customers accounted each for over 10% to our product revenues, including two foundry customers and two memory customers. blended gross margin in the first quarter increased to 57%. product gross margin came in at 62%, while service gross margin increased to a normalized level of 39%. operating expenses for the quarter increased to $28.2 million on a gaap basis and $25.8 million on a non-gaap basis.
sales and marketing expenses increased in the quarter mainly due to higher sales commission expenses, expenses, and other costs of sales personnel. on a non-gaap basis, we expect sales and marketing expenses to normalize between $8 million and $8.5 million in the upcoming quarters. effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2021 was approximately 13%, slightly lower than our effective tax rate model of 15%. the earnings per share on a gaap basis was $0.60 per diluted share and earnings per share on a non-gaap basis was $0.70 per diluted share, both exceeding the company guidance for the quarter and representing a new record for quarterly earnings per share. moving on to cash flow.
the company generated $33 million in free cash flow an all-time record for the company. this significant increase in free cash flow was also driven by efficient management of working capital, keeping sales outstanding at 66 days and inventory turnover ratio at 2.3 times a year. finally, i'd like to share our guidance. we expect the following for the second quarter of 2021. revenues to be between $84 million and $92 million, gaap earnings per diluted share to range from $0.51 to $0.64. non-gaap earnings per diluted share to range from $0.64 to $0.77.
at the midpoint of our second-quarter estimates, we expect gross margins to remain at similar levels as the first quarter of this year. operating expenses to reach approximately $29 million on a gaap basis and approximately $26 million on a non-gaap basis and effective tax rate of approximately 15%. with that, i will turn the call back to eitan.
eitan oppenhaim -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you, dror. before we take your questions, i would like to use this opportunity to thank once again nova's employees for their dedication and outstanding efforts, leading to these record results during this dynamic an uncertain periods. the past year has been a truth test of three of grid and resilience of the company and our local team across the globe. they didn't miss a bit along the year. our local offices were strengthened tremendously to maintain top-quality service for our global customers and to capitalize on various emerging opportunities.
our production teams never stopped working sometimes around the clock to ensure we deliver on our promises and mid-market demand. and every single one of nova's employees stepped up to the challenge and did their part. as we gradually and cautiously resume our familiar working routines, starting from israel, where 97% of the employees are vaccinated. i would like to take to thank each and every one of them for their contribution to our performance and ongoing success. with that final note, we will be pleased to take your questions. operator?

operator
[operator instructions] we will now take our first question from quinn bolton from needham.
nathaniel quinn bolton -- - needham & company, llc -- senior analyst
congratulations on the great results. i wanted to start first with maybe a clarification drawer it looks like deferred revenue on the balance sheet jumped up pretty meaningfully and maybe to a record level. wondering if you could discuss what led to that increase? is it reflecting greater software sales that are recognized over time. is there a service component to that? or could it be associated with some of the new tools that you're putting into the field?
dror david -- chief financial officer
yes. so the deferred revenues did increase significantly in the first quarter, and most of the increase is related to the new products that we are introducing into the market. we have a few of these in several product lines. and in some cases, we installed the tool, the customer is already paying, and the acceptance is actually being delayed to a later period. so most of this increase is related to these new product introductions.
nathaniel quinn bolton -- - needham & company, llc -- senior analyst
great. the second question i have is many of your peers are citing sort of growing capacity constraints that may be starting to limit upside in the second quarter or perhaps even in the second half. wondering if you're having or seeing a supply chain constraints that might be limiting your near-term outlook, either again in the second quarter and the second half, whether it be semiconductors, whether it be passive devices, anything else that go into your systems?
eitan oppenhaim -- president, chief executive officer and director
so the answer is no. we took a lot of actions during 2020 in order to expand both ore production capacity as well as securing the supply chain from the understanding that once everybody will go out from the corona, we'll have here an over-demand issue with the supply chain.
we secured both our inventory as well as the production capabilities, both in israel and the u.s. and in taiwan. and currently looking in 2021, we don't see any issue coming from either productivity perspective or supply chain. and everything is based on the current situation, if something will change economically or from the from the covid perspective then we need to evaluate again. but as it looks right now, we don't have constraints to increase capacity.
nathaniel quinn bolton -- - needham & company, llc -- senior analyst
okay. great. and then on for you. my last question is it sounds like you've got an increasing number of prism and lift on tools out in eval. but just wondering if you could give us any sense on other new technologies you're developing, whether those technologies would be more in the dimensional space or the material space?
eitan oppenhaim -- president, chief executive officer and director
so obviously, once we release those technologies to the market, we will announce it. i think that on the current growth path that we have and the surge in demand for the current products that we have, it will take a few quarters more in order to introduce more new technologies.
but definitely, the two areas that we are focusing right now or the three areas we are focusing right now. one is finding a new channel of information for the dimensional part and one of them you saw as the --. the second pillar will be more products on the material side because it's becoming a real issue to measure the profile composition, stress of those materials. and you saw the you saw the -- coming in. and the third element is more and more software, machine learning elements as they are compensating part of the hardware that will be very tough to reach in this tight windows and type specification that the customers are asking.
so most of the development right now or most of the investment right now goes into these three directions.
operator
we will have our next question from jamie zakalik from bank of america.
jamie rebecca zakalik -- bank of america securities -- research analyst
congrats on the great results. i had a question on china. so how are you guys seeing demand from the domestic china region? i think some of your peers have mentioned they expect domestic china -- this year to be around $10 billion, maybe slightly higher. so what's been your visibility into demand? and has the incremental upside you've seen been concentrated in any specific region?
eitan oppenhaim -- president, chief executive officer and director
so thanks for the questions. so let's start from the second question. regarding the geographical distribution of the revenue, we definitely in the first quarter, seen more demand coming from korea. actually, it was a record revenue for us coming from korea this quarter. so we see growth both in dram, logic and vnand coming from korea during the first quarter. taiwan is already elevated with a larger foundry over there that is spending both on 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer.
and regarding to china, we do see increasement of investment in the local domestic in china. the fact that we what part of our product can shift from israel, allow us to gain market share as well as to get into those investment scheme much easier than part of our peers, and we are enjoying from that. and if we are looking right now on the distribution over the year, china is very stable to us across the four quarters with some options for upside from domestic -- both domestic memory and domestic foundry in china.
jamie rebecca zakalik -- bank of america securities -- research analyst
got it. that's very helpful. and then you guys talked about a number of impressive product offerings. i kind of wanted to ask a little bit more about the new elipson tool. can you discuss what's driving the need for this specific tool, how it's really different from what else is in the industry? and any color on customer momentum so far?
eitan oppenhaim -- president, chief executive officer and director
so if i'm looking right now on the total portfolio of nova for material measurement, it's very unique, and it's one of a kind in the market. actually, both for the xps and the elipson, those are products that used to be measuring materials characterization in the laboratories. and what we did, actually, we took them into their production, and we took them to applications that are in line in-die. and besides nova, i -- there isn't any other competitors in the market that is doing either composition or stress with any other technology in the market.
so for that uniqueness, that you are taking some technologies that would not exist today in the production and taking it from a very slow laboratory tool and bring it to high-volume productivity in the fab itself. it's creating a lot of demand. now regarding the application itself, we need to understand right now that in order to improve today's performance on a chip, if previously everybody talked about the more law and scaling, today, it's a combination of scaling, which is dimensions and a lot of investment in materials.
so we do see in the future as we see in the last few quarters with our materials portfolio, a lot of demand for materials measurement. it's always running around composition, stress, strength, crystallinity of the silicon and many other materials measurement that are really needed today in process control, and we are very unique in that.
jamie rebecca zakalik -- bank of america securities -- research analyst
got it. and if i could squeeze one more in. some of your peers have mentioned that they now expect wfe to be back half loaded this year. are you seeing the same? and what does that mean for your revenue profile throughout the year?
eitan oppenhaim -- president, chief executive officer and director
so usually, we don't give guidance beyond the quarter, and i'm saying it always in the first quarter. it will be a bit naive to look on the fourth quarter and assume that that we know exactly what is the visibility in the fourth quarter. and we see this upside in the second half, but i think that the second half will be better than the first half, but we don't see it as a major increase in the second half. everything is under the assumption that we don't yet see the full visibility on the fourth quarter.
operator
our next question from patrick ho from stifel.
patrick j. ho -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- managing director of technology sector
congrats on a nice quarter and outlook. tom, maybe first off, you've talked about a lot of your development work that's now coming to fruition with new products as well as new node transitions as you look forward into the foundry, logic, you did bring up in your prepared remarks, comments about being all around nano wires and the future transition structure on the foundry, logic side of things. how much capital intensity do you think it increases for both your dimensional and materials tools as the industry makes that migration?
eitan oppenhaim -- president, chief executive officer and director
so i think that if we're looking right now, by the way, not only on the logic. if we're looking also on the memory, there's two inflection points that is requiring a lot of investment in creating a better profile of the chip, ok? in the finland, it's majorly increasing the account layers of the memories, which don't allow you to do one shot edge or one short deposition. and therefore, you need to do have a multi-stack structure. and this multi-stack structure in the vnand creating a lot of difficulties that be controlled only with more intensity on the metrology side, mainly dimensional part. and if you're looking right now on the logic, the gate all around or the nano sheet structure with three and maybe five sheets later on create a whole new story, ok?
so the transistors are not anymore -- traditionally, they are outstanding. and currently, they are becoming horizontal and in order to make it as an accurate and precise structure, you need to add a lot of materials, and it's a very tough structure to control. and every time that something is tough to control, you need more metrology, and you need more intensity on those process control tools. so definitely, when we are looking right now on the advanced nodes, both on the the north of the 170 layers in vnand as well as the nanosheet two nano wires with three ships in logic. we definitely see increasement in tens of percentage of intensity in those technology nodes.
patrick j. ho -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- managing director of technology sector
great. that's helpful. and maybe as my follow-up question, in terms of the services business. you mentioned you had a record quarter this year. i know over the last couple of years, you've increased your capacity, particularly in israel, that's obviously helped with the manufacturing side of things and getting tools up. can you discuss your services infrastructure and whether you need to invest more to keep pace with that growing business and the number of tools that are starting to hit the field?
eitan oppenhaim -- president, chief executive officer and director
so obviously, once you increase the installed base, you need more services and we need more resources to support this installed base. but i think that if we're looking on the larger picture, the service revenues are distributed over three elements. one is the contract or the service-based licenses for services, for those 2, the installed base in the trailing edge. and the target, of course, is to have as much -- as many tools as you can, in those service contracts or license-based contracts. this is one part.
the second part, of course, is time and materials, which means those customers that don't like this -- the contract part you are -- you need to support them by coal, which is a part of the service revenue. and the last one is everything that we call as the value-added services, which is -- this is the growing part and this is where we invest both on road map. we have a specific service road map, which means productivity upgrades, hardware and software of trailing tools and installed base, which are installed for a couple of years. we have, in this part, also unique software elements to control the tools in large volumes only for the service part. so -- and of course, many more.
so part of the development that we have in the r&d, is to develop those value-added services that actually you can earn money by add them to the current installed base. and i'm not talking just about release upgrades or just throughput upgrade, i'm talking about real functionality changes that we can squeeze money for -- and revenue from the installed base in order to give more functionality and productivity to the customers. so definitely, there is investment in that. and definitely, we are growing in investment in services.
patrick j. ho -- stifel, nicolaus & company, incorporated -- managing director of technology sector
great. thank you very much.
eitan oppenhaim -- president, chief executive officer and director
thank you patrick.
operator
we will now take our next question from atif malik from citi. please go ahead.
atif malik -- citigroup incorporated -- research analyst
eitan, you talked about the 10% goal for the software to be as a percentage of the products. can you help us understand where you guys are right now in terms of software as a percentage of your sales?
dror david -- chief financial officer
yes. so in the first quarter of '21, we were at approximately 7% to 8% of product revenues.
atif malik -- citigroup incorporated -- research analyst
okay. and then as my follow-up, i just want to understand what percentage of your product portfolio are integrated metrology? and how much of that is exposed to kind of the decision-making at the oems, the processing tool companies in the u.s. and how much of it is influenced by your direct customers? and the reason i ask that question is because some of these oems are included in talking about kind of a holistic kind of infection and metrology, and they talked about some in-house capability in terms of putting metrology capabilities on the -- tool.
so i just want to understand how much of your card exposed to integrated metrology. and if they should be any concern in terms of in-sourcing risk at these oems?
eitan oppenhaim -- president, chief executive officer and director
so atif, thank you for the question. in regard to the first part, we don't break down the the revenues coming from integrated and stand-alone, and we would like to stay in this policy because it has a lot of competitive information once we start breaking it down following the market demand. in regard to the second question, i would like to shine a bit light about the metrology and the way that it's been decided. so integrated metrology, although it's connected to an oem tool, it's a totally different market, decided by the customers and the oem beside the fact that they need to be ready to connect today integrated.
and of course, that we have very good relationship with all of them, decisions are made by customers and the oem don't have a say in that, ok? now looking right now on the way that metrology has been divided. it has three parts. the first part is a stand-alone. it's tools that are standing as the stand-alone station not related to the oem and the wafers are traveling to this stand-alone system. if you go one level down, it's the integrated metrology, which connected to the oem and give metrology as wafer to wafer control, ok?
so we know how to control the metrology between the wafers. and if you go -- and this is where nova exists, and if you go one level down, you go to the institute. this is what the oems are doing. and in institute, usually, it's for the polishing or the etching process itself, it can't even compete with the integrated. so it's three different markets that exist by itself and nova is not competing with the institute and the institute is not competing with the integrator. so therefore, the oem discussion about having internal metrology through the institute or very smart sensors, are not cannibalizing any of our markets.
atif malik -- citigroup incorporated -- research analyst
thank you eitan, very clear.

good day, and welcome to nova's second quarter 2021 results. today's conference is being recorded. at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to miri segal, ceo of ms-ir. please go ahead.
miri segal -- founder and chief executive officer
thank you, operator, and good day to everybody. i would like to welcome all of you to nova's second quarter 2021 financial results conference call. with us on the line today are mr. eitan oppenhaim, president and ceo; and mr. dror david, cfo.
before we begin, may i remind our listeners that certain information provided on this call may contain forward-looking statements. and the safe harbor statement outlined in today's earnings release also pertains to this call. if you have not received a copy of the release, please view it in the investor relations section of the company's website. eitan will begin the call with the business update, followed by dror with an overview of the financials. we will then open the call for the question-and-answer session.
i'll now turn over the call to mr. eitan oppenhaim, nova's president and ceo. eitan, please go ahead.
eitan oppenhaim -- president & ceo
thank you, miri, and welcome everyone to our second quarter financial results conference call. i will start the call today by speaking about our second quarter results and performance highlights. following my commentary, dror will review the quarter's financial results in detail and we will conclude with the guidance for the third quarter of 2021.
nova maintained its outstanding performance, delivering another strong quarter with compelling results that exceeded the company's revenue and profitability guidance. the acceleration in our business, as reflected in our continued robust performance, is propelled by our evolving offerings and our growing position across geographies, customers and technology nodes.
our revenue reached another record high, demonstrating approximately 55% growth year-over-year, while our non-gaap net income grew approximately 95% year-over-year to a record level as well. moreover, comparing our 2021 first-half results to the same period last year shows a growth pace of around 45% in our revenues and more than 70% in our non-gaap net income, reflecting the leverage that is embedded in our business model and the value our innovative portfolio brings to our customers in this demanding period.
the strong momentum and the exceptional performance we are demonstrating are the result of our consistent execution, which is led by our strategic plans to outperform and continue the company's profitable growth in the years to come. our flexible operating model and the concentrated efforts to strengthen our resiliency across the company allow us to meet our customers' growing demand as we expect to increase our production output by more than 50% this year.
as reflected in our financial results, we continue to reap the benefit of our well executed plan as part of multiple strategic initiatives across technologies and customers. based on the current positive semiconductor environment and the expectations for continuous demand in both the trailing and advanced nodes combined with the record quarterly bookings for our solutions, we expect another record year in 2021, forecasting approximately $390 million in revenue with an option on upside to cross the $400 million threshold. achieving that will represent around 50% growth year-over-year in our business volume.
in the current market dynamics, our innovative approach supported by our solid commitment to our customers continues to strengthen our position and expand our exposure to a broader customer base across all geographies. the strong impetus we are experiencing in all semiconductor segments is propelled by -- sorry, propelled currently by strong demand for multiple traditional and high-end applications that are driving growing demand for stronger computation, extended data management and powerful network infrastructure.
the growing digitization of multiple industries continues to fuel the demand for silicon and support our expectation for elevated multi-year wfe spending. in addition and against the backdrop of broad demand for semiconductors, increasing device complexity plays well into our growth plans in several new metrology applications which open for us numerous opportunities to extend our available markets, increase attach rates and also gain market share.
the complexity embedded in building next generation devices require innovative solutions for in-line in-die metrology and in this space, we prevailed with our combined solutions for both critical dimensions and materials control. on top of this, two strong market drivers, which are the demand and the technical complexity, the push by different continents and nations to achieve semiconductor supply chain independence within the next several years, expand regional investments, elevate the demand for capital equipment globally and support even copious wfe spending.
these tailwinds resonate well with our results, with balanced contribution from the three big territories, taiwan, korea and china contributing 30% each. moreover, our position in china continues to improve with several new expansions and penetrations resulting in a new revenue record in this region. furthermore, and based on several global manufacturer intention to expand their position in the us, we expect a growing business momentum in north america as well throughout 2021 and 2022.
in addition to the overall demand for new advanced devices, customers are also focused on utilizing their investments by optimizing existing fabrication lines to improve performance and increase outputs. as a result, we are experiencing growth in systems delivery also to the trailing memory and logic nodes, driving revenue balance between the nodes in the first half where around 40% coming from trailing edge nodes.
additionally, to better utilize these high volume manufacturing lines, we are offering our customers a broad range of solutions to upgrade the installed base, to extend the fleet, lifespan and increase its productivity. this activity over many customers stood up our service business growth this year with another record high this quarter.
although we are pleased with all our achievements during the quarter, i would like to emphasize two major milestones closely connected to our strategy. the first one is the growing demand for our optical cd stand-alone tools, mainly the prism, across numerous customers. while our industry is going through extensive technical transition, either in multi-stuck memory, scale dram or new logic architectures, nova's solution that includes multiple optical unique channels along with advanced software capabilities resonates well with our customers as the most suitable solution for faster and more accurate process in 3d devices. as a result of this growing traction, our stand-alone revenue hit a record high in the second quarter and we expect strong momentum for the rest of the year as well.
the second milestone is the progress we made with our software sales toward our long-term business model. at this point, i would like to clarify that when we discuss our software growth engine, we exclude common systems sequence upgrades, service software version upgrades or fault management solutions, and concentrate only on advanced modeling, deep learning and fleet management. these three engines drive our business forward and brought in another software revenue record this quarter. specifically in this space, we are very encouraged by the traction our nova fit portfolio is gaining in the market. nova fit, our deep learning solution suite, stands as a key differentiator in our offering to customers who strive to improve accuracy and increase yield while reducing time to market.
our solution handles massive amount of data very fast and deliver process insights based on accumulated knowledge and advanced algorithms. the ultimate goal of our offering is to calculate and analyze a growing amount of data during the process cycle from hundreds of tools along the different process steps, and with that to predict the next measurement with the highest accuracy.
one example of the immense importance of that to our customers is the device functionality testing. today's fabrication process is so complicated that it takes several months from the time a silicon wafer is introduced in the manufacturing until a fully functional device is produced that can be released to electrical testing. to make production faster and more efficient, nova fit analyzes data from over 200,000 optical measurements, performs weeks and sometimes months before manufacturing is completed and can predict the electrical test results already during the front-end process with unmatched accuracy, our ability to deliver solutions like that, that is based on having different metrology sensors in the production lines in different steps. in a typical advanced node, we can have hundreds of integrated metrology tools, tens of optical cd stand-alone tools and multiple x-ray systems.
encouraged by our consistent achievements and our ability to meet our nova 300 model, we recently announced during our analyst and investor day the new strategic plan to organically grow the business to more than $500 million in revenues. the combination of favorable market conditions, increased complexity in device manufacturing, our solid business model and the diversified portfolio support our expectations for further growth and outperformance.
the plan as presented during the analyst and investor day is based on four pillars which are the basis for our success. the first one is the continuous investment in talent acquisition and talent management to nurture our culture. it combines inclusion, diversity and transparency along with aggressive approach toward execution and winning.
the second pillar is our continuous elevates elevated spending in r&d to keep rolling out new innovative metrology solutions to the market with focus on both hardware and software products. the elipson and the prism are the harbingers of more new technologies to come in the short and the long period while customers are using both new architectures and materials to improve performance.
the third pillar is our increasing installed base and the service revenue it drives. on average, we deliver hundreds of tools to the markets. these are very accurate and highly advanced tools that measure thousands of wafers a day and are responsible for all major yield improvements globally. as part of our roadmap, we constantly develop upgrade packages for these tools, including hardware and software, to be able to provide our customers with more capabilities to handle more complex devices in existing traditional fabrication lines.
the final pillar is the leverage we developed in our operational model, which supports our continued investment in new products and technologies while allowing us to deliver on our long-term profitability model. we can see this leverage materialized already this year as we increased r&d investment in new products and grew our products production output approximately 50% all while significantly increasing our profits.
before i hand over the call to dror to explain our financial highlights in more detail, let me just recap our performance this quarter. it has been a remarkable quarter in the first half of 2021, achieving multiple records and heights. looking ahead, we see an abundance of opportunities to continue growing. as our strategy to invest in innovative unique technologies bears fruits in the form of unextended portfolio and growing addressable market. i'm extremely proud of our teams across the globe who are rising to the challenge and performing at their best.
with that, let me hand over the call to dror to review our financial results in detail. dror?
dror david -- chief financial officer
thanks, eitan. good day, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2021 conference call. total revenues in the second quarter of this year exceeded our guidance and reached an all-time record of $98 million. this represents a 56% growth compared to the second quarter of 2020 and a 16% growth compared to the first quarter of 2021. product revenues in the second quarter grew 18% quarter-over-quarter. this growth was attributed to a significant increase in revenue from the stand-alone optical cd product line, which reached an all-time record revenue level during the second quarter.
service revenues in the second quarter grew 9% quarter-over-quarter as a result of higher time and materials and installed base management revenues. looking at product revenue distribution, approximately 70% was attributed to logic and foundry and approximately 30% to memory. geographically, taiwan, korea, in china each contributed approximately 30% to our product revenues with china representing an all-time record level.
blended gross margin in the second quarter was 57% on a gaap basis, similar to the first quarter of 2021. blended gross margin on a non-gaap basis increased to 58% relative to 57% in the first quarter of the year. operating expenses for this quarter increased by 2% the $29 million on a gaap basis and to $26 million on a non-gaap basis. operating margins in the second quarter significantly increased, reflecting the financial leverage built into the company operational model. on a gaap basis, operating margins increased from 23% in the first quarter to 28% in the second quarter. on a non-gaap basis, operating margins increased from 27% in the first quarter to an all-time record level of 31% in the second quarter of 2021.
the effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2021 was approximately 12%. earnings per share on a gaap basis were $0.07 per diluted share and earnings per share on a non-gaap basis were $0.90 [phonetic] per diluted share, exceeding the company guidance for the quarter and representing a new record high for quarterly earnings per share.
finally, i'd like to share our guidance. we expect the following for the third quarter of 2021. revenues to be between $99 million and $106 million, gaap earnings per diluted share to range from $0.71 to $0.84 and non-gaap earnings per share -- per diluted share to range from $0.85 and $0.98. at the midpoint of our third quarter estimates, we expect gross margins to remain similar to the second quarter of the year, operating expenses to reach approximately $30 million on a gaap basis and approximately $28 million on a non-gaap basis, and effective tax rate to be approximately 14%.
looking at 2021 as a whole, as eitan mentioned, we expect another record year, forecasting approximately $390 million in revenues with an optional upside to cross the $400 million in annual revenues.
to support this steep growth in business, we are accelerating our investments and recruitments in all areas and departments, including expansion and establishment of new and existing offices globally. the timing of these investments may vary due to execution progress and due to the covid-19 environment.
as communicated in our recent analyst and investor day, the company's target financial model is comprised of gross margins between 56% to 59% and operating margins between 26% and 29%. at these expected levels of revenues in 2021, which represent a major year-over-year increase, there is a potential upside to present operating margins which are higher than our target model.
with that, i will turn the call back to eitan. eitan?
eitan oppenhaim -- president & ceo
thank you, dror. before we take your questions, i would like to use this opportunity to mention our press release for monday about modifying our name from nova measuring instruments to nova. following our expansion driven by several software and hardware growth engines, the company believes the previous name no longer represent its technology portfolio and diversified offerings. the company continues to retain the nvmi sticker -- sorry, ticker, and its process insight tag line.
with that final note, we will be pleased to take your questions. operator?
",":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] the first question today comes from jamie zakalik of bank of america.
jamie zakalik -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the great quarter. you highlighted a few times record revenue from china. can you quantify how much domestic china was in this quarter of that 30% and how does that compare to last quarter and maybe a year ago? was china demand in line with what you expected when you guided? and how do you remain confident that customers are ordering to true end demand?
eitan oppenhaim -- president & ceo
so i think -- it's eitan here and thanks for the question. so i think i'll start first from the market perspective and then work -- then conclude with the financial element. so regarding to the demand in china, we do see growing demand in china year-over-year. so, if we compare this year demand from last year, actually it's higher and mainly it's coming from the investment in the logic customers in china. and this is one.
and second, following the trade limitations between the us and china, we do see some opportunities that are coming from the fact that we are not keeping our tools from the us and we are not part of those obligations. so we can continue shipping tools. and i think that the third element is we do see growing investment in china as a result from the trade war. we do see investment in new green greenfield customers. we do see increasing capacity and increasing investment in some of the customers that actually expedited their expansions, and we do see that china is growing this year, and by the way, we expect the same thing next year.
dror david -- chief financial officer
if i may add some color on that, so as eitan mentioned, in the last few quarters, we did see at least one local domestic chinese customer is a 10% customer of our product revenues. china as a whole was around 20% in the last 2 years, 2019 and 2020. in the first half of 2021, it's around 20%. so, it is an incremental growth in that aspect.
jamie zakalik -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thanks, that's very helpful. and then on gross margin, so gross margin in the quarter came in slightly ahead but are still down slightly year-on-year despite really strong revenue growth. so, what are the puts and takes there and what can drive gross margins toward the higher end of your long-term target? is it just a function of mix or a certain revenue level or something else? thanks.
eitan oppenhaim -- president & ceo
so, as we discussed in our analyst day, obviously on one hand, we see increase in revenues and the company has the new technologies, which are coming in which are with high asp and high gross margins. on the other hand, we do see challenges in terms of the cost of employment globally, costs related to covid-19 manufacturing and also supply chain aspect, including the cost of deliveries, cost of raw materials and so forth.
we do believe that the combination of these elements as a whole will still enable us to be within the target model of the company, which as i mentioned, is 56% to 59%. in addition, we need to remember that we need to balance between being competitive in the market and creating a robust gross margin, which can facilitate r&d investments.
so overall, we do expect to remain within these levels of 56% to 59% where in years -- and areas where the new technologies are coming in and revenues are growing in a fast manner, we would be at the high end of this range.
jamie zakalik -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it, thanks guys.
operator
our next question comes from atif malik of citi.
atif malik -- citigroup global markets -- analyst
hi, thank you for taking my questions and good job on the results and guide. i have a question on your supply situation. curious how long the equipment lead times are now. i think you guys have been running at 80% of your manufacturing capacity and are planning to add a new clean room by middle of next year. so are you supply constrained right now? and how should we think about your production capacity exiting this year and next year?
eitan oppenhaim -- president & ceo
so, atif, thanks for the question. so regarding -- i want to divide it into two. first is the production capacity and we have enough capacity to increase capacities and more, and we don't see ourselves close to limits, regarding clean room, days [phonetic], productions and things like that. and we do expect that if there is going to be upside this year, we can accumulate it and we can answer the customer demand as they -- as it grows.
regarding next year, we expect the new cleanroom to kick in somewhere next summer and we are all secured in production to reach there. and once it's coming in, it's supposed to smoothly increase the capacity. so, this is from a production perspective.
regarding the supply chain itself, as i said in a couple of previous earnings calls, we did increase our inventories and we did purchase some of the long lead items early enough in the covid period. so, we are enjoying right now from shorter lead time and we are [technical issues] our supply chain actually four quarters ahead. so, we know by now to manufacture the tools for a full quarter ahead. so i think for -- in that perspective we are also secured.
there are some risks, as everybody understand, in this period of increasing material prices, some constrain on supply chain delivery, shipments and flights and also travel. and it's becoming more difficult to -- logistically to deliver our system to customers. but nevertheless, looking right now on the last few quarters and based on the situation and the dynamic changes, we can control it and we can overcome it and continue growing.
atif malik -- citigroup global markets -- analyst
great. and as my follow-up, dror, you mentioned record software sales, but can you quantify what the software sales was as a percentage of overall revenue?
dror david -- chief financial officer
yes. software -- in the last two quarters, software revenues out of the total revenues of the company were between 7% and 8%.
atif malik -- citigroup global markets -- analyst
great, thank you.
operator
the next question comes from patrick ho up stifel.
unidentified participant
hi there, good afternoon. this is brian [phonetic] on for patrick. congratulations on the continued strong results and thanks for letting us ask a few questions. maybe first, just in terms of the second half commentary, i think 3 weeks ago you spoke about the potential for flat to modestly higher revenue. clearly, you're revising this higher today. maybe can you provide, eitan, a little color on what has incrementally strengthened driving this better second half? and also, what does that optionality that will drive you closer to the $400 million level? is that tied to the acceptance of new products or a particular end market?
eitan oppenhaim -- president & ceo
so brian, i think that there are two answers to that. so when we're looking right now on the rest of the year, i think that the upside can be led by two things one is the -- is that -- is the rate of adoptions of the new technology in the market and we are doing our best that some of the valuations that currently are ongoing will be concluded and the systems will be accepted by the end of the year. this is one.
second, we do have some opportunities to increase market share on some of the competitive selections that are going on right now and we hope that the decisions will be made during the next couple of months. so, you know that the bottom line is -- it's a combination of new market share and selection and penetrations with a growing rate of adoption of the new products.
unidentified participant
okay, great, that's very helpful. and then, maybe doubling back on china, just curious you obviously quantified sort of what your sales contribution is this year, it's stepping up from last year, just curious if you try to break that down maybe stand-alone cd versus integrated, how do you think you'd calibrate your market share in china for those two particular platforms relative to your overall position in the world?
eitan oppenhaim -- president & ceo
so, we are not breaking -- we're not breaking down the numbers to integrated and stand-alone, but i can comment that our market share is -- the market share percentage in china is very high. there are customers that we have around 100% market share by the way on both product lines, both the materials and dimension. and i think that if you're looking right now on specific customers or specific segments, i think that during 2021 there were two main investments in china or two main areas of investment in china. one is the, is the logic customers, which are not smsc. the government is moving investment to other logic customers. so, this is one area of investment.
and the second is new r&d investment that's happening in different provinces in china, ok. so each one of them may be is small, but there are multiple of them. so the combination of publishing new product -- new r&d and production line with the increase of investment in those logic customers or logic providers that will need to gaap or cover the gap that -- smic cannot provide are the main drivers for growth in china.
unidentified participant
great, that's great color. thanks.
operator
[operator instructions] the next question today comes from mark miller of benchmark.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
congratulations on another record quarter. i was wondering, you've done this previously, could you break out the product cost and service cost?
dror david -- chief financial officer
so as you saw in the press release, we did consolidate some of the -- of these elements. as you know, the company shifted gears in terms of its business level. so we have decided to align their reports with the reporting benchmark for such business levels. in general, these reports are more condensed and are in correlation also to the target model of the company, which includes mainly blended gross margins. we decided not to report separately gross margins for the different product lines or revenue streams.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
you mentioned your growing momentum in north america. could that represent -- north america represent 10% or more of your sales next year?
eitan oppenhaim -- president & ceo
so mark, it's eitan here. so i think that even this year it's very close to 10%. if i'm looking right now, next year everything depends on the timing of the investment in arizona, ok. and the question is how fast the two major logic customer will invest. and additionally to that, we have another korean memory customer that supports to expand or open a new facility. so that's from greenfield spending by these two customers.
additionally to that, we do see recovery by other customers in that region. we have -- the leading logic provider in north america actually increased capacity this year and supposed to increase capacity next year in the r&d facilities. we have also other global customers -- other logic global customer that started to invest this year as well in 28 and 20 nanometer. so all in all, we see both investments in the trailing edge nodes by the traditional customers as well as new capex being spent for new facilities starting next year as well. so, we definitely see north america growing next year.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
you mentioned one chinese domestic was a greater than 10% customer. how many quarter than 10% customers did you have?
dror david -- chief financial officer
normally, it's between three and four customers every quarter.
mark miller -- benchmark -- analyst
thank you.

good day, and welcome to nova's third quarter 2021 results.
at this time, i would like to turn the conference over to miri segal, chief executive officer of ms-ir. please go ahead.
miri segal-scharia -- chief executive officer
thank you, operator, and good day to everybody. i would like to welcome all of you to nova's third quarter 2021 financial results conference call. with us on the line today are mr. eitan oppenhaim, president and chief executive officer; and mr. dror david, chief financial officer. before we begin, may i remind our listeners that certain information provided on this call may contain forward-looking statements, and the safe harbor statement outlined in today's earnings release also pertains to this call. if you have not received a copy of the release, please view it in the investor relations section of the company's website. eitan will begin the call with a business update, followed by dror with an overview of the financials. we will then open the call for the question-and-answer session. i'll now hand over the call to mr. eitan oppenhaim, nova's president and chief executive officer.
eitan, please go ahead.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, miri, and welcome, everyone, to our quarterly conference call. i will start the call today by speaking about our quarterly results and performance highlights. following my commentary, dror will review the financial results in detail, including the guidance for the fourth quarter of 2021. nova's track record of consistent outperformance and strong execution was evident in the third quarter results with both revenue and profit exceeding our guidance and reaching another record high. although we are not immune to the various challenges in the supply chain, these outstanding results demonstrate the strong momentum in our core markets and our ability to navigate efficiently in this environment to satisfy our customers' demand.
our record performance over the last five quarters also signifies the strength and the agility of our financial model which allows us to keep expanding production output and investing in new technologies while still meeting our long-term strategy of profitable growth. the impact of multiple technology transitions in chip design continues to drive growth across a broad range of applications. the impact of covid on consumer behavior, along with the industry secular drivers like data storage, mobile infrastructure, ai and digital transformation, are now augmented by strategic decisions to redistribute capacity over different geographies in order to ensure supply independence. these elements are creating pressure simultaneously on multiple semiconductor technology nodes across different chip manufacturing lines. while we continue to deliver a solution to the most high-end technology nodes, we also continue to deliver systems to the trailing edge nodes that supports the growth of traditional applications.
in the exigent environment, we are well positioned to keep fortifying our market advantages as we continue rolling out new metrology solutions. delivery of a combination of new and traditional platforms to a wide range of fabrication nodes drove record bookings this quarter, which increased our backlog significantly for the following quarters. with our current guidance in place for the fourth quarter, and following my comments during the previous earnings call about the potential upside for the year-end, we now forecast the company revenue for the year to surpass $412 million in revenues. this forecast indicates growth of more than 50% year-over-year. turning now to our business highlights for the quarter. revenue contributions was weighted toward logic across different technologies. while we continue delivering our solution to the most advanced nodes below seven nanometers, we also increased our delivery to the more trailing nodes across various traditional applications.
the strong demand for our logic solutions is reflected in our geographical distribution with growing activity in taiwan, china, korea and u.s. we expect this demand, along with new site construction, to continue in 2022 as well. on the memory side, we continue to experience solid dram demand with expectations for additional nand spending as we enter 2022. the growing demand for our portfolio drove several notable achievements this quarter. the first one to mention is the record contribution of our materials metrology portfolio. against the backdrop of broad demand for advanced semiconductors, the growing complexity of materials engineering has struck a high note in our offering. the next-generation devices require a better approach to control different materials' properties, along with the ambitious architectural design.
as complexity increases, in-line materials process control in etch, lithography and deposition become crucial to yield improvement and drive growing metrology attach rates. nova's strategy to lead this market resonates well in our results as both our xps veraflex and raman elipson products were adopted by multiple customers. beyond the immediate effects on our business growth, the initiative to move more laboratories capabilities to in-line manufacturing capabilities resonates well with our strategy as we continue to develop new technologies to allow production fabs to better control of each step of their process. following this encouraging progress, we announced this quarter two major wins for the veraflex and elipson platforms with leading memory and logic customers. these wins represent a solid business potential for 2022 as well. the second achievement to notice is the record income from our software products. our software stand-alone portfolio is now implemented by our leading customers and allowed them to utilize more effectively the hardware platforms. combining our physical modeling and advanced mathematical training engines over a connected fleet of tools in various stages allows nova to achieve better results using smaller data sets with much greater accuracy and repeatability. we continue increasing investments in these areas, which we view as our most encouraging competitive advantage.
the third milestone to highlight is our new service revenue record. in the current environment, customers are investing simultaneously in both extending their existing nodes and expanding into new ones. revenue this year from services is expected to hit a record high with a wide range of drivers, including upgrades, improved productivity, software enhancement and advanced service contracts. the growing demand for nova innovative portfolio in both memory and logic for materials and dimensions metrology pushes our development cadence forward with new products and offering. our focus this year continues to be the prizm stand-alone rollout, the expansion of the materials offering and the investment in advanced software prediction capabilities. during the third quarter, we made exceptional progress in all of these directions, this direction putting us in a very strong proliferation position toward 2022.
a notable achievement in this regard was the continued adoption by several customers of our stand-alone ocd prizm platform for advanced memory. in response to the surged demand during 2021, we are working intensively to expand our production capacity, which grew more than 60% this year. with growth in all our product lines, we continue to optimize our output around the globe and plan to open two new clean room facilities next year in fremont, u.s. and israel. as other companies mentioned, we are not immune to the supply chain disruptions in this dynamic market as materials and chip keep being short, transportation and increasing prices are constantly changing. yet, as reflected in our outstanding results, we continue to navigate well these challenges in order to extend our growth into 2022. before i hand over the call to dror, let me recap my notes for this quarter. it has been yet another outstanding quarter and a milestone for nova, where, for the first time, we crossed the $100 million quarterly revenue mark as a direct result of our well-executed plan toward the nova 500 strategy. against the backdrop of a global chip shortage, the growing demand for our innovative portfolio continues to pave the way to another outperformance year in 2021 and build a positive and encouraging momentum toward 2022.
with that, let me hand over the call to dror to review our financial results in details.
dror david -- chief financial officer
thanks, eitan. good day, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2021 conference call. total revenues in the third quarter of this year exceeded our guidance and reached a record of $113 million. this represents a 62% growth compared to the third quarter of 2020 and a 15% sequential growth compared to the second quarter of 2021. product revenue included record software revenue in the third quarter of the year, hitting our target level of 10% of the overall company's product revenues. product revenue distribution was approximately 70% from logic and foundry and approximately 30% from memory. blended gross margin in the third quarter was 58% on both gaap and non-gaap basis within the company's target model of 56% to 59%. operating expenses for the quarter increased by approximately 3% to $30 million on a gaap basis and to $27 million on a non-gaap basis as the company continues to increase its global head count to support the steep growth in business activities.
operating margins in the third quarter significantly increased to record levels reflecting the financial leverage built into the company's operational model. on a gaap basis, operating margins increased from 28% in the second quarter to 32% in the third quarter. on a non-gaap basis, operating margins increased from 31% in the second quarter to 34% in the third quarter. the effective tax rate in the third quarter was approximately 12%. earnings per share came in at all-time record and crossed for the first time the level of $1 per share. on a gaap basis, earnings per share were $1.02 per diluted share, and on a non-gaap basis, earnings per share were $1.16 per diluted share.
finally, i'd like to share our guidance. we expect the following for the fourth quarter of the year: revenues to be between $113 million to $123 million; gaap earnings per diluted share to range from $0.78 to $0.96; and non-gaap earnings per diluted share to range from $0.94 to $1.12. at the midpoint of our fourth quarter 2021 estimates we expect gross margins to come in at approximately 57%. operating expenses are expected to significantly rise in the fourth quarter as a result of year-end activities and provisions and continued head count increase and reach approximately $34.5 million on a gaap basis and approximately $31.5 million on a non-gaap basis. looking forward into the beginning of 2022, we expect operating expenses on a non-gaap basis to start from a level of approximately $30 million and to gradually grow as we continue accelerating investments and recruitment in all areas and departments, including expansion and establishment of new and existing offices and clear rooms globally.
the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2021, excluding adjustments related to a potential change in tax rate in the u.s., is expected to be approximately 13%. looking at 2021 as a whole, as eitan mentioned, we are on our way to a record year with more than $400 million in annual revenues, reflecting more than 50% growth year-over-year. also, we expect to conclude 2021 with operating margins of around 30%, slightly higher than the company target model of 26% to 29%. i will conclude by noting that cash reserves increased to more than $500 million at the end of the third quarter of 2021, following a positive free cash flow of more than $50 million in the same quarter.
with that, i will turn the call back to eitan.
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, dror. we will be pleased to take your questions now. operator?

[operator instructions] first question comes from jamie zakalik from bank of america. please go ahead.
jamie zakalik -- bank of america -- analyst
hey guys, thanks for accepting my question. for my first question, one of your large peers talked about strong momentum into the first half of 2022. they even suggested their process control system sales could grow somewhere in the 10% range half-on-half in the first half. so i'm not asking for a specific guide, but are you guys seeing a similar momentum into the march and june quarter? and how strong is your visibility given i think your lead times are in a somewhat more normal range?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
yes. all right. so first of all, regarding the lead times, so lead times for nova systems today is around three to five months. that's around the lead time. this is somewhat our feasibility for next year. so definitely, when we're looking on next year, and following my comments on the backlog, although we don't give guidance for more than one quarter, we do see continuous momentum in the first half as well. i can't say right now, and we don't have the visibility to say if h2 will be higher than h1. but definitely, it's going to be a growth year for us.
jamie zakalik -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. and then on gross margin, very strong this quarter, but your guide suggests they're down quite a bit despite record revenues. so what are the puts and takes there?
dror david -- chief financial officer
so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are investing a lot in opening new sites globally also because of the penetration to new customers in several areas, including in europe, in china and other areas. so as a result of that, some of the expenses are related to the service organization and the spread of our field service engineers globally. on top of that, obviously, there are pressure from the supply chain in terms of cost of materials, deliveries, and this is obviously building up quarter-over-quarter. on top of that, we had, in the third quarter, as i mentioned, record revenues from software. this is probably going to normalize a little bit in the fourth quarter. and all these elements together have some impact on the gross margins.
jamie zakalik -- bank of america -- analyst
got it. and if i could squeeze one last one in on the balance sheet. it looks like deferred revenues took a pretty large step-up in the quarter. anything to read in there?
dror david -- chief financial officer
sure. yes. just i mentioned, deferred revenues are customer payments which were done before the company recognized the revenues. the reason for this increase is a combination of several elements. it's across a significant portion of our product portfolio and also relates to the fact that the company is proliferating new technologies at existing and new customers. and in some cases, the payments are coming in before the final acceptance of the system.

[operator instructions] next question comes from krish sankar from cowen and company. please go ahead.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
and congrats on crossing the $100 million quarterly revenue mark. eitan, just first question i had is you spoke about nand growing in 2022. i'm kind of curious, is that a nova-specific comment? or is it more what you're seeing in the industry? can you just help us give some color on how you think -- how and why nand is growing in 2022 relative to this year?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i don't think -- so thanks for the question, but i don't think that this is nova's comment. this is the industry's comments. and i think that my peers talked about it as well. so if you're looking right now on 2021, it was a very strong logic year, augmented by strong dram demand because of the low -- because of the pressure in the deal market as well and the increased prices. if we're looking right now on nand, we're starting to see in q4 increase in nand demand, and i think that it will go into the first half of 2022. it's coming from a combination of shortage in supply in this market, together with new nand technologies or new layer memory that needs to come to the market. so the combination of the new technology, together with some kind of demand to this -- to the nand memory creating a growing -- actually growing demand for nand in the next couple of months.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. so it's coming more -- would you say it's more technology-driven rather than capacity-driven?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so i think that it's a combination. if you're looking right now on the leaders in the industry, it's coming from both technology and capacity. so we do see that -- so again, but if you're looking right now in 2021, it was a dram and a logic year, where nand was a bit lower than dram. and i think that if we're looking in the first half of 2022, it will be more nand than dram. we see it everywhere.
krish sankar -- cowen and company -- analyst
got it. got it. that's very helpful, eitan. and then just a quick follow-up. obviously, you're easily outgrowing wfe this year. i'm just kind of curious, is there a way to figure out how much of the outperformance this year is actually driven by process control intensity increasing. or how much is driven by your own share gains? or how much is driven by the new products you've introduced? can you help us qualify the outperformance in those three buckets, if possible?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we will not get into the numbers. but if you're looking right now on wfe in 2021, the prediction of -- the prediction is talking about 35% to 40% growth. and process control probably will be from the forecast perspective from the analysts probably will be the same. so if we are going to do more than 50 actually, it means that it should come from something else. it cannot come from attach rate. so it's coming from a couple of areas. first, of course, it's coming from the new technologies that expand our total available market and create more application for us to come in. it's coming, of course, from market share, as we discussed about the prizm and other tools. and also, it's coming from opening new places where materials metrology was measured in the lab, and now it's measured in the fab. so if you're looking on the combination of all that, you can see that actually, we outperformed the wfe and we outperformed also the prediction for process control, which usually process control is including also metrology and inspection. nevertheless, we are more -- we are growing more than that significantly.

the next question comes from mark miller with benchmark company. please go ahead.
mark miller -- benchmark company -- analyst
let me add my congratulations record quarter after record quarter. it's very impressive. your largest customer, taiwan semiconductor, they're just starting with building a plant in arizona. they also announced, i think, a new fab coming in japan. when do you think orders will start to flow into you from these opportunities?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
okay. so when we're looking right now on this customer, so we are talking about a new fab in u.s., a new fab in japan. i think that the order is first the arizona fab and then the japanese one. and our forecast right now that orders will start to flow -- to fly in around end of next -- end of q3, q4 2022.
mark miller -- benchmark company -- analyst
the other question is the -- there are several ramps of new technology. euv is really starting to heat up. i think asml is doubling the number of what their tools are going to be shipping and also next-generation dram. does this expand the use of your equipment on these trends?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
sure. so every -- so i'm using to say in every investor presentation that i'm doing that, for us, the best environment is when complexity is getting much more difficult to produce. so everywhere that the technology transition is complex and it's involved both architectural and material changes, usually, at the beginning, attach rate is growing up and the need for process control and metrology is getting higher and attach rate is, of course, getting stronger. so if you're looking right now on the combination of transitions that we see in the market, starting from logic moving from 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer, which involves not only the scaling but also moving from one structure to another like from finfet to gate all around, and then if you go to dram, you see that it's starting to scale aggressively. and you look also to the nand that need to cross 200 layers, each one of those transition in each one of the segments actually increased the attach rate and creating more opportunities. so for us, it's very good that litho is growing, etch, deposition. so everywhere that it's growing, it's creating more opportunities.
mark miller -- benchmark company -- analyst
would the next-generation chips require any changes in terms of light sources or detectors that you use in your equipment?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
no. so usually what we do when we come out with the tool or with a solution, it usually keep up with several technology nodes. and the hardware that is in place right now can take us for several nodes ahead of us.
operator
the next question comes from patrick ho with stifel. please go ahead.
j. ho -- stifel -- j. ho-stifel-analyst
congrats on the nice quarter and outlook. actually, maybe one -- first to start off with in terms of the supply chain, you managed to do it very well based on your results and outlook. can you just specifically give a little bit of color on some of the challenges you faced in the third quarter specifically because it seems like the situation actually worsened in 3q? what were some of the specific challenges? and how did you mitigate those problems, especially looking forward going into q4?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so patrick, several things. first of all, if i'm looking right now on the supply chain challenges and disruption is coming, i think, from a couple of areas. first of all, the -- first of all, it's the obvious thing of transportation, insurance, delivery, cost of delivery. it's becoming a bit challenging as well as very expensive, and it's creating some issues. second is the issue of raw materials that is in shortage. we're starting to see some of the materials that you can actually -- never mind the prices. you cannot -- you start to see that they're in shortage. and if you can reach them, it's with very high prices. and the third element is when we look on our suppliers, they start to be challenged by the capacity, ok? so not all of them are big and some of them starting to see capacity issue. and on top of it, we need to understand that we are suffering from the shortage of chips exactly like the rest, if we need it for our computers and other controllers in the systems. so this is where we see the challenges in the supply chain. i don't think that it is a surprise and i don't think that it's different from other vendors. we have the benefit that part of our suppliers are spread around the world and some of them are in israel. we have dual source for almost everything. and basically, we increased our inventory a lot, and we usually buy equipment or materials for four to six quarters ahead. so we can mitigate that. nevertheless, there are things that money cannot buy, and we see some shortage. i don't think that it will damage any of our plans for the next few quarters, but it's becoming challenging.
j. ho -- stifel -- j. ho-stifel-analyst
no. i appreciate the color. and again, like i said, the results and outlook obviously show that you guys are managing it very well. maybe as my follow-up question, and you just briefly touched upon it. i wanted to get your take on some of the broader implications for nova. gate-all-around is something that's around the corner for the industry. how do you see that both from what you talked about a complexity and a materials opportunity for nova specifically? do you see that transition as being big for both of those market applications?
eitan oppenhaim -- president and chief executive officer
so definitely, the move for gate-all-around or the nanosheets are -- the movement itself is extremely challenged, ok? it's like you're taking a vertical gate and you make it horizontal. and actually from -- only from this simple fact that it's becoming horizontal, you start to see a lot of challenges in the structure itself. and you start to see some physical challenges as well as material challenges. and basically, the whole structure, the building of the structure needs different control schemes that you don't see in a different gate technology. so for the logic providers, this transition is a huge complex issue. and then, of course, you need to create -- when you're talking about gate-all-around, you need to do it with multiple gates. so the separation of the gate is an issue. the strain is an issue. and definitely, when we came out with our portfolio, starting from the prizm, the new integrated, the elipson to measure the stress, everything is built in order to measure those challenges. so when you're looking right now in gate-all-around, it will not be like finfet, a dimensional challenge. it will be dimensional challenge, a material challenge. and also when you're looking on the material challenges, it start to be a chemical challenge. and definitely stress, strain, composition on how you build the gate will become a huge issue. so it's playing to our strategy. so we want to be the leader in this market where it's a combination of materials and dimension.
