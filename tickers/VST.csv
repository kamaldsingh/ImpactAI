thank you. [operator instructions] and your first question comes from the line of shar pourreza with guggenheim partners. please go ahead. your line is now open.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
hey, shar.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
just two quick questions. first, curt, could we get a little bit more color around the future investment, thinking about that might arise over the next decade? i mean the annual investment of $500 million per year is sort of a big part of the growth story there.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i think we mentioned in the script, may not been that prominent, but i think we still view more near term that retail opportunities are the biggest opportunity. i mean you guys can see that the value that we bring, and i'd say nrg probably bring to the table, given our capabilities and plus, in particular, given our long position, and we can take out not only just sort of the back office and other types of costs, but we can manage the commodity price risk exposure better. and then there's just inherent in that that difference, there's a much lower multiple for retail.
so we see some real value. i think they're going to be smaller in nature though going forward, shar. i don't think there are many larger -- when i say larger, more in the crius type, ambit-sized deals out there. but there are still other ideas out there that we'll likely pursue.
i do believe that we will participate at the right point in time in renewables and battery storage. as you know, we have some real opportunities out in california to continue to build out our battery build at both moss landing site and our oakland site. i think we'll probably do some investment in that. we have a good pipeline of opportunities on the development side, not only in texas but also in a few other states where we have sites from some of our existing assets that will become available.
all that's going to be driven heavily by economics. and i think you guys know, there's a lot of capital right now flooding into green investments by people who really don't have any business owning a wind project or a solar project, but they want to wave the green flag. and i think that is -- the returns that we're seeing on that are pretty low. i do believe that it's sort of like the ccgt buildout in the early 2000s, that there's going to be opportunities after the fact for us to take a look at it.
so i think when you think about the 10-year period that you mentioned, sort of early on, it's more of a retail focus. i think it will be more on an intermediate period of time, there's going to be some opportunities around renewables and batteries. and i'd also say that there may be a few little tuck-in opportunities inside of ercot on the solar front. we've got a -- like i said, we got a pretty big pipeline.
we've got a lot of acreage and it's some really good acreage, but we have to be very selective around that. to some extent, that will also be in support of our growing ercot retail business now that we've got the ambit brand in here. so there may be some opportunity to do a project or two around that. but i think that's really where the growth is going to come from.
and i think we're just going to have to be patient and incredibly disciplined. it's going to come, in my view, in a lumpy nature. so this $500 million a year is probably -- i mean it's a great modeling exercise, but it's probably not exactly how it's going to happen.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. and then just lastly, curt, i mean, obviously, the plan you presented today should provide a lot of comfort with the agencies. right? the cash flows are sustainable, the ebitda can actually grow, the balance sheet's healthy, you're definitely building a solid natural hedge with the retail business. you've talked sort of in the past around your ratings in sort of two phases.
right? first, bb+; second, investment grade. can we maybe just get a little bit of a status on how the dialogue is going with the agencies; your sense on timing first around the notch improvement, and then second, investment grade, especially in light of how you're presenting your plan today? that's it.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so we're going to go in. and i think we're going to go in and talk to the agencies because we're updating obviously. we have a 10-year view, but we're also finishing up and taking to our board in early december our updated long-range plan, which is our -- it's generally a five-year view, and then we need to sit down with the agencies on that.
moody's, for example, has asked for some of that information because i think they're going to go to the committee. i think they're going to talk about not only us but maybe others in terms of upgrading. we've been on a positive watch with them for some time. so we think that in the next quarter or so, we should be in a pretty good position, hopefully, with all the agencies, especially with what we're presenting today, to potentially get an upgrade to that equivalent of bb+.
on the investment-grade front, that may be a little lumpier and probably, from that point, where we would get upgraded, probably a year -- a year beyond that before we get there. i think with fitch and moody's, the metrics work pretty well at 2.5 times. and with s&p, because of the way they look at certain things, at the 2.5 times, we're not necessarily exactly there on the metrics. but with the business rating improvement, which we believe that we're squarely in line to get, that would put us in the investment-grade range.
so i think what we're really looking at is sort of first quarter 2020, we're hoping we're in that range of getting an upgrade across the agencies to that bb+ range. and then we're looking at one year to maybe a year and a half beyond that to get to investment-grade with all three of the agencies. but i think that might be a little lumpier just given the way the metrics were. so we're going to keep doing what we're doing because i think the more we execute, the more we continue to perform the way that we say and that this business model becomes more and more apparent to people just how strong it is, and then also the quality of our assets, the quality of our retail business, that's going to be really helpful with all the agencies because i think what really is the bigger hang-up is, is this real? are people that -- are they going to be disciplined? and does this business model work? and i think -- so that's probably a bigger thing of anything.
and i think that takes a little bit of time. but we feel like we're in line for this next upgrade in the near future. and then we're going to obviously continue to execute, and we think we'd put ourselves in a good place for investment-grade rating.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim partners -- analyst
got it. congrats, curt, on this execution. it's terrific.

your next question comes from the line of stephen byrd with morgan stanley. please go ahead. your line is now open.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, good morning, and congrats on a very constructive and thorough update.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
ok. thanks, stephen. good to hear from you.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
just wanted to touch on your point you raised about solar in ercot. you gave a lot of good color around that. i guess if you run a very simple sort of solar lcoe model, you could see that maybe solar could work in a $30-plus market. but the point about practical limits on the growth of solar, i think, is a pretty important one we're often asked about.
could you just add a little bit more in terms of the volumes that you see that's realistic in terms of actually getting a hedge, getting financing, etc.? any color around that would be really helpful.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
that's a good question. so one of the things we've been trying to get our arms around, i think you guys know this, but the renewables that have been built in ercot, and frankly pretty much everywhere, have been ppa supported. and it's been large players that have come in and allowed -- basically used their balance sheet to do ppas. and then it does allow, obviously, to get financing and take lower returns, right, especially if you got investment-grade counterparty on the other end.
but there is a saturation point where you start getting into smaller companies who don't want to own a wind project or a solar project. and at some point in time in ercot, given the size -- i mean, we've got 50 gigawatts of renewables coming into this market. i mean, that's more than half of the current nameplate capacity in the market -- some of that is going to have to end up being merchant. i think the big question in ercot, being an all-energy market, as you add more intermittent resources and during the periods between when you actually see volatility in high pricing, prices are going to be lower because you're going to -- you've got intermittent resources with zero marginal cost.
and so the question is, is there going to be enough revenue and enough frequency of that revenue to support merchant build? and i don't care what kind of merchant build it is, it can be renewables or it can be combined-cycle plants. now combined cycle plants are way out of the money. renewables that we see, when you run the numbers, if you can get proper leverage on them, can get decent levered returns currently, and i expect that they'll continue to see some cost decline in that, but once you get into the merchant side of things, because no one's really built a merchant solar plant yet in ercot, but once you start to do that in an all-energy market with a backwardation and the forward curves as steep as it is, it's tough to get the financing that you need. and then you got to get someone to come in and put in the equity dollars.
and the problem with that, if it's just a single asset owner situation, it's going to be a little white-knuckle time between when you're actually getting lower in the off-peak periods, lower megawatt-hour pricing, and then you have to wait for a good summer to come in. some of my guys can do it because we can -- we've got a balance sheet and we can basically stand in between -- in between cycles. but someone who's a single asset owner with leverage on top of it, it's going to be a real tough thing. and i -- that's my biggest question is what's going to happen with the ercot market as you get more zero marginal cost assets setting price for most of the hours and you see a much more volatile business? can you get the kind of development that's going to be necessary? because i don't believe you can build this 50 gw or so out with all ppas.
i just don't think the market has that kind of depth. so that will be an interesting thing. my sense of it is, if we don't, there's going to be further changes to the market, whether it's an increase in the ordc or even maybe some -- some changes to ancillary services to get more revenues in the market to make sure that there's enough revenues. i mean i just don't see ercot going to a capacity market.
and when you think about outside of ercot, you do have capacity markets which can get additional revenues in. and i think you hear gordon van welie say this in iso new england because he's worried about the revenue stream from energy because of offshore wind coming in, but he still needs dispatchable resources, mainly the gas resources in new england, and there's nothing new getting built because you can't get a gas pipeline up there, so he wants to keep those around. so he knows he's going to have to get revenues stream into the capacity market because that's the way to basically keep assets around and hopefully get some new builds. so i -- i mean that's kind of how we see this playing out.
i mean it's going to be real interesting. obviously, we have a big seat at the table, so we'll be a part of that discussion, but that's sort of how we see it.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
that's really helpful. i'll let others ask questions. i appreciate it. thank you.

your next question comes from the line of greg gordon with evercore isi. please go ahead. your line is now open.
greg gordon -- evercore isi -- analyst
thanks. good morning. good update. thank you.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
hey, greg.
greg gordon -- evercore isi -- analyst
just to be clear, you say -- you assume 50 gigawatts of new nameplate renewables in the texas market. i think that that -- just that number alone will really cause people a lot of heartburn even if you're modeling that you can still generate stable cash flows out of that. but just to be clear, that's your aggressive case scenario? you don't necessarily believe that that's where we're going to end up in 2030 given the constraints you just articulated?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i think what we tried to do, greg, was this is a conservative view of the market. we didn't want to come out with something that look very self-serving. and i just mentioned this, and i'll say it again, i'm not sure how this actually plays out.
i mean you can model things, and we sort of forced function some of this new build to happen. whether that can really happen or not on a merchant basis, i have a lot of questions about that. and if that doesn't happen, you're still going to see increased volatility and higher pricing. it's just going to be higher pricing than what we've assumed here.
and so i -- we don't really know. i mean this is a modeling exercise. we wanted to be somewhat conservative on it. but there's a lot of leap of faith in this that, at some point, when the ppa market dries up, there's only so much depth to that, somebody is going to have to come in here and build on a merchant basis.
and that's tough in an all energy market. and i don't see people like us or nrg or exelon or others who have the ability to do it on balance sheet. we've all seen what can happen in ercot if you overbuild the market. so i just don't see that happening.
and then, of course, we mentioned in the script and i've said this before, there's still 15-plus thousand megawatts of higher heat rate, oil and gas, and coal units, that if we did somehow overbuild, which i just don't see happening, would come out of the stack. so that's why we're bullish on this ercot market, even in what we would consider a very conservative case that we put forward here.
greg gordon -- evercore isi -- analyst
great. my second question is you're obviously bullish on the fundamental value of the company and, to some degree, the arguments around the investment thesis in merchant power are this -- basically the durability of cash flow argument or the melting ice cube argument, which you're attacking head on. but to the extent that you really believe you're going to generate free cash flow after growth investments that -- over the next 10 years, that's greater than your current market cap, why aren't you plowing further ahead more aggressively with the buybacks in the short to medium term? and i know i understand that the very short-term answer is you want to get to investment grade, but to the extent you're confident that these cash flows are going to show up, we're basically looking at another $300-some-odd million of buyback in the short to medium term and then a pause in 2020 while you sort of run the engine to get to debt to ebitda of 2.5 times. right? so how do you balance with investors who are saying, ""well, if you're so excited about the future, why aren't you being more aggressive with the buyback?""
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean that's a good question, and that's the balance that we're trying to strike here. look, greg, there's no magic formula here. and i think it's our judgment that the equity value of this company does better with a stronger balance sheet than not.
and there's also a credibility and commitment thing, and we're not just committing to equity here, we're also committing to people who own our bonds. and we're trying to satisfy an entire capital structure here at the end of the day. but i think i watch calpine do this, and i know we're not where they were, but i watch them do a bunch of share buybacks and the market never believed their fundamental story, and their stock continued to decline as they bought back shares. and i think that was just the risk premium that the market required because of the concern of financial distress of the business and the business model.
and so i said when i first got here that we needed to run this thing at a debt level that would put us in line to potentially be investment grade, and that's what we're going to do. so i -- look, i understand that when you have debt that's even at 7.5%, and you're trading at a free cash flow yield of 15, the math i get, i just think that at some point we have to focus on getting our debt down. and i think this is really a one-year issue. and then on the back end of 2020, i think what you'll hear from us is a discussion about what we're going to do in 2021.
and depending on where our stock is trading at that point in time, i would not be shocked that the board would want to do some sort of a strong buyback program. but i think what we are trying to tell you guys right now is that we do believe that following through on our commitment to get in that range of 2.5 times is important for our company. and we did outline it, i think, and david said it in his comments, i think there's a lot of reasons why the equity should be supportive of us doing that. but it's a balance.
and you can make the argument that you've made here and others, but i think this is sort of what we believe is the right balance right now.
greg gordon -- evercore isi -- analyst
no. i actually completely agree with you. i just wanted to hear you articulate it. thank you.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer

your next question comes from the line of michael weinstein with credit suisse. please go ahead. your line is now open.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
hi. good morning, guys.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
hey, michael. how are you?
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
hey, all right. pretty good. just a follow-up on the same line of questions. i guess once you get a grade -- once you get an investment-grade credit rating and assuming that does improve valuation on the equity side as well, you've got really good cash flow, and from your own -- your own profile says there's sort of a limited amount of investment going forward, retail acquisitions will be smaller, i'm just wondering where -- what would you do with a better balance sheet and better valuations and better reception from investors at that point? where does the company go? what can you do more that you can't do with the current cash flow profile? right?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
i think we sort of outlined what we think is sort of the track of this thing. and i wish i had a better sense of timing of it. but we still believe in -- we still believe in the generation side of the business, we think it's still fundamentally important. we're not going to a retail-only model and a short model.
and so i would expect us to put some investment predominantly on the renewable side because that's going to be the work for us. but the other thing i will say that we haven't said a lot about but it's also part of this modeling thing was good for us, too, to understand kind of what's going on, but there could be some small investment in what i refer to as volatility assets, where either assets that actually can be around during the peak periods and they're very cheap type assets. now whether that's batteries or whether that's a gas fire peaker or something like that, we would look at. but that's small potatoes.
i mean i think the real thing here is that you'll see our company invest in generation in the future as we retire generation. and by the way, the retirement of this generation is going to be needed anyway. most of these coal plants we're talking about are going on 60-plus years old. they're becoming obsolete, and they're not economic.
and i think any business that is a capital-intensive business, whether it's airlines or chemicals or refining or whatever, have to replace their hardware at some point in time. the question is going to be what kind of hardware are we going to replace it with? i think it's going to be renewables. and more important than that, it's going to be when do you do it? and right now, i just don't -- there's so much money going into this that i think this is not the place. i think retail is a better place for us to invest at this point in time.
and we'll see where the cycle goes. but i think that at some point in time, though, there are going to be opportunities for us, whether that's ppas to come off of the renewables and they become merchant and we have the capability to run them and see more value than somebody else, i really don't know how that's all going to play out. but i do expect us to have a greater share of our business in renewables over the next 10 years. now whether we can spend that roughly $5 billion that we're talking about, $500 million a year over 10 years, i don't know.
if we don't, then we're going to return capital to shareholders. and that's just the way it's going to be. and we still generate a heck of a lot of cash. i think what this thing shows you, this 10-year deal, which we think is very conservative, that if we don't put a dime back into the business, we're only losing 2.5% to maybe on average 6.5% of ebitda, which means we're still generating a boatload of cash.
and so it's still a really vibrant business even if you don't reinvest in it. so we don't feel like we have a gun on our head to actually go out and spend money. and we're not going to do that. but i think the good news on our company is we've got the scale and the capabilities.
i think we've proven that we can buy things and we can extract value that others cannot. and i think we're going to get that opportunity around renewables. it's just a question of when.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
that makes sense. we cover the renewable industry, and a lot of the retailers, the distributed renewable, distributed rooftop solar players, are growing at 15% a year of sales. do you see yourself may be evolving into a retailer of perhaps, let's say, for example, centralized renewable energy, or perhaps maybe even a distributed power retailer, to compete against these rooftop players at some point?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
i think that is something that we will consider and have considered and continue to consider. i mean i think absolutely. i think that is an area for our company that we will and have taken a look at.
michael weinstein -- credit suisse -- analyst
ok. thanks a lot.

your next question comes from the line of praful mehta with citigroup. please go ahead. your line is now open.
praful mehta -- citi -- analyst
thanks so much. hi, guys, and i really appreciate the update.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
hey, praful, thank you.
praful mehta -- citi -- analyst
hi, curt. so maybe just on the investment that you've talked about over the next 10 years. what i find is, in your position, having both a retail and generation, you have the opportunity to step in and buy assets rather than grow them organically. i wanted to understand if that's a fair view.
given the volatility that you're seeing or you expect to see, do you expect to be this opportunistic around acquisitions? and what kind of examples can you give us where you kind of have seen that in the past and you expect to see that in the future?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
well, i think everything we've done so far, in my own opinion, has been pretty much an opportunistic thing. i mean, i think what we did with the odessa plant in texas was a good example of, we had a view of the future and we had somebody that was not a natural owner of that asset that wanted to get out, and i think we were opportunistic. and it turned out, obviously, to be a very good acquisition for us. i would say that was part skill and part luck because we didn't know people are going to pay us to take natural gas.
but we did have a view that natural gas would be relatively cheap in the permian to other hubs. so i think that's an example of being opportunistic that i think we've been able to do. i think the other thing is almost day one when we took over for dynegy, we were in discussions with pg&e around a battery project in moss landing, which our predecessor owners were not. and i think that was because we had the cash, the balance sheet and maybe the willingness, i don't know, to do something there.
but i think we will be opportunistic. that's why i mentioned, praful, that there could be some small asset things that would fit sort of like i said, sit -- fit the profile of being a volatility type asset that we might take a look at that i think would be opportunistic. maybe somebody that owns it today doesn't seem to see the same value that we do. and i think we'll continue to be that way.
and i believe that most of our renewable that i'm talking about, this renewable spend is going to be pretty much opportunistic. it's going to be waiting for the right period of time. and i've seen this business for a long time, and there are going to be opportunities around renewables where somebody overpaid, somebody can't make it, and those assets are going to come available, and we'll be around. and pretty much all the deal flow comes through us in most of the markets that we're in, and we'll get an opportunity to take a look at it.
so i do think that the large portion of what we do and what we will do will be more opportunistic. and i do think operating assets. the one thing i like about operating assets, in particular, retail, is they really don't have a lot of impact on credit ratings. so you can do them, but they generate cash immediately.
the problem with the development, the big development pipeline is you got that couple of year gestation period, and that takes a while and it's a drag on you until you actually get some kind of operating cash flow. so i think we do lean a little bit -- plus just the cost to build something is higher than what the cost to buy something is, except i'm a little worried right now where the renewable side of things are with the number of players that have decided to enter at least right now.
praful mehta -- citi -- analyst
gotcha. that's super helpful. and i'm sure the balance sheet will also help you be opportunistic. just a second question quickly, and we've got this a lot, which is if there is a democratic president, does this change your view in any way in terms of how ercot or pjm or how your assets are positioned? how would you think about that?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's a good question. so again, i've been around a long time. i've seen administrations come and go.
because it's so difficult to actually make things happen, even when we've seen where we've had republican-controlled presidency, with a republican-controlled congress or democrat-controlled presidency and congress, things just don't move that quickly. and so i haven't really seen that big of a change. there's been some things. obviously, the tax legislation was a pretty big deal for us as a company.
and i would say that, and there could be other things. but if you talk about just what people are speaking about, there's a pretty big divide. the current administration, in my opinion, is less of a principal administration and probably more -- i call them more opportunistic, looking for ways to actually surgically improve the economy. on the other side of the equation, you see a fairly progressive group, and the front runners are fairly progressive.
and some of the things that i've heard, such as the ban of fracking and just making it very difficult for gas pipelines, interestingly enough is actually good for our company. we are a long natural gas equivalents company. and so if you stop fracking, natural gas prices are going to go up. that is good for our company.
it might make me think about i wish i didn't shut down the coal plants that we did because those are obviously natural gas equivalents. i'm not sure everybody's thought that through yet, that you still have to run the power grid and you have to have assets. and if you shut down gas drilling, that's going to increase electricity costs. so -- but i've not really seen it change that much.
i don't expect it to change that much. we're sort of agnostic when it comes to who's in the presidency and the congress. i saw something recently where somebody came out and had us sort of pegged, i think, under democrat presidency and a democratic control of congress, that we don't do as well. i just don't see that.
i mean, i -- and i also think we expect to be a participant in the renewable side of the business. but one of the key points we tried to make in this discussion today is that when you bring in a significant amount of intermittent resources, you need some level of dispatchable resources that you can count on. and right now, given where gas prices are in this country, natural gas, efficient natural gas plants fit the bill, and we purposely did a deal to get long those types of assets. so we feel very good about how we've positioned ourselves.
and i feel like we will do well under any administration.
praful mehta -- citi -- analyst

your next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin-smith from bank of america. please go ahead. your line is now open.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
good morning team, thanks for your patience. i just wanted to run by the illustrative '21 and how you think about that sort of a year-over-year walk, if you will, from '20. i know you guys have laid out a number of different pieces there, but can we talk a little bit through it? and especially given the context for the updated hedges, i just wanted to make sure i understand this right. so looking at the hedges that you guys provided late in the deck, i think it's about $580 million for 2020, how do you think about that rolling off and rolling into '21? that might be a different way to ask of like what kind of embedded hedge value putting in '21 as well?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so first of all, i want to be clear that we don't provide -- we're not providing guidance on '21. there's always -- we try to do this because i know people -- in particular, you, julien. i know that you care about that out year.
and so part of this is just to try to get people a window into it. admittedly, here's the story for '21. i think we said this in the script. if you market to market, just take the curve, we'd be a little bit below where we're coming in, in '20, which '20 is a pretty strong year, but we would be below that.
when we run our -- when we run a very detailed fundamental model for '21, and we did this last year, and we had the same viewpoint, at this stage right now, we would say that our fundamental view is above where the market is trading. and so when we market to model, if you will, we would be above where 2020 comes in. and if you stripped out the base business, if you stripped out the retail businesses, it kind of falls in that same line. i mean we'd be a little bit below on the base business, but then on a mark to model, we'd be above.
the question is going to be are we going to see the curves move up? and we try to show this because we've seen it. i mean it has been very pronounced in '19 and '20, where when we rolled through the prompt period, the 1-year out period moved up. as we went through the summer of '19, '20 moved up. when we went through the summer of '18, '19 moved up.
and it happened as people began to realize that the market remained tight, but also they got glimpses of the volatility in the market, and we expect that to happen again. but that's -- we tried to range that for you guys to say that. but we feel pretty confident that we'll have an opportunity to hedge 2021, but i will tell you that we are going to be patient on that. but what we typically do is we're usually 80% to 90% hedged going into any prompt year.
i don't expect us to deviate from that too much. and i think we did try to say today that we might carry a little more length than we have in the past, one, because of the volatility and the fact that the volatility products that people have used to hedge swing risk in ercot are not as available because everybody's starting to realize this volatility but also because we added ambit and ambit also has swing risks associated with it. so i don't know if that gets to an answer to your question, but i think we're going to be patient around '21. we think it right now is below where fundamentals would see it.
and so i wouldn't expect us to move our hedge ratio up a lot right now in 2021. but i do expect, as we go through the balance of '20, as we get closer to 2021, we'll be likely hedged about the way we normally are, somewhere between 80% and 90% going into that year.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. but just in terms of the year-over-year walk here, any other large factors to kind of keep in mind? i just want to make sure i'm hearing you clear as you kind of think about your illustrative outlook.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. i mean just a couple of things that are a little bit different. so when we go from '20 to '21, we'll have the battery facility out of moss landing, so that is included -- will be included in 2021. we will get to a full run rate on ambit and crius because it takes us some time to do all the integration and all that.
and so that -- i think we've said before we're around $50 million on the battery. i would expect us to a pickup of maybe $15 million to $25 million on the ambit and crius side. so you are seeing some of that that would show up, which is contributing to offsetting some of the lower curves that you have for '21. then if we mark the curves to our model, that's when you go above 2020.
but those are two things that are -- that will be coming on that are new. and then we will be reaching full run rate of opi in 2021. so that $50 million will come on and then we'll be at full run rate by the end of 2021, but we'll be picking up some of that in 2021. so those are the things that i would say are contributing to, right now, offsetting relative to the ercot curves.
and by the way, the pjm curves are down, they're backwardation and so is iso new england. they're smaller though the impact on 2021. and so the real swing on this -- and this is true of us pretty much all the time, is the real swing on this will be what does ercot end up doing? and we feel very confident that our modeling is more representative of where things will come in, and that will obviously push us to either be flat, but more than likely higher, given all those other things i just went over with you, that we would end up being higher '21 to'20.

your next question comes from the line of sandeep sama with goldman sachs. please go ahead. your line is now open.
sandeep sama -- goldman sachs -- analyst
yes. hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. i want to focus on retail for a little bit. did you guys notice any increase in customer attrition in the retail business from the volatility in the summer power prices? or would you say it's a little too early because of the long-term nature of those contracts?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
so actually, we did not. i mean, we actually saw sort of the opposite. what tends to happen in a high price environment, our competition have to raise prices intra month because most of these guys are hanging on razor-thin margins. and so when that happens, you tend to see people move from sort of the fly by nights, if you will, to safety.
and txu energy, obviously, is a safe bet. so we actually saw through those months. i think we actually grew customers during that period of time. so -- and that's typical for us.
and the good news for us is when we get a customer, we typically could hold a customer for a good period of time. so i think it was net-net beneficial to us over that period of time.
sandeep sama -- goldman sachs -- analyst
got it. the other question i had was on how important the ig rating is for you guys. so as you think about achieving your leverage target of 2.5 times, is it absolutely critical in your mind to crossover into the ig territory? or would you just be comfortable getting to that leverage level and maintain it going forward?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. that's a good question. look, we never came out and said there's a fall in the sort of issue. i mean what i do believe, and i think we've tried to say this, is that i think it's a strong indicator of the risk of the business.
and i still believe there is a risk premium that sits in our free cash flow yield because people are just uncertain as to whether the business model is sustainable, and the business is sustainable. so we've tried to attack this in a couple of ways. one is through just pure execution and discipline and doing the things we said, and part of that is reducing your debt. i mean, i think that's one way to reduce that risk premium.
the other one is to try to draw a picture for people about what the long-term resiliency of this business is, which is why we did the 10-year view. so the -- i would say the investment grade is less about credit spreads and more about the risk of the business overall, which i believe then translates into a higher equity value because investors view that they don't need the risk premium that they once thought they needed for this business, that the risk profile of this business is much lower, and they can own it at a 10% free cash flow yield, not a 15% free cash flow yield. and i've said this a bunch of times. this company trades at a 10% free cash flow yield at $7 billion plus of equity value.
i mean that's a huge change in the value of our company. there's nothing i'm doing every day or anybody in this company is doing every day that could come close to creating that kind of value. and so we're doing everything we can to prove to people because we believe it, that the business -- the risk of this business has changed substantially by the way that we run it. and the amount of cash we generate is enormous.
it was -- who would have known? it was embedded in this situation where people had too much debt and they were blowing money on bad things at the wrong time. and we've cleaned that up. i think we just have to do it year-over-year, which we're doing. but i think a part of that puzzle is getting our debt down, and investment-grade would be a visible, tangible sign that the business risk of our company is significantly lower.
and i think that would have some impact on our free cash flow yield.
operator
and there are no further questions at this time. i would turn the call back over to curt morgan for closing remarks.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
once again, thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. i know it was a long call. really appreciate the questions and the opportunity to talk to you about our business. it's always a risk when you talk about 10-year view, but we thought it was important.
i think we've explained why we think that is important. and we always appreciate your interest in vistra energy, and we look forward to continuing the conversation. thank you and have a great day.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the vistra energy third-quarter 2019 results conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, molly sorg, vice president of investor relations. thank you. please go ahead.
molly sorg -- vice president of investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to vistra energy's investor webcast covering third-quarter 2019 results, which is being broadcast live from the investor relations section of our website at www.vistraenergy.com. also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our 10-q, and the related earnings release. joining me for today's call are curt morgan, president and chief executive officer; and david campbell, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
we have a few additional senior executives in the room to address questions in the second part of today's call as necessary. before we begin our presentation, i encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-gaap financial measures. today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied.
we assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-gaap financial measures. for such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measures are in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation. i will now turn the call over to curt morgan to kick off our discussion. 
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
thank you, molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. as always, we appreciate your interest in vistra energy. we expect this call to be lengthier than usual. we have a lot to cover, including q3 results, 2019 guidance, 2020 guidance, with a glimpse of 2021, and operations performance initiative update and a 10-year view based on our detailed fundamental analysis.
so let's get started.turning to slide 6. vistra finished the third quarter of 2019 reporting strong adjusted ebitda from its ongoing operations of $1.064 billion, results that are once again in line with the management's expectations for the quarter and results. i am pleased to see relative to guidance that already incorporated high ercot wholesale power prices, especially for the summer of 2019. the quarter began with an unseasonably mild july following one of the mildest junes in over 10 years.
in fact, there was a very -- various sentiment out and there, and our stock had sold off. on our second quarter call, we outlined why we remain bullish on the markets, especially ercot, and our company. of course, we know that august turned out to be a different story than july as the tight supply/demand dynamic in ercot resulted in sustained scarcity pricing. we saw 12, 15-minute intervals clear at the price cap of $9,000 per megawatt hour during the month.
to give you some perspective of the magnitude of the difference between july and august pricing at ercot, the average 7 by 24 price in august was $131 a megawatt hour, more than four times higher than the average july settle price of approximately $30 a megawatt hour. our fleet performed well during the summer peak period, resulting in august favorability in our ercot generation segment, offsetting the headwinds from july and, importantly, bringing realized prices for the quarter back in line with management expectations for the year. this is a key point and one i want to emphasize. in ercot, in order for peak hour forward curve that is well above $100 per megawatt hour to be realized, the market has to see some level of scarcity pricing materialize.
in fact, for peak forward curves to trade at these levels, a certain number of scarcity pricing intervals are assumed. in order to achieve financial projections that are based on the forward curve going into the year, we need to see some of these high-priced intervals occur. in short, each high-priced interval is not necessarily additive to financial results on a stand-alone basis, and some of this volatility is required to achieve the expected outcome. scarcity pricing did materialize in august in ercot and september of this year.
and vistra's integrated model performed well. our net length in ercot was able to capture scarcity pricing in the market, while also covering swings in our retail load, including the incremental crius load we acquired on july 15. crius came to us, like many other stand-alone retailers, under-hedged for the ercot summer and right in the thick of it. as a result, the crius book was more exposed to summer volatility in 2019 than it would have been under our ownership.
in fact, the scenario that materialized this summer is exactly why we prefer to be net long in ercot. our incremental length is first available for risk mitigation to ensure we have the appropriate amount of generation available to cover forward sales from our generation assets and our retail load requirements. incremental generation is then available to capture any scarcity pricing in the market, providing upside opportunity. of course, the overwhelming majority of our generation position is used to hedge retail and much of the excess generation is hedged before we arrive at the prompt periods, creating a lower-risk, more stable earnings profile.
we believe this is the right way to run our business, especially in a market like ercot that exhibits such extreme volatility in energy pricing. in fact, we expect we will see even more volatility in ercot in the coming summers as the market relies more heavily on intermittent renewable assets. as a result, the types of volatility products that have historically been available for retailers are becoming more expensive and difficult to find. given the change in composition of the generation mix in ercot and the expectation for increased volatility, we will likely want to go into future summers carrying at least as much length as we have historically, a topic i will discuss in more detail momentarily.
turning now to year-to-date results. vistra's adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations for the first nine months of the year is $2.586 billion, which is in line with management expectations that already incorporated robust summer wholesale power prices in ercot, as i previously discussed. with our strong performance for the first nine months of the year, combined with the addition of the crius business as of july 15, and the ambit business, which we just closed last friday, november 1st, we are both narrowing and raising the midpoint of our full-year 2019 ongoing operations guidance range. we expect we will finish the year delivering adjusted ebitda in the range of $3.32 billion to $3.42 billion in the top half of our prior 2019 guidance range.
in effect, our base business is generally tracking as originally projected for the year, with crius and ambit providing ebitda upside to our prior guidance range. we are similarly narrowing and raising our adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance range to the top end of our prior guidance range of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. our improved outlook for adjusted free cash flow before growth is a result of the expected increase in adjusted ebitda for the year. you will also see in the guidance table, on slide 6, a column highlighting illustrative guidance for 2019.
this illustrative guidance is $40 million higher than our updated 2019 guidance range as it backs out the negative impact of ercot retail backwardation we expect to realize in the year. when we talk about retail backwardation, we are referring to the near-term impact of long-dated contracts executed with retail customers supplied by our native generation. for example, if we execute a new three-year contract with a retail customer, often the pricing under that contract is flat for the entire three-year term. given the backwardation that exists in current ercot market curves, that usually means the contract is out of the money compared to the market in the early period of the contract but meaningfully in the money thereafter, such that the net present value of executing the transaction is favorable.
while we have historically realized some level of retail backwardation in our results, the total impact has typically been minor. however, for 2019 and 2020, we are projecting a much larger impact as a result of the greater current backwardation entering into both years, coupled with increased interest by market participants to enter into long-dated contracts in ercot. for 2019, we are estimating the impact of the ercot retail backwardation to be approximately $40 million. if we were to exclude this negative in-year financial impact, our adjusted ebitda guidance range would have increased to $3.36 billion to $3.46 billion, reflecting a midpoint that would have been at the high end of our guidance range.
we wanted to provide this illustrative range to give you a sense for exactly how well our integrated operations are executing in 2019. in fact, we believe, excluding the adverse backwardation impact from 2019 adjusted ebitda, is the proper way to look at our 2019 results, as we did not plan for the volume or the impact of long-dated contracts in our initial 2019 guidance. and moreover, the future favorable impact from these retail transactions will be included in our prospective guidance range. our core business demonstrated stability in a volatile summer market.
and with the additions of ambit and crius, we are expecting incremental upside to our base results. turning now to slide 7. we are also announcing today our guidance ranges for 2020. we have been reiterating for the past year our belief that 2020 results could be relatively flat to 2019, in part because we were confident that historical 2020 forward curves remain dislocated from fundamentals and would improve after we got past the 2019 summer, a phenomenon we have witnessed in recent years as depicted on the next slide and one we expect to continue for the foreseeable future.
we have forecast summer reserve margin of 10.5%. summer 2020 is expected to remain tight. and in march of next year, the loss of load probability in ercot's operating reserve demand curve shifts by another quarter of a standard deviation, which should further increase the probability of scarcity pricing intervals during the summer. the recent uplift in the 2020 forward curve, as well as the addition of the crius and ambit businesses has raised our prior expectation of relatively flat to a projected increase in adjusted ebitda year over year.
specifically for 2020, we are projecting adjusted ebitda in the range of $3.285 billion to $3.585 billion and adjusted free cash flow before growth of $2.16 billion to $2.46 billion. similar to 2019, we have provided on this slide an illustrative guidance range, excluding the projected negative impacts of our ercot retail backwardation. for 2020, we expect these impacts to be approximately $70 million higher than what we expect to realize in 2019, partially due to the addition of ambit whose portfolio will also be impacted by contracts with retail backwardation in ercot. excluding these impacts, our 2020 guidance midpoint would be approximately $3.5 billion, a significant increase over our expected 2019 results.
in fact, many of you will recall the five-year financial projections we published in our joint proxy statement and prospectus in connection with the dynegy merger announcement in the first quarter of 2018. at that time, our board of directors evaluated the merits of the dynegy transaction, assuming the 2020 adjusted ebitda of the combined business would be $2.81 billion, which included an estimated $350 million of value levers announced in connection with the merger. the midpoint of our 2020 guidance is more than $600 million higher than that previous estimate. in only two years, we have improved that 2020 financial outlook by more than 20%, with the vast majority of this improvement being driven by items entirely within our control and largely unaffected by commodity prices.
specifically, approximately $425 million of the improvement in adjusted ebitda is attributable to the hard work our teams have done to increase the expected merger value leverage by nearly 70%, while also adding incremental ebitda through growth investments. two years ago, when we announced the dynegy merger, the market was concerned about the long-term viability of this business, pointing to a $200 million decline in capacity revenues that would materialize in 2020. the 2020 guidance we are providing today is just one example of the resiliency of this business model. our teams continue to identify efficiencies that maximize the value of our operations, and we have been successful at identifying tuck-in growth opportunities that are both ebitda and free cash flow accretive with very attractive returns, while requiring modest levels of our free cash flow to pursue.
we are confident that this business model will continue to create value for our stakeholders, a topic we will discuss in more detail shortly. and i must say, in our view, vistra's stock price does not reflect the resiliency, stability and level of ebitda and free cash flow of this business. a final note on this slide. you might notice that these guidance ranges are slightly wider than our prior guidance ranges, reflecting bands of $150 million as compared to our prior bands of $100 million.
we believe a guidance range based on a percentage of ebitda is most appropriate and a range of plus or minus approximately 5% is reasonable and in alignment with peers. we believe a wider guidance range also better reflects the potential range of outcomes for our business, particularly in ercot, with its tight reserve margins and increasing reliance on intermittent renewable resources. this market dynamic is increasing the volatility in ercot, as well as the potential to capture value if managed properly with the right assets. in fact, it is now more important than ever that we have length on the days where there is volatility in the market, especially when taking into consideration the size of the load we serve.
as a result, we might find it prudent to carry more length in december 2020 and beyond than we have in years past. given this past summer and the likely influx of more intermittent resources, the cost of managing risk in ercot has gone up, especially for short retailers. while the range of potential outcomes may be wider for us in ercot, we are well-positioned to take advantage of the increased volatility, given our high-quality, long asset position, integrated business and commercial capabilities. furthermore, as i will discuss in connection with our 10-year outlook, our fundamental analysis continues to forecast a high probability of scarcity events occurring at ercot in future years.
the ercot market is changing. increasing intermittent resources will inevitably increase the appropriate level of reserve margin, a cost to run the power system with significant intermittent renewables that is yet to be fully understood and recognized by stakeholders. this increased volatility suits our integrated business position and capabilities quite well. so we remain bullish on the ercot market and our ability to capitalize on opportunities likely to arise in the future.
turning now to our thoughts on 2021. directionally, we still believe 2021 adjusted ebitda could be relatively flat to or higher than 2019 and 2020. if you take a view based solely on the forward curves, 2021 adjusted ebitda would look slightly down compared to prior years. however, as we have discussed, and as we depict on the next slide, forward curves that are more than a year out tend to understate the tight supply/demand dynamic and increased likelihood of volatility in ercot in particular.
the graph on slide 8 is a helpful visual of this phenomenon, where there was a significant uplift in forward pricing in 2018, 2019 and 2020, as each delivery year approached. this uplift was especially prominent for 2019 and 2020, appropriately reflecting updated scarcity pricing expectations, including the modifications to the ordc and the tight market conditions. as you know, we develop our own point of view of where we believe forward pricing is likely to materialize based on rigorous analysis of market fundamentals. as it did for 2020, our point of view for 2021 would suggest that current market curves are not representative of likely pricing outcomes.
as a result, when looking forward to 2021, in the context of our internal point of view, we believe 2021 adjusted ebitda would exceed 2019 and 2020 results. recognizing that there are a range of potential outcomes for 2021, we are comfortable given our fundamental analysis that the 2021 has a very good chance of being relatively flat to 2020, if not, higher. a relatively flat outcome would reflect a nearly $700 million improvement in the adjusted ebitda that was forecast for the business at the time we announced the dynegy merger two years ago. the outlook for our business continues to improve, and we remain believers in our business model.
turning now to slide 9. i'm excited to announce today that we have identified $50 million of incremental ebitda enhancement opportunities from our ongoing operations performance initiative under the leadership of jim burke. our teams on the ground know that in order to remain viable as the generation landscape evolves, we must ensure our assets are operating at the highest level of efficiency and at the lowest cost, while, first and foremost, prioritizing safety. the opi process is critical to our success in this regard, and it continues to deliver results.
incrementally, within the fleet rationalization bucket of our opi process, we have also improved our financial forecast with the retirements of four coal plants in downstate illinois. as you know, vistra was required to retire 2,000 megawatts of nameplate capacity in miso zone four in connection with an amendment to the multi-pollutant standard, which was finalized this summer. three of the plants, coffeen, havana and hennepin, were retired effective november 1st. the fourth plant, duck creek, is scheduled to retire on december 15 of this year.
as a result of these retirements, vistra has improved its 2021 adjusted ebitda forecast by an incremental $100 million, which is net of the previously identified opi opportunity at these sites. taken together, these updates improve our opi target to a total of $425 million per year, up from the $125 million we announced in connection with the dynegy merger. including synergies and opi, the ebitda value lever targets we have identified for the dynegy merger have increased from $350 million annually to $715 million, which includes $290 million of traditional merger synergies, $325 million of opi value levers identified and a net $100 million of ebitda improvement in 2021 from the retirement of the four miso plants. it has been two years since we first announced the acquisition of dynegy, and the financial benefits of the transaction continue to improve.
financial synergies, however, were not the sole reason we made the decision to acquire dynegy. another important factor was the opportunity to transition vistra's generation fleet from one that was heavily weighted toward coal to one that is now approximately 64% natural gas by capacity. we believe our relatively young, low heat rate generation fleet will be able to create value for our stakeholders over the next decade and beyond, which leads me to the discussion of our 10-year fundamental outlook. before i get into the discussion, i would like to explain why we believe it is essential for us to present a longer-term view of our company and the key power markets where we operate.
first, at a minimum, we believe it is important to frame the potential impact of our recently announced greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets on the business. furthermore, we believe it is imperative to our company's valuation that we explain the long-term prospects for the business given our perspective on technological and climate change impacts on the sector. simply put, there is a terminal value question for energy companies, and we believe it is necessary to address it head-on. the good news is that the power sector stands to grow over time as a result of electrification across all sectors of the economy in response to climate change, and we are well-positioned.
slide 11 summarizes our 10-year view. as most of you are aware, last week, vistra announced for the first time our long-term greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, which include our goal to achieve a more than 50% reduction in co2 equivalent emissions by 2030 as compared to a 2010 baseline. notably, vistra has already retired or announced plans to retire 14 coal plants and three gas plants since 2010, resulting in a reduction of co2 equivalent emissions of approximately 42%. as a result, in reflecting the marginal profitability of some of our coal units in particular, we expect we can achieve our 2030 emissions reduction target through incremental retirement actions, representing only 2.5% of our projected 2020 adjusted ebitda.
while any such retirements will advance our progress toward our long-term emissions reduction targets, our fundamental analysis would suggest that future retirements of this magnitude will be warranted based on economics alone. in fact, we estimate generation assets, representing approximately 5% to 8% of our projected 2020 adjusted ebitda could be at risk of retirement in the next decade, predominantly from new build, in particular, renewables and expected environmental expenditures. importantly, this small percentage of our total ebitda can be replaced with relatively minor growth investments over the same time period. at vistra's targeted return levels, we could replace a 2.5% ebitda reduction projected to achieve our 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target with less than $500 million of investment.
the incremental at risk ebitda would require only $500 million to $1 billion of additional investment. to put this size of investment into perspective, we have already more than replaced the equivalent of the ebitda risk through our recent retail and battery investment, not to mention, our incremental ebitda improvement initiatives such as opi. in addition, this level of investment represents only about 2.5% to 7.5% of our anticipated free cash flow over the next 10 years, assuming we generate $2 billion of free cash flow each year on average. the bulk of vistra's current adjusted ebitda is derived from its relatively young, low-cost, highly flexible gas field generation fleet, with two of the lowest cost nuclear coal plants in the country in comanche peak and oak grove.
we believe these assets are well-positioned for success in markets, with the increasing reliance on intermittent resources. in particular, we expect our flexible natural gas assets will run more and remain critical to the reliability of the regional power markets in which we operate. we are seeing this phenomenon play out in california now, as the percentage of solar assets in the state increases. for example, resource adequacy contracts for gas assets in california are being transacted at $7 to $7.50 per kw a month right now, which, as a frame of reference, is almost double the revenues awarded in the iso new england's latest capacity auction.
we also saw this play out in ercot during the summer peak as our gas field peaking and steamer assets played a key role on low wind days. our fleet, which is approximately 64% natural gas by capacity, is well-positioned to capture value and support market reliability as renewables are built out across the u.s. similarly, we believe our retail business will remain a stable and growing contributor of our performance over the next decade. and we project fundamentals in both ercot and pjm, our core markets, will remain strong.
turning to slide 12. let's start our fundamentals discussion with ercot. getting right to the punchline, our fundamental analysis projects that ercot prices are likely to remain in the mid-$30s or higher per megawatt hour through 2030, with scarcity pricing events remaining a consistent feature in the market over this time period. in reaching this conclusion, our team factored in an estimated 1.5% to 2% annual load growth through 2030.
and the scenarios that we evaluated included the addition of up to 50 gigawatts of new renewable assets, including approximately six gigawatts of battery storage with no sustained transmission capacity constraints, although we do expect there will be price differentials by zone. we similarly modeled potential retirements in the market based on economic factors or plant obsolescence, assuming only three and a half gigawatts of retirements over the next decade. while we believe our analysis is conservative, if it proves to be too bullish, we believe there are more than 15 gigawatts of generation in ercot supply stack potentially at risk of retirement, which should further mitigate any downside scenarios. in arriving at our conclusion on expected market price outcomes, we ran a bottoms-up hour-by-hour simulation model, with explicit assumptions around newbuild, retirements and load growth, and we calibrated our model relative to ercot's history.
what market observers perhaps do not appreciate is how markets will evolve with the rising intermittency from increased reliance on renewable assets. the greater the percentage of renewable assets in the market, the higher the levels of volatility we expect to see. this is true, even if the market has increasing reserve margins, as the expansion of reserve margins is driven by renewable assets, which tend to rise and fall together. renewable penetration effectively lowers the overall median price observed in a year as renewable assets with a zero marginal cost shift their generation stack further to the right.
however, and most important, the higher percentage of renewables in the market will significantly increase the probability of scarcity events and pricing volatility, resulting in a significantly higher average annual price relative to the median price. if you think about it, renewable assets of a like kind in the same geographic area will generally be available or off-line as a class. in many instances, the renewable assets will not be able to capture price spikes because, in large part, they will be the cause of the scarcity event due to the correlated nature of their failure to perform. for example, all solar will be off-line at 9:00 p.m.
and all wind drops when front stall over a geographic area. an increasingly important metric to pay attention to in ercot will be net load, defined as load less renewables, as that is ultimately what the iso has to manage on a delivered basis. net load peaks, rather than overall demand peaks, are expected to be more highly correlated with scarcity events in the future. this was the case in ercot this august, when price play ups were driven primarily by low availability of wind generation on days with strong, though not extreme, demand, as we depict on the next slide.
slide 13 shows that on august 15 of this year, power prices in ercot spiked to the market cap of $9,000 per megawatt hour. however, peak load was less than 71,000 megawatts, approximately 5% lower than ercot's 2019 peak summer demand. the real driver for the price spike was the low level of wind output, which was approximately 2,500 megawatts or less than 15% of nameplate capacity during the intervals at the cap, compared to an average output of 6,000 to 7,000 megawatts for peak summer wind. renewable resources, by definition, are unpredictable.
with renewable assets forecast to make up a greater percentage of the ercot supply base over the next decade, market participants should expect sustained volatility, as well as increased reliance on flexible and efficient natural gas assets, of which we have many. in short, renewable penetration in ercot should not meaningfully depress market pricing. rather, our fundamental analysis would suggest average market price will remain stable to rising over the next decade. our ercot fleet, which is comprised of low-cost base load coal, solar and nuclear assets, highly flexible and low heat rate ccgts and gas peaking and steam units is well-positioned to capture value as the market evolves.
before we leave ercot and move on to pjm, let's turn to slide 14, where we backcast 2019 actuals to prior years in order to further demonstrate our view that 2019 is representative of ercot's new normal. as you can see in the chart on the top half of the slide, despite the scarcity pricing we observed in august and september of this year, 2019 was not an outlier of extreme temperature days in texas. as i just discussed, the scarcity pricing was driven more by a combination of strong load and low renewables, a phenomenon we can expect to see more of in ercot over the next decade, particularly as a greater percentage of the supply base is comprised of renewable assets. the bottom half of slide 14 shows the result of recasting 2011 through 2019 based on our fundamental point of view of the 2020 supply stack.
the results reinforce our expectation of persistent scarcity events going forward. for example, in 2018, modeling the 2020 supply stack, we would have expected to see 14 hours of north hub pricing above $1,000 per megawatt hour, compared to the four hours we actually observed in the year. this backcast highlights that a small number of incremental renewable assets in the supply stack can have a noticeable difference in pricing outcomes. last, let's not forget that beginning in march of next year, ordc pricing will kick in even earlier than it did in 2019, further increasing the probability of scarcity pricing outcomes.
we remain steadfast in our view that the long-term forward power curves do not reflect the underlying fundamentals of the ercot market. as we have discussed in the past, the backwardation of the forward curve, while not reflective of fundamentals, do exert a certain level of discipline on the market, especially related to merchant thermal newbuild. it will also impact future renewable development as we reach a saturation point for renewable ppas. let's not forget that merchant investments require the ability to hedge five to seven years out to secure capital.
in addition, the market must support sufficient revenues to justify merchant investments. there are some that believe a round the clock pricing in ercot will decline to a sustained low 20s per megawatt hour, but this ignores the likelihood of incremental retirement at those price levels, as well as the need to have long-term pricing that supports adequate returns for the lowest cost merchant investment, likely renewables. in fact, this low price draconian view is neither supported by any reasonable analysis, nor can it sustain the market in the long run. our analysis indicates that the current market rules in ercot can and will provide adequate revenues, but they will be more volatile and less predictable.
we will see if this market construct will support the level of investment, especially merchant, that will be needed to maintain a minimally acceptable reserve margin as we have assumed in our fundamental analysis. we believe our existing ercot generation fleet, with assets that are low cost, flexible and well-positioned on the supply stack will remain valuable and critical to ensuring a reliable, cost-effective risk. turning now to pjm. i'm on slide 15.
unlike ercot, pjm has delivered relatively stable energy and capacity revenues over the last several years. from 2010 to 2018, the average pjm ccgt earned approximately $9 to $12 per kw a month from the combination of capacity and energy. in fact, capacity and energy revenues has historically moved in opposite directions, resulting in a relatively stable earnings profile in total and over time. the graphs we depict on slide 15 demonstrate this phenomenon.
for example, in 2016, you can see that trough capacity prices for rto zone were offset by on peak spark spreads that were at a four-year high. similarly, in 2017, on-peak spark spreads in emaac were relatively low, but capacity prices in the zone were at a peak in the second half of the year. we have seen this dynamic play out in pjm over the years. and in a similar fashion, our fundamental analysis result in expectations of flat to gradually rising overall energy and capacity pricing through 2030.
our fundamental analysis is driven by the expectation of gradually tightening reserve margins, the possibility of slightly rising natural gas prices and prospects for ongoing retirement of older, less efficient coal, oil and gas steam units. we also assume that the results in the capacity market will not change materially from recent clears, with expected highs and lows. while we expect renewables will be added to the supply stack over the next decade, pjm is the least favorable market for renewables, with largely low onshore wind intensity and low sun irradiance. as a result, we expect renewable development will be driven by state rps standards rather than economics.
as reflected by the consistent band of historical returns in pjm, with over 180,000 megawatts of installed capacity, it is difficult for either incremental new supply or retirements to meaningfully move the market in one direction or the other. just as we have seen in recent periods, we expect total revenues to vary year to year, though to remain consistent with historical levels overall. as it relates to vistra specifically, we believe our large fleet of efficient ccgt units in pjm will continue to generate a significant amount of ebitda for our consolidated operations as they collect significant revenue streams from both capacity and energy markets. however, our pjm coal units could be at risk of retirement, just as other high-cost coal, oil and gas units will be over the next decade.
we have factored any potential future retirements into our ebitda at risk analysis. which takes us to our last slide on our 10-year fundamental outlook, slide 16. our analysis supports our view that vistra can generate relatively stable to growing ebitda in a wide range of scenarios, including generating approximately $2 billion per year on average of adjusted free cash flow before growth to either return to shareholders or to invest in growth opportunities. if we invest, on average, $500 million a year on growth opportunities, roughly a quarter of our projected adjusted free cash flow on an annual basis and achieve our targeted returns, we could deliver an incremental $90 million to $100 million a year of ebitda.
our track record, to date, with the acquisition of the odessa ccgt plant in west texas, the development of the upton two and moss landing solar and battery project and the acquisition of crius and ambit on the retail side has demonstrated that we can be successful in finding high-return, tuck-in growth opportunities on a regular basis. in fact, those projects have exceeded or expected to exceed our targeted return levels. continuing this history of executing on opportunistic growth projects likely in retail, renewables and battery storage would not only require only a small portion of our overall anticipated cash flows, but it is expected to result in a growing business that would more than offset the impact of potential plant retirements over the next decade. in fact, even after allocating capital to growth projects and paying an annual dividend, vistra could still have a significant amount of cash available to return to shareholders.
we expect we will have meaningful cash to deploy beginning in 2021 after we achieve our long-term leverage target. as we always mentioned, with any discussion of growth, if we do not find opportunities to invest at attractive returns, we will return capital to shareholders. this is always our litmus test. in summary, our assessment of the 10-year prospect for our business reinforces confidence that our business model is resilient and compelling, taking advantage of the way we have positioned our company as a low-cost, low leverage integrated business with in-the-money assets in attractive markets.
we have covered a lot today. i hope it has been a worthwhile discussion for you, and i hope you walk away from this call with a better understanding of a few key points. first, renewable penetration is not an insurmountable threat to our business, rather a higher percentage of renewables in the market will merely change the distribution of price outcomes, placing more importance on unit performance during high price intervals and increasing the reliance of efficient ccgt assets and peaking units, of which, we have many. and we will have the opportunity to invest in the technological changes impacting our business, but in a disciplined manner.
second, while certain of our units, specifically our coal plants in miso and pjm could be at risk of retirement over the next decade, these assets are not meaningful contributors of ebitda today. our modeling suggests that given the favorable position of our generation assets on the supply stacks in the markets where they operate, only 2.5% of our estimated 2020 adjusted ebitda would be lost in order to achieve our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target and a modest 5% to 8% could be at risk through 2030 from new build penetration and environmental expenditures. the assets that are most exposed to a higher penetration of renewables are the older, high heat rate assets, of which we own very few. and third, we expect to generate a significant amount of free cash flow on an annual basis.
using only a small percentage of this free cash flow, we can make attractive growth investments to not only offset any ebitda loss from future asset retirements, but to grow our business. with our strong free cash flow and market-leading position in the core competitive electric markets in the u.s., we can participate in the evolving power markets where it makes sense, while also returning capital to shareholders. we do not believe our business is a melting ice cube, rather, through cost management and efficiencies, financial discipline and execution, we believe we can continue to create value for our shareholders over the long term. we continue to believe our stock is undervalued, and the math tells us that the market must be discounting our future value.
we believe this analysis is one piece of compelling evidence suggesting that we can produce strong results on a consistent basis over a long period of time, and we have demonstrated our ability to execute. i will now turn the call over to david campbell.
david campbell -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, curt. turning now to slide 18. vistra delivered third-quarter 2019 adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations of $1.064 billion, which, as curt mentioned, is in line with our expectations. our third-quarter results were $89 million lower than the same period of 2018.
the quarter-over-quarter decline was driven by lower prices and volumes in our midwest and northeast segments. lower retail gross margin in 2019 was offset by higher prices and margins in our ercot wholesale segment. as you know, we are expecting negative adjusted ebitda in our retail segment for the quarter, given the extreme peak in august 2019 heat rates observed in the market at the time we are procuring power for the year, which drove up to our third quarter cost of goods sold. as we discussed in our second-quarter call, we shape the cost of goods sold for our retail business with the actual power curves rather than straightlining these costs over the year.
the retail backwardation that curt mentioned earlier was concentrated in the third quarter. the negative $40 million impact has already been fully recognized in the retail year-to-date results. in fact, the negative impact in the third quarter is a little higher than $50 million, with some reversal occurring by year-end. as you may recall, we realized higher retail gross margin in the first and second quarters of 2019 as compared to their respective quarters in 2018.
we expect a similar result in the fourth quarter. year to date, vistra's adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations was $2.586 billion, which is also in line with management expectations for the period. the next two slides set forth our 2019 and 2020 adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance ranges. given that curt already covered our guidance announcements, i won't spend much time on these pages, though i do want to mention the updates to our asset closure segment guidance for 2019.
you will see that our guidance ranges for the asset closure segment now assume a more negative impact as compared to our prior 2019 guidance. the primary driver of this variance is the transfer of the four miso plants retiring in the fourth quarter to asset closure. this impact flows through the asset closure segment projections in the 10-year update we have provided on slide 28 in the appendix. it is important to remember that projected asset closure expenditures have already been accounted for in the asset retirement obligation on our balance sheet.
the retirement of the assets nearly buckets the anticipated cash flows in the asset closure segment as opposed to our ongoing operations. let's turn now to slide 21 for an update on our capital allocation plan. as of october 31, we've executed $1.415 billion of our $1.75 billion share repurchase program, leaving approximately $335 million of capital remaining for future share repurchases. you will notice that the pace of our repurchasing slowed in the third quarter, which was a direct reflection of the improvement in our stock price during the period.
with respect to the $335 million that is outstanding under the program, we will continue to be flexible. at the present time, our capital allocation priority for 2020 is debt reduction. we are focused as a company on reducing our leverage in the range of our targeted levels, which will support an upgrade to our debt ratings and keep us on the path to investment grade. we will continue to opportunistically evaluate repurchasing shares or investing in promising growth opportunities, especially those that have minimal impact on our leverage.
our dividend is continuing as expected. we announced last week that our board approved the next quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share, or $0.50 per share, on an annual basis, which will be paid on december 30 to shareholders of record on december 16. following review and approval by our board, we plan to announce the annual increase to our dividend on the fourth-quarter earnings call on february 2020. management still anticipates the dividend will grow at an annual rate of approximately 6% to 8%.
lastly, paying down our debt remains the key capital allocation priority for vistra, and we are continuing to track toward our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to ebitda. we believe achieving our long-term leverage target will further reduce the risk profile of our business for opportunistic growth investments and enhance our long-term equity value by increasing the value of the company available to shareholders and appropriately reducing the risk premium implied in our current free cash flow yield. we continue to expect that we will have significant cash available for allocation in 2021 and beyond, supporting a growing dividend, future growth investments and meaningful excess free cash flow to return to shareholders, including repurchasing our stock when appropriate. we expect to discuss this more as we progress through 2020.
one final comment before we open up the line for questions. we have made a few changes to our hedge disclosures this quarter. the new disclosures can be found on slides 30 and 31 in the appendix. updates include the addition of power price sensitivities, as well as a breakout of the hedge value that is embedded in our total realized price.
we continue to try to improve our disclosures to make them more user-friendly, and we hope that you will find this new format helpful. in closing, we remain confident that our business has the necessary elements to thrive now and for the long term. the strong performance of our integrated operations during the third quarter reinforces our view that our business can generate stable ebitda and free cash flow in a variety of market environments. our fundamental analysis supports that the core markets in which we operate will remain attractive over the next decade, and we believe our relatively young and efficient generation fleet, comprised primarily of lower heat rates, flexible gas assets, will be critical to supplying the nation's electricity needs as the country transitions to lower-carbon technologies.
our projected strong free cash flow generation will ensure that we can participate in this transition, where economics are supportive of investment. we are excited for the future, and we hope you are as well. with that, operator, we are now ready to open the line for questions.

okay. [operator instructions] your first question comes from shahriar pourreza from guggenheim. your line is open.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
hey, good morning, guys.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
good morning, shah. how are you?
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
not too bad. just, curt, a couple of questions here. i know, obviously, you did the small retail acquisition in texas in the quarter. it looks like a pretty healthy multiple, very high cash flow conversion on that. can you just maybe shed any more details on the process there? is this something that we should kind of expect intermittently or was it more of a sort of one-off? and are you seeing any additional opportunities?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
good question, shah. so we are seeing these types of opportunities come up. what can happen is, and what we typically do through our m&a team is we will reach out to entities like this, and in some cases we'll reach out and say, are you interested in exiting the business? and in other cases, they may be looking to exit. we happen to know a couple of the principals. and we actually do their supply right now for infinite. so we have a relationship, an existing relationship. and i think when they decided that it was time for them to do something different, they, of course, looked at us as one of the top candidates for buying their business. so this one, i think, came to us a little bit different. but we have an active process where we are reaching out to some entities and then, again, some will reach out to us.
and there are, i'd say, a few of these seems like all the time. and some of which we are able to sign a deal with and some that we are not. so i would expect that this can continue. and they're smallish in nature but they add up over time.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
got it. perfect. then you noted that in the upper end, you've been at the upper end of your '21 guidance, that's fairly achievable. can you just maybe refresh us on what the drivers are that may be giving you a little bit more incremental confidence? i mean, looks directionally like you're pointing to the economy and supply/demand. i guess, how has that improved since late september? so maybe just a little bit of drivers there.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so october has turned out to be a pretty decent month for us on the retail side of the business, although we're still closing out things. but there's a potential that we -- the weather was decent, and we still have to take a look at what the final tally looks like, but it could be in a favorable position. and we've also -- as you know, we were pretty well hedged on the wholesale side throughout the year at some reasonably good pricing.
so i think that we also go into things a little bit as you might expect, because we don't know exactly what's going to happen with weather. and our retail business actually does well in these shoulder months, that we tend to go a little conservative even when we revise our guidance. and i think what's showing is that we're more on target with where we thought we would end up being plus i think we may see a little better october. all of that is beginning to give us more confidence. this is just a situation where our confidence is growing around getting somewhere above the midpoint and heading toward the upper end of that range. and that's simply what it is. but i think october also may end up being a favorable month. again, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves because we haven't closed out the books yet.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
got it. and i was referring to -- i'm assuming you're referring to '21 correct?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
well, i'm sorry, i thought you said -- ok, you're talking about '21, i apologize.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
yes, exactly. no, it's ok.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
in '21, so that's a little bit different. i apologize for that. in '21, i mean, i alluded to this in my comments that our business position and assets do offer us option value. and the market, depending on whether you're short or long or where your book is positioned, people look at our business position and they see value for them and we see value in our business. and we're able to either transact in the forwards. sometimes, the forwards recognize scarcity. and sometimes, they recognize the value that's embedded in our assets and you can use that to hedge. sometimes, like right now, it's not fully reflected in the forward curves but that value is still there and you can capture it on a bilateral basis.
and so i think what we're seeing though is in the market, that the value in our portfolio is there. it's just a matter of how do you want to transact and capture it. and we're seeing that value and we're realizing some of it. and we feel like that gives us a lot of confidence that ultimately '21 will turn out to be a year where we can get to the midpoint or even better than that.
so it's just really what you see in the marketplace. and it's not always -- i try to tell this to people, the forward curves are not the end all be all, especially as you get out beyond a year where they are thinly traded and they're not very representative. had we gone back and marked our book to the forward curves 5 years ago, we would be coming in with ebitda over that 5-year period at less than $3 billion. but that's not how it ended up. and so you got to be very careful about just choosing the forward curves. i know it's an easy thing. and i know it feels right for people to do it. but that's why we invest a bunch of money to try to analyze and model and understand the fundamentals of our business.
and i know people get worried about models and all that. but for us, we have to do that along with the forwards to understand really the value of our business. and for '21, we think there's a lot of value that's not reflected in the forward curves and there are multiple ways to realize that value.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim -- analyst
got it. i'll hop back in the queue. thanks so much, guys.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
all right. thanks, shah.
operator
and your next question will come from julien dumoulin from bank of america. your line is open.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, good morning, team. thanks for the time. i'll make this quick. so you all talked about, shall we call it growth initiative, a few weeks ago here. so at the time, i think you had alluded to having a shortly upcoming phase 2 update on texas specifically. where do you stand on expanding on your initial growth efforts, first? and then secondly related, more structured, how should we think about your tax appetite going forward relative to the pace of renewable and/or storage investments, right? as i think about it, i would think that you would key the pace investments off of your ability to absorb those tax attributes directly? or are we mistaken in making that assumption and thinking that perhaps the direct retail sales would drive some of those growth ambitions? so a lot of in there, but i'll let you have at it.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. so i'll take a shot at that. and david or jim, jim burke is on here with us, if you guys want to add to it. but in terms of the phase 2, i'm thinking that that is probably more a '21 -- later '21 type event where we would talk about that. we still have a significant pipeline of things that we announced in phase 1. we haven't decided exactly when we would come out with our phase 2 details, but i would guess it's more of a '21 event.
in terms of tax appetite, of course, tax appetite is going to be somewhat driven by the election and where tax rates go. but what we do is we look at the present value of the tax benefit relative to what the cost is of bringing in tax equity. and what we have found so far, julien, is that we still have a tax -- we still have an appetite depending on where prices go, so we look at it both using our point of view, our fundamental modeling as well as market, and when we become taxable, it does affect the npv of those tax attributes. but in all cases, we have an appetite for tax attributes because we will ultimately become a taxpayer after we run through the nols. and, of course, you know that we have this unique tra payment that actually will kick in before federal taxes will. and so we also look at that because that helps us defer the tra payment as well. and that also affects our appetite for the tax attributes of renewables.
so it's going to be a little bit fluid just because we don't know exactly what tax rates are going to end up being. but whether it's today's tax environment or something different, we still continue to have a tax appetite. and we believe we will continue to have that even into our phase 2 build-out.
does anybody, david or jim, want to add anything to what i've just said?
david campbell -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
well, i was going to say we look at this from an overall return perspective, of course. so tax attributes are a factor in our overall analysis. and ercot phase 1, the products exceeded our return thresholds with utilizing the tax benefits on the schedule that we can utilize it. that's how we model them. and as curt described, there are higher benefits used internally than in a third-party marketplace. so as we look at ercot phase 2 and beyond, we'll do that same assessment of what's the maximum opportunity to extract further tax benefits. and we'll fold that into our overall customer accounts and to make sure that the project exceed our returns. jim, over to you.
jim burke -- executive vice president and chief operating officer
yeah. thank you, david. sorry about that. curt as you described it, most of our phase 1 spend, it peaks in 2021 and starts to taper off in '22. so we would expect to announce the phase 2 in 2021. so fill in some of 2022, and then the bulk would be in 2023 to try to levelize around the $500 million or so in growth capital. so that's how i see it sort of feathering in at this point.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
got it. quick follow-up here, curt. given the feedback after the analyst day, are you committed going forward to continue to see that level of capex even after phase 2?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
yes, we are. we are. i think, julien, we see what everybody sees in terms of where the world is going. and i don't think that the esg world is going to change in the next couple of years. and we want to be a part of that transition. and we also believe that we have the projects, the capabilities and understanding the markets to be able to invest and to generate very good returns.
of course, we always will look at any given time if something were to change, then we would obviously let you guys know that. and i'm not saying that we can't change. we're not stubborn about it. but we still see opportunity and we haven't seen anything to change our view on the long-term fundamental view of markets that we have today and then our ability to create value from investment. we think a quarter of our free cash flow makes a lot of sense to reinvest in the business. but as we have said before, if we begin to see a market environment where we don't believe that we can generate the kind of returns that we think we can, then we will return that money to our shareholders. but at this point in time, we feel like we can continue to do that.
and i think one of the things that really is underappreciated, in my mind, is that there is going to be a supply response to newbuild. there was a supply response when combined cycle plants came into the market, and there were a number of retirements in coal plants and higher heat rate gas and oil units. and that's going to continue to happen in these markets as you bring on new technologies. and i think that's largely being ignored. and we certainly are a company that has had to make the hard decisions, and i expect we will continue to do that. but i do believe that this country's generation landscape is going to change significantly. and there's absolutely no reason why vistra cannot be a part of that.
i also believe that you have to have a return on that investment in order to get people to do it. you can't just invest in renewables and say, ok, well, it's zero marginal cost. so now we're going to have free power forever. there has to be a mechanism, a pricing mechanism that incentivizes people to invest. and if we're going to spend trillions of dollars in this country to invest, there has to be a price clearing point that allows that to happen. you can't just invest and then go to zero marginal cost. zero marginal cost doesn't work in the long run to support an industry. and so if you believe in economic theory like i do, ultimately, pricing is going to settle at a point where people can get a return of and on investment. and that's why we're encouraged by it and we'll watch that. there are periods of time in all competitive markets where markets can get oversupplied. and then there's times when they get tight and they're undersupplied. i am certain that is going to happen. but there will also be a supply response when there is an oversupply, and that will bring markets back to equilibrium.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
thank you for the time.
jim burke -- executive vice president and chief operating officer

and your next question will come from steve fleishman from wolfe search. your line is open.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi. good morning. just first, is there a price or ebitda that you've disclosed for the new acquisition?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
we haven't, but we can, steve. so good morning to you by the way. it's $13 million, in that range. and then i think we said that it was about 3.7 times when you look at the multiple. that includes synergies. synergies come from back office and other functional units largely. we were already a supplier to these guys.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
$13 million is the price paid or the ebitda?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
no, oh, i'm sorry. that's the price paid. ebitda, i don't know that we've disclosed that.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
no, that's fine. i can figure that out. okay. and just to be clear on when you're making the decision-making on growth and your cost of capital, i mean, if the stock stays in this range around where it is, are you using that as your cost of capital? or are you using something higher than that when you think about --?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
you're talking about the yield on the stock? are you talking about --?
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
no, just the general cost of capital, the embedded -- yes, the free cash flow yield, whatever, in terms of making the decision to invest in the growth, or are you assuming something better? and so then what happens if we're here 9 months from now and you're making the growth decision investment and the stock is still at $18?
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
yes. look, that's why i get paid the big buck, that's the tough decision, right? i mean, i don't know where the stock is going to go. i do -- there's obviously the famous capm, which would tell you that our cost of capital is much lower than where the free cash flow yield is, right? but we don't invest in anything anywhere close to what a capm model would tell you where we should be. and i won't say though, that every investment -- although there are some that we have done, that every investment has a 20%-plus return either. and i do believe that we believe -- you know this, since you've covered us, we've been at 15% free cash flow yield. it just so happens that we're up in the 20s right now. but we typically would be in excess of that 15%. but it is something that we have to look at. this is why i believe that we are trying to take a balanced approach in actually one that errs on the side of returning more capital and buying back our shares, more so than reinvesting in the business and it's something that we're going to have to follow.
but then you know this because you've asked me this question, a sustainable 20% plus free cash flow yield has far-reaching implications well beyond whether we invest in solar projects or not. it has a lot to do with, can this company get a reasonable free cash flow yield for the kind of company that it is in the public market setting? and the management team and the board over the next couple of years is going to have to wrestle with that. but there is no easy way out either. it's not easy just to go private either. i know how money is made there, too. and that's no panacea. but at the end of the day, we are going to search as much as we possibly can to find a way to get the full and fair value of this company. and i think part of that is investing in the changing technology on the generation side but we absolutely have to do that in a prudent fashion. and your point is a fair one, and one that we have to wrestle with. and i think we try to balance that. but we've been investing in what we believe are compensatory type returns given where we are.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. thank you.

curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks. molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. we appreciate your time and interest in vistra during this busy third quarter earnings season. it was just 5 weeks ago when we last connected with you at our virtual investor event, where we laid out our capital allocation plans for the next 2 years and provided additional details regarding our planned portfolio transformation. as we announced on the call, we expect to transform our generation fleet, including growing our renewable and energy storage presence while retiring the majority of our existing coal plants, significantly decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions produced by our operations. we believe we are a natural owner of renewable and energy storage assets given our capabilities and competitive position. and have a high degree of confidence that we can generate healthy returns from these assets through the same skills and methodology by which we extract significant value from our existing fleet. we are not going to give away the value to others by entering into below-market power purchase agreements and we have the capabilities to manage the market risk. we also own a portfolio of highly efficient, low emitting natural gas assets that can provide reliable dispatchable power and complement the intermittent nature of renewable resources. the diversity of our portfolio enables our team to structure renewable products that can ensure reliability at an affordable price.
as we have recounted in the past, every reputable and objective study on the changing power generation landscape has natural gas playing a significant role for several years to come, especially as we electrify the economy. the most recent study by e3, a well-respected energy consulting firm is another good example. and let's not forget we already serve nearly 5 million retail customers, many of which are increasingly seeking to procure their electricity needs from renewable sources. i know we did not spend as much time on our retail business. during our virtual investor event in september, but it is one of the cornerstones of our business model. and we expect to prudently invest in it as evidenced by the announcement of a highly attractive tuck-in retail business we announced today that scott hudson, the president of our retail business will discuss. through growing retail and reducing our exposure to coal generation, we will continue to optimize our retail to wholesale match. it is important to keep in perspective that it's going to take trillions of dollars of investment over several years for the us electricity grid to meaningfully transition away from thermal resources. the current generating fleet in the us was invested in over many decades. vistra expects we will play an important role in that transition as well as provide critical reliability via our flexible gas assets.
as we have just recently spent considerable time on these topics, we plan to focus today on the very strong third quarter and year-to-date results of our integrated business. we will also provide a business update on our retail operations. before i turn to our third quarter results, i would be remiss not to acknowledge that the country is experiencing another wave of covid-19 cases as we enter the flu season albeit with a lower mortality rate. as we have said before, the health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. we have had only five cases we can trace to being contracted at work, successfully containing further spread. vistra is dedicated to staying vigilant and focused as we continue to operate safely to keep the lights on in this unprecedented environment. we will also continue to focus on helping our communities and customers through this difficult period by making corporate donations, procuring computers for children in need and offering payment plans and deferral programs for our customers, just a few examples of our commitment to helping others in need. we hope all of you are also staying safe and healthy.
i'm going to start on slide 6, where we set forth our strong third quarter and year-to-date results. in the third quarter, vistra delivered adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations of $1,185 million, which is 10% above third quarter 2019 results despite operating through a pandemic in 2020. these higher results might appear counter intuitive as it was in the third quarter of 2019 when the texas market saw meaningful scarcity pricing intervals. we did not see similar scarcity pricing this summer as the hottest days fell on the weekends and fleet performance across texas was exceptional exceeding what was already a strong performance in the summer of 2019.
as we often reiterate, scarcity events typically have an overall limited impact on current period results as we are usually largely hit heading into any given summer, rather where scarcity pricing events can be the most beneficial for vistra's financial results relates to the impact they have on forward pricing. we saw this phenomenon play out in the summer of 2019 as it was in august 2019 when the summer 2020 forward in texas rose meaningfully. the ercot forward stated elevated levels through the end of the year, giving vistra several months of opportunity to hedge our summer 2020 output at attractive prices that were on average higher than the average prices realized for 2019. we are also continuing to see the benefits of our operations performance improvement or op initiatives materialize. as a reminder, our program is on track to deliver an incremental $100 million of adjusted ebitda in 2020 as compared to 2019 with the benefits of our op program combined with the dynegy, crius and ambit synergies projected to reach an annual run rate of nearly $700 million by year-end.
our retail business had lower adjusted ebitda period-over-period, driven by the additional volume from crius and ambit acquisitions. you'll recall that our retail business can generate negative ebitda in the third quarter in periods of higher wholesale pricing due to the seasonality of power costs in texas, which is why this incremental volume drove ebitda lower in the period. while approaches vary across companies, we do not levelize our cost of power throughout the year, rather we flow through our actual cost while our retail pricing and revenues are relatively flat. however, it is important to note that our retail business results exceeded management expectations for the quarter, which are embedded in our guidance as a result of stronger margins and lower sales costs contributing to our 2020 guidance raise for the segment during our september investor event. in addition, our three legacy retail brands once again organically grew residential customer counts in texas during the quarter. vistra delivered year-to-date adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations of $2,964 million, results that are tracking ahead of management expectations for the period and solidly above 2019 results by nearly 15%, further evidence of the resiliency of the integrated model.
it was a strong performance through the first part of the year that led vistra to raise its 2020 ongoing operations adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance midpoint by $150 million and $165 million respectively in september. year-to-date, vistra is tracking soundly above this recently raised adjusted ebitda guidance midpoint and as we have mentioned before, it will be the fifth year in a row that we have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance, not exactly the kind of performance associated with a stock with a free cash flow yield in the 20s. today, we are reaffirming our recently raised 2020 guidance ranges as set forth on slide 6, though assuming we once again successfully execute in the fourth quarter, we are expecting another adjusted ebitda guided midpoint beat[phonetic]. importantly, our financial guidance implies an adjusted ebitda to adjusted free cash flow before growth conversion ratio of approximately 69% for the year, which supports our recently announced capital allocation plan and the anticipated significant return of capital to our financial stakeholders. we have been able to significantly exceed our original free cash flow before growth guidance midpoint and achieve this high conversion ratio even with the early receipt in 2019 of nearly $95 million of alternative minimum tax refunds that were projected in our 2020 guidance. and while accelerating some planned outages in 2020 and opportunistically taking advantage of business opportunities that required a higher use of current year cash flows.
turning now to slide 7. today, we are also reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges for both ongoing operations adjusted ebitda and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth, which we initiated during our virtual investor event in september. we have continued to execute since that time, increasing our confidence in our 2021 guidance ranges and further supporting our view that the upper end of the guidance ranges are achievable. importantly, vistra's fundamental analysis continues to suggest that the current 2021 forward prices in ercot are meaningfully discounting the probability of summer scarcity events. when evaluating all the supply and demand variables at play, we are bullish as ever regarding our opportunity to capture value in 2021. in fact, last monday, a random monday in late october, the ercot market found itself in a period of scarcity where prices surged to over $1,000 per megawatt hour around 7:00 pm and stayed well above $100 per megawatt hour for most of the day. these price outcomes were driven by several factors, including load coming in 1,500 to 3,000 mw higher than predicted in the day ahead market. lower available thermal generation due to the post-summer outage season for most units, significantly lower renewables contribution than expected including wind coming in approximately 13,000 mw lower than anticipated during the peak 7:00 pm, partly driven by icing issues on the turbine blades and the limited contribution from solar throughout the day given the cloud cover.
importantly, the observed strong demand levels extending into the evening hours was also a key contributor to the strong pricing we saw on monday. as we know and have observed in other markets, the presence of a strong evening hour demand does not line up well with the solar contribution profile. this mismatch between demand and the solar generation profile is an emerging trend in texas and it will likely be an increasing source of volatility as the supply stack evolves, volatility that vistra's commercial team and generating assets are positioned to capture as we have demonstrated time and time again. this is just another reminder of how quickly prices in texas can change when intermittent renewable resources are not available. while the value of the forward curves at any single point in time leading into the delivery year is important, what is most important to vistra is that we are able to strategically capture value as market opportunities arise just like we did last monday in texas.
our assets and business positions offer significant levers to capture value that can be represented and captured in the forward or they can be locked into through the bilateral transactions. we have been able to construct a realized wholesale price curve that has supported our consistent over performance for the last 5 years. we are continuing to make progress in this regard and executing for 2021.
looking ahead to 2022, our current expectations for the earnings power of our business are consistent with our average 2020 to 2021 view, in the range of $3.4 billion in adjusted ebitda and a conversion rate to free cash flow before growth of 65% or more. we believe we can manage our year-to-year earnings volatility within a very tight range and we continue to have confidence in the long-term earnings profile of our business. the market clearly does not share this view. as action on climate change accelerates and private institutions and state and federal policymakers advance policies supporting the development of incremental renewable resources, investors are clearly questioning what this evolving landscape might mean for vistra. in our view, it is this question that has directly been impacting vistra's valuation. there is no justification for vistra to trade at a 20% free cash flow yield based on the performance and financial position of the company.
free cash flow yields at these levels are generally reserved for companies in financial distress with poor performance track records and weak balance sheets. none of this applies to vistra. the only explanation that seems to make some sense is that the market must expect vistra will experience future economic distress based on the changing power generation landscape. in our view, vistra's near-term financial performance supports a free cash flow yield at least in the low double digits, especially when taking into account where the company's debt trades and the prospects for investment grade credit ratings in the next year. the debt-to-equity risk premium is confounding, rather if you believe in appropriate free cash flow yield for a business with a strong balance sheet and a proven track record on execution should be in the range of 10% to 12%. the recent prices where vistra's stock has been trading would suggest that the market is assigning virtually zero equity value to vistra's generation segment. in our view, this is a completely flawed assumption that is likely driven by the emotions of the current esg environment as opposed to a practical and informed fundamental analysis.
the bulk of vistra's adjusted ebitda from its generation segment is derived from its relatively young low-cost, highly flexible gas field generation fleet. with two of the lowest cost nuclear and coal plants in the country in comanche peak and oak grove, both in texas. we believe these assets will continue to be critical resources in the markets where we operate and will continue to generate substantial free cash flow, most of which will be returned to investors. there is absolutely no way that these assets have zero equity value and in fact they have significant positive value. in addition, the assumption of no value from our generation fleet extends to our investments in solar and batteries, yet stand-alone renewable companies are garnering lofty valuations in the markets today. an appropriate free cash flow yield applied to the true long-term free cash flow of vistra would produce a stock price substantially above our current trading price and at least in line with most sell-side analysts' price targets. as long as this valuation disconnect persists, we will continue to buy back our shares.
if you turn to the next slide, slide 8, we have set forth how we think vistra will be able to not only compete but to lead over the next couple of decades. since 2016, when vistra was first spun off from its parent as a publicly traded company, we have taken actions to build a business that prioritizes a strong balance sheet and low cost and market-leading integrated operations with high-quality assets. we also took a company that was 70% coal and transformed it by retiring 16,000 megawatts of coal, adding natural gas renewables and battery generation and growing our retail business by over 3 million customers, all while significantly reducing cost, improving generation performance and expanding our ebitda at highly attractive returns, which we highlighted at our investor event.
we derive approximately 95% of our ongoing operations' adjusted ebitda from our four core operating segments, retail, texas, east and west, where we believe we have meaningful and attractive transformational growth opportunities into the future. of that 95%, only 15% now comes from coal and we convert approximately 65% of our adjusted ebitda to adjusted free cash flow before growth, which has enabled the return of more than $6 billion of capital to our financial stakeholders over the last 4 years. with our expectation that we will return an average of $1.5 billion to our financial stakeholders annually, we estimate that we will return another approximately $7.5 billion by 2025 and a cumulative approximately $15 billion by 2030, with total annual returns of 15% or more projected.
as we approach our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net-debt-to-ebitda, we also believe we are on track to achieve investment-grade credit ratings next year. the steps we have taken over the last 4 years have created a strong foundation from which we can launch our future initiatives. true to our name, we have a vision for success and a tradition of excellence. and now we have introduced our vistra zero brand, which will build on this vision and tradition as our zero carbon growth engine for our generation transformation.
as we look ahead to 2030, we expect we will continue on this path, evolving into a market-leading integrated business that plays a key role in powering america through its renewable transition by making prudent incremental investments in renewables and energy storage, growing our retail business and offering innovative green products and value-added services to our customers and supporting the reliability of the electric grid at affordable prices with our flexible natural gas fleet. in fact, by 2030, we project that more than half of our adjusted ebitda will be derived from our carbon-free operations, with 90% of our adjusted ebitda coming from our retail business and low to zero-carbon generating assets. we believe we can grow our ebitda over the next decade, even while retiring the majority of our existing coal portfolio, by investing only a modest fraction of our free cash flow back into the business.
we expect the majority of our free cash flow will be returned to our financial stakeholders, primarily through dividends and share repurchases. and if we allocate only $1 billion per year to share repurchases at the recent prices where our stock has been trading, we can buy back the entire market cap of our company in less than 9 years. this is all while maintaining balance sheet strength and expected investment-grade credit ratings, a pretty impressive value and growth story if you ask me.
as difficult as it is to project 20 years into the future as the decarbonization of the economy continues, we expect our disciplined transformation to accelerate into 2040. by 2040, we estimate at least 70% to 80% of our adjusted ebitda will come from our carbon-free operations, including retail, nuclear, renewable and energy storage. we continue to believe that gas plants will remain a key component of the supply stack up until 2040 and beyond, initially as a base load and reliability resource and, over time, as a transition resource complementing renewables. the playing field is changing. esg, in particular, environmental stewardship, especially as it relates to climate change, is an increasingly important component for portfolio managers' investment decisions, and vistra is committed to prudently be out in front in the transformation leading a sustainable company reaching its fair and full value.
before i turn the call over to scott, i did want to highlight three new slides we included in the appendix to our investor presentation this quarter related to our broad focus on our stakeholders as part of our esg efforts. we believe a company that prioritizes employees, customers, communities, suppliers and investors is one that will attract the best talent and retain customers and investors. slides 15 through 17 in our appendix highlight some of our recent esg initiatives in these areas. we will update these slides on a quarterly basis, and we hope you find them informative and helpful.
i will now turn the call over to scott hudson to discuss our retail business in a bit more detail.
scott hudson -- executive vice president and president of retail
thank you, curt. turning to slide 10, we wanted to spend some time on today's earnings call highlighting the stability of our retail business, its resiliency through the covid-19 pandemic and our opportunities for continued growth. as many of you who have been following vistra for some time might recall, vistra's retail business has been a stable contributor of ebitda since the retail market in texas opened fully to competition in 2008.
prior to the dynegy transaction, which closed in april of 2018, vistra's retail business grew solely through organic activity. and over the period from 2008 to 2017, we generated an average of approximately $800 million of ebitda annually even in the face of a number of volatile power price cycles, including the extremely hot summer of 2011 and the polar vortex of 2014. the dynegy transaction that closed in 2018 expanded vistra's reach from a texas-only retailer to one with operations in five of the top 10 competitive markets in the us. then last year, we added both crius energy and ambit energy to our portfolio of businesses, expanding the vistra retail footprint to 19 states in the district of columbia, adding several new brands, high-margin residential natural gas to the portfolio and a powerful network marketing channel. vistra's customer counts grew to nearly 5 million, and our total delivered load grew to approximately 95 terawatt hours. in 2018 and 2019, our retail ebitda averaged approximately $825 million and we are currently on track to exceed our recently raised 2020 guidance midpoint of $955 million, with our 2021 adjusted ebitda projected at nearly $1 billion. this expected performance in 2020 is particularly impressive in light of the challenges brought on by the covid-19 pandemic during the year.
in may, we estimated that covid-19 could potentially be a negative driver of our 2020 adjusted ebitda of approximately $70 million due to anticipated higher bad debt expense and the anticipated impact of lower volumes on our financial results. we now expect the impact from covid-19 to reflect only $10 million to $15 million of higher bad debt expense in 2020, as lower business volumes during the year have been largely offset by higher residential volumes due to increased usage from the work-from-home population.
our strong performance in 2020 in the face of the pandemic is a direct result of the numerous initiatives we implemented to help our customers through these unprecedented times. for example, we utilized our data and analytics capabilities to proactively contact customers whose usage patterns had changed due to working from home requirements in order to make sure that they were on the right electricity plan. these efforts resulted in higher retention rates and enhanced customer satisfaction. we also offered payment flexibility to customers unsure of their financial future. our experience has shown that if you help a customer through hard times, he will be a customer for life.
importantly, txu energy, our flagship retail brand, continued to maintain its 5-star rating in the ercot market and was the top performing major retail electric brand in each month of the third quarter. in addition, txu energy has been a leader in innovation year-in and year-out, as evidenced by products like free nights, free nights and solar days, free pass and many others, all of which have been copied by our competition. in short, our strong 2020 is proving out. vistra retail continues to provide stability and robust financial results for the integrated model. as we look to the future, we expect to continue to grow our portfolio, both organically and through opportunistic acquisitions.
in addition to the organic growth on the residential customer side, vistra has demonstrated its ability to organically grow its business markets portfolio each year in ercot, and we have line of sight to consistent business markets growth in targeted regions outside of texas. we also plan to continue to strengthen our customer relationships through various value-added offerings. on that point, vistra has been active in the cross-selling of non-commodity products and services for over 8 years. we have invested in our platform, and we have seen significant growth, with customer interest growing threefold since 2013. we currently offer services like home warranties and insurance, smart thermostat, hvac services and a variety of solar, energy storage and green products. we offer most of these products through an asset-light partnership model, which allows vistra to nimbly test which services resonate with our consumers without making large capital investments. beyond the opportunity to earn incremental ebitda through these bolt-on product offerings, we have found that the expanded relationship results in a stickier portfolio, ultimately extending the life of our customers. as a result, we are continuing to expand the universe of value-added products we offer.
on the natural gas side, our portfolio is focused on the high-margin residential and small business segments, where approximately one in four of our crius and ambit customers carry a natural gas product into fuel markets. we are exploring -- expanding this offering into new markets in the future. we are similarly continuing to be opportunistic when evaluating potential m&a transactions. on that note, i'm excited to announce today that we have just executed an agreement to acquire the texas electric retail customers of infinite energy and veteran energy. the transaction will expand vistra's retail footprint in the attractive texas market, where we currently derive 95% of our retail profitability. the transaction, which was executed at an estimated acquisition multiple of approximately 3.7 times., is expected to close later this month. this acquisition is just another example of vistra's ability to take advantage of our scale and market position to grow our business through attractive tuck-in opportunities.
vistra retail has the lowest cost structure of any major retailer in the country, and our operations are incredibly cash efficient, dropping over 90% of our ebitda to free cash flow. retail continues to be the most attractive channel for vistra to sell its generation line. and after accounting for the recently announced retirements in our generation fleet, we expect we will be more than 80% matched generation to load. we have an exceptionally strong retail business that is focused on the customer and a leader in innovation, and we will continue to leverage these capabilities as we grow.
i will now turn the call over to david campbell.
david campbell -- executive vice president and chief financial officer
thank you, scott. as shown on slide 12, in the third quarter vistra once again outperformed management expectations embedded in our guidance. ongoing operations delivered adjusted ebitda of $1,185 million, which was $108 million higher than the same period in 2019, with our retail segment down $53 million, and our generation segments up a collective $161 million. as curt described, the positive year-over-year variance in generation was driven by higher margins in our texas segment. the negative variance in our retail segment was a product with higher volumes from our crius and ambit acquisitions during negative margin months.
you may recall from our discussions during third quarter performance last year, that our plan projected negative adjusted ebitda in our retail segment during the third quarter. this phenomenon is a result of the seasonality of power cost in texas where power prices are at their highest in august, driving up our third quarter cost of goods sold, whereas retail customer prices are generally at more consistent levels through the year. this negative third quarter margin is offset by higher gross margin in the first, second and fourth quarters.
year-to-date, vistra's ongoing operations adjusted ebitda is $2,964 million or $346 million higher than our comparable 2019 results. the favorability is driven by the acquisitions of crius and ambit, our operations performance improvement initiatives and higher energy margin, primarily in our texas segment. with three quarters of outperformance relative to management expectations for the year, vistra is tracking solidly above its recently raised adjusted ebitda guidance midpoint for 2020.
this quarter, we are also reporting our financial results in accordance with our new segments. of note, the new sunset segment includes plants that have announced future retirement dates, providing transparency into the contributions and potential liabilities from those facilities, and more importantly, separating their financial results from our longer-term assets and businesses. once the sunset assets retire, it will be moved into the asset closure segment.
when evaluating the best path forward for these plants, vistra explored a potential sale. however, the bid-ask spread on the closure cost was too great, as buyers were generally too conservative due to relative lack of experience and the transactional requirements were too complex. in the end, we determined that vistra is better equipped to handle the wind-down of these assets as we have significantly more experience in the process than most others. we can manage the retirement of the assets without taking a significant hit to value, while benefiting from the cash generated from the leased facilities prior to their retirement. once the assets are retired, vistra has had very good success in divesting some of these facilities and associated closure liabilities to third parties. in addition, retiring the assets as opposed to selling them has a greater impact on vistra's greenhouse gas emission reductions, as selling the assets would similarly reduce our baseline. it is better for the company and for the environment for vistra to take the action to retire the plants.
turning now to slide 13. vistra remains committed to reducing our leverage in 2020, as we approach our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net-debt-to-ebitda. as of september 30, we have paid down approximately $1,150 million of debt this year, including the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which totaled $550 million as of the end of the second quarter, as well as the redemption of all of the remaining senior unsecured notes issued by vistra corp.
last week, we also announced that our board of directors approved our fourth quarter dividend of $0.135 or $0.54 per share on an annual basis, which represents an 8% increase from the annual dividend we paid in 2019.
with respect to credit ratings, shortly following our september virtual investor event, we received an upgrade to bb+ by s&p ratings, which also maintained its positive outlook. this upgrade positions vistra to one notch below investment grade and of note, all three credit rating agencies, moody's, fitch and s&p have vistra on positive outlook. as a result, we expect that a potential upgrade to investment grade is achievable before the end of 2021.
in furtherance of our commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet, our capital allocation plan for 2021 and '22 calls for incremental debt reduction of approximately $550 million over the 2-year period, while the bulk of our free cash flow of more than $2 billion is expected to be returned to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. as it relates to the dividend, it is our intention to increase our dividend by approximately 8% in 2021, at the high end of our expected 6% to 8% annual growth rate. in 2022, we anticipate a step change increase in the annual dividend to $0.76 per share. both of these increases will be subject to board approval at the appropriate time.
our recently announced $1.5 billion share repurchase program begins on january 1 of next year and replaces any repurchase authority that remains outstanding under our existing programs as of the end of this year. the last component of our 2021 and 2022 capital allocation plan is to grow our business through investments that have attractive return profiles and support our continued retail growth or expansion into zero-carbon resources.
we expect we will allocate approximately $1.15 billion of capital to transformational growth investments over the next 2 years, which includes capital for our previously announced moss landing and oakland battery storage projects as well as our recently announced texas phase 1 renewable and storage development projects. these investments exceed our threshold of 500 basis points to 600 basis points above our cost of equity and are consistent with our strategic transformation plans.
vistra's track record of delivering on our financial commitments combined with impressive conversion of adjusted ebitda to adjusted free cash flow before growth supports our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet on both investing in our business and returning a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. our strong performance year-to-date in 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic, is further evidence of the resilience of our integrated business model. we remain optimistic that with the ongoing successful execution of our business plan, our stock price will ultimately reflect its fundamental value.
i would now like to turn the call back over to curt to make a few remarks on the election.
curt morgan -- president and chief executive officer
thanks, david, and scott thank you as well. so not much to say at this point. i think most of you have been following the election and things look pretty tight, too tight to call. of course, it's going to be interesting to see whether we'll have divided government or whether we will have a single-party control. that, of course, would end up being the democrats, because it looks like the house will go to the democrats.
the point that i'd like to make about the election is that, and we've said this before, that we feel like we can be successful under any administration. we're an apolitical entity. we have friends on both sides of the aisle. we've worked very well with both republicans and democrats. and we, of course, studied, like most of you have, where the policies might go and feel like we can benefit under either administration. so we look forward to working with whoever the administration is and with whatever the congressional makeup ends up being. and we feel like we can make progress under either administration, and however congress gets set up. so it's a little too early to tell on this, as you guys know this could drag out for a while as well given what we're seeing. but we believe that vistra is well-positioned under either control of administration by democrats or republicans.
and so with that, operator, we'd like to open it up for q&a.

thank you. [operator instructions] your first question this morning comes from stephen byrd from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, thanks so much for taking my questions. and i really do appreciate the very frank and kind of thorough review that you all provided. so thank you. i appreciate the time. just first maybe on the natural gas supply situation. in terms of just the supplier obligations to you, is there a potential to litigate to the extent that firm supply was not provided or is that not likely?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
no, there is a potential to that.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. in the sense that's sort of -- folks who had firm supply obligations too did not provide the gas and the situations in texas wouldn't necessarily excuse their delivery obligations?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, look, so it's going to come down to -- i don't want to actually litigated it. but there are provisions and contracts. every one of them is a little bit different. and it will come down to whether those provisions applied in this instance or not, and it would be a very simple analysis. what i'll say is, there is potential. we're still doing the analysis as to whether it will make sense or not, and we can update you guys on that. but obviously, it's something we need to take a look at because we thought we had gas at a particular price, and obviously we didn't, and that was a big hit for us. so we'll see where this takes us, but there could be some disputes.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, understood. and then the ercot pricing glitch on monday, that's obviously -- i share your frustration. that just seems like a tremendous, just mistake by the -- in terms of how the price was set. is that also possible to -- i know there is language about sort of adjusting that. but could that be adjusted? and obviously, that would have a very substantial impact to your loss positions. i was just curious how you think about that?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
so i think the interesting thing on that one, stephen is, first of all, yes, it can be disputed. secondly, it's going to be disputed on both ends. so the prospective increase to the cap and actually keeping it at the cap on thursday into friday is going to be something i think that is going not only will be -- may be challenged with the public utility commission, but it may be challenged at the legislature. we absolutely believe that when you're in eea3 and you don't have reserve, you have negative reserves that you can't be anywhere but cap. but there was a -- there is a particular mechanism in pricing scheme that actually kicked in that had the prices being set at lmps that were below the cap at times. and i think the commission rightly so determined that the price should be at the cap. ultimately, i think they have the authority to make that order. i think we will likely challenge that notion that you can't retroactively price. and so -- but i think there may be others like retailers who may challenge whether it should have been set at the cap.
so it's an unfortunate thing because billions of dollars changed hands in a week. people are going to go out of business over it. and i think people were going to try to see what they can do to change the playing field. so we won't really know until we get through all of that math, which i think will go on for some time. but we are probably going to contribute a little bit to the mess because there are some things that we think are legitimate to be -- to dispute, and we may do that.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. and, curt, just on that. this point about the position gas power plants were in strikes me as such a problem from a market design point of view in the sense that the gas plant owners were in this -- on monday, it's really tough position, do you buy gas at very high prices versus not knowing necessarily whether you're going to dispatch. secondly, into a price a power where you're going to lose a lot of money and yet at the same time you want to provide as many electrons as you can to the people of texas. is that -- am i getting that right or am i may have misunderstood it?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
no, you got it exactly right, stephen. and this was the one that we were faced with. with an unknown load and unknown financial obligation, but an absolute obligation to human needs. and this is the problem that i said this last night and yesterday to the house and the senate in texas that i don't believe texas could this type of an event and i don't think any state really can. i don't think they like the price cap. they don't like the gritty products. they don't like consumers having it past on. we don't like consumers having blips like this passed on because they will shop for another supplier or retailer. and so we all agree that the volatility in this market is probably not what it should be.
on the other end of the spectrum, i'm not sure that everybody is ready to go to some full capacity market. but i do believe there is something that can be done in between where the price cap comes down and you increase the amount of reserves, which increases the revenues into the market and it increases the steel in the ground. so it brings this thing a little more stable with less layouts and less risk to consumers. because what's a problem with the model now for us is as a retailer we don't want to increase price to consumers in the middle of this type of an event, yet our suppliers are increasing prices at will and we get squeezed in the middle. that is an untenable situation. that is not something that can last. and i believe i made some good points and people are beginning to realize that in this market.
so i am convinced that market design will help with that. but the other thing is we cannot let the gas system fail again, and it did. and i don't care what anybody says. all the way from the wellhead, i mean we are producing right now oil and gas in north dakota. don't tell me it can't be produced in that kind of weather. and so we can't have that happen again. i don't care if we produce more gas than we ever have in texas because of demand. the reality is the pressures on the lines were not sufficient enough to get gas generators what they needed in order to be at the top, and we are in a virtuous cycle. we need to provide electricity for compressors and for gas processing and for production sites. we need gas bill to produce electricity. so they all have to work together. and sometimes, that is what regulatory -- that's what regulation does and that is what policymakers do, and we need to make sure that happens.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
very good. i could ask 50 more questions, but i will hand it over to others. thank you very much.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
well, i think we are going to give a chance, i hope tuesday.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, sir. i think next week. yeah. thank you.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
all right. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from steve fleishman from wolfe research. please go ahead.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks. i will try to limit to the one question and follow-up.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
you can do more than one.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
okay. thanks, curt. just i think just a couple of days ago, you raised the dividend, and i think more -- frankly, more than you were initially planning to for this year. could you just talk about your thinking in doing that in the context of everything?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, that is an excellent question. so you know we moved it in september. and then we decided to just move it a couple of pennies and to $0.60. and it was $10 million, steve. and we had made the call, and we just didn't go back on it. $10 million is still $10 million. so we decided to go forward with it and thought it was still the right thing.
this is one of these things where if you do it, some people will say, what the heck are you doing raising your dividend regardless of how much it is in the middle of something like this? honestly, i think the way we are thinking about this is that this is a one-time event. it's unfortunate, but we are still on the trajectory when 2022 rolls around. we are still back to where we were on our capital allocation plan in 2023 and forward.
and so we made the call to continue with that. relatively small, but still obviously -- it is an obvious change in the middle of this type of situation. it certainly can be second guessed, but we thought it was the right thing to do to move forward with it. we still are very interested in our dividend. we think it's important to our investors. and so we decided to stick with it. because we made that decision, steve, by the way, before this hit. as a board, we decided to do this, and we did not revisit it. we said we are going to go ahead and move forward with it.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
okay. but i assume you did that with context knowing that you could get -- even though this was a big hit, it's manageable in the scheme of the whole company?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yes. so from a liquidity standpoint, we feel good. and not only do we feel good with what we have, we feel good with the partnerships we have with a number of different financial institutions that have frankly been very supportive. and they didn't know anything, by the way. they didn't know if we've made money or we didn't make money. but they also knew people were winners and losers. and they have come to us and said, look, we believe in your long-term. if you need it, any kind of liquidity, we would be happy to make our balance sheet available to you to help you through this if you needed it.
i'm convinced that this is not a liquidity crisis for this company. this is a short-run material hit. we took a body blow. but i also believe that we will come back around out of this and move forward with strength. and the fact that people are willing to help us out in this, and they understand, they believe in us, that's huge to us. but steve, i don't see this as a situation where we're in dire straits. i'd tell you, if we hadn't got our debt down and if we are still the old ipp model, we would be in a different place.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
yeah, good. and then just a follow-up is just thinking -- trying to ignore '21 and what happened and looking to '22 let's say and beyond. can you just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about both generation, which i think forwards have moved up some? but is there any different strategy there for you? and then on retail, how are you thinking about the implications of this for retail at '22 and onward?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so -- and i'm going to let jim talk a little bit about retail. but i will just say -- i'm sorry, what was the first part of that?
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
generation and hedging.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, sorry.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
ignoring '21, focusing for the future toward '22.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so i think this gets you in a little bit to the capital allocation discussion too. i mean, first of all, we still believe, probably more so than we ever have, in texas until there is a market design change that generation is pretty darn important. and now we know obviously supply chain around our generation with gas is even more important than we ever thought. but we still believe that the generation that we have is important. i still think that we are going to see coal retirements. and we believe, probably even more now than ever, because my guess is this is also going to impact development in the ercot market. but we think there is value in these -- in the projects that we are doing. so we continue to want to do those.
i will say, though, steve, that how we finance those and how we realize the value from them. i think we always have been open-minded and we will continue to be open-minded about -- i'm talking now about the renewable and battery that we are doing. and so there could be some things that we do. i think we would like to buy our shares back, and we are going to probably need to do that even more. so the real challenge in '21 is there is not going to be a lot of money to do that unless we were to do some project-level financing, something like that, which we will consider.
in '22 and beyond, by the way, retail actually held up through this. and steve -- i mean, jim can get into the details and tell you his thoughts on retail real quick. but we are looking not only to maintain our retail, but we may end up getting -- we are a provider of last resort in ercot. and we may get some of the customers, if in fact customers drop their customers to the provider of last resort, which is a mechanism in ercot. we may get a significant amount of new customers. and we are also open to continuing m&a around retail. so we have been saying we would like to get a little more retail in our business. i think we are continuing that. we like that business. we are good at it. and so i think that hasn't changed.
on the generation front. we were sort of reducing our generation exposure a little bit anyway and we are becoming more and more matched. i know this event obviously shakes people because we ended up being short. it was because of things that we did not -- could not have planned for. so i still think that we are going to head down a path where our generation is going to be reduced in terms of megawatts as we retire coal. and we will add some renewables and batteries and we will still have generation. but i think we will be a much more balanced company as we go forward. even with this event, we still think that is the right move. i hope that answered, steve.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
thank you.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
jim, do you want to say anything about retail real quick?
jim burke -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. yeah, sure, i would. thanks, curt. steve, i think over the evolution of the markets here in ercot, we've seen these events come every three to five years and it disciplines retailers to think differently about some of the collateral requirements and the hedging that's necessary to survive. this event had the chance to really create a runaway scenario for swing for the retail segment, for any retail business in ercot. and then the load-shed capped out that exposure for some, and it actually it did for our business as well. and so the retail business held up well.
however, there still are some retail businesses that experienced swing and they are reporting some results that are unfavorable. i think this business takes more capital than most people think. and it takes more discipline around hedging than most people think. and we found ourselves even in a business that we're very familiar with having assets ready to run, being in a position to run and having trouble with the fuel supply, which we did not see coming to the extent obviously that had occurred.
so i think there is going to be some retail consolidation. i think whether that's doing the [indecipherable] process or whether that's through a chance to take a look at some books. i think we are going to come out of this in a relative position in a very strong place. we look at 2022 and beyond as back to normal. and to your point about the curves, the curves being up in the next several years is a $200 million to $300 million difference than where we were just a few weeks ago. and so we'll see how that plays out. but this is a tough one, tough one to get through. but i think coming out on the other side, we are going to be relatively positioned in a good place.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
great. thank you.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
thanks, steve.

your next question comes from julien dumoulin-smith from bank of america. please go ahead.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, team. thank you for all the color and commentary. i wish you guys the best. can we talk about capital allocation? i know you mentioned an update coming, but there is some -- you just alluded to it, so i want to bring it up more directly here. it seems like there is some latitude in the budget, especially if you think about having a probably disproportionate preference to review buybacks here. how do you think about investments in renewables and the ability -- not to pursue them, but to monetize those selectively as you complete them? certainly, it seems like added source, but also can we address the credit rating and your thought process, perhaps initially with the rating agencies?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, great questions, julien. so on the renewables, i think you sort of stated accurately. and i tried to portray this, maybe i didn't do a very good job on it. but i think there is some opportunity to potentially raise capital in a different way, let's put it that way, that could add capital to buy back shares. and i think we'd like to buy our shares back. so i think we are going to be very open-minded. these projects have value to them. and now that can be somewhat contingent on also having contracted projects. and of course, we have a retail business that we can look at to contract with, but we also can do that externally with third-parties. so i think there is some work in 2021 we'll do to make sure that. but we are not in a position where we have done it ahead and that we absolutely have to do it, but i think it is worth doing. and we were considering it even before this event, but i think it's an even higher priority.
jim, do you have anything you want to add to that? but that's kind of how i see that. and then i can answer the next piece of it too.
jim burke -- president and chief financial officer
our view is very similar there, curt. and i think there may also be opportunities to look at current operating assets in the market are those under way as current owners or projects might have seen the performance gap and how they hedged some of those assets in this market as well. and so i think there could be other opportunities that weren't on the horizon just a few weeks ago.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
it sounds interesting.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
we have looked at that, julien. the problem is, again, if you want to sell it, return to the hedge, i suppose you could do that, but the values just aren't there. there is so much generation that is either explicitly or implicitly for sale in the market that -- and i don't feel like we have to do that. but if we found an opportunity to do that, that made some financial sense, we don't need to own all the megawatts that we have, and so we would consider that. but i'm not-we are not going to rush to that because we are not in a financial distress. and i think we are going to be a little more disciplined. i think i would rather look for ways to save money and to do things like that rather than to force a sale in the middle of a market that is not a particularly good market to sell assets in.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
understood. and on the rating agencies?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so rating agencies, i'll just say this. we've had some early discussions with them. and this is, like it is to you guys, it's an initial shock. they know that we are still disciplined and we will continue to pay down debt and that we have been that way. and so look, i think we have had constructive discussions. i have nothing to announce at this point in time about that, and they don't either. but i would say the discussions have been constructive. and i'm going to spend some time i could. i was in these hearings all day yesterday. i'm going to spend some time with a couple of the agencies myself because i couldn't make the meetings and talk to them. but i found the discussions to be very open and honest and constructive, and i'm hopeful that we will be ok there.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, excellent. thank you. best of luck.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from shahriar pourreza from guggenheim partners. please go ahead.
james kennedy -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst
good morning, guys. it's actually james for shahriar.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
hey, how is it going?
james kennedy -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst
curt, to build off your policy points about middle ground between high priced assets and a capacity market. i mean, we watched the hearings yesterday, it sounds like there is sort of momentum. kind of from where we stand today, could you give us any probability on policy change actually coming out of the spring session in the legislature?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so look, we were asked to bring back ideas in a week. this event has really shaken the state of texas from the very top. i was able to speak with some of the obviously the leadership in the state of texas. they don't want this to happen again. i think they are beginning to realize that the mix of assets in the market combined with the structure itself is not sustainable, pretty obvious to them. and they also know this was a big weather event. and we can't lose sight of that, that this was an extreme weather event. but at the same time, they have to ask themselves even so, do we really want to even have to take the risk of this type of event. and i think they are asking themselves, and they know the answer, none of them can stomach really the idea that a bunch of this high pricing power is going to get passed on to customers.
and so they realize that that's an untenable position to be in for us, and they are worried about having enough generation. and they realize if you don't have a market structure that works, people aren't going to invest. so that tells me that there is a very good probability that we could get something done here, and i would say north of 50%. and i wouldn't normally say that about any process like that, but i see momentum. and i know our company is going to have a seat at the table. and we are going to be working on this extensively in the next few days, because i do not want to lose the momentum. i think we do need a change. and we were already considering these things. and so we were prepared. and i think it's time to get everybody together and find a way to move this market. still using competitive market principles, but i think stabilizing it somewhat.
james kennedy -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst
got it. thanks. this will be it.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
our next question comes from amit sarkar from bmo. please go ahead.
amit sarkar -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, curt. thank you for taking my questions. i'm in houston. so i hope you will indulge me since i just got the power back. so i figure i have earned it too. hey, curt, you kind of talked a little bit about the oak grove coal supply issues with some of the rail transportation not kind of getting through. i'm just curious, but don't you typically have like a coal power that would represent a couple of weeks of burn? i guess you aren't shipping it coal every day to kind of burn that coal. can you kind of fill us in a little bit on kind of the issues there?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, i will, and then jim can jump in. but it was kind of the two things. it was coal -- getting coal to the coal silos, but it also was wet coal that we actually had. and so what we were -- and that was creating issues with the front end process to eventually burn coal. and so it was those two things. so we were trying to get fresh coal in and then we were having problems with the rail because the coal we had on the ground was frozen and it was also wet in gumming up and causing problems that we end up having to take the units down. but that's what i understand it. but jim has been working on this night and day. so why don't we let him also explain his knowledge of what happened?
jim burke -- president and chief financial officer
sure. thanks, amit, for the question. that is one of the benefits of having a mine operation right there is that we can self-supply. we have several days worked at the plant. and then of course, we have -- at the mine, we have much more under coal barn, a covered area. so the thought was when the coal pile, which is right by the plant, is exposed, it froze over, becomes basically chunks of ice that you can't put through the equipment without tearing it up.
so the goal was to try to get the drier coal over from the mine to the plant. and that transportation system is really tough, not just the tracks, but the railcars, the doors that you used to dump the coal, they are freezing. so they were freezing shut and then we couldn't actually -- once we got them open, we couldn't get them back closed. and so we had a supply chain even within our own system where it was effectively difficult to work in the freezing conditions that got worse through the middle of the week before we were able to find ways to work through that. so that wasn't about a rail coming in from elsewhere. it was really between the mine and the plant and trying to get the best fuel we could.
at martin lake, we obviously do have also a supply on hand. it was a derated plant because of the freezing temperatures and also dealing with the pile, effectively turning into ice. and so we ended up our conveyor systems where we are transporting this coal up through to the plants. they are exposed as well. in many parts of the country, those are completely enclosed.
so these systems, as curt mentioned earlier, they were designed for the heat and the warm weather not the freezing temperatures we were in. so we took derates on that plan as well. we ended up at a 70% capacity factor for coal during the week. so the capacity factor is certainly lower than we expected and wanted to have. but that 30% that we were not able to keep going, and that includes the derates and being offline, that just became a very expensive prospect for us. because as curt said, we were replacing $5 to $20 a megawatt hour fuel with $2,000 fuel in the form of gas that we were burning in some of our old gas steam units. and so a little bit of miss on the volume there multiplied by the delta on fuel cost was substantial. so we are going to have to look at the coal handling and look at what resiliency we need to build in for this type of a cold weather stretch at our coal plants.
amit sarkar -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you for that. and i guess that kind of leads into my follow-up question. just going back to kind of the press release you guys put out on wednesday, i guess kind of in the midst of all of this. and i have heard i think you testified to this yesterday in front of legislature as well. if i kind of look at the percentage of load of cut you kind of reserving and i kind of used monday as an example since that was kind of the height of this. is it fair to say if we set aside mgp, assume that ran -- that your fossil fleet kind of ran at a kind of a blended kind of capacity factor of like 70%, 75%?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yes.
amit sarkar -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
and so like with prices kind of on tuesday and wednesday kind of clearing at the cap, and it looked like you guys had some length or heat rate length open going into this. i guess, i'm still trying to wrap my head around on kind of on why the losses where they were to such an extent. are you guys kind of saying that because you did such a good job in a light stayed on in north zone versus say houston zone that you just -- and the demand was so high there relatively, that you guys kind of found yourself short, whereas other kind of generation units that were pointed at houston zone basically had the benefit of the load just basically being cut, so they basically weren't short anymore?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so i mean -- go ahead.
jim burke -- president and chief financial officer
i mean, yes. in essence, this was a very interesting pattern because heading into the weather event when you see what the temperatures were going to be, this looked like coal generators, specialty generators with length would have an opportunity to make potentially a good return on their efforts. and retailers, no matter how much they were headed, whether it was through a p95 or p99 scenario, they were going to swing and likely pay much higher prices to cover their obligation to their customers. so it was originally going to look like a good generator segment opportunity and probably a tough one for retailers.
once the load-shed happened and the load shed happened, not just curtailing load for retail but it actually curtailed and contributed to the gas supply issues, the retailers kind of got stopped out on their exposure to the swing. and in some cases depending on how much load was shed, could have become lost on their supply position. and the generators and the ones that were online including ourselves, we could not get the fuel to meet the obligation of what we had sold forward to both third parties as well as our own supply book. so it shifted this load curtailment shifted the entire risk from what should have been on a retail segment back to a generation segment, because of its linkage to the fuel supply challenge on particularly natural gas.
and that is we were long. we had an ability to capture this, but you are long if you get the fuel. if you don't get the fuel, you are short. and that is why when we put the press release out, we put a lot of emphasis on the fact that we were having fueling challenges. and we also wanted to do address that our units were winterized, they were there running. and we have an opportunity here if we can solve the field challenges. and despite all that, we were still a disproportionate amount of the generation on the grid. so it played out very differently than we would have thought a week or two ago, but those are the major drivers.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
and jim, i will just add that what happened is too is monday, as i said, pricing was not at the cap. for this very strange reason, we were long monday. then we started having gas delivery issues, pricing issues as well as pressure issues. and then we lost oak grove for about day and a half, which is our low-cost fuel. and so it is like one of these sayings where if it could go bad, it did. and all those things contributed, but a big chunk of it really was around gas. the cost of gas as well as the amount of gas we were getting delivered.
and then there was another-that is a big bucket. that is like, i think jim has said, about two-thirds. and about third of it was around our coal of that total. and i know-because-i mean you can only imagine what i was doing to meet-i was like pulling my hair out. like i thought we were long. i thought we were in a good position. we are one of the biggest generators in terms of percentage on the grid. you think $9,000 cap, you are thinking everything is going well. but when you start tracing through it, it begins to make sense and unravel as to how our position changed and how we were-had the inability to really do much about it. but we did the right thing, but it was financially not good. and that is a tough thing when you do things and you know that you were doing the right thing and the outcome doesn't swing your way, it is very difficult.
amit sarkar -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i appreciate all the time, curt. i know you had a hell of a day yesterday. thank you.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. take care.
operator
this concludes the q&a portion of our call, and i would like to turn it back to curt morgan for final comments.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
well, i appreciate people that are still hanging in there, but thank you very much for your interest in our company. tough week last week, but this company is strong, resilient. it is a good company. and we are going to come out of this stronger than ever. i hope you all have a great weekend, and look forward to talking to you soon.

thank you, molly. good morning, everybody. we appreciate your interest in this call today. and this morning i would like to start out with the elephant in the room. we had a rough week last week to say at least. and for our investors who are listening to this call, i want to say on behalf of everybody at vistra that we are disappointed in our inability to deal with this unprecedented event in a way that was favorable for the company. but i can assure you that we did everything we could to try to come out on top. and i'd like to take you through a little bit, and jim burke will too, the events that ensued and what we tried to do to deal with those events, what happened and also just to tell you on the front end that it has taken us until middle of this week to really sort out what really ultimately ended up happening.
and so therefore, we felt it was imperative that we have this discussion, even though we have not sorted out everything that we have this discussion today and started the process of a conversation about what actually happened and then we will get to the final numbers. i can assure you that there isn't anybody more disappointed than us. and it's disappointing to me that we let you down because we pride ourselves in execution, and i think we've done a darn good job of it over the five years i've been here. and within literally an hour or two, our world kind of turned upside down.
first of all, it was for texas, maybe for those of us who lived in the northeast or the north know that may not have looked as a big a deal. but in texas, it was an unprecedented event. the infrastructure, and i don't mean just the electric infrastructure, but i'm talking about housing and other things are built really for the heat. you don't see this kind of event. and i think history tells us that this was one of these so-called one in a 100 years. now it did happen. and the reality is, even if it's one in a 100, it can happen. so it's no excuse, but it tells you the depth of what happened. it's, as i understand it, the coldest three day stretch that they can -- that they have on record in texas, the 14th through the 16th.
so what does that mean? well, that meant that we had unprecedented demand. so to take you back, and i think it's important to lay this out, i think it was the 9th of february, steve muscato who's on this call, came to me and said, our meteorologists that we have on staff came to him and said, we've got an unprecedented event coming. we ran the numbers and we were seeing load in 72,000 to 74,000 megawatts. now let's put that in perspective, the worst case scenario or the -- one of the -- i guess you called out that ercot had performed was about 67,000 megawatts or so, maybe 67,000 to 68,000. and steve was concerned not just because of the load, but we also were looking at wind forecast and we are concerned about solar. and the fact of the matter was that we didn't have enough steel on the ground to cover that load. so they have been testifying to this in texas, i'm still here in austin last couple of days and i'll be talking more again today. but we did go to ercot because they had -- i think it was about 65,000 megawatt for monday -- and this is by the way for monday, tuesday, 15th and 16th, just to give you a timeline.
so we are out in front of it. i've justified to this. i believe and now that i've been listening to the other testimony that i believe ercot thought that they had it under control. and i'll tell you in a minute what happened. and i think they weren't even prepared for what did end up happening. so the bottom line is, the company positioned itself relative to that to be long or flat. and in some instances, we were short going into that, but then we went out and bought power at very high prices because we believe that power was going to go through the cap. that it was not if, it was when.
and so we were prepared. we also spent, and we've been open about this, about $10 million in preparation. we brought on about 200 additional contractors on site. we essentially did our whole winter readiness in texas all over again, which we normally do in the fall. and we felt very well prepared going into that. and then monday came and i was on the phone with steve and it was 1 am and steve, like he always does, we talk about, ok, here it comes. we think load-shed is going to begin. and of course, it was supposed to be rolling blackouts. and then it started. i mean, we all thought because we were 30 minutes on, 15 off, and that went on for a relatively short period of time. and then steve told me that we almost lost the entire grid. frequencies were erratic. it tripped a couple of our units. and then shortly after that, everything locked down.
and from what we find out on testimony now, the transmission distribution entities, not ercot, essentially locked down each of their systems at wherever they were because they were afraid they were going to lose the system. now we had a book and then all of a sudden that book of business changed. loans were down about 40,000. and the reason they locked it down is because we were losing generation on the grid left and right. and the reason we were losing generation on the grid was predominantly because gas pressures, but also there were outages. unfortunately, for nrg, and this is public, south texas project tripped. and i think this was a confluence of events for ercot and for the teus that all of a sudden, they were managing a very different risk profile with about 30,000 megawatts less of generation and they could not run a system on rolling blackouts with that level of generation. and so they just had to preserve the system.
now that was the first event that changed our book. how did it change it? it locked whatever load you had in your area based on what was on at that time. so if you were rolling blackouts and you were on, north texas was on, which we were, that froze that at a particular level. and then we started getting our gas cut because of pressures. so all the sudden, our book went from a flat to loan book into a book that was long, short, mixed. and we were scrambling at that point. and then right on that, we had gas contracts, people declared force majeure. so we had gas and then we didn't have gas. all that happened within a very short period of time. and we were managing a different reality at that point in time.
and so frankly, we had millions of people without power in the state of texas. we were scrambling to get gas. gas prices shot through the roof. and we said, this is survival mode. we turned our attention to preserving the texas market and the grid and putting every megawatt we could. we said ourselves, we have to put everything on it and we will count this up at the end. but the one thing we know we need to do is serve customers, stabilize the grid and then we will sort it out later. and that's what we did. and i look back on that every day and over the night when i can't sleep, and i say to myself, what could we have done different, curt? what -- how could we have played this differently? and i think those decisions, as i play them over and over again, were right.
now we had some things. and by the way, i know it doesn't matter, in light, what doesn't matter. if you lose the super bowl, no one goes and says, that is just because you know you had a mistake or the ref had a call, you lost. and so i get that. i'm just trying to explain to you what we were trying to do to manage this situation that was unprecedented to us and we were trying to do the best that we could. and it took us, frankly, until the middle of this week. in fact, all the way up to last night we were having the board meeting to really get a sense of what that range would be. and so we still don't know exactly what all these numbers are because we're still getting in because ercot shutdown for a while, wasn't provided invoices. we didn't know what the load looked like and we're beginning to get that picture.
so if you think about what happened, there was a confluence of events. but the biggest which that we have not seen is all the way from the wellhead, we were having freeze ups. so there wasn't enough gas to inject into the pipelines. we had gas processing facilities that were having winter issues. and one of the biggest things that happened is that the tdus didn't have an updated list of critical infrastructure. and so all of a sudden, they couldn't help it. they just shut down what they didn't think was critical. and all of a sudden, we had gas compressors that are running on electricity, that packed the pipes, they were shut off. they weren't listed as critical infrastructure. we have gas processing facilities that were shut off because they weren't listed as critical infrastructure. and we had wells, producing wells that were shut off for the same reason.
so then we have to triage. we had to go upstream looking for people saying -- and finding out what was wrong, why we weren't getting gas and we were helping people with the tdus turn back on critical infrastructure. and that took -- in order to get that to happen, it took a couple of days then for those to get on and then you have to -- in order to repressurize the pipe, it takes a good day to do that. so it took us the balance of the week to get gas restored. so we had significant amount of curtailments and we were buying gas at a very high price.
now one on us is we had some problems with our coal fleet. we had some -- just some coal issues at martin lake, which would be rates. we didn't come offline. we just didn't produce at the maximum. and then we had, you guys may know this, but oak grove, we shipped coal, we mined lignite and we shipped it. we have three -- the rails froze up and then we had plugging and that took us down for about a day and a half. now why is that matter? well, it matters a lot because of oak grove has about $5 a megawatt hour cost structure as opposed to having to essentially replace it with gas at hundreds of dollars in mmbtu. so the margin that we were getting for that day and a half was less. now we got it back. that was a good thing, but we lost for that day and a half. that was lot of money that we lost, and jim is going to go through these numbers.
the other thing that hurt us is that there was a pricing glitch on monday. so we're in what we call an eea3, which is the highest alert at ercot. that means, you have really no reserves. in fact, we had 30,000 megawatts in negative reserves. where was the price? price was trading at lmps, in some instances, $1,000 below our cost. and so we were calling ercot, what is going on? well, we determined there was a pricing, let's call it anomaly. we went to the puc the next day. and they came out with an order and said we're going to reprice that at the cap and then we're going to have it stay at the cap until we come out of eea3. frankly, the right decision, and that was a big deal for us. inexplicably, 18 hours later, they reversed the decision and they decided to do it prospectively, but not retroactively. and they claim that during wee hours of the morning on monday that people relied on that price, ridiculous.
and so monday was a big day for us because we were long that day because the gas infrastructure was just beginning to come off. and so we lost that value. now that's something that we are still taking a hard look at, but that was tough. again, curt, what's the matter? still happened to you? yes, it did. but we didn't expect it. nobody expected when we're in a eea3 that the price will be anything, but at the cap. how could it be when you have negative reserves. it absolutely is preposterous, and yet that's what happened.
so all of those things happened. the book -- we didn't know what the book was. we went through that. we performed actually relatively well. we put on 25% to 30% of all megawatts on the grid relative to our 18% market share. a good -- again, no good deed goes unpunished. the problem was we had a mismatch when they locked the system down between megawatts and load. and the other thing is, we were producing from higher cost assets than we expected. so our cost of goods sold mix was not helpful.
so i've taken you really through the two first slides. i will say a little bit about the market because i think the other very fair question is ok, well, what does this mean for the texas market? and frankly, i thought it was the best market in the country. and this event has made me think. not just me, but a lot of people think about it. but i still believe the basic tenants of a very good market are here. but i think the one thing that we're going to have to work on with the policymakers, the regulators, and i think we have good momentum on this, is that the grid in texas today when we put in the all energy market and the price gaps is a grid that is different than the one that exist or existed when we went competitive.
so when we are competitive, it was very different. how? well, we have a lot less dispatchable resources. in fact, we have less dispatchable resources than our peak loads. so we rely much more heavily on renewables. renewables are good, nothing wrong with that. but it changes the risk profile. renewables during this event were at capacity factors from 5% to sort of 15%. it didn't really contribute a lot during this event. that's why we didn't -- and that's why i said, when we were at 74,000 peak load, we didn't have enough at megawatts in the system. it was -- again, it wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when and we were telling people that.
so on the market design, reserves has to be, in my mind, the number one emphasis. and so there is a number of ways to get more reserves on the system. but i also think that we have to take a hard look at the balance between market and the competitive markets and reliability. and i think that puts a lot of things on the table. that puts could be potentially greater reserves that ercot has to acquire in order to maintain the system. it could be a capacity market. i know that that may be blasphemy need to some in texas, but i think it has to be on the table. but what i think comes out of this is still a very good competitive market that still has opportunities for people to do well. but move on the spectrum of competitiveness to reliability, move that a little more toward the middle. and -- but we're going to sort through that and more will come out of that, but i'm confident that texas will rise to the occasion. this economy mandates it. and the policymakers and the governor and others know that this economic engine is powered by electricity. and with electrification coming, we've got to get it right. and we're a big player. we have a big seat at the table. we have a lot of good ideas. and i think the market actually advances to a good point.
now the weather event, i mean, we're believers in climate change. we don't know if this type of event becomes more frequent. but i think if you just let history tell you something that this is not a frequent event, but it could happen. and so we have to adapt. we have to -- and it's not huge numbers, but we're going to have to batten down the hatches, so to speak, and to harden our assets. and the one thing i'm going to be on a crusade about is making sure that the gas and electric systems work seamlessly, that the tdus upgrade their critical infrastructure and that the gas system puts the money in just like we do to harden their system. it cannot be acceptable to not deliver gas at the maximum pressures in the middle of a natural disaster. now you can't say, well, my hands are clean on this, i don't regulate that, let's change the regulations then. so we have work to do, but i still have confidence very much so in the market.
now this has been difficult. we hope that -- we hope to maintain your trust in us, but at the very least, we hope to earn it back. i'm disappointed and it hurts, but it is what it is. and it's easy to lead when things are going well. and i think it's time to lead going forward. and i believe that the franchise is in place, the financial strength that we worked so hard to build, thank goodness has helped us through this. and our better days are still ahead of us. and the integrated model still works. and we just have to do some things, some tweaks. we have to work on the market design. but i still have faith in this business and in these markets because there are too important. electricity is the lifeblood of the economy. we have to get this right. there is no choice when you say, well, how do i trust that? sectors can never go through this again, and they know that. so that's what i trust. and we are a big player here. and so what comes out the back end of this, i believe, is going to be good for texas, good for the market and good for vistra.
so with that, i'm going to move into, and i just hate this, but i'll move into 2020. not that i hate 2020, but -- or maybe i do, but moving into 2020 because we have such a great year and this event has overshadowed it and the men and women have worked so hard at vistra in 2020 in the face of covid, in the face of social issues and everything that's been thrown at us, performed as good as anybody could have expected. it enabled us to pay down a significant amount of debt. our retail business was exceptional getting close to almost $1 billion of ebitda. we continue on the cost savings front. and by the way, i'm not going to throw a number out there today and say that we're going to save bunch of hundreds of millions of dollars.
we have a lean business. and i'm not going to starve this business. you cannot starve power plants for maintenance costs. it will bite you in 2022 and 2023. but we will, as we always do and we will double down. we will look for opportunities to optimize earnings going forward once we determine what the full effect of this is. and i'm convinced, like we do every year, we will find opportunities and we will let you know what those are. but i'm not going to throw a big number out there that i don't think is good for the company in the long run. and we are playing this for the long run. 2021 and this event are one-time event. and we're going to move this company forward in a way where it can compete and be even better into the future.
in 2020, i'm now on delivering financial results slide. this is a phenomenal year. $3.77 billion of ebitda and almost $2.6 billion in free cash flow before growth, almost a 70% conversion ratio. i remember when i was talking to you guys and the dynegy acquisition and we put out the, i think it's s-4 and we had a set of projection numbers. and just looking at what we were able to do in 2020 relative to what we had in that is, in my opinion, truly remarkable. and i think we did that with very disciplined investment into the business. and i'm proud of what we were able to do and what the numbers we were able to put up.
i think since we -- since i took over, we've got i think almost $600 million above midpoint of guidance over those years. what just kills me is we gave it all back and more. but we've been through that story already this morning, i won't take you through it again, but that's tough. you don't want to get back what you've created, and that's a difficult thing for us. the op initiative continues and it will continue. we think that now that is just a part of who we are. and we like to give this to you just because we want you to know when we tell you we're doing something that we do it, but it's really embedded in our ebitda. and then we are on track on our synergies for the -- and namely, the crius and ambit because dynegy is pretty much done now. even on the system side, the technology side, that's pretty much done at this point in time.
and the last thing i'll say then i'll hand it over to jim. through all this, we still have, and i'm on the last slide here, prioritizing all stakeholders. just briefly to touch base, this has been who we are since i've been here. we've been about all stakeholders. we continue to do it. we've made huge advancements on the environmental side with our employees and contractors and customers and suppliers and our communities, we're proud of that. and we expect to continue to do that. and i know we did announce that we were -- had $5 million to help customers. and some people may say, well, there is a cost savings right there, curt. why did you do that? and it's because of what i said earlier, two things. one is, we're about helping people as a company, not just about making money. we do care about that, but we have a bunch people down here that are in need. this became a survival game. this became a humans' needs effort, and we took that seriously. just like we take seriously being the guardians of your investments, we do care also about people. and it's very important to the franchise of our retail businesses that we are out there and we are helping others. and we have not lost those franchises. this weather couldn't take those franchises away from us. and they have extreme value and we have to keep investing in those franchises. but helping people is also a very important thing. and so we made that hard call in the face of adversity and uncertainty because that's who we are. that's what we're about.
so with that, i'm going to give it to jim. jim is going to quickly go through financial results. and then i know you guys have q&a and we'll try to answer everything we can as completely as possible. and so, i will turn it over to jim. thank you.
jim burke -- president and chief financial officer
thanks, curt. i'm going to quickly cover slide 16. as curt said, i know we want to get to q&a. i would just hit two slides.
our full year 2020 retail results were $176 billion higher than our full year 2019 results, driven by the acquisitions of crius and ambit, plus stronger comp margin performance, partially offset by milder weather. the $197 million favorability in our collective generation segments was driven by higher margins in our texas east and sunset segments, including the higher period-over-period benefits from our opi initiatives, partially offset by lower capacity revenues.
as it relates to the impacts of covid-19, vistra was able to navigate through the challenges brought on by the pandemic with minimal impacts to our financial performance. on the retail side, we only saw a small uptick in bad debt during the year, while our lower business volumes were offset by higher residential volumes. and as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call in may of 2020, our commercial team executed some opportunistic transactions in anticipation of the market volatility caused by covid-19, resulting in a positive benefit to vistra for the year.
in addition to these strong financial results, our retail business grew its residential customer count in texas year-over-year, reflecting strong performance by our legacy brands, while our generation business once again executed with commercial availability of over 95%. on the liquidity side, as of year end 2020, vistra had total available liquidity of approximately $2.4 billion, which was primarily comprised of cash and availability under its revolving credit facility. this strong liquidity position enabled vistra to effectively manage the collateral requirements related to the winter storm, yuri. as of february 25, vistra had more than $1.5 billion of cash and availability under its revolving credit facility to meet any liquidity needs.
we can close with slide 17. vistra repaid more than $1.5 billion of debt in 2020 to end the year at our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to adjusted ebitda. as of february 23, we've repurchased approximately 5.9 million shares at an average price of $21.15. $1.375 billion remains available under this authorization. we're continuing to execute on our strategic renewable and energy storage investments, including our texas phase 1 in california battery projects.
as we have communicated to you, we will be disciplined as it relates to deploying capital, regularly evaluating all growth projects for financial viability. we will only invest in growth projects if we are confident in the expected returns. as a result of this continuous review, we're currently pausing one growth projects in west texas due to updated economics, driven by higher than anticipated congestion cost.
i know many of you are wondering how our existing capital allocation plan will change as a result of the impacts of this winter storm. we expect to provide an updated capital allocation plan for 2021 on our first quarter earnings call. we remain committed to our dividend trajectory and to maintaining a strong balance sheet.
the challenges brought on by the global pandemic in 2020 and this historic winter storm in texas last week have tested our business model. we truly believe it was a one-time historic event. the winter event was a significant financial hit. our people worked in very tough conditions to generate as much power for the greatest possible. importantly, our business still has the strong assets that are hedged just two weeks ago. both our customer base and our generation footprint remained intact and we believe were solid growth prospects. we are a resilient team. we will stay focused on creating value for our stakeholders over the long-term.
with that operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.

-0.9402,,":
operator
thank you. [operator instructions] your first question this morning comes from stephen byrd from morgan stanley. please go ahead.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hey, thanks so much for taking my questions. and i really do appreciate the very frank and kind of thorough review that you all provided. so thank you. i appreciate the time. just first maybe on the natural gas supply situation. in terms of just the supplier obligations to you, is there a potential to litigate to the extent that firm supply was not provided or is that not likely?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
no, there is a potential to that.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
okay. in the sense that's sort of -- folks who had firm supply obligations too did not provide the gas and the situations in texas wouldn't necessarily excuse their delivery obligations?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. i mean, look, so it's going to come down to -- i don't want to actually litigated it. but there are provisions and contracts. every one of them is a little bit different. and it will come down to whether those provisions applied in this instance or not, and it would be a very simple analysis. what i'll say is, there is potential. we're still doing the analysis as to whether it will make sense or not, and we can update you guys on that. but obviously, it's something we need to take a look at because we thought we had gas at a particular price, and obviously we didn't, and that was a big hit for us. so we'll see where this takes us, but there could be some disputes.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah, understood. and then the ercot pricing glitch on monday, that's obviously -- i share your frustration. that just seems like a tremendous, just mistake by the -- in terms of how the price was set. is that also possible to -- i know there is language about sort of adjusting that. but could that be adjusted? and obviously, that would have a very substantial impact to your loss positions. i was just curious how you think about that?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
so i think the interesting thing on that one, stephen is, first of all, yes, it can be disputed. secondly, it's going to be disputed on both ends. so the prospective increase to the cap and actually keeping it at the cap on thursday into friday is going to be something i think that is going not only will be -- may be challenged with the public utility commission, but it may be challenged at the legislature. we absolutely believe that when you're in eea3 and you don't have reserve, you have negative reserves that you can't be anywhere but cap. but there was a -- there is a particular mechanism in pricing scheme that actually kicked in that had the prices being set at lmps that were below the cap at times. and i think the commission rightly so determined that the price should be at the cap. ultimately, i think they have the authority to make that order. i think we will likely challenge that notion that you can't retroactively price. and so -- but i think there may be others like retailers who may challenge whether it should have been set at the cap.
so it's an unfortunate thing because billions of dollars changed hands in a week. people are going to go out of business over it. and i think people were going to try to see what they can do to change the playing field. so we won't really know until we get through all of that math, which i think will go on for some time. but we are probably going to contribute a little bit to the mess because there are some things that we think are legitimate to be -- to dispute, and we may do that.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yeah. and, curt, just on that. this point about the position gas power plants were in strikes me as such a problem from a market design point of view in the sense that the gas plant owners were in this -- on monday, it's really tough position, do you buy gas at very high prices versus not knowing necessarily whether you're going to dispatch. secondly, into a price a power where you're going to lose a lot of money and yet at the same time you want to provide as many electrons as you can to the people of texas. is that -- am i getting that right or am i may have misunderstood it?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
no, you got it exactly right, stephen. and this was the one that we were faced with. with an unknown load and unknown financial obligation, but an absolute obligation to human needs. and this is the problem that i said this last night and yesterday to the house and the senate in texas that i don't believe texas could this type of an event and i don't think any state really can. i don't think they like the price cap. they don't like the gritty products. they don't like consumers having it past on. we don't like consumers having blips like this passed on because they will shop for another supplier or retailer. and so we all agree that the volatility in this market is probably not what it should be.
on the other end of the spectrum, i'm not sure that everybody is ready to go to some full capacity market. but i do believe there is something that can be done in between where the price cap comes down and you increase the amount of reserves, which increases the revenues into the market and it increases the steel in the ground. so it brings this thing a little more stable with less layouts and less risk to consumers. because what's a problem with the model now for us is as a retailer we don't want to increase price to consumers in the middle of this type of an event, yet our suppliers are increasing prices at will and we get squeezed in the middle. that is an untenable situation. that is not something that can last. and i believe i made some good points and people are beginning to realize that in this market.
so i am convinced that market design will help with that. but the other thing is we cannot let the gas system fail again, and it did. and i don't care what anybody says. all the way from the wellhead, i mean we are producing right now oil and gas in north dakota. don't tell me it can't be produced in that kind of weather. and so we can't have that happen again. i don't care if we produce more gas than we ever have in texas because of demand. the reality is the pressures on the lines were not sufficient enough to get gas generators what they needed in order to be at the top, and we are in a virtuous cycle. we need to provide electricity for compressors and for gas processing and for production sites. we need gas bill to produce electricity. so they all have to work together. and sometimes, that is what regulatory -- that's what regulation does and that is what policymakers do, and we need to make sure that happens.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
very good. i could ask 50 more questions, but i will hand it over to others. thank you very much.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
well, i think we are going to give a chance, i hope tuesday.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
yes, sir. i think next week. yeah. thank you.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
all right. thank you.
operator
[operator instructions] our next question comes from steve fleishman from wolfe research. please go ahead.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
hi. good morning. thanks. i will try to limit to the one question and follow-up.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
you can do more than one.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
okay. thanks, curt. just i think just a couple of days ago, you raised the dividend, and i think more -- frankly, more than you were initially planning to for this year. could you just talk about your thinking in doing that in the context of everything?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, that is an excellent question. so you know we moved it in september. and then we decided to just move it a couple of pennies and to $0.60. and it was $10 million, steve. and we had made the call, and we just didn't go back on it. $10 million is still $10 million. so we decided to go forward with it and thought it was still the right thing.
this is one of these things where if you do it, some people will say, what the heck are you doing raising your dividend regardless of how much it is in the middle of something like this? honestly, i think the way we are thinking about this is that this is a one-time event. it's unfortunate, but we are still on the trajectory when 2022 rolls around. we are still back to where we were on our capital allocation plan in 2023 and forward.
and so we made the call to continue with that. relatively small, but still obviously -- it is an obvious change in the middle of this type of situation. it certainly can be second guessed, but we thought it was the right thing to do to move forward with it. we still are very interested in our dividend. we think it's important to our investors. and so we decided to stick with it. because we made that decision, steve, by the way, before this hit. as a board, we decided to do this, and we did not revisit it. we said we are going to go ahead and move forward with it.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
okay. but i assume you did that with context knowing that you could get -- even though this was a big hit, it's manageable in the scheme of the whole company?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yes. so from a liquidity standpoint, we feel good. and not only do we feel good with what we have, we feel good with the partnerships we have with a number of different financial institutions that have frankly been very supportive. and they didn't know anything, by the way. they didn't know if we've made money or we didn't make money. but they also knew people were winners and losers. and they have come to us and said, look, we believe in your long-term. if you need it, any kind of liquidity, we would be happy to make our balance sheet available to you to help you through this if you needed it.
i'm convinced that this is not a liquidity crisis for this company. this is a short-run material hit. we took a body blow. but i also believe that we will come back around out of this and move forward with strength. and the fact that people are willing to help us out in this, and they understand, they believe in us, that's huge to us. but steve, i don't see this as a situation where we're in dire straits. i'd tell you, if we hadn't got our debt down and if we are still the old ipp model, we would be in a different place.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
yeah, good. and then just a follow-up is just thinking -- trying to ignore '21 and what happened and looking to '22 let's say and beyond. can you just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about both generation, which i think forwards have moved up some? but is there any different strategy there for you? and then on retail, how are you thinking about the implications of this for retail at '22 and onward?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so -- and i'm going to let jim talk a little bit about retail. but i will just say -- i'm sorry, what was the first part of that?
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
generation and hedging.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, sorry.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
ignoring '21, focusing for the future toward '22.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so i think this gets you in a little bit to the capital allocation discussion too. i mean, first of all, we still believe, probably more so than we ever have, in texas until there is a market design change that generation is pretty darn important. and now we know obviously supply chain around our generation with gas is even more important than we ever thought. but we still believe that the generation that we have is important. i still think that we are going to see coal retirements. and we believe, probably even more now than ever, because my guess is this is also going to impact development in the ercot market. but we think there is value in these -- in the projects that we are doing. so we continue to want to do those.
i will say, though, steve, that how we finance those and how we realize the value from them. i think we always have been open-minded and we will continue to be open-minded about -- i'm talking now about the renewable and battery that we are doing. and so there could be some things that we do. i think we would like to buy our shares back, and we are going to probably need to do that even more. so the real challenge in '21 is there is not going to be a lot of money to do that unless we were to do some project-level financing, something like that, which we will consider.
in '22 and beyond, by the way, retail actually held up through this. and steve -- i mean, jim can get into the details and tell you his thoughts on retail real quick. but we are looking not only to maintain our retail, but we may end up getting -- we are a provider of last resort in ercot. and we may get some of the customers, if in fact customers drop their customers to the provider of last resort, which is a mechanism in ercot. we may get a significant amount of new customers. and we are also open to continuing m&a around retail. so we have been saying we would like to get a little more retail in our business. i think we are continuing that. we like that business. we are good at it. and so i think that hasn't changed.
on the generation front. we were sort of reducing our generation exposure a little bit anyway and we are becoming more and more matched. i know this event obviously shakes people because we ended up being short. it was because of things that we did not -- could not have planned for. so i still think that we are going to head down a path where our generation is going to be reduced in terms of megawatts as we retire coal. and we will add some renewables and batteries and we will still have generation. but i think we will be a much more balanced company as we go forward. even with this event, we still think that is the right move. i hope that answered, steve.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
thank you.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
jim, do you want to say anything about retail real quick?
jim burke -- president and chief financial officer
yeah. yeah, sure, i would. thanks, curt. steve, i think over the evolution of the markets here in ercot, we've seen these events come every three to five years and it disciplines retailers to think differently about some of the collateral requirements and the hedging that's necessary to survive. this event had the chance to really create a runaway scenario for swing for the retail segment, for any retail business in ercot. and then the load-shed capped out that exposure for some, and it actually it did for our business as well. and so the retail business held up well.
however, there still are some retail businesses that experienced swing and they are reporting some results that are unfavorable. i think this business takes more capital than most people think. and it takes more discipline around hedging than most people think. and we found ourselves even in a business that we're very familiar with having assets ready to run, being in a position to run and having trouble with the fuel supply, which we did not see coming to the extent obviously that had occurred.
so i think there is going to be some retail consolidation. i think whether that's doing the [indecipherable] process or whether that's through a chance to take a look at some books. i think we are going to come out of this in a relative position in a very strong place. we look at 2022 and beyond as back to normal. and to your point about the curves, the curves being up in the next several years is a $200 million to $300 million difference than where we were just a few weeks ago. and so we'll see how that plays out. but this is a tough one, tough one to get through. but i think coming out on the other side, we are going to be relatively positioned in a good place.
steven fleishman -- wolfe research llc -- analyst
great. thank you.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
thanks, steve.

your next question comes from julien dumoulin-smith from bank of america. please go ahead.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
hey, team. thank you for all the color and commentary. i wish you guys the best. can we talk about capital allocation? i know you mentioned an update coming, but there is some -- you just alluded to it, so i want to bring it up more directly here. it seems like there is some latitude in the budget, especially if you think about having a probably disproportionate preference to review buybacks here. how do you think about investments in renewables and the ability -- not to pursue them, but to monetize those selectively as you complete them? certainly, it seems like added source, but also can we address the credit rating and your thought process, perhaps initially with the rating agencies?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, great questions, julien. so on the renewables, i think you sort of stated accurately. and i tried to portray this, maybe i didn't do a very good job on it. but i think there is some opportunity to potentially raise capital in a different way, let's put it that way, that could add capital to buy back shares. and i think we'd like to buy our shares back. so i think we are going to be very open-minded. these projects have value to them. and now that can be somewhat contingent on also having contracted projects. and of course, we have a retail business that we can look at to contract with, but we also can do that externally with third-parties. so i think there is some work in 2021 we'll do to make sure that. but we are not in a position where we have done it ahead and that we absolutely have to do it, but i think it is worth doing. and we were considering it even before this event, but i think it's an even higher priority.
jim, do you have anything you want to add to that? but that's kind of how i see that. and then i can answer the next piece of it too.
jim burke -- president and chief financial officer
our view is very similar there, curt. and i think there may also be opportunities to look at current operating assets in the market are those under way as current owners or projects might have seen the performance gap and how they hedged some of those assets in this market as well. and so i think there could be other opportunities that weren't on the horizon just a few weeks ago.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
it sounds interesting.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
we have looked at that, julien. the problem is, again, if you want to sell it, return to the hedge, i suppose you could do that, but the values just aren't there. there is so much generation that is either explicitly or implicitly for sale in the market that -- and i don't feel like we have to do that. but if we found an opportunity to do that, that made some financial sense, we don't need to own all the megawatts that we have, and so we would consider that. but i'm not-we are not going to rush to that because we are not in a financial distress. and i think we are going to be a little more disciplined. i think i would rather look for ways to save money and to do things like that rather than to force a sale in the middle of a market that is not a particularly good market to sell assets in.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
understood. and on the rating agencies?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so rating agencies, i'll just say this. we've had some early discussions with them. and this is, like it is to you guys, it's an initial shock. they know that we are still disciplined and we will continue to pay down debt and that we have been that way. and so look, i think we have had constructive discussions. i have nothing to announce at this point in time about that, and they don't either. but i would say the discussions have been constructive. and i'm going to spend some time i could. i was in these hearings all day yesterday. i'm going to spend some time with a couple of the agencies myself because i couldn't make the meetings and talk to them. but i found the discussions to be very open and honest and constructive, and i'm hopeful that we will be ok there.
julien dumoulin-smith -- bank of america merrill lynch -- analyst
okay, excellent. thank you. best of luck.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer

your next question comes from shahriar pourreza from guggenheim partners. please go ahead.
james kennedy -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst
good morning, guys. it's actually james for shahriar.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
hey, how is it going?
james kennedy -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst
curt, to build off your policy points about middle ground between high priced assets and a capacity market. i mean, we watched the hearings yesterday, it sounds like there is sort of momentum. kind of from where we stand today, could you give us any probability on policy change actually coming out of the spring session in the legislature?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so look, we were asked to bring back ideas in a week. this event has really shaken the state of texas from the very top. i was able to speak with some of the obviously the leadership in the state of texas. they don't want this to happen again. i think they are beginning to realize that the mix of assets in the market combined with the structure itself is not sustainable, pretty obvious to them. and they also know this was a big weather event. and we can't lose sight of that, that this was an extreme weather event. but at the same time, they have to ask themselves even so, do we really want to even have to take the risk of this type of event. and i think they are asking themselves, and they know the answer, none of them can stomach really the idea that a bunch of this high pricing power is going to get passed on to customers.
and so they realize that that's an untenable position to be in for us, and they are worried about having enough generation. and they realize if you don't have a market structure that works, people aren't going to invest. so that tells me that there is a very good probability that we could get something done here, and i would say north of 50%. and i wouldn't normally say that about any process like that, but i see momentum. and i know our company is going to have a seat at the table. and we are going to be working on this extensively in the next few days, because i do not want to lose the momentum. i think we do need a change. and we were already considering these things. and so we were prepared. and i think it's time to get everybody together and find a way to move this market. still using competitive market principles, but i think stabilizing it somewhat.
james kennedy -- guggenheim securities llc -- analyst
got it. thanks. this will be it.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer

our next question comes from amit sarkar from bmo. please go ahead.
amit sarkar -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
hey, curt. thank you for taking my questions. i'm in houston. so i hope you will indulge me since i just got the power back. so i figure i have earned it too. hey, curt, you kind of talked a little bit about the oak grove coal supply issues with some of the rail transportation not kind of getting through. i'm just curious, but don't you typically have like a coal power that would represent a couple of weeks of burn? i guess you aren't shipping it coal every day to kind of burn that coal. can you kind of fill us in a little bit on kind of the issues there?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, i will, and then jim can jump in. but it was kind of the two things. it was coal -- getting coal to the coal silos, but it also was wet coal that we actually had. and so what we were -- and that was creating issues with the front end process to eventually burn coal. and so it was those two things. so we were trying to get fresh coal in and then we were having problems with the rail because the coal we had on the ground was frozen and it was also wet in gumming up and causing problems that we end up having to take the units down. but that's what i understand it. but jim has been working on this night and day. so why don't we let him also explain his knowledge of what happened?
jim burke -- president and chief financial officer
sure. thanks, amit, for the question. that is one of the benefits of having a mine operation right there is that we can self-supply. we have several days worked at the plant. and then of course, we have -- at the mine, we have much more under coal barn, a covered area. so the thought was when the coal pile, which is right by the plant, is exposed, it froze over, becomes basically chunks of ice that you can't put through the equipment without tearing it up.
so the goal was to try to get the drier coal over from the mine to the plant. and that transportation system is really tough, not just the tracks, but the railcars, the doors that you used to dump the coal, they are freezing. so they were freezing shut and then we couldn't actually -- once we got them open, we couldn't get them back closed. and so we had a supply chain even within our own system where it was effectively difficult to work in the freezing conditions that got worse through the middle of the week before we were able to find ways to work through that. so that wasn't about a rail coming in from elsewhere. it was really between the mine and the plant and trying to get the best fuel we could.
at martin lake, we obviously do have also a supply on hand. it was a derated plant because of the freezing temperatures and also dealing with the pile, effectively turning into ice. and so we ended up our conveyor systems where we are transporting this coal up through to the plants. they are exposed as well. in many parts of the country, those are completely enclosed.
so these systems, as curt mentioned earlier, they were designed for the heat and the warm weather not the freezing temperatures we were in. so we took derates on that plan as well. we ended up at a 70% capacity factor for coal during the week. so the capacity factor is certainly lower than we expected and wanted to have. but that 30% that we were not able to keep going, and that includes the derates and being offline, that just became a very expensive prospect for us. because as curt said, we were replacing $5 to $20 a megawatt hour fuel with $2,000 fuel in the form of gas that we were burning in some of our old gas steam units. and so a little bit of miss on the volume there multiplied by the delta on fuel cost was substantial. so we are going to have to look at the coal handling and look at what resiliency we need to build in for this type of a cold weather stretch at our coal plants.
amit sarkar -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
thank you for that. and i guess that kind of leads into my follow-up question. just going back to kind of the press release you guys put out on wednesday, i guess kind of in the midst of all of this. and i have heard i think you testified to this yesterday in front of legislature as well. if i kind of look at the percentage of load of cut you kind of reserving and i kind of used monday as an example since that was kind of the height of this. is it fair to say if we set aside mgp, assume that ran -- that your fossil fleet kind of ran at a kind of a blended kind of capacity factor of like 70%, 75%?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yes.
amit sarkar -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
and so like with prices kind of on tuesday and wednesday kind of clearing at the cap, and it looked like you guys had some length or heat rate length open going into this. i guess, i'm still trying to wrap my head around on kind of on why the losses where they were to such an extent. are you guys kind of saying that because you did such a good job in a light stayed on in north zone versus say houston zone that you just -- and the demand was so high there relatively, that you guys kind of found yourself short, whereas other kind of generation units that were pointed at houston zone basically had the benefit of the load just basically being cut, so they basically weren't short anymore?
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so i mean -- go ahead.
jim burke -- president and chief financial officer
i mean, yes. in essence, this was a very interesting pattern because heading into the weather event when you see what the temperatures were going to be, this looked like coal generators, specialty generators with length would have an opportunity to make potentially a good return on their efforts. and retailers, no matter how much they were headed, whether it was through a p95 or p99 scenario, they were going to swing and likely pay much higher prices to cover their obligation to their customers. so it was originally going to look like a good generator segment opportunity and probably a tough one for retailers.
once the load-shed happened and the load shed happened, not just curtailing load for retail but it actually curtailed and contributed to the gas supply issues, the retailers kind of got stopped out on their exposure to the swing. and in some cases depending on how much load was shed, could have become lost on their supply position. and the generators and the ones that were online including ourselves, we could not get the fuel to meet the obligation of what we had sold forward to both third parties as well as our own supply book. so it shifted this load curtailment shifted the entire risk from what should have been on a retail segment back to a generation segment, because of its linkage to the fuel supply challenge on particularly natural gas.
and that is we were long. we had an ability to capture this, but you are long if you get the fuel. if you don't get the fuel, you are short. and that is why when we put the press release out, we put a lot of emphasis on the fact that we were having fueling challenges. and we also wanted to do address that our units were winterized, they were there running. and we have an opportunity here if we can solve the field challenges. and despite all that, we were still a disproportionate amount of the generation on the grid. so it played out very differently than we would have thought a week or two ago, but those are the major drivers.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
and jim, i will just add that what happened is too is monday, as i said, pricing was not at the cap. for this very strange reason, we were long monday. then we started having gas delivery issues, pricing issues as well as pressure issues. and then we lost oak grove for about day and a half, which is our low-cost fuel. and so it is like one of these sayings where if it could go bad, it did. and all those things contributed, but a big chunk of it really was around gas. the cost of gas as well as the amount of gas we were getting delivered.
and then there was another-that is a big bucket. that is like, i think jim has said, about two-thirds. and about third of it was around our coal of that total. and i know-because-i mean you can only imagine what i was doing to meet-i was like pulling my hair out. like i thought we were long. i thought we were in a good position. we are one of the biggest generators in terms of percentage on the grid. you think $9,000 cap, you are thinking everything is going well. but when you start tracing through it, it begins to make sense and unravel as to how our position changed and how we were-had the inability to really do much about it. but we did the right thing, but it was financially not good. and that is a tough thing when you do things and you know that you were doing the right thing and the outcome doesn't swing your way, it is very difficult.
amit sarkar -- bmo capital markets -- analyst
i appreciate all the time, curt. i know you had a hell of a day yesterday. thank you.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. take care.

this concludes the q&a portion of our call, and i would like to turn it back to curt morgan for final comments.

well, i appreciate people that are still hanging in there, but thank you very much for your interest in our company. tough week last week, but this company is strong, resilient. it is a good company. and we are going to come out of this stronger than ever. i hope you all have a great weekend, and look forward to talking to you soon.

ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the vistra fourth quarter 2020 results conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, molly sorg, head of investor relations at vistra. please go ahead, ms. sorg.
molly sorg -- investor relations
thank you, carol, and good morning, everyone. welcome to vistra's investor webcast discussing fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, which is being broadcast live from the investor relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our form 10-k and the related earnings release. joining me for today's call are curt morgan, chief executive officer; and jim burke, president and chief financial officer. we have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary.
before we begin our presentation, i encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-gaap financial measures. today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. we assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
further, our earnings release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-gaap financial measures. for such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measures are provided in the earnings release and in the appendix to the investor presentation.
i will now turn the call over to curt morgan to kick off our discussion.
curtis a. morgan -- chief executive officer
thank you, molly. good morning, everybody. we appreciate your interest in this call today. and this morning i would like to start out with the elephant in the room. we had a rough week last week to say at least. and for our investors who are listening to this call, i want to say on behalf of everybody at vistra that we are disappointed in our inability to deal with this unprecedented event in a way that was favorable for the company. but i can assure you that we did everything we could to try to come out on top. and i'd like to take you through a little bit, and jim burke will too, the events that ensued and what we tried to do to deal with those events, what happened and also just to tell you on the front end that it has taken us until middle of this week to really sort out what really ultimately ended up happening.
and so therefore, we felt it was imperative that we have this discussion, even though we have not sorted out everything that we have this discussion today and started the process of a conversation about what actually happened and then we will get to the final numbers. i can assure you that there isn't anybody more disappointed than us. and it's disappointing to me that we let you down because we pride ourselves in execution, and i think we've done a darn good job of it over the five years i've been here. and within literally an hour or two, our world kind of turned upside down.
first of all, it was for texas, maybe for those of us who lived in the northeast or the north know that may not have looked as a big a deal. but in texas, it was an unprecedented event. the infrastructure, and i don't mean just the electric infrastructure, but i'm talking about housing and other things are built really for the heat. you don't see this kind of event. and i think history tells us that this was one of these so-called one in a 100 years. now it did happen. and the reality is, even if it's one in a 100, it can happen. so it's no excuse, but it tells you the depth of what happened. it's, as i understand it, the coldest three day stretch that they can -- that they have on record in texas, the 14th through the 16th.
so what does that mean? well, that meant that we had unprecedented demand. so to take you back, and i think it's important to lay this out, i think it was the 9th of february, steve muscato who's on this call, came to me and said, our meteorologists that we have on staff came to him and said, we've got an unprecedented event coming. we ran the numbers and we were seeing load in 72,000 to 74,000 megawatts. now let's put that in perspective, the worst case scenario or the -- one of the -- i guess you called out that ercot had performed was about 67,000 megawatts or so, maybe 67,000 to 68,000. and steve was concerned not just because of the load, but we also were looking at wind forecast and we are concerned about solar. and the fact of the matter was that we didn't have enough steel on the ground to cover that load. so they have been testifying to this in texas, i'm still here in austin last couple of days and i'll be talking more again today. but we did go to ercot because they had -- i think it was about 65,000 megawatt for monday -- and this is by the way for monday, tuesday, 15th and 16th, just to give you a timeline.
so we are out in front of it. i've justified to this. i believe and now that i've been listening to the other testimony that i believe ercot thought that they had it under control. and i'll tell you in a minute what happened. and i think they weren't even prepared for what did end up happening. so the bottom line is, the company positioned itself relative to that to be long or flat. and in some instances, we were short going into that, but then we went out and bought power at very high prices because we believe that power was going to go through the cap. that it was not if, it was when.
and so we were prepared. we also spent, and we've been open about this, about $10 million in preparation. we brought on about 200 additional contractors on site. we essentially did our whole winter readiness in texas all over again, which we normally do in the fall. and we felt very well prepared going into that. and then monday came and i was on the phone with steve and it was 1 am and steve, like he always does, we talk about, ok, here it comes. we think load-shed is going to begin. and of course, it was supposed to be rolling blackouts. and then it started. i mean, we all thought because we were 30 minutes on, 15 off, and that went on for a relatively short period of time. and then steve told me that we almost lost the entire grid. frequencies were erratic. it tripped a couple of our units. and then shortly after that, everything locked down.
and from what we find out on testimony now, the transmission distribution entities, not ercot, essentially locked down each of their systems at wherever they were because they were afraid they were going to lose the system. now we had a book and then all of a sudden that book of business changed. loans were down about 40,000. and the reason they locked it down is because we were losing generation on the grid left and right. and the reason we were losing generation on the grid was predominantly because gas pressures, but also there were outages. unfortunately, for nrg, and this is public, south texas project tripped. and i think this was a confluence of events for ercot and for the teus that all of a sudden, they were managing a very different risk profile with about 30,000 megawatts less of generation and they could not run a system on rolling blackouts with that level of generation. and so they just had to preserve the system.
now that was the first event that changed our book. how did it change it? it locked whatever load you had in your area based on what was on at that time. so if you were rolling blackouts and you were on, north texas was on, which we were, that froze that at a particular level. and then we started getting our gas cut because of pressures. so all the sudden, our book went from a flat to loan book into a book that was long, short, mixed. and we were scrambling at that point. and then right on that, we had gas contracts, people declared force majeure. so we had gas and then we didn't have gas. all that happened within a very short period of time. and we were managing a different reality at that point in time.
and so frankly, we had millions of people without power in the state of texas. we were scrambling to get gas. gas prices shot through the roof. and we said, this is survival mode. we turned our attention to preserving the texas market and the grid and putting every megawatt we could. we said ourselves, we have to put everything on it and we will count this up at the end. but the one thing we know we need to do is serve customers, stabilize the grid and then we will sort it out later. and that's what we did. and i look back on that every day and over the night when i can't sleep, and i say to myself, what could we have done different, curt? what -- how could we have played this differently? and i think those decisions, as i play them over and over again, were right.
now we had some things. and by the way, i know it doesn't matter, in light, what doesn't matter. if you lose the super bowl, no one goes and says, that is just because you know you had a mistake or the ref had a call, you lost. and so i get that. i'm just trying to explain to you what we were trying to do to manage this situation that was unprecedented to us and we were trying to do the best that we could. and it took us, frankly, until the middle of this week. in fact, all the way up to last night we were having the board meeting to really get a sense of what that range would be. and so we still don't know exactly what all these numbers are because we're still getting in because ercot shutdown for a while, wasn't provided invoices. we didn't know what the load looked like and we're beginning to get that picture.
so if you think about what happened, there was a confluence of events. but the biggest which that we have not seen is all the way from the wellhead, we were having freeze ups. so there wasn't enough gas to inject into the pipelines. we had gas processing facilities that were having winter issues. and one of the biggest things that happened is that the tdus didn't have an updated list of critical infrastructure. and so all of a sudden, they couldn't help it. they just shut down what they didn't think was critical. and all of a sudden, we had gas compressors that are running on electricity, that packed the pipes, they were shut off. they weren't listed as critical infrastructure. we have gas processing facilities that were shut off because they weren't listed as critical infrastructure. and we had wells, producing wells that were shut off for the same reason.
so then we have to triage. we had to go upstream looking for people saying -- and finding out what was wrong, why we weren't getting gas and we were helping people with the tdus turn back on critical infrastructure. and that took -- in order to get that to happen, it took a couple of days then for those to get on and then you have to -- in order to repressurize the pipe, it takes a good day to do that. so it took us the balance of the week to get gas restored. so we had significant amount of curtailments and we were buying gas at a very high price.
now one on us is we had some problems with our coal fleet. we had some -- just some coal issues at martin lake, which would be rates. we didn't come offline. we just didn't produce at the maximum. and then we had, you guys may know this, but oak grove, we shipped coal, we mined lignite and we shipped it. we have three -- the rails froze up and then we had plugging and that took us down for about a day and a half. now why is that matter? well, it matters a lot because of oak grove has about $5 a megawatt hour cost structure as opposed to having to essentially replace it with gas at hundreds of dollars in mmbtu. so the margin that we were getting for that day and a half was less. now we got it back. that was a good thing, but we lost for that day and a half. that was lot of money that we lost, and jim is going to go through these numbers.
the other thing that hurt us is that there was a pricing glitch on monday. so we're in what we call an eea3, which is the highest alert at ercot. that means, you have really no reserves. in fact, we had 30,000 megawatts in negative reserves. where was the price? price was trading at lmps, in some instances, $1,000 below our cost. and so we were calling ercot, what is going on? well, we determined there was a pricing, let's call it anomaly. we went to the puc the next day. and they came out with an order and said we're going to reprice that at the cap and then we're going to have it stay at the cap until we come out of eea3. frankly, the right decision, and that was a big deal for us. inexplicably, 18 hours later, they reversed the decision and they decided to do it prospectively, but not retroactively. and they claim that during wee hours of the morning on monday that people relied on that price, ridiculous.
and so monday was a big day for us because we were long that day because the gas infrastructure was just beginning to come off. and so we lost that value. now that's something that we are still taking a hard look at, but that was tough. again, curt, what's the matter? still happened to you? yes, it did. but we didn't expect it. nobody expected when we're in a eea3 that the price will be anything, but at the cap. how could it be when you have negative reserves. it absolutely is preposterous, and yet that's what happened.
so all of those things happened. the book -- we didn't know what the book was. we went through that. we performed actually relatively well. we put on 25% to 30% of all megawatts on the grid relative to our 18% market share. a good -- again, no good deed goes unpunished. the problem was we had a mismatch when they locked the system down between megawatts and load. and the other thing is, we were producing from higher cost assets than we expected. so our cost of goods sold mix was not helpful.
so i've taken you really through the two first slides. i will say a little bit about the market because i think the other very fair question is ok, well, what does this mean for the texas market? and frankly, i thought it was the best market in the country. and this event has made me think. not just me, but a lot of people think about it. but i still believe the basic tenants of a very good market are here. but i think the one thing that we're going to have to work on with the policymakers, the regulators, and i think we have good momentum on this, is that the grid in texas today when we put in the all energy market and the price gaps is a grid that is different than the one that exist or existed when we went competitive.
so when we are competitive, it was very different. how? well, we have a lot less dispatchable resources. in fact, we have less dispatchable resources than our peak loads. so we rely much more heavily on renewables. renewables are good, nothing wrong with that. but it changes the risk profile. renewables during this event were at capacity factors from 5% to sort of 15%. it didn't really contribute a lot during this event. that's why we didn't -- and that's why i said, when we were at 74,000 peak load, we didn't have enough at megawatts in the system. it was -- again, it wasn't a matter of if, it was a matter of when and we were telling people that.
so on the market design, reserves has to be, in my mind, the number one emphasis. and so there is a number of ways to get more reserves on the system. but i also think that we have to take a hard look at the balance between market and the competitive markets and reliability. and i think that puts a lot of things on the table. that puts could be potentially greater reserves that ercot has to acquire in order to maintain the system. it could be a capacity market. i know that that may be blasphemy need to some in texas, but i think it has to be on the table. but what i think comes out of this is still a very good competitive market that still has opportunities for people to do well. but move on the spectrum of competitiveness to reliability, move that a little more toward the middle. and -- but we're going to sort through that and more will come out of that, but i'm confident that texas will rise to the occasion. this economy mandates it. and the policymakers and the governor and others know that this economic engine is powered by electricity. and with electrification coming, we've got to get it right. and we're a big player. we have a big seat at the table. we have a lot of good ideas. and i think the market actually advances to a good point.
now the weather event, i mean, we're believers in climate change. we don't know if this type of event becomes more frequent. but i think if you just let history tell you something that this is not a frequent event, but it could happen. and so we have to adapt. we have to -- and it's not huge numbers, but we're going to have to batten down the hatches, so to speak, and to harden our assets. and the one thing i'm going to be on a crusade about is making sure that the gas and electric systems work seamlessly, that the tdus upgrade their critical infrastructure and that the gas system puts the money in just like we do to harden their system. it cannot be acceptable to not deliver gas at the maximum pressures in the middle of a natural disaster. now you can't say, well, my hands are clean on this, i don't regulate that, let's change the regulations then. so we have work to do, but i still have confidence very much so in the market.
now this has been difficult. we hope that -- we hope to maintain your trust in us, but at the very least, we hope to earn it back. i'm disappointed and it hurts, but it is what it is. and it's easy to lead when things are going well. and i think it's time to lead going forward. and i believe that the franchise is in place, the financial strength that we worked so hard to build, thank goodness has helped us through this. and our better days are still ahead of us. and the integrated model still works. and we just have to do some things, some tweaks. we have to work on the market design. but i still have faith in this business and in these markets because there are too important. electricity is the lifeblood of the economy. we have to get this right. there is no choice when you say, well, how do i trust that? sectors can never go through this again, and they know that. so that's what i trust. and we are a big player here. and so what comes out the back end of this, i believe, is going to be good for texas, good for the market and good for vistra.
so with that, i'm going to move into, and i just hate this, but i'll move into 2020. not that i hate 2020, but -- or maybe i do, but moving into 2020 because we have such a great year and this event has overshadowed it and the men and women have worked so hard at vistra in 2020 in the face of covid, in the face of social issues and everything that's been thrown at us, performed as good as anybody could have expected. it enabled us to pay down a significant amount of debt. our retail business was exceptional getting close to almost $1 billion of ebitda. we continue on the cost savings front. and by the way, i'm not going to throw a number out there today and say that we're going to save bunch of hundreds of millions of dollars.
we have a lean business. and i'm not going to starve this business. you cannot starve power plants for maintenance costs. it will bite you in 2022 and 2023. but we will, as we always do and we will double down. we will look for opportunities to optimize earnings going forward once we determine what the full effect of this is. and i'm convinced, like we do every year, we will find opportunities and we will let you know what those are. but i'm not going to throw a big number out there that i don't think is good for the company in the long run. and we are playing this for the long run. 2021 and this event are one-time event. and we're going to move this company forward in a way where it can compete and be even better into the future.
in 2020, i'm now on delivering financial results slide. this is a phenomenal year. $3.77 billion of ebitda and almost $2.6 billion in free cash flow before growth, almost a 70% conversion ratio. i remember when i was talking to you guys and the dynegy acquisition and we put out the, i think it's s-4 and we had a set of projection numbers. and just looking at what we were able to do in 2020 relative to what we had in that is, in my opinion, truly remarkable. and i think we did that with very disciplined investment into the business. and i'm proud of what we were able to do and what the numbers we were able to put up.
i think since we -- since i took over, we've got i think almost $600 million above midpoint of guidance over those years. what just kills me is we gave it all back and more. but we've been through that story already this morning, i won't take you through it again, but that's tough. you don't want to get back what you've created, and that's a difficult thing for us. the op initiative continues and it will continue. we think that now that is just a part of who we are. and we like to give this to you just because we want you to know when we tell you we're doing something that we do it, but it's really embedded in our ebitda. and then we are on track on our synergies for the -- and namely, the crius and ambit because dynegy is pretty much done now. even on the system side, the technology side, that's pretty much done at this point in time.
and the last thing i'll say then i'll hand it over to jim. through all this, we still have, and i'm on the last slide here, prioritizing all stakeholders. just briefly to touch base, this has been who we are since i've been here. we've been about all stakeholders. we continue to do it. we've made huge advancements on the environmental side with our employees and contractors and customers and suppliers and our communities, we're proud of that. and we expect to continue to do that. and i know we did announce that we were -- had $5 million to help customers. and some people may say, well, there is a cost savings right there, curt. why did you do that? and it's because of what i said earlier, two things. one is, we're about helping people as a company, not just about making money. we do care about that, but we have a bunch people down here that are in need. this became a survival game. this became a humans' needs effort, and we took that seriously. just like we take seriously being the guardians of your investments, we do care also about people. and it's very important to the franchise of our retail businesses that we are out there and we are helping others. and we have not lost those franchises. this weather couldn't take those franchises away from us. and they have extreme value and we have to keep investing in those franchises. but helping people is also a very important thing. and so we made that hard call in the face of adversity and uncertainty because that's who we are. that's what we're about.
so with that, i'm going to give it to jim. jim is going to quickly go through financial results. and then i know you guys have q&a and we'll try to answer everything we can as completely as possible. and so, i will turn it over to jim. thank you.
jim burke -- president and chief financial officer
thanks, curt. i'm going to quickly cover slide 16. as curt said, i know we want to get to q&a. i would just hit two slides.
our full year 2020 retail results were $176 billion higher than our full year 2019 results, driven by the acquisitions of crius and ambit, plus stronger comp margin performance, partially offset by milder weather. the $197 million favorability in our collective generation segments was driven by higher margins in our texas east and sunset segments, including the higher period-over-period benefits from our opi initiatives, partially offset by lower capacity revenues.
as it relates to the impacts of covid-19, vistra was able to navigate through the challenges brought on by the pandemic with minimal impacts to our financial performance. on the retail side, we only saw a small uptick in bad debt during the year, while our lower business volumes were offset by higher residential volumes. and as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call in may of 2020, our commercial team executed some opportunistic transactions in anticipation of the market volatility caused by covid-19, resulting in a positive benefit to vistra for the year.
in addition to these strong financial results, our retail business grew its residential customer count in texas year-over-year, reflecting strong performance by our legacy brands, while our generation business once again executed with commercial availability of over 95%. on the liquidity side, as of year end 2020, vistra had total available liquidity of approximately $2.4 billion, which was primarily comprised of cash and availability under its revolving credit facility. this strong liquidity position enabled vistra to effectively manage the collateral requirements related to the winter storm, yuri. as of february 25, vistra had more than $1.5 billion of cash and availability under its revolving credit facility to meet any liquidity needs.
we can close with slide 17. vistra repaid more than $1.5 billion of debt in 2020 to end the year at our long-term leverage target of 2.5 times net debt to adjusted ebitda. as of february 23, we've repurchased approximately 5.9 million shares at an average price of $21.15. $1.375 billion remains available under this authorization. we're continuing to execute on our strategic renewable and energy storage investments, including our texas phase 1 in california battery projects.
as we have communicated to you, we will be disciplined as it relates to deploying capital, regularly evaluating all growth projects for financial viability. we will only invest in growth projects if we are confident in the expected returns. as a result of this continuous review, we're currently pausing one growth projects in west texas due to updated economics, driven by higher than anticipated congestion cost.
i know many of you are wondering how our existing capital allocation plan will change as a result of the impacts of this winter storm. we expect to provide an updated capital allocation plan for 2021 on our first quarter earnings call. we remain committed to our dividend trajectory and to maintaining a strong balance sheet.
the challenges brought on by the global pandemic in 2020 and this historic winter storm in texas last week have tested our business model. we truly believe it was a one-time historic event. the winter event was a significant financial hit. our people worked in very tough conditions to generate as much power for the greatest possible. importantly, our business still has the strong assets that are hedged just two weeks ago. both our customer base and our generation footprint remained intact and we believe were solid growth prospects. we are a resilient team. we will stay focused on creating value for our stakeholders over the long-term.
with that operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.

thank you. and we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] and our first question today will come from shah pourreza with guggenheim. please go ahead.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
hey, good morning guys.
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
hey, shah. good to hear from you.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
yes, it same -- same curt. just, quickly curt -- just on your comments regarding a review of your strategic direction, how you allocate capital. you mentioned in your prepared remarks as you kind of continue to generate cash. can you maybe just speak on how you're thinking about buybacks versus perhaps a special dividend, especially as we're thinking about '22 and beyond? may be more inorganic retail deals also you kind of specifically also noted strategic direction. could that also imply that there is maybe an internal debate around a go-private scenario, if you continue to trade at these unsustainable high free cash flow yields. could -- kind of go-private scenario would be the avenue to realize value. i guess, just maybe if you can elaborate a little bit more on that strategic direction comment and -- but would you be prepared to discuss this by november, could this be pushed out? thanks.
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
yes. hey shah, so thank you. that's a great question. a lot in that question. so -- but i mean i knew that. i think i was going to get that question. i think after the uri event, i think most people would expect that management team and the board were going to sit down and have a discussion about our business and it's something that obviously was a risk that we did not contemplate and just to brush it off and say, we're going to go at things business as usual. i don't think that would have set well with anybody and certainly not with me and not with the board. so i think the first and foremost that we felt a sense of urgency and of course you know this, i mean our stock sold off big and more so actually than the actual math that you would put into it in terms of our shares divided into the loss itself. so there was a loss in confidence and i understand that, but we had to rethink things going forward. and i think that's what we're doing. i don't know that anything has really changed that much, but we -- i think there were four main pillars that are driving us as we go through our strategic direction and as we think about allocating capital.
number one is, our stock is incredibly cheap. and we went -- we've done a lot of analysis, and we still believe that we're significantly undervalued. and so, we have to think about what's the best way to invest in our own company. if others don't believe in us, then we need to believe in ourselves and we generate a lot of cash. and so, i think we have to take a hard look at buying back our shares. and that ultimately adds value to the shareholders to stay in the company. and so, it's a good use of capital in our mind. we said this in our remarks, jim and i did that we want to have a strong balance sheet.
we never started this though with the idea that we had to pursue investment-grade rating. that kind of came along with it. and if we get there, that's fine. what's more important is, we have a balance sheet that can withstand the kind of risk that we did with uri. we were sitting here at 5 or 6, maybe 7 times debt-to-ebitda, like the ipps of the past. we probably would be talking about a completely different situation right now than what we are. so we believe a strong balance sheet. it's still one of the cornerstones of our company, but we're not going to be penny wise and pound foolish. so we're going to look real hard at that. we think dividend will continue to be a part of what we do.
and finally, we did a review of our renewable and battery business. and we have one of the best businesses. we see just about every development company that's trying to sell itself right now. we know what those teams look like. we understand nextera has got an incredible business and kudos to them, but we're not second to anybody else in our view. we've got a great pipeline. we're using sites that have access to transmission. we have a tremendous capability in terms of development. development is not just about going out and getting in the interconnection queue. you've got to have market knowledge and experience. you have to have construction experience and operations and maintenance skills. we have the economies of scale from a functional support standpoint. we bring a lot to the table. the key for us, though, is it's a cost of capital gain. and so that's where a partner may come into this.
and so we're going to take a real hard look at how we can accelerate the growth in that business and make sure that we have a competitive cost of capital in that business. and that could also mean that we may want to do some project financing, but certainly bring in probably some infrastructure-type investment. so that's what we are working on. there is no disagreement with our board. i think our board and the management team are in lockstep. but these things take a little bit of time. and we're darn sure we're going to be prudent about it. we want to make sure whatever move we make is a long-term move. we don't want to have a knee-jerk reaction here and then have to do something again.
and i feel good, shar, that we will likely do something no later than the q3 call time frame. we'd like to obviously not do it on the q3 call because that gets you guys all congested because you've got other things to deal with. we certainly would like to do it before that and separately so that we can have the kind of time where we can spend time with investors and with you guys. so that's where we are on this.
we're -- we continue to believe in the long-term value of this company. i step back and think about it this way. we've got this incredible business that generates a tremendous amount of cash. and that cash can open up the opportunity for us to return capital. we've also got this burgeoning and very good growth business. and that business needs capital and it also means a cost of capital advantage. that's what we need to unlock. that's what we need to solve for. and that's what we are working on to do. and i feel very good that we're on a good path to do that. but there is a lot of work to be done. we want to get to the market as soon as we can on this direction because we build the urgency, but we want to do it right.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
so just to reiterate, curt. so the strategic direction really isn't about a debate on whether investors will ever properly reflect the value of an ipp as a public company and whether you're debating whether we should go private because that's what private is willing to pay for assets. this is more of a strategic direction, maybe a change in how you're thinking about buybacks versus dividend versus organic growth versus inorganic growth as a publicly traded company. this isn't a debate between whether we should go private or stay public.
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. no, look, we're for sale every day. so, if somebody wanted to pay an attractive price, but we're not out with hanging our shingle out there because i'll just tell you -- i've said this before, shar, i've said it to you, but i don't -- i've been in the private setting. i know what it is. i know what it takes. i know what private investors want. and i think that there are others out there that have gone private that are realizing that if you go private, it's the same thing that if we were public for these businesses, that it's a long-term gain and the idea that a private equity firm would come in here and can somehow then exit in three to five years. i just don't know who that exit would be.
and the thing that makes it difficult for us is that it would take a big equity check and a significant capital raise in order to get this done. that doesn't mean that it can't happen, but that is not our primary direction. we want to take a direction that we control. we don't control that direction. and so we do something that we control and that we think can unlock this value. so that's where we're focused.
shahriar pourreza -- guggenheim securities -- analyst
fantastic. thank you guys so much. appreciate it.
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from stephen byrd with morgan stanley. please go ahead.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
hi, good morning. thank you so much for taking my question.
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
hey, stephen.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
wanted to just talk a bit more about the opportunities for renewables that you're seeing and just get your latest view on sort of the state of play there. and as much as i love the idea of growing in renewables, it does strike me as challenging to kind of beat the economics of your own stock. and i know you just went through a long discussion of your review, so i understand that this is in process. but just would you mind talking a bit about that opportunity set in renewables? what you're seeing broadly? i would guess there might be some degree of distress among some of those smaller players out there. but just -- could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there?
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. good question, stephen. so, look, i think i tried to say this, but i'll make it as clear as i can. we think, at the top of our list of things to use the capital from this great cash generation machine that we have is our stock right now. and so, you see the free cash flow yields. the math is pretty clear. and so -- but we also want to have a strong balance sheet. i went through all these things and we do think paying a dividend made some sense. and so we are going to do that.
the real challenge is, can we return capital and grow what we believe is a very good and, like i said, burgeoning renewables and battery storage business. i mean, these are opportunities because of the sites that we have and we're in locations like california. california is talking about 12,000 megawatts plus of batteries that they need to put in. we've got sites that can do that. we can't walk away from that value proposition. we want to partner with pg&e and others in the state of california and with the state of california to help them solve their -- where they are trying to take their state. and we have the sites to do that.
and so, i think what we've concluded is, there are ways to do both. and that's where we're headed. we also want -- we believe that partnering with people, who have, let's say, an advantaged cost of capital and will put us in a position of having an advantaged cost of capital will put us in a better position. we have everything else there is to compete in this business and we have the full suite of capabilities. so i don't think it's a question of whether you can do one or the other. i think we can do both. the real question is, how do we go about doing that? and that's where we're spending the time right now is concluding that effort so that we can pursue both. there are great companies out there. i used nextera as one. i think nextera is a great company and they have been able to do both. and i think we can do both. and so we're going to just have to balance that. that's where we're headed.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley -- analyst
makes a lot of sense. i wanted to follow-up on illinois and just get your latest thoughts on kind of the state of play there, the opportunity set. it strikes me sometimes folks don't appreciate the potential there for you all. but i'm just curious what you're seeing on the ground? what your view is of where that may head?
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, look, i mean this is an interesting one because governor pritzker would like to move the state of illinois in a very progressive way to a leadership position in the area of clean generation. and he's pushing very hard on doing that. and he sees an opportunity with an omnibus energy bill, if that's going to happen. and i'm interpreting, he is not telling me this. i'm telling you what i'm reading through the discussions that i've had. and in so doing, that's a difficult thing because he would like to see emissions rates from thermal resources to decline and part of the legislation is pushing hard on that. and of course, that creates disruption.
and there are some co-ops that own coal plants have just built them or munis i should say. that just built them not too long ago, and they still have a huge amount of debt that are on a number of different municipalities. and that creates a lot of angst. and of course, there is others like us that own thermal resources and we're trying to sort out how does that happen. and i think even within his own party, there is a debate going on as to how you actually accomplish that. so -- and that has created a bit of a divide. and i think at the end of the day, they are going to try to work together. and i believe they will because there is too much at stake here. and they will come to a reasonable conclusion to move the state forward in terms of lowering its emissions. we are in the middle of that trying to help that.
the one thing that i have tried to mention to people is that if you get the omnibus bill in place and you put the kind of stipulations in the direct auctions and require developers to actually complete their projects and get them online, by that very nature, will end up crowding out thermal resources and will reduce emissions without having to have a heavy handed set of criteria that forces those to happen in an unnatural fashion. and so, i think, if they get this bill passed and they put the right teeth in, so that they can get the development that they want of the renewable and battery resources, they will accomplish a major amount of what they want to get done.
so, the real essence, though, at the end of the day, can something get done. we are cautiously optimistic that there will be a way -- a path forward that everybody will come together because again, there is too much at stake. there is a lot of investment that they want to do in renewables. our coal to solar is part of that. we feel strongly that we are solidly in the legislation. we have a very good program. it helps communities that are losing jobs from the fact that we are shutting down coal plants and investing in those communities, bringing property tax base. and we are real -- we are a real company. we have real projects, and we can bring those online in a very short period of time. and so we think there is a lot in that for us as well. and so we would like to obviously help bridge this gap and work together. and that's what we are doing.
we are working together with as many people as we can to try to help bridge this divide. i think it will get done, stephen, but you would never know. and we are cautiously optimistic, but there is a lot of stake and we think -- of course, the nukes, i didn't even mention that. those are very important to the state. they have made that very clear, so all that has to come together. most of it is already together. at the end of the day, it's just getting through this, what do we do in the long run with thermal resources and the glide path for those to exit. and i think that's where we need to come up with a compromise and i believe we will be able to do that.

operator
and our next question will come from steve fleishman with wolfe research. please go ahead.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hey, good morning.
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
hi, steve.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
hi, curt. just on the -- could you just remind us the current capital plan? what was in there in terms of dollars for renewables capex over the next few years? and maybe just also give us an update on where you stand on projects there, particularly the ones you were planning to do in texas?
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
yes. so steve, we had said that we would put $0.5 billion -- roughly $500 million. jim, while i'm answering this, jim may be able to find the exact numbers that we have. but $0.5 billion a year, we have said for 10 years. and when we put out that 10-year view -- and i think we're largely -- it's a little bit more and a little bit less in a couple of years, but we were going to reinvest that amount into renewables and batteries. and we are tracking sort of in that range and that was the investment. in terms of the projects themselves, i don't have the list in front of me, but i know that we have, and i don't know, jim, if you have that list and if you have been able to find that, but if you can pull up that list of where we are on each of the different projects.
jim burke -- president and chief financial pfficer
sure. steve, we had in our investor day, we had talked about a capital allocation plan that would put over $600 million into '21. we said $650 million approximately in '21 and $500 million in '22. we scaled the $650 million down to $425 million for this year. and we did that as part of the earlier questions. we're kind of reading the market signals on where we should best allocate our capital and we control these sites. so these were sites that we can bring on in the timeframe that we would like. we are going to be the off-taker predominantly for the texas sites. and so this gives us a lot of flexibility to be able to bring them on and do it in the timeframe that makes the most sense for us. as far as the sites themselves, we have both the moss 300 and 100 which were completed and those are operating with an ra agreement from pg&e.
the other sites that we're focused on are the brightside solar project, the decordova battery project, which is our hybrid project here in texas. we've got emerald grove and we've got just a little bit of spend to keep some options alive at a few other sites. that's the bulk of our spend for this year. and we are going to continue to build out for the balance of this year. we have got some phase 1 projects that we had announced earlier. we just slowed the path down, and we haven't gotten going yet on phase 2. so, the strategic review that curt has mentioned, will obviously dictate a lot in terms of the pace and can we find a cheaper form of financing that helps us accelerate this, but still use our capital for kind of its highest return. and so we will share that as we bring the details of that going forward. but it's the pipeline we talked about before, just a little bit slower go given we were resetting post uri. but the projects that we have are moving forward well and the battery projects in california are performing well.
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
and steve, one thing -- one other thing to add on that. andrews county is one that we pulled back when we pulled back to this lower spend. and that was initially -- this is why i talked about having the capability and having the discipline in development. if you are a development company, then all you are going to do is kind of build this thing up and flip it, it's a little bit different. but we were going to have to live with it. but we had some issues with congestion. and we have worked with encore and we now believe that side, you could go up to 200 megawatts. but this is the kind of stuff that we have a dedicated group on transmission that are incredible at what they do. and they can keep us out of issues by over-developing in an area and then having congestion and having the price reduced significantly. and so that -- we have pulled that back, but now since we have been able to work it, it's a project we'll do later. and as jim said, we control that site. so, that was part of why we also pulled that back.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay. just, i guess, a high-level question related to the renewables is just in your slide, you mentioned the alternatives to accelerate the pace of development using a cheaper cost of capital, which makes a lot of sense and it frees up a lot more capital for buyback. in terms of then the mix of the company, if someone else is going to own some of this, like can you grow the business fast enough, quicker that even if somebody is going to own some of it, the overall company keeps moving a lot greener over the period, if someone, if you have a partner?
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, sure. so, yeah, i mean that's a really good question and one that we have spent a lot of time. jim and i have recently, by the way. but you're talking about whether -- how do you do this, is this a jv and those things tend to have governance associated with them and there is a lot to them. i think, the way we're thinking about it, steve, is there is a couple of ways to do this. there is -- you can have an equity investment, you can also have sort of, what i'll call, a structured financing where it's -- maybe it's a preferred -- convertible preferred or something like that. there is a number of ways to cut this in terms of how do you raise the capital against the spend and the value of the company that can allow you to grow this company and to maintain the ownership and the governance that allows you to control the shots, because you can't get into a situation if you don't have the right partner, where it can get gummed up. and that's not what we are looking to do. what we are looking to do is get access to -- there is a lot of capital out there right now and a lot of infrastructure funds and a lot of people looking for companies like us that are legitimate that have a capability.
and so we think that we can raise reasonably priced capital in a governance-friendly manner to continue to allow us to grow our business. and so, we will see and the extent of how much the party would have a governance position in the company will depend on the size of the capital investment and the type of capital investment. and there will be a balance that we will make there. we've got a number of good friends out there that are interested in this. and we know this because there are people -- there are inbounds coming to us because i am making comments like this on calls like this. but we know that there is interest in this. and then it comes down to just what do the terms look like. but we have people that we know that were like-minded with that we can do -- that we could work with. and that we believe that understand what we are trying to do, which is accelerate this, not slow it down.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research -- analyst
okay, great. it makes a lot of sense. thank you.
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question will come from durgesh chopra with evercore isi. please go ahead.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
hey. good morning team. just on the sort of the -- hey, curt -- just on the strategic review, you have mentioned the size of the check. i'm just wondering like as you go into the sort of the q3 call and as you think through this, is there a possibility to not sell the company outright, but perhaps get a like-minded partner, who sees the value in the cash flow stream, sell a portion of the assets or a portion of companies. is that a possibility?
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
yes. absolutely.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, perfect. and then, just in terms of just the buyback you mentioned, obviously the currencies is heavily discounted. on the q3 call, should we expect sort of a form of program to be announced or like what to sort of -- you had this previous guidance of -- i think it was $1.5 billion worth in share buyback. so, should we expect a larger program or would you have done -- you have taken some actions before then?
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
i hesitate to get into precise numbers because we're working through this. we have a pretty big program that we already have out there for the next couple of years. i think what you're going to hear though is what we would like to do even longer-term. i mean, i think we would like to paint a picture, again. we have got this core business that generates a lot of cash. and i think we would like to earmark that to returning a bunch of cash. and so, we want to give a picture of the future that goes multi-years and just kind of shows just how much return of capital that we can do over that period of time from that business.
and then, i think we also would like to paint a picture of what the growth side of our business would look like. and those two -- let's call them two separate businesses and two separate tracks. but at some point, those two ultimately merge again. i think our biggest problem has been -- is that people can't envision the company long-term. they say, well, at some point, those thermal assets are going to go away. but if you have two tracks, one that you are generating a lot of cash and you are returning it to shareholders from your core business and you're building this large burgeoning renewable and battery business. at some point, those merge again. and then you have solved your long-term terminal value because our retail business isn't going anywhere. and we're going to grow that business. it's how we manufacture power, electricity that matters.
and we've got a great business that returns a lot of capital. and i think will continue to do so for a long time that we can return to shareholders. we also have advantaged sites in a core capability to be able to grow in renewables and batteries. and we want to be able to unlock both of those things. we think bringing in partners and additional capital is the way to do that. and then, at some point in time, those two merge again and that you have this -- you can then visualize this company in the long run because the supply side of our business has been essentially replaced from thermal to renewable and batteries. that's really the vision here. and then, we need to get into the details of how that happens.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
that makes a ton of sense, curt. thank you. just a quick one here, could you -- could there be share buybacks this year in 2021 potentially, previously you have said because of uri and sort of the balance sheet there would be no share buybacks in 2020, but could you reevaluate that?
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
we could. we could reevaluate that, yes.
durgesh chopra -- evercore isi -- analyst
okay, perfect. thank you so much. i appreciate you taking the time.
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
yes. thank you. thanks for the questions.

thanks again everybody for joining the q2 call. i know it's a busy -- a very busy day. we tried to -- we thought it was a pretty yeoman like quarter. the company has rebounded well. so we didn't want to take the full hour. hopefully this will give you some time. but a lot to talk about in the future, in the near-term. we will be getting back to you soon with the strategic direction and the capital allocation. so, thanks again. i hope everybody is well. take care.

operator
good morning everyone and welcome to the vistra second quarter 2021 investor conference call. [operator instructions]
i would now like to turn the conference over to molly sorg, head of investor relations. please go ahead.
molly sorg -- chief purpose and sustainability officer and senior vice president, investor relations
thank you and good morning everyone. welcome to vistra's second quarter 2021 results conference call which is being broadcast live from the investor relations section of our website at www.vistracorp.com. also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our form 10-q and the related press release.
joining me for today's call are curt morgan, chief executive officer; and jim burke, president and chief financial officer. we have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary.
before we begin our presentation, i encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website that explain the risks of forward-looking statements, the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-gaap financial measures. today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. we assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements.
further today's press release, slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-gaap financial measures. for such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation.
i will now turn the call over to curt morgan to kick off our discussion.
curtis a. ""curt"" morgan -- chief executive officer
thank you, molly and good morning to everyone on the call. as always, we appreciate your interest in vistra, especially on this crowded earnings reporting day. as we find ourselves at the start of august already, the fact that the power markets are in a state of transition continues to be apparent. california, texas and new york have all requested conservation at various times during the summer. june of 2021 was america's hottest june in 127 years of records, beating the prior record from june of 2016 by 0.8 degrees. much of this record-breaking heat has been observed in the pacific northwest. north texas was actually slightly below the 10-year average in june with april and may also being very mild. so as a nation, there is no question the temperatures have been on the rise in 2021, as have the extremes in weather conditions. these weather extremes coupled with the greater percentage of renewable resources backing up the supply stack in various markets have resulted in a heightened sensitivity to scarcity conditions by the system operators reinforcing the importance of thermal resources, especially natural gas, in maintaining a reliable grid now and several years into the future.
power markets and systems must also balance decarbonization efforts with affordability and reliability, which is proving to be a challenge as evidenced in california and texas. given the uncertainty with covid-19 especially, the delta variant and the country's desire to return to normal, we have continued to prioritize the safety of our number one asset, our people, while delivering reliable and affordable power to our customers. the second quarter results we are announcing today reflect this dedication and focus.
during the quarter we continued our rebound from the very unfortunate impacts from uri, most notably hardening our assets, participating in the texas legislative and regulatory processes and refining our risk management policies. we have also begun a process to review our strategic direction and how we allocate capital.
on slide 6, we show our strong second quarter financial results. excluding the second quarter impacts from winter storm uri related to bill credits and higher fuel costs, this delivered adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations of $909 million, comparable to its very strong second quarter 2020 financial results. including these uri impacts, vistra's adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations was $825 million. these results were pretty much in line with management expectations for the quarter. we have similarly, had a solid start in the execution of the self-help initiatives we identified when we announced our revised financial guidance in april. we currently have a line of sight to achieving the vast majority of the $500 million of self-help initiatives we previously announced and we have achieved more than 40% through june 30. we will continue to pursue the full $500 million, but only to the extent we do not jeopardize the future risk profile and/or earnings of the company.
as a result, we are reaffirming our 2021 guidance ranges for both ongoing operations adjusted ebitda and ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth as set forth on slide 6. importantly, excluding uri, vistra would be tracking in line to ahead of our pre-uri guidance midpoint for the year. we understand that uri happened, but we also believe it is important to recognize that the long-term earnings potential for vistra remains intact.
turning now to slide 7. as i mentioned at the beginning of the call, power markets have recently moved up with forward curves in both ercot and pjm as well as our other markets, up meaningfully over the last several months. i'm sure you've heard me discuss our point of view in the past, which is our modeled fundamental view of where prices are likely to move over time, incorporating various weather conditions, new build scenarios and other key variables on a probability weighted basis. pretty much since i have been at vistra, our point of view has decoupled from backwardated forward curves, especially in ercot. over the years, forward markets and to some extent several prices have afforded vistra the opportunity to construct realized price curves in line with our point of view. it is interesting that the recent positive movement in 2022 forward curves have brought pricing in line with vistra's point of view, especially in ercot. ercot sparks have increased primarily for the winter and summer months and we believe this is being driven by market participants reducing their overall risk tolerance falling uri, and possibly the potential for market reforms, which could result in more favorable price formation for dispatchable resources in the future to support market reliability.
in pjm, however, it is our view that the rise in power prices has been driven primarily by the increase in natural gas prices. as of july 30, vistra is now 54% and 93% hedged in ercot and pjm, up from 40% and 50% respectively for 2022. we have similarly, meaningfully increased our hedge positions in new york, new england, california and the miso markets over the last several months, taking advantage of the increase in outright power prices and spark spreads. the recent momentum in forward prices, primarily in ercot supports our previously stated strong outlook for 2022.
you might recall last fall at our virtual investor event in september, we offered an early outlook for 2022, noting our view that in a commodity exposed business like ours, looking at average adjusted ebitda over time is a more appropriate way to evaluate the earnings power of the business. we further offered our view that we believe 2022 ongoing operations adjusted ebitda could come in line with this average consent, specifically, we noted that the average of our 2020 and 2021 ongoing operations adjusted ebitda guidance midpoint was approximately $3.4 billion, which we believe could be indicative of 2022 financial performance and reflected our point of view pricing. at that time curves were lower. with the recent uplift in forward curves, especially in ercot, we continue to believe 2022 adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations could be in the range of $3.4 billion, excluding the impact of the retail bill credits from uri, with a 60% to 70% conversion to adjusted free cash flow before growth.
i'm now on slide 8. as we mentioned on our business update call in april, vistra is taking several actions intended to address the risk we were exposed to during winter storm uri. first, we are investing nearly $50 million in 2021, prior to the 2022 winter on improvements to further harden our cold fuel handling capabilities and to further weatherize our texas fleet for even colder temperatures and longer durations. we intend to spend up to another $30 million in 2022 to further enhance the ability for our fleet to withstand extreme weather conditions. we have also contracted for a meaningful amount of additional gas storage, which performed well during the storm to support our gas fleet and we are installing dual fuel capabilities at our gas steam units, while similarly increasing the fuel oil inventory at our dual fuel sites.
last, we plan to carry more generation link into the peak seasons, increasing the level of physical insurance we carry to protect against volatility. the absolute level of excess generation we carry will be a function of our investments in our generation infrastructure in the ercot market improvements that are implemented going forward.
in addition to these improvements we are making on a stand-alone basis, the texas legislature recently passed legislation that provide for mapping of the integrated gas and electric systems, which should help to alleviate gas deliverability issues by identifying critical infrastructure, allowing for weatherization and registration with the transmission and distribution utilities to ensure that those assets continue to operate in the inclement conditions and receive power in the event of rolling outages in the future. we have already seen a significant amount of registration activity since uri. we intend to play a role in ensuring the efforts to map and identify critical gas and power infrastructure are carried out in a manner that results in the intended reduction of risk to the integrated systems.
last both ercot and the public utility commission of texas are evaluating various market reform alternatives to reduce risk and ensure that dispatchable resources have adequate revenues to incent -- investment and serve to balance the system with a growing number of intermittent renewables. we believe any such reforms could further improve ercot's risk profile for market participants and enhance the attractiveness of the market. the process is in its early stages, so it is difficult at this time to speculate on what form these reforms might take, though very clearly ercot and the puct are focused on ensuring that texans have reliable electricity going forward, reinforcing the importance of dispatchable resources like vistra's. the most likely potential areas for reform are to the operating reserve demand curve, including reducing the price gap and extending the amount of reserves on the curve and additional ancillary services to incentivize new investment and maintain existing dispatchable generation.
before i turn the call over to jim, i would like to comment briefly on our strategic direction and capital allocation review. as we noted on our business update call in april, the events of uri required us to step back and rethink our strategic direction, enterprise risk and how we allocate capital. the goal is to unlock the value of our company that we strongly believe remains intact as you likely know the events of uri also have set-back the timeline for potential investment grade rating to at least the end of 2022 or at some point in 2023. the strategic review will undoubtedly address our leverage targets in the pursuit of investment grade credit ratings. however, regardless of the direction we take, vistra will always maintain a strong balance sheet that allows us to withstand extreme risk, pursue business opportunities and attract investors. we understand the urgency of this work given where our stock is trading, but we also want to be prudent in our deliberations. we intend to provide more information when we have news to discuss on our longer term strategic direction, no later than our third quarter earnings call in early november.
probably the most important point, is that our deliberations have confirmed our confidence in the long-term value of our business. it is incumbent on us to put together the plan to realize this value and we intend to do so. we believe that our relatively young low cost assets that we are de-risking will play a critical role in the energy transition for the next couple of decades, which when combined with our attractive retail and zero carbon businesses should deliver relatively consistent financial results while generating a substantial amount of free cash flow on an annual basis. at today's stock price, investing in our stock has to be at the top of the list of where to allocate our capital. we look forward to talking more about our strategic direction and how we plan to allocate our significant cash flow in the months ahead.
i will now turn the call over to jim burke.
jim burke -- president and chief financial pfficer
thank you, curt. as shown on slide 10, vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter, with adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations of $825 million. excluding the uri related bill credits in fuel cost adjustments, vistra's adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations was $909 million. results that are comparable to our exceptionally strong second quarter 2020 financial results. period-over- period our retail segment results were $109 million higher than second quarter 2020, driven by the realization of our self-help initiatives in '21. the collective generation segment ended the quarter with $213 million lower than second quarter 2020, driven primarily by lower realized prices in texas after an exceptionally strong 2020 and lower capacity revenues. importantly, the long-term earnings power of this company has not been affected by uri, which was a highly unusual event. in fact, without the impact of uri, we expect we would have been reaffirming our pre-yearly guidance today, which had an adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations midpoint of $3.275 billion. next year, excluding the impact from uri bill credit, we believe we have the ability to deliver adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations in the $3.4 billion range with 60% to 70% conversion to free cash flow before growth.
all of this to say we continue to believe this business will have significant capital to allocate in the years ahead which takes me to slide 11. last week, our board approved our third quarter 2021 dividend of $0.15 or $0.60 on an annual basis, subject to board approval at the appropriate times. we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, so as curt mentioned, we believe we are still a couple of years out from a potential investment grade credit rating. in the second quarter of 2021, we did execute one capital markets transaction issuing $1.25 billion of 4.375% senior unsecured notes due may 1, 2029. we use the proceeds to repay all of the outstanding principal amounts of the $1.25 billion 364 day term loan a that we issued following uri. beyond our priority to maintain a strong balance sheet, we also view our stock as significantly undervalued. we continue to believe that share buybacks at these levels would be one of the most attractive uses of our capital and we will continue to evaluate opportunities to reallocate capital for the remainder of 2021.
last, as we previously discussed, we are also evaluating alternatives to accelerate the pace of our renewable development using lower cost capital. all of these capital allocation tenants are being evaluated in our current review. so please stay tuned for more to come on these topics in the months ahead.
in closing, while winter storm uri was a significant one-time financial hit in the first quarter, our business has been able to get back on track and execute well in the second quarter. and with the recent uptick in forward curves in both pjm and ercot, our forward outlook has only improved, with management expecting that we will be able to deliver strong adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow before growth in '22 and beyond. we believe in the value of this business and our ability to generate significant free cash flow for allocation in the years ahead. in fact, with our long-term view that we will be able to generate $3 billion or more of adjusted ebitda, with 60% to 70% conversion of free cash flow on an annual basis, we could repurchase our entire market cap in roughly five years, if we were to allocate all of this capital to share buybacks. attractive value in our opinion.
our teams are committed to execution. we prioritize operational excellence, low cost operations and disciplined financial management. as always, we are focused on delivering safe and reliable electricity to our customers, while creating value for our stakeholders over the long-term.
with that operator, we are now ready to open the lines for questions.

operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from stephen byrd of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley
hey, good morning, and congratulations on laying out a pretty thoughtful capital allocation approach.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
hey, steven. good morning, good to hear from you.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley
so i wanted to focus on vistra zero and the updated guidance here and you mentioned your prepared remarks, it's fairly capital-light from your perspective as you mentioned $5 billion of total capital needed, but only $500 million in net capital from vistra, and that of project debt, other financing cash flow, etc. could you just elaborate a little bit more on that?
i guess i was thinking, that's a fairly high level of project leverage and we can get that typically when we have contract durations of 2025 years. i thought it might be more challenging to achieve that level of leverage here and what gives you the confidence in sort of such a capital-light approach?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, i'll take the first shot then jim, feel free to jump in. but, so i think we're also looking at a sort of, what i'll call a kickstart upfront tranche of capital, we haven't determined exactly what that tranche will look like, but it will be equity light, let's put it that way. and then when you combine that with leverage, steven, that's more around about 60% type leverage, project leverage with the contracted cash flows. so it's not that we're putting 80% leverage, but i think the other thing that's missing maybe in this is that, the effort that we're pursuing to bring in another tranche of capital in here of some consequence.
and then when we look at the cash flows off of the business and the maintenance expense and things, because it's fairly low for these types of assets, we generate enough cash along with project financing, and this project capital along with our $500 million to basically self-fund the build out of the roughly five gigs through 2026.
so we have looked at this, we feel comfortable with how we're setting it up. clearly, we would like to grow it even further than that, and i expect us to add to the pipeline, whether that's through acquiring projects or potentially even a platform, but just what is line of sight that we have already in the queue. we feel like we can raise sufficient capital and through the cash flows that would be more than adequate to be able to run that business.
jim, anything you want to add?
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
hear, curt, you covered it well, the only thing that i would amplify is that we intend structure the ppas from these assets back to vistra to create the contracted cash flows that gives us the chance then to put 60% to 70% project debt, the balance comes from the 3 sources curt mentioned, the apparent contribution of less than $500 million some form of structured financing our equity and then the cash flows from the projects themselves.
and so, when we think of this as a self-sustaining entity that can grow even faster than we anticipated when we announced this pipeline last summer. and so i think it gives us a way to use more cost-effective capital and still take advantage of the opportunities given the pipeline of great sites that we have.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley
it's really helpful. it makes a lot of sense. and then just on the 5-gigawatt target by year-end 2026. could you just give us your latest thoughts on sort of visibility of growth degree of competition sort of how you see that sort of playing out?
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
yeah. we,
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
so, yeah, go ahead. go ahead, jim.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
sure, sure. thanks, curt.
what we've tried to do here, steven is focus on where we've got a strong place to start, which is sites that we have control over its focus right now is primarily texas, california, and now with coal to solar the illinois flee. we have a few opportunities at a couple other coal plants that we intend to convert but this does not include as curt mentioned, this does not include an expectation of prospecting for a bunch of sites.
we don't have control over or an m&a-type platform. so i think we've got a really good pipeline that we can you set up based on our partnerships. we've got very good partnerships on the solar side and the epc side and our batteries. and so it's really just a matter of taking advantage of this methodically over the next 5 years.
and then in addition to that, i think there's other opportunities that curt mentioned, but this is our focus. not a heavy focus on pjm and iso new england at this point. those are possibilities, but what we've got in front of us is quite a bit.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, justin.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley
great. yes, sir.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
steven, you know we have mass landing site that can take probably up to another thousand megawatts, we have a site called morro bay which is can be up to 700mw. those are both in california. we have a number of sites. we're one of the largest landholders, especially at our sites that have some of the old coal plants in texas.
we obviously know that market quite well and we're partnering in california with the utilities there, and of course, we are in the omnibus energy legislation in illinois, we pursued that for 3 years out of thin air and raise this cold, solar, and battery storage legislation that then was woven into the ultimate omnibus bill.
so i think, we came up with an idea to utilize sites that already have transmission access in many of the areas where the assets were being shut down or were already retired and that's proven to work very well. and i think we have other opportunities down the road.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley
it's a great point. i mean the site value for many of those sites in place like california, illinois, clearly, clearly quite high. so, thanks so much for the color. appreciate it.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim. please go ahead.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
good morning, guys.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
hey, shar.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
just 2-part question on 2023. curt, you indicated you're pretty open still is your fundamental view for more expansion in sparks as we draw closer and directionally, can you just also indicate where ebitda would shake out under the current dynamic?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, for 2023, now? you're talking about.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
yes, please. yep, yep. perfect.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so look, we had a period of time were compressed they've actually come back to what i call a more normalized level. but there's still a fair amount of backwardation in the curve, going from 2022 to 2023. i think our fundamental view which suggests there is still room to move with the curves relative to the fundamental view in 2023.
but the one good thing is that those 2 curves market and in our fundamental view our point of view, have converged significantly. and i think i made in my remarks, but we're now seeing over the next 5 years. ebitda levels that our 3 billion plus even at the curves and prior to that, sure, we were seeing, when you market to the curve below $3 billion. so that has converged significantly in terms of spark spreads.
there's probably some further what i'll call normalization that can occur in 2023 on sparks and so there could be some of that movement. but we've seen a pretty strong move in sparks. but if you take a look at 2022 sparks versus 2023 sparks. there is still about, i'm going to say maybe about $4 difference. and we would expect that to that gap to close, and so there is some upward mobility and our fundamental view shows that in terms of directionally 2022 to 2023. we always say this, but i want to be clear this time, that within the range of being in a very similar ebitda level on and using that illustrative ebitda number. and when i say that, that's plus or minus a couple of $100 million, because an open position can go either way depending on weather. and so, but, we're well within the bounds of where we are in 2022 for 2023 and i would say, directionally, when we look at the distribution of outcomes, probably with a greater probability of upside versus downside just knowing where the curves are where our fundamental view is and knowing that our commercial team is able to take advantage of when the curves are in our at this point of view or better.
so, i feel good about 2023 i think directionally, it's in that range and now we have to go out and execute and capture that value well.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
at least at a minimum, the reality and versus your views are starting to align which is what you've been pitching for a while, so that's good to see that, and then,
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
it is.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
the $4 billion in additional buybacks is predicated obviously on your view of the stock value, right? any guidance here on what you see heard as something of a more sustainable free cash flow yield?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
well, yeah, that's a, man, that's, i wish i had the crystal ball and but look, i think what i would hope to see especially with this capital allocation plan. and with our execution is something that is much more in the mid-teens and going down into the low-double digits.
i think that we certainly weren't out when i understand that there was a major event in february and you know this, as well as i do that, any kind of return is part of that is the anticipated risk of the business and i think that exposed some risk, but i think once we show how we have invested in our business, we've reduced the risk significantly and we're able to execute, i would expect that risk premium to come down.
and then i also believe that people are beginning to realize that a combination of renewables, batteries, and low heat rate very efficient fossil fuel mainly gas plants is really going to be the right mix of assets going into the next 15 to 20 years, because you're going to need dispatchable resources for reliability purposes. the market is going to have to pay for those.
clearly, we're going to need to have clean a green resources going forward and battery storage is going to be a big piece to that. i think that's what our company is lining up with and then we've got this large retail business that i think people don't think about that we can contract much of our renewable and battery business with, that also has a very consistent and significant margins and we expect that to continue as well.
so we feel like we're lined up. if we can execute. then we would expect that the risk premium that is a function of both a perceived risk in the business model, which i think we are closing, but also the terminal value question. we believe that we have a company that's here for a long period of time, we should see that that risk premium come down and commensurately we ought to see a much lower free cash flow yield, which in turn as you know, means a higher and stronger stock price.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
right, got it. and then just lastly from me, are you having any coal or sort of material supply challenges with the sunset fleet?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, we are, we are, if you take 2021's outcome and you take the $500 million securitization, you back it off, you'll notice that we were a little bit under. and a big chunk of that more than half of it is the challenges we've had at the segment, not just cole constraints. but also we had some outages that were this year that came about, what i would call though our coal constraints mainly as an opportunity lost more than anything else.
i'll tell you why we have been prioritizing building coal inventory for the winter because the price curves are saying that it's much more economic to run in q1 of 2022 than it is in q4 of 2021 and if you think of it, we have a finite amount of coal, because of the supply constraints. we're going to have to optimize between q4 2021 and q1 of 2022 we have opted to run a little bit less in q4 of 2021 to conserve and preserve the amount of coal we have so that we are going to be there for q1 of 2022 because the price curves are telling us that's where it's most economic and that's what we intend to do.
the other thing i'd tell you is that i'm still a little bit concerned about making sure that the entire grid in texas is weatherized including the gas system for this particular winter and so we want to be very cautious. we're going to go into that carrying more length because of that and we want to make sure that we don't have any hiccups. and then just the broader energy commodity complex as you know is quite volatile.
and so because of that, we're taking a very, very conservative approach going into q1 and that means trying to conserve some of our coal to make sure that, yeah, we can run in q1 of 2022.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
got it. appreciate it guys. i'll jump back in the queue it's refreshing seeing these results.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
thank you.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
thanks guys. bye.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
and the next question today comes from julien dumoulin smith of bank of america, please go ahead.
julien dumoulin smith -- bank of america
hey, good morning, team well done, truly, listen, i wanted to follow up a couple of easy questions if i can just start, first off, in terms of the buyback itself here, any thoughts about a tender versus other mechanisms to execute here? obviously, a lot to buy at hand. and then separately related to on the 3 ebitda, just i'll throw it out there quickly. so i mean no questions here, i mean how are you thinking about that relative to 22 levels?
i know you said it's better than 3. but what about better than 22? if i could ask you in that way.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
hey, jim, do you want to take the first one around? buyback, what we're looking at around buybacks and then we can -- and then if you want to establish the second one, that's fine. and i can add to it. go ahead.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
sure. good morning, julian. thanks. thanks for the questions. so on the buyback, we have, we are looking at a number of alternatives, we have not settled on the method that we're going to use hopefully coming out of this earnings call will be very aggressive with the buyback program in order to be able to implement the 2 billion by the end of 2022.
we don't intend to telegraph how we're going to buy when we're going to buy, but we will report each quarter. how we have, how we've effectuated the number of shares that we've purchased, but it is a meaningful percentage as you note of what's outstanding, not only for the program through 22 but through 26. the other question, as we think about 23 and i think it's curt, there could be mentioned we have a large open position in 23 relative to 22 and that can work obviously to create an overperformance opportunity or come in slightly under and we've seen the curves, continue to rise.
and i think the commercial team has done a very nice job looking at our point of view and trying to figure out when to put the positions on to be able to manage the expectation, i think as curt said 3 was much lower, you saw that with forward curves in the past, particularly this time last year. that gap has closed considerably. it hasn't fully closed and you see that even in our charts and in the slides that we presented for the spark spreads. so we think 23 has a very good chance of being in line with 22 but there is still room for the curves to move and we still have a large open position.
so, we've talked about a 3 plus billion business on a run-rate basis and i think the fact is that there is going to be a range around these outcomes. we are in a competitive segment are benefited by having a large retail position that can work almost in a counter-cyclical manner to the wholesale position at times, but we still have some variation around it as the markets have shown some volatility, believe you that is something we can capture.
so i think looking at a more in-line is where we would expect to be, but we still have a ways to go from 23 given that there is still some backwardation relative to 22.
julien dumoulin smith -- bank of america
okay, got it. so ways to go as in uncertainty or did, still a little bit below?
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
i know well, i think, julien, the way i would describe it...
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
i think it's...
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
it has... go ahead, curt.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
no, no, no, go ahead, jim. sorry.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
no, i would say you have if you're simply and this is that this is the struggle that we talk about because we have a point of view on the business that has consistently shown that the market curves begin to approach as we get toward the prompt year, so if all you do is look at where curves today and you just look at it and say lock all that end, it's going to be lower than 22. i mean that's just math, that's not how we run our business. we run our business based on where we think it makes sense to put positions on and where we think curves would likely end up given supply, demand characteristics in the q that comes in, for new build, etcetera. and so when we look at it over that basis. we feel that 2023 has a very good chance to be right in line with 2022, but that's just not where the curves are at the moment, and we don't, that does not concern us. we've been in the spot before and we, it's happened for 2022. it's happened in previous years and so we anticipate it will likely happen again in 2023.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah...
julien dumoulin smith -- bank of america
got it.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
so, julien, i think that's why we say and we're not trying to be evasive here at all, it's just that when you're this far out, and the curves are still backward dated and we've seen every year that when you get into the summer and come out of the summer. the next summer and the winners tend to begin to move up and we expect that from our fundamental view, marketing something just to a current curve will give you one result, marketing something to our fundamental view will give you a different result.
we think those, but the good news is this time around, that those two things are still within the range of 2022 for 2023. in the past, the curves and you brought this up before, in the past, the curves were well below the $3 billion mark, and now those the curves in the fundamental view our have converged but there is still some room to move.
so i like to think about it, there is a distribution around 2023 but clearly, the 2022 ebitda midpoint on a lesser basis is within that distribution. and so we think there is a good chance that we can come in around where 2022 levels are for 2023. that's going to come down to execution and being ready when the curves are ripe and our team, that's what we do. that's what we get paid to do.
so we feel pretty good about going into 2022. we clearly feel good about it being 3 billion plus and being plus $3 billion, where it will land in terms of 20 -- in terms of 2022 for 2023. we're going to be within spitting distance of 2023 i think we have a good chance of hitting it, and we could actually even exceed it so that distribution, i think is favorable. it's now about execution and getting opportunities.
julien dumoulin smith -- bank of america
wow, thank you, team. so for an easy question here, and certainly not evasive at all. now let me ask you for a more detailed question then, on this vistra zero side of the equation, you talked about $450 million to $500 million of adjusted ebitda. how much capex are you thinking needs to get invested to get that outcome here?
and just to be clear, it sounds like none of that would be paid at least prospectively by the corporate capital. it would all be funded with various other project and segment-specific sources as well. i know that this is an update that's coming, but it sound... i just want to make sure if i'm capturing this holistically correctly.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
yeah, i think it's in the $5 billion to $5.5 billion range of total capital that would have to be invested and then you are right, the amount of equity capital that we would be putting in, is relatively low, although we're putting in some, obviously putting in some projects into that as well. that have value on the market, but yeah, i think it's $5 billion to $5.5 billion of our member right that we would have to invest and we obviously have plans for how we would do that.
julien dumoulin smith -- bank of america
in that contribution, principally just your existing storage right? i, without being too specific of...
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
well, yeah. i think i've mentioned it's moss landing it's more a bay, it's our oakland site in california. it's, what is it nine sites in illinois, that would have batteries or something like that. it's batteries in texas, we have one that's 265-megawatt one-hour battery coming on in texas, we have a 10 megawatt already on, but that's what the battery storage picture looks like.
then, of course, we're predominantly a solar on the renewable side, we have found wind to be economic, we're not an offshore wind person yet. so, and i don't expect us to be that, but we're not afraid of wind is just that we haven't found the opportunity for that, but that's, those are the primary projects ff course, there is a lot of solar both in texas and in illinois.
julien dumoulin smith -- bank of america
guys, really appreciate the detail there.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from steve fleishman at wolfe research. please go ahead.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research
hey, good morning. hey, curt. so just wanted to just, the nrg issues yesterday, called some -- you discuss some, well, i guess, also the texas ancillary costs and coal treatment, etc. how do you feel like those are embedded in your outlook and obviously your asset position is different, but just want to kind of clarify that you're ok on those issues?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, so in jim, you can jump in after this. but so, over half of -- let's just put this way, about $40 million in 2021, it was, is the effect of coal constraints. and so just so we've captured that, that's in our updated guidance and we capture that. i think i've mentioned, we decided to build inventory for q1 because the economics are more compelling to be ready for q1. and so, we have created this constraint in q4 of 2021 is in favor of q1 of 2022, everything is, any constraints that we have going into 2022 is already built into our guidance.
so there is nothing there's nothing more to talk about there, we expect, given what we're doing in q4 of 2021 in favor of q1 of 22 will actually allow us to run where we want to, in q1 of 22. i think you know this too that some of our, some of our plants, two of them in pjm in ohio or not on prb, a lot of these constraints are coming out of the prb. and on the rails from the prb.
and then of course oak grove mines its own coal. so we don't have those limitations there and then many of our other peers. we just don't have a lot of ebitda coming from like the illinois plants. and so the constraints just aren't as big for us and i think the other thing is our team got way out in front. i, just came to me more than a couple of months ago that we were concerned about this. and so we've been managing toward that and we've been working with the burlington northern folks, i've talked to their leadership team about getting more trains, so that we can get them in and they're doing the best they can, i know it's important for this winter in texas.
so all in all, i think we're really kind of took a, what i call a $40 million opportunity loss in q4, but we're also going to have more inventory for q1 or 22 and all of that's baked in both of our guidance ranges.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research
okay. i'm sorry how about...
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
go ahead, and the ancillaries...
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
did you ask about ancillaries, steve? can you hear us?
steve fleishman -- wolfe research
yes, that was a big part of the issue they had too, yeah.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. we have, that's also ours is just much lower. and jim, you might want to add to this, but our effect, we have ancillary the effects of ancillaries baked into our numbers. jim, do you want to add to that specifics?
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
sure. yeah, i, we do. it's baked into our plan. we view the ancillary costs similar to the other cost that any retailer would face, you've got to look at it. dear price and you've got it ultimately reflect it with the customers we have that built into our plan for 2022 and beyond. and of course, we do have, as you mentioned, steve, a different position having some generation assets as well.
so, but the integrated effect and the effect on retail is slowly reflected in our plan.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research
great. and then just on the renewables plan, how are you going to deal with the texas sites in terms of historically, you were looking at developing those as merchant but obviously you can't project finance that. so are you going to do ppas with vistra retail or with 3rd parties what's your strategy on the texas renewables?
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
yeah, it could be both steve, but i think most of it, we're looking at right now is, can be different in the future is back with our retail and that's actually we have a, we have an entity that lives between our wholesale and retail group that manages the supply book but advantages in supply for our retail business and they, they buy and they sell to 3rd-party retailers as well as to our own retail business.
they are the one that will ultimately end up contracting and then they will then supply our retail book as well as other retailers, but that's where it's really sort of back-to-back with our retail arm. and so that's where those contracts will be set up.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research
great, thank you very much.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from durgesh chopra with evercore isi. please go ahead.
durgesh chopra -- evercore is
hey, good morning, team. thank you for taking my question. i have a clarification and a follow-up. this, the 500 million prospective ebitda from the vistra zero platform. just to be clear, as you're thinking about the structured financing or equity for those projects. that, that ends up diluting that $500 million. right. that $500 million is the gross number. then what's vistra share is going to be lower, depending on what finance that you choose? am i thinking about the right way or not?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. you are. but let me just put this way, we will own 100% of the common equity of this entity. so just to be very clear about it. that capital tranche that we're looking at, we haven't decided exactly what to look like, but we will, we will own 100% of the common equity of that business and so you can sort of figure out what kind of, what kind of tranches that could be, but we're not looking to sell and partner with the equity ownership of that i think there are other ways to do what we want to do and maintain our control. jim, anything you want to add?
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
yes, i think the way you're thinking about it is correct what curt mentioned is an ebitda number and so we would expect that we would have some interest expense because we're going to be doing the project financing in any other sort of 3rd-party capital charges that we would have. so we have some ongoing cost of that capital, which we believe to be more cost-effective than our own.
and then over time, we have some amortization of the project debt, the project level debt that we would take on. so that's not meant to be a free cash flow number if that's, i think was getting into the nature of your question, it is an ebitda number. and, as curt mentioned, our goal is to maintain a 100% equity control so that from a terminal value standpoint, we're building a business of $500 million on a 5-year basis, we can get the $500 million and have long-dated long assets very esg friendly asset portfolio that's grown rapidly and use 3rd-party capital more cost-effective capital to do it.
so there will be some distributions out of that ebitda to pay for that, but we think that's more cost-effective than doing it all on balance sheet.
durgesh chopra -- evercore is
got it, that's super helpful. yeah. i was really interested in whether it's going to be 100% owned by you and it sounds like it will be. okay, second question, in terms of that 3 plus billion ebitda number you mentioned coal retirements among other thing that kind of gives you opportunity to get to that 5 gigawatt zero platform number, is that degradation to that base 3 billion ebitda as you ramp up on the vistra zero your platform?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
well, in, we break, if you break. yeah, if you break these things and jim you. but if you break them out right and say ok let's isolate what impact that we have from our closing or retiring of our coal fleet. yeah, there is some slight degradation and ebitda from that, i will say that there is very little coming from these assets and the value of these assets have been written down to zero on the books.
so they're just not economically not contributing a lot and certainly not on an ebitda basis. what we are seeing though is that effect is more than offset by over time as we invest in the vistra zero platform. so we're able to actually ultimately grow ebitda over time as we invest and so we do see an increasing ebitda profile when we project that out.
so while they do if you isolate if they do have a negative effect on ebitda, meaning the retired coal plants, the other projects that are coming on, more than offset that, jim. go ahead, i'm sorry, i didn't mean to interrupt.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
no, no. curt, no. curt, you -- you covered it well and there is a that nearly 8000 megawatts of slated retirements. we obviously have 2 large facilities in texas that do not have anticipated retirement dates, but the ebitda contribution of that nearly 8000 has come down through time and it is not material on the go forward horizon, but it's something that we are built if we built into our plan and that's the whole point of transitioning this fleet is to be able to put new long-lived high margin assets with the vistra zero to more than overcome that so that we have a growing ebitda profile through time.
durgesh chopra -- evercore is
got it. thanks, guys. net-net, it sounds like you're biased higher in on the 3 plus billion ebitda prospectively, right? like counting in the ground incident. okay. thank you, guys.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
yes. yeah.

",0.7584,2021-11-05 08:00:00,"prepared remarks:
operator
good morning, and welcome to the vistra 3rd quarter's results only one earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to molly sorg from investor relations. please go ahead, ma'am.
molly sorg -- investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to vistra 3rd quarter 2021 results conference call. which is being broadcast live from the investor relations section of our website at www.vistra corp.com. also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our form 10-q, and the related press release.
joining me for today's call are curt morgan, chief executive officer, and jim burke, president, and chief financial officer. we have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. before we begin our presentation, i encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website, that explain the risks of forward-looking statements.
the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-gaap financial measures. today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied.
we assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. further today's press release, slide presentation, and discussions on this call will include certain non-gaap financial measures. for such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation, i will now turn the call over to curt morgan to kick off our discussion.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
thank you, molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. as always, we appreciate your interest in vistra. while we have a lot to cover today, we will do our best to be as piffy as possible to leave sufficient time for q&a. and not only will we be discussing our 3rd quarter and year-to-date financial results, but we are also initiating our 2022 guidance as is customary on our 3rd quarter results call. and most importantly we are laying out additional details of our long-term capital allocation plan, which i am excited to share with you. so let's get started.
it's hard to believe, we are still in the same year, where we experienced the significant effects from winter storm, yuri. i'm proud of how our company has recovered from a business standpoint, and we are beginning to execute on our strategic priorities, which are a product of a thorough review with the board, that have begun prior to yuri but accelerated greatly immediately on the heels of the storm, we will discuss these priorities in more detail later.
consistent with the bounce-back of our business, slide 6 reports are strong 3rd quarter financial results. despite a weak texas summer, we're vistra delivered adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations of $1.177 billion or $1.167 billion, excluding the impacts from winter storm yuri realized in the 3rd quarter, which included a small positive impact from ercot's 180-day resettlement statements.
as of september 30, vistra has already achieved approximately 85% of the $500 million self-help target we announced following yuri, and all of that done without really impacting any future periods. and we have a clear line of sight to achieving the balance in the 4th quarter. the combination of our solid execution on these self-help initiatives together with the inclusion of the approximately $500 million of proceeds.
we expect to realize from ercot securitization of certain charges allocated to load-serving entities during yuri. we are in a position today to both narrow and raise our 2021 ongoing operations adjusted ebitda guidance range. as shown on the slide, the securitization and self-help materially offset the more than $2 billion loss from yuri such as the retail bill credits, we will discuss later, as you likely recall internal and 3rd-party analysis has shown that vistra is yuri loss was driven predominantly by the uncontrollable failure of the texas intrastate gas system.
we are also narrowing and revising our ongoing operations, adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance which is similarly reflected on slide 6. the cash flow associated with securitization is expected to be received in the first half of 2022. consequently, the cash impact of securitization is reflected in our 2022 guidance on the next slide. so turning to slide 7, vistra is initiating its 2022 guidance today forecasting ongoing operations adjusted ebitda in the range of $2.81 billion -$3.31 billion with ongoing operations, adjusted free cash flow before growth in the range of $2.07 to $2.57 billion.
this represents a free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 76%, which is higher than our historical conversion ratio due to the anticipated receipt of the securitization proceeds in the first half of 2022. on slide 7, we also offer an illustrative view of vistra's 2022 guidance ranges, which exclude winter storm yuri related bill credits of approximately $185 million and also the negative in year impact from the execution of npv positive long-dated contracts with retail customers of approximately $55 million and the $500 million of securitization proceeds in free cash flow before growth only.
we believe this illustrative view is the best way to think about vistra's future financial performance potential as it demonstrates the long-term earnings power and cash generation of the business. notably, the adverse impact from the bill credits in 2022 guidance are more than offset by the securitization, included in the 2021 updated guidance. in fact, securitization will likely more than offset the retail bill credits across all years.
looking beyond 2022, vistra's long-term view of our earnings power remains robust. the company is less hedged in 2023 and beyond, which affords an even greater opportunity to capture momentum from the rising curves, we have observed in recent months. in fact, we have seen a move up in both gas and heat rate in ercot as the gap between market and our fundamental view converge, which we have similarly seen in the last several years.
in fact, this conversions has resulted in projected results using market curves for the next several years in line with our stated view that we can generate consistent ebitda of $3 billion or greater. previously, the out years using steeply backward dated market curves were below $3 billion. this leaves us in a stronger position to optimize our ebitda within the $3 billion or greater ebitda range, especially as we add our growth investments.
we continue to remain confident in the ability of this business to earn significant cash flow on an annual basis and we intend to return a majority of that cash flow to our financial stakeholders in the years ahead. as i will outline on the next few slides.
slide 8 sets forth the four key priorities that our recent strategic review identified. we believe the best way to unlock the value inherent in this business and maximize value for our financial stakeholders is to drive long-term sustainable value through our integrated business model, which has been strengthened following yuri through various investments in our fleet and fuel supply as well as our enhanced risk management practices return a significant amount of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and a meaningful dividend program especially for as long as our stock remains at what we believe is such a meaningful discount to its fundamental value.
and if our stock responds, we will continue to return that capital in the most optimal way to our shareholders, the key is that we generate substantial capital year-over-year and we intend to return a significant amount to our shareholders. also, we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet. and last but not least, accelerate our vistra's zero growth pipeline with cost-effective capital.
as we set forth on the next slide, our long-term capital allocation plan reflects these strategic priorities, vistra's long-term capital allocation plan reflects an anticipated return of capital of at least $7.5 billion to its common stockholders through year-end 2026 while simultaneously reducing our corporate level leverage and accelerating our vistra's zero growth pipeline. specifically, as we announced in october, our board recently approved a $2 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to fully execute by year-end 2022. the share repurchase program is partially funded by the $1 billion of 8% preferred equity we issued last month. we then expect we will allocate approximately $1 billion per year toward share repurchases from 2023 through 2026 for a total of $6 billion in 5 years. and again, if our stock responds we will reallocate those funds back to our shareholders in some other cost-effective manner.
the $6 billion of return of capital represents more than 60% of our current market cap. this significant amount of capital allocated to share repurchases is evidence of both management and the board's conviction of the long-term earnings power of the business juxtaposed with what we believe is a significant under-valuation of our stock, we will expect, we will continue to prioritize share repurchases along as we believe our stock is undervalued.
and let me tell you, in my view, we have a long way to go. we are also reinforcing our commitment to paying a meaningful and growing dividend rather than identifying a target annual growth rate for our dividend, management expects that it will subject to board approval at the appropriate time allocate $300 million per year toward its common dividend.
as we retire more and more of our shares over time, this $300 million dividend pool will be spread over fewer shares and will offer potentially outsized growth on the remaining shares, for example, if we were to execute all $6 billion worth of the share repurchases at our recent stock price, our annualized dividend per share would grow by more than 100% by year-end 2026.
and our current share price, these share repurchases, and dividend programs are projected to result in an annual average cash yield on the stock of an attractive 15%, as always, we are also committed to a strong balance sheet, we expect we will retire another approximately $1.5 billion of corporate level debt by the end of next year and up to $3 billion by 2026 with projections of debt to ebitda in the mid to high twos during this timeframe for the vistra base business.
for our previous comments, we expect to combine project financing with renewable-related preferred equity and cash flows from existing renewable projects to cost effectively develop our current nearly five gigawatt renewable and battery pipeline over the next 5 years. using only $500 million of our own capital, and that is $500 million on a cumulative basis over the 5-year period, a significantly lower estimate than our previous expectation of spending approximately $500 million per year on growth capital.
these funds can now be used to support other capital allocation priorities especially share repurchases. it is important to note that vistra's zero will be a highly contracted business with 3rd party and internal ppas. so the leverage ratios will be commensurate with similarly situated businesses. slide 10, outlines the sources and uses for the long-term capital allocation plan that i just laid out.
importantly, we expect we will be able to execute on this capital allocation plan by growing our vistra's zero renewable and battery storage portfolio to a more than five gigawatt business generating approximately $450 to $500 million of adjusted ebitda annually by year-end 2026. we are excited about this long-term capital allocation plan and believe strongly that it is the best way to maximize the value of our business as we expect we will return the majority of our free cash flow from our base business to our financial stakeholders, while being mindful of our overall leverage levels and cost effectively accelerating our renewables and battery storage growth pipeline, which should ultimately be valued at a higher multiple over time.
using the midpoint of the vistra zero ebitda of $475 million by 2026 and a 14 times multiple would result in a total value of $6.65 billion for these projects. as i mentioned earlier, the strategic review we undertook was thorough evaluating multiple scenarios and potential paths to unlock shareholder value. ultimately, we believe the path we have outlined here today will be the path that will result in the greatest financial reward over time, taking into account risk of execution, cost-effectiveness in economies of scale.
with that, i will now turn the call over to jim burke, to discuss our financial results in more detail, jim.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
thank you, curt, as shown on slide 12, vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter with adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations of $1.177 billion results that are comparable to our 3rd quarter 2020 financial results, period over period our retail segment results were $205 million higher than 3rd quarter 2020 driven by the realization of our self-help initiatives and the lower cost of goods sold in 2021.
the collective generation segments ended the quarter, $211 million lower than 3rd quarter 2020 driven primarily by the lower realized energy margin in texas, east, and sunset after a very strong 2020. turning now to slide 13, we wanted to briefly touch on the momentum we have seen in spark spreads across the markets where we operate.
since september, we've seen a dramatic rise in commodity pricing across the board. as gas prices, power prices, and spark spreads are all climbing higher for 2022 and beyond. this is true in all the markets where we operate. though, we highlight our 2 largest markets ercot and pjm on the slide. as a general rule, vistra as the company that benefits from higher natural gas price environment as gas units are typically the marginal unit setting the price of power leading to higher overall power prices.
we expect this will benefit us in the outer years where we are less hedged. as of october 31, vistra is now 27% and 50% hedged in ercot and pjm respectively for 2023, we are hedged at relatively similar levels in new york, new england, kiso and miso as we have taken advantage of the increase. an outright power prices in spark spreads over the last couple of months, which are rising more in line with our fundamental point of view, we expect our commercial team will continue to take advantage of commodity pricing volatility working to position our integrated operations to earn in a relatively stable earnings profile over time.
i'm turning now to slide 14, which provides a more detailed breakdown of our 2022 financial guidance. we believe the illustrative guidance in the range of $3.05 to $3.55 billion adding back the impact of the euro-related bill credits and the year one impact of various npv positive long-dated retail contracts is the best way to think about the long-term earnings power of this business.
we continue to believe that vistra will be able to convert a majority of its adjusted ebitda to adjusted free cash flow before growth. similarly, our guidance for ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth includes the anticipated receipt of securitization proceeds in addition to the other yuri impacts such as bill credits.
so our illustrative guidance removes these for a more normalized view of adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow before growth, a strong conversion percentage as shown on the slide enables the significant return of capital that curt discussed, while also supporting a strong balance sheet and the transformation of our fleet with our vistra's zero pipelines.
before we close this morning, i wanted to briefly address our long-term leverage target in pursuit of investment-grade credit ratings, which i know has been a strategic question for many of you following yuri. foundationally a strong balance sheet is core to vistra's strategy, our low leverage level proved critical during yuri as our financial strength supported our ability to quickly add more than $2 billion of debt in response to the storm.
as outlined on slide 15, we believe our current leverage in the range of approximately 3 to 3.5 times net debt to adjusted ebitda is a leverage level that will afford us the same level of financial strength, we believe we will be able to maintain our leverage in this range in the near term and reach the mid to high twos over the next 5 years.
we also believe that we would still be a candidate for investment-grade credit ratings in the future as our corporate leverage drops below 3 times and any project financing will relate to a lower risk contracted part of the business. though as we've said recently, we believe this opportunity is at least a few years in the future.
in closing, as i hope you can see from the long-term capital allocation plan we laid out today, we believe in the value of this business and our ability to generate significant free cash flow for allocation in the years ahead. by prioritizing returning the majority of our capital to our financial stakeholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet and pursuing accelerated growth of our vistra's zero portfolio, we believe that we will unlock the value of our business over time.
with that, operator, we're now ready to open the lines for questions.

operator
thank you. we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [operator instructions] today's first question comes from stephen byrd of morgan stanley. please go ahead.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley
hey, good morning, and congratulations on laying out a pretty thoughtful capital allocation approach.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
hey, steven. good morning, good to hear from you.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley
so i wanted to focus on vistra zero and the updated guidance here and you mentioned your prepared remarks, it's fairly capital-light from your perspective as you mentioned $5 billion of total capital needed, but only $500 million in net capital from vistra, and that of project debt, other financing cash flow, etc. could you just elaborate a little bit more on that?
i guess i was thinking, that's a fairly high level of project leverage and we can get that typically when we have contract durations of 2025 years. i thought it might be more challenging to achieve that level of leverage here and what gives you the confidence in sort of such a capital-light approach?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so, i'll take the first shot then jim, feel free to jump in. but, so i think we're also looking at a sort of, what i'll call a kickstart upfront tranche of capital, we haven't determined exactly what that tranche will look like, but it will be equity light, let's put it that way. and then when you combine that with leverage, steven, that's more around about 60% type leverage, project leverage with the contracted cash flows. so it's not that we're putting 80% leverage, but i think the other thing that's missing maybe in this is that, the effort that we're pursuing to bring in another tranche of capital in here of some consequence.
and then when we look at the cash flows off of the business and the maintenance expense and things, because it's fairly low for these types of assets, we generate enough cash along with project financing, and this project capital along with our $500 million to basically self-fund the build out of the roughly five gigs through 2026.
so we have looked at this, we feel comfortable with how we're setting it up. clearly, we would like to grow it even further than that, and i expect us to add to the pipeline, whether that's through acquiring projects or potentially even a platform, but just what is line of sight that we have already in the queue. we feel like we can raise sufficient capital and through the cash flows that would be more than adequate to be able to run that business.
jim, anything you want to add?
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
hear, curt, you covered it well, the only thing that i would amplify is that we intend structure the ppas from these assets back to vistra to create the contracted cash flows that gives us the chance then to put 60% to 70% project debt, the balance comes from the 3 sources curt mentioned, the apparent contribution of less than $500 million some form of structured financing our equity and then the cash flows from the projects themselves.
and so, when we think of this as a self-sustaining entity that can grow even faster than we anticipated when we announced this pipeline last summer. and so i think it gives us a way to use more cost-effective capital and still take advantage of the opportunities given the pipeline of great sites that we have.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley
it's really helpful. it makes a lot of sense. and then just on the 5-gigawatt target by year-end 2026. could you just give us your latest thoughts on sort of visibility of growth degree of competition sort of how you see that sort of playing out?
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
yeah. we,
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
so, yeah, go ahead. go ahead, jim.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
sure, sure. thanks, curt.
what we've tried to do here, steven is focus on where we've got a strong place to start, which is sites that we have control over its focus right now is primarily texas, california, and now with coal to solar the illinois flee. we have a few opportunities at a couple other coal plants that we intend to convert but this does not include as curt mentioned, this does not include an expectation of prospecting for a bunch of sites.
we don't have control over or an m&a-type platform. so i think we've got a really good pipeline that we can you set up based on our partnerships. we've got very good partnerships on the solar side and the epc side and our batteries. and so it's really just a matter of taking advantage of this methodically over the next 5 years.
and then in addition to that, i think there's other opportunities that curt mentioned, but this is our focus. not a heavy focus on pjm and iso new england at this point. those are possibilities, but what we've got in front of us is quite a bit.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, justin.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley
great. yes, sir.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
steven, you know we have mass landing site that can take probably up to another thousand megawatts, we have a site called morro bay which is can be up to 700mw. those are both in california. we have a number of sites. we're one of the largest landholders, especially at our sites that have some of the old coal plants in texas.
we obviously know that market quite well and we're partnering in california with the utilities there, and of course, we are in the omnibus energy legislation in illinois, we pursued that for 3 years out of thin air and raise this cold, solar, and battery storage legislation that then was woven into the ultimate omnibus bill.
so i think, we came up with an idea to utilize sites that already have transmission access in many of the areas where the assets were being shut down or were already retired and that's proven to work very well. and i think we have other opportunities down the road.
stephen byrd -- morgan stanley
it's a great point. i mean the site value for many of those sites in place like california, illinois, clearly, clearly quite high. so, thanks so much for the color. appreciate it.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from shar pourreza with guggenheim. please go ahead.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
good morning, guys.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
hey, shar.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
just 2-part question on 2023. curt, you indicated you're pretty open still is your fundamental view for more expansion in sparks as we draw closer and directionally, can you just also indicate where ebitda would shake out under the current dynamic?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, for 2023, now? you're talking about.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
yes, please. yep, yep. perfect.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. so look, we had a period of time were compressed they've actually come back to what i call a more normalized level. but there's still a fair amount of backwardation in the curve, going from 2022 to 2023. i think our fundamental view which suggests there is still room to move with the curves relative to the fundamental view in 2023.
but the one good thing is that those 2 curves market and in our fundamental view our point of view, have converged significantly. and i think i made in my remarks, but we're now seeing over the next 5 years. ebitda levels that our 3 billion plus even at the curves and prior to that, sure, we were seeing, when you market to the curve below $3 billion. so that has converged significantly in terms of spark spreads.
there's probably some further what i'll call normalization that can occur in 2023 on sparks and so there could be some of that movement. but we've seen a pretty strong move in sparks. but if you take a look at 2022 sparks versus 2023 sparks. there is still about, i'm going to say maybe about $4 difference. and we would expect that to that gap to close, and so there is some upward mobility and our fundamental view shows that in terms of directionally 2022 to 2023. we always say this, but i want to be clear this time, that within the range of being in a very similar ebitda level on and using that illustrative ebitda number. and when i say that, that's plus or minus a couple of $100 million, because an open position can go either way depending on weather. and so, but, we're well within the bounds of where we are in 2022 for 2023 and i would say, directionally, when we look at the distribution of outcomes, probably with a greater probability of upside versus downside just knowing where the curves are where our fundamental view is and knowing that our commercial team is able to take advantage of when the curves are in our at this point of view or better.
so, i feel good about 2023 i think directionally, it's in that range and now we have to go out and execute and capture that value well.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
at least at a minimum, the reality and versus your views are starting to align which is what you've been pitching for a while, so that's good to see that, and then,
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
it is.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
the $4 billion in additional buybacks is predicated obviously on your view of the stock value, right? any guidance here on what you see heard as something of a more sustainable free cash flow yield?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
well, yeah, that's a, man, that's, i wish i had the crystal ball and but look, i think what i would hope to see especially with this capital allocation plan. and with our execution is something that is much more in the mid-teens and going down into the low-double digits.
i think that we certainly weren't out when i understand that there was a major event in february and you know this, as well as i do that, any kind of return is part of that is the anticipated risk of the business and i think that exposed some risk, but i think once we show how we have invested in our business, we've reduced the risk significantly and we're able to execute, i would expect that risk premium to come down.
and then i also believe that people are beginning to realize that a combination of renewables, batteries, and low heat rate very efficient fossil fuel mainly gas plants is really going to be the right mix of assets going into the next 15 to 20 years, because you're going to need dispatchable resources for reliability purposes. the market is going to have to pay for those.
clearly, we're going to need to have clean a green resources going forward and battery storage is going to be a big piece to that. i think that's what our company is lining up with and then we've got this large retail business that i think people don't think about that we can contract much of our renewable and battery business with, that also has a very consistent and significant margins and we expect that to continue as well.
so we feel like we're lined up. if we can execute. then we would expect that the risk premium that is a function of both a perceived risk in the business model, which i think we are closing, but also the terminal value question. we believe that we have a company that's here for a long period of time, we should see that that risk premium come down and commensurately we ought to see a much lower free cash flow yield, which in turn as you know, means a higher and stronger stock price.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
right, got it. and then just lastly from me, are you having any coal or sort of material supply challenges with the sunset fleet?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah, we are, we are, if you take 2021's outcome and you take the $500 million securitization, you back it off, you'll notice that we were a little bit under. and a big chunk of that more than half of it is the challenges we've had at the segment, not just cole constraints. but also we had some outages that were this year that came about, what i would call though our coal constraints mainly as an opportunity lost more than anything else.
i'll tell you why we have been prioritizing building coal inventory for the winter because the price curves are saying that it's much more economic to run in q1 of 2022 than it is in q4 of 2021 and if you think of it, we have a finite amount of coal, because of the supply constraints. we're going to have to optimize between q4 2021 and q1 of 2022 we have opted to run a little bit less in q4 of 2021 to conserve and preserve the amount of coal we have so that we are going to be there for q1 of 2022 because the price curves are telling us that's where it's most economic and that's what we intend to do.
the other thing i'd tell you is that i'm still a little bit concerned about making sure that the entire grid in texas is weatherized including the gas system for this particular winter and so we want to be very cautious. we're going to go into that carrying more length because of that and we want to make sure that we don't have any hiccups. and then just the broader energy commodity complex as you know is quite volatile.
and so because of that, we're taking a very, very conservative approach going into q1 and that means trying to conserve some of our coal to make sure that, yeah, we can run in q1 of 2022.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
got it. appreciate it guys. i'll jump back in the queue it's refreshing seeing these results.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
thank you.
shar pourreza -- guggenheim
thanks guys. bye.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
and the next question today comes from julien dumoulin smith of bank of america, please go ahead.
julien dumoulin smith -- bank of america
hey, good morning, team well done, truly, listen, i wanted to follow up a couple of easy questions if i can just start, first off, in terms of the buyback itself here, any thoughts about a tender versus other mechanisms to execute here? obviously, a lot to buy at hand. and then separately related to on the 3 ebitda, just i'll throw it out there quickly. so i mean no questions here, i mean how are you thinking about that relative to 22 levels?
i know you said it's better than 3. but what about better than 22? if i could ask you in that way.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
hey, jim, do you want to take the first one around? buyback, what we're looking at around buybacks and then we can -- and then if you want to establish the second one, that's fine. and i can add to it. go ahead.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
sure. good morning, julian. thanks. thanks for the questions. so on the buyback, we have, we are looking at a number of alternatives, we have not settled on the method that we're going to use hopefully coming out of this earnings call will be very aggressive with the buyback program in order to be able to implement the 2 billion by the end of 2022.
we don't intend to telegraph how we're going to buy when we're going to buy, but we will report each quarter. how we have, how we've effectuated the number of shares that we've purchased, but it is a meaningful percentage as you note of what's outstanding, not only for the program through 22 but through 26. the other question, as we think about 23 and i think it's curt, there could be mentioned we have a large open position in 23 relative to 22 and that can work obviously to create an overperformance opportunity or come in slightly under and we've seen the curves, continue to rise.
and i think the commercial team has done a very nice job looking at our point of view and trying to figure out when to put the positions on to be able to manage the expectation, i think as curt said 3 was much lower, you saw that with forward curves in the past, particularly this time last year. that gap has closed considerably. it hasn't fully closed and you see that even in our charts and in the slides that we presented for the spark spreads. so we think 23 has a very good chance of being in line with 22 but there is still room for the curves to move and we still have a large open position.
so, we've talked about a 3 plus billion business on a run-rate basis and i think the fact is that there is going to be a range around these outcomes. we are in a competitive segment are benefited by having a large retail position that can work almost in a counter-cyclical manner to the wholesale position at times, but we still have some variation around it as the markets have shown some volatility, believe you that is something we can capture.
so i think looking at a more in-line is where we would expect to be, but we still have a ways to go from 23 given that there is still some backwardation relative to 22.
julien dumoulin smith -- bank of america
okay, got it. so ways to go as in uncertainty or did, still a little bit below?
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
i know well, i think, julien, the way i would describe it...
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
i think it's...
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
it has... go ahead, curt.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
no, no, no, go ahead, jim. sorry.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
no, i would say you have if you're simply and this is that this is the struggle that we talk about because we have a point of view on the business that has consistently shown that the market curves begin to approach as we get toward the prompt year, so if all you do is look at where curves today and you just look at it and say lock all that end, it's going to be lower than 22. i mean that's just math, that's not how we run our business. we run our business based on where we think it makes sense to put positions on and where we think curves would likely end up given supply, demand characteristics in the q that comes in, for new build, etcetera. and so when we look at it over that basis. we feel that 2023 has a very good chance to be right in line with 2022, but that's just not where the curves are at the moment, and we don't, that does not concern us. we've been in the spot before and we, it's happened for 2022. it's happened in previous years and so we anticipate it will likely happen again in 2023.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah...
julien dumoulin smith -- bank of america
got it.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
so, julien, i think that's why we say and we're not trying to be evasive here at all, it's just that when you're this far out, and the curves are still backward dated and we've seen every year that when you get into the summer and come out of the summer. the next summer and the winners tend to begin to move up and we expect that from our fundamental view, marketing something just to a current curve will give you one result, marketing something to our fundamental view will give you a different result.
we think those, but the good news is this time around, that those two things are still within the range of 2022 for 2023. in the past, the curves and you brought this up before, in the past, the curves were well below the $3 billion mark, and now those the curves in the fundamental view our have converged but there is still some room to move.
so i like to think about it, there is a distribution around 2023 but clearly, the 2022 ebitda midpoint on a lesser basis is within that distribution. and so we think there is a good chance that we can come in around where 2022 levels are for 2023. that's going to come down to execution and being ready when the curves are ripe and our team, that's what we do. that's what we get paid to do.
so we feel pretty good about going into 2022. we clearly feel good about it being 3 billion plus and being plus $3 billion, where it will land in terms of 20 -- in terms of 2022 for 2023. we're going to be within spitting distance of 2023 i think we have a good chance of hitting it, and we could actually even exceed it so that distribution, i think is favorable. it's now about execution and getting opportunities.
julien dumoulin smith -- bank of america
wow, thank you, team. so for an easy question here, and certainly not evasive at all. now let me ask you for a more detailed question then, on this vistra zero side of the equation, you talked about $450 million to $500 million of adjusted ebitda. how much capex are you thinking needs to get invested to get that outcome here?
and just to be clear, it sounds like none of that would be paid at least prospectively by the corporate capital. it would all be funded with various other project and segment-specific sources as well. i know that this is an update that's coming, but it sound... i just want to make sure if i'm capturing this holistically correctly.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
yeah, i think it's in the $5 billion to $5.5 billion range of total capital that would have to be invested and then you are right, the amount of equity capital that we would be putting in, is relatively low, although we're putting in some, obviously putting in some projects into that as well. that have value on the market, but yeah, i think it's $5 billion to $5.5 billion of our member right that we would have to invest and we obviously have plans for how we would do that.
julien dumoulin smith -- bank of america
in that contribution, principally just your existing storage right? i, without being too specific of...
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
well, yeah. i think i've mentioned it's moss landing it's more a bay, it's our oakland site in california. it's, what is it nine sites in illinois, that would have batteries or something like that. it's batteries in texas, we have one that's 265-megawatt one-hour battery coming on in texas, we have a 10 megawatt already on, but that's what the battery storage picture looks like.
then, of course, we're predominantly a solar on the renewable side, we have found wind to be economic, we're not an offshore wind person yet. so, and i don't expect us to be that, but we're not afraid of wind is just that we haven't found the opportunity for that, but that's, those are the primary projects ff course, there is a lot of solar both in texas and in illinois.
julien dumoulin smith -- bank of america
guys, really appreciate the detail there.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from steve fleishman at wolfe research. please go ahead.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research
hey, good morning. hey, curt. so just wanted to just, the nrg issues yesterday, called some -- you discuss some, well, i guess, also the texas ancillary costs and coal treatment, etc. how do you feel like those are embedded in your outlook and obviously your asset position is different, but just want to kind of clarify that you're ok on those issues?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. yeah, so in jim, you can jump in after this. but so, over half of -- let's just put this way, about $40 million in 2021, it was, is the effect of coal constraints. and so just so we've captured that, that's in our updated guidance and we capture that. i think i've mentioned, we decided to build inventory for q1 because the economics are more compelling to be ready for q1. and so, we have created this constraint in q4 of 2021 is in favor of q1 of 2022, everything is, any constraints that we have going into 2022 is already built into our guidance.
so there is nothing there's nothing more to talk about there, we expect, given what we're doing in q4 of 2021 in favor of q1 of 22 will actually allow us to run where we want to, in q1 of 22. i think you know this too that some of our, some of our plants, two of them in pjm in ohio or not on prb, a lot of these constraints are coming out of the prb. and on the rails from the prb.
and then of course oak grove mines its own coal. so we don't have those limitations there and then many of our other peers. we just don't have a lot of ebitda coming from like the illinois plants. and so the constraints just aren't as big for us and i think the other thing is our team got way out in front. i, just came to me more than a couple of months ago that we were concerned about this. and so we've been managing toward that and we've been working with the burlington northern folks, i've talked to their leadership team about getting more trains, so that we can get them in and they're doing the best they can, i know it's important for this winter in texas.
so all in all, i think we're really kind of took a, what i call a $40 million opportunity loss in q4, but we're also going to have more inventory for q1 or 22 and all of that's baked in both of our guidance ranges.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research
okay. i'm sorry how about...
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
go ahead, and the ancillaries...
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
did you ask about ancillaries, steve? can you hear us?
steve fleishman -- wolfe research
yes, that was a big part of the issue they had too, yeah.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. we have, that's also ours is just much lower. and jim, you might want to add to this, but our effect, we have ancillary the effects of ancillaries baked into our numbers. jim, do you want to add to that specifics?
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
sure. yeah, i, we do. it's baked into our plan. we view the ancillary costs similar to the other cost that any retailer would face, you've got to look at it. dear price and you've got it ultimately reflect it with the customers we have that built into our plan for 2022 and beyond. and of course, we do have, as you mentioned, steve, a different position having some generation assets as well.
so, but the integrated effect and the effect on retail is slowly reflected in our plan.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research
great. and then just on the renewables plan, how are you going to deal with the texas sites in terms of historically, you were looking at developing those as merchant but obviously you can't project finance that. so are you going to do ppas with vistra retail or with 3rd parties what's your strategy on the texas renewables?
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
yeah, it could be both steve, but i think most of it, we're looking at right now is, can be different in the future is back with our retail and that's actually we have a, we have an entity that lives between our wholesale and retail group that manages the supply book but advantages in supply for our retail business and they, they buy and they sell to 3rd-party retailers as well as to our own retail business.
they are the one that will ultimately end up contracting and then they will then supply our retail book as well as other retailers, but that's where it's really sort of back-to-back with our retail arm. and so that's where those contracts will be set up.
steve fleishman -- wolfe research
great, thank you very much.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
thank you.
operator
and our next question today comes from durgesh chopra with evercore isi. please go ahead.
durgesh chopra -- evercore is
hey, good morning, team. thank you for taking my question. i have a clarification and a follow-up. this, the 500 million prospective ebitda from the vistra zero platform. just to be clear, as you're thinking about the structured financing or equity for those projects. that, that ends up diluting that $500 million. right. that $500 million is the gross number. then what's vistra share is going to be lower, depending on what finance that you choose? am i thinking about the right way or not?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
yeah. you are. but let me just put this way, we will own 100% of the common equity of this entity. so just to be very clear about it. that capital tranche that we're looking at, we haven't decided exactly what to look like, but we will, we will own 100% of the common equity of that business and so you can sort of figure out what kind of, what kind of tranches that could be, but we're not looking to sell and partner with the equity ownership of that i think there are other ways to do what we want to do and maintain our control. jim, anything you want to add?
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
yes, i think the way you're thinking about it is correct what curt mentioned is an ebitda number and so we would expect that we would have some interest expense because we're going to be doing the project financing in any other sort of 3rd-party capital charges that we would have. so we have some ongoing cost of that capital, which we believe to be more cost-effective than our own.
and then over time, we have some amortization of the project debt, the project level debt that we would take on. so that's not meant to be a free cash flow number if that's, i think was getting into the nature of your question, it is an ebitda number. and, as curt mentioned, our goal is to maintain a 100% equity control so that from a terminal value standpoint, we're building a business of $500 million on a 5-year basis, we can get the $500 million and have long-dated long assets very esg friendly asset portfolio that's grown rapidly and use 3rd-party capital more cost-effective capital to do it.
so there will be some distributions out of that ebitda to pay for that, but we think that's more cost-effective than doing it all on balance sheet.
durgesh chopra -- evercore is
got it, that's super helpful. yeah. i was really interested in whether it's going to be 100% owned by you and it sounds like it will be. okay, second question, in terms of that 3 plus billion ebitda number you mentioned coal retirements among other thing that kind of gives you opportunity to get to that 5 gigawatt zero platform number, is that degradation to that base 3 billion ebitda as you ramp up on the vistra zero your platform?
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
well, in, we break, if you break. yeah, if you break these things and jim you. but if you break them out right and say ok let's isolate what impact that we have from our closing or retiring of our coal fleet. yeah, there is some slight degradation and ebitda from that, i will say that there is very little coming from these assets and the value of these assets have been written down to zero on the books.
so they're just not economically not contributing a lot and certainly not on an ebitda basis. what we are seeing though is that effect is more than offset by over time as we invest in the vistra zero platform. so we're able to actually ultimately grow ebitda over time as we invest and so we do see an increasing ebitda profile when we project that out.
so while they do if you isolate if they do have a negative effect on ebitda, meaning the retired coal plants, the other projects that are coming on, more than offset that, jim. go ahead, i'm sorry, i didn't mean to interrupt.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
no, no. curt, no. curt, you -- you covered it well and there is a that nearly 8000 megawatts of slated retirements. we obviously have 2 large facilities in texas that do not have anticipated retirement dates, but the ebitda contribution of that nearly 8000 has come down through time and it is not material on the go forward horizon, but it's something that we are built if we built into our plan and that's the whole point of transitioning this fleet is to be able to put new long-lived high margin assets with the vistra zero to more than overcome that so that we have a growing ebitda profile through time.
durgesh chopra -- evercore is
got it. thanks, guys. net-net, it sounds like you're biased higher in on the 3 plus billion ebitda prospectively, right? like counting in the ground incident. okay. thank you, guys.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
yes. yeah.

operator
good morning, and welcome to the vistra 3rd quarter's results only one earnings conference call. [operator instructions] i would now like to turn the conference over to molly sorg from investor relations. please go ahead, ma'am.
molly sorg -- investor relations
thank you, and good morning, everyone. welcome to vistra 3rd quarter 2021 results conference call. which is being broadcast live from the investor relations section of our website at www.vistra corp.com. also available on our website are a copy of today's investor presentation, our form 10-q, and the related press release.
joining me for today's call are curt morgan, chief executive officer, and jim burke, president, and chief financial officer. we have a few additional senior executives present to address questions during the second part of today's call as necessary. before we begin our presentation, i encourage all listeners to review the safe harbor statements included on slides 2 and 3 in the investor presentation on our website, that explain the risks of forward-looking statements.
the limitations of certain industry and market data included in the presentation and the use of non-gaap financial measures. today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements which are based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable only as of today's date. such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied.
we assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. further today's press release, slide presentation, and discussions on this call will include certain non-gaap financial measures. for such measures, reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures are provided in the press release and in the appendix to the investor presentation, i will now turn the call over to curt morgan to kick off our discussion.
curt morgan -- chief executive officer
thank you, molly, and good morning to everyone on the call. as always, we appreciate your interest in vistra. while we have a lot to cover today, we will do our best to be as piffy as possible to leave sufficient time for q&a. and not only will we be discussing our 3rd quarter and year-to-date financial results, but we are also initiating our 2022 guidance as is customary on our 3rd quarter results call. and most importantly we are laying out additional details of our long-term capital allocation plan, which i am excited to share with you. so let's get started.
it's hard to believe, we are still in the same year, where we experienced the significant effects from winter storm, yuri. i'm proud of how our company has recovered from a business standpoint, and we are beginning to execute on our strategic priorities, which are a product of a thorough review with the board, that have begun prior to yuri but accelerated greatly immediately on the heels of the storm, we will discuss these priorities in more detail later.
consistent with the bounce-back of our business, slide 6 reports are strong 3rd quarter financial results. despite a weak texas summer, we're vistra delivered adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations of $1.177 billion or $1.167 billion, excluding the impacts from winter storm yuri realized in the 3rd quarter, which included a small positive impact from ercot's 180-day resettlement statements.
as of september 30, vistra has already achieved approximately 85% of the $500 million self-help target we announced following yuri, and all of that done without really impacting any future periods. and we have a clear line of sight to achieving the balance in the 4th quarter. the combination of our solid execution on these self-help initiatives together with the inclusion of the approximately $500 million of proceeds.
we expect to realize from ercot securitization of certain charges allocated to load-serving entities during yuri. we are in a position today to both narrow and raise our 2021 ongoing operations adjusted ebitda guidance range. as shown on the slide, the securitization and self-help materially offset the more than $2 billion loss from yuri such as the retail bill credits, we will discuss later, as you likely recall internal and 3rd-party analysis has shown that vistra is yuri loss was driven predominantly by the uncontrollable failure of the texas intrastate gas system.
we are also narrowing and revising our ongoing operations, adjusted free cash flow before growth guidance which is similarly reflected on slide 6. the cash flow associated with securitization is expected to be received in the first half of 2022. consequently, the cash impact of securitization is reflected in our 2022 guidance on the next slide. so turning to slide 7, vistra is initiating its 2022 guidance today forecasting ongoing operations adjusted ebitda in the range of $2.81 billion -$3.31 billion with ongoing operations, adjusted free cash flow before growth in the range of $2.07 to $2.57 billion.
this represents a free cash flow conversion ratio of approximately 76%, which is higher than our historical conversion ratio due to the anticipated receipt of the securitization proceeds in the first half of 2022. on slide 7, we also offer an illustrative view of vistra's 2022 guidance ranges, which exclude winter storm yuri related bill credits of approximately $185 million and also the negative in year impact from the execution of npv positive long-dated contracts with retail customers of approximately $55 million and the $500 million of securitization proceeds in free cash flow before growth only.
we believe this illustrative view is the best way to think about vistra's future financial performance potential as it demonstrates the long-term earnings power and cash generation of the business. notably, the adverse impact from the bill credits in 2022 guidance are more than offset by the securitization, included in the 2021 updated guidance. in fact, securitization will likely more than offset the retail bill credits across all years.
looking beyond 2022, vistra's long-term view of our earnings power remains robust. the company is less hedged in 2023 and beyond, which affords an even greater opportunity to capture momentum from the rising curves, we have observed in recent months. in fact, we have seen a move up in both gas and heat rate in ercot as the gap between market and our fundamental view converge, which we have similarly seen in the last several years.
in fact, this conversions has resulted in projected results using market curves for the next several years in line with our stated view that we can generate consistent ebitda of $3 billion or greater. previously, the out years using steeply backward dated market curves were below $3 billion. this leaves us in a stronger position to optimize our ebitda within the $3 billion or greater ebitda range, especially as we add our growth investments.
we continue to remain confident in the ability of this business to earn significant cash flow on an annual basis and we intend to return a majority of that cash flow to our financial stakeholders in the years ahead. as i will outline on the next few slides.
slide 8 sets forth the four key priorities that our recent strategic review identified. we believe the best way to unlock the value inherent in this business and maximize value for our financial stakeholders is to drive long-term sustainable value through our integrated business model, which has been strengthened following yuri through various investments in our fleet and fuel supply as well as our enhanced risk management practices return a significant amount of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and a meaningful dividend program especially for as long as our stock remains at what we believe is such a meaningful discount to its fundamental value.
and if our stock responds, we will continue to return that capital in the most optimal way to our shareholders, the key is that we generate substantial capital year-over-year and we intend to return a significant amount to our shareholders. also, we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet. and last but not least, accelerate our vistra's zero growth pipeline with cost-effective capital.
as we set forth on the next slide, our long-term capital allocation plan reflects these strategic priorities, vistra's long-term capital allocation plan reflects an anticipated return of capital of at least $7.5 billion to its common stockholders through year-end 2026 while simultaneously reducing our corporate level leverage and accelerating our vistra's zero growth pipeline. specifically, as we announced in october, our board recently approved a $2 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to fully execute by year-end 2022. the share repurchase program is partially funded by the $1 billion of 8% preferred equity we issued last month. we then expect we will allocate approximately $1 billion per year toward share repurchases from 2023 through 2026 for a total of $6 billion in 5 years. and again, if our stock responds we will reallocate those funds back to our shareholders in some other cost-effective manner.
the $6 billion of return of capital represents more than 60% of our current market cap. this significant amount of capital allocated to share repurchases is evidence of both management and the board's conviction of the long-term earnings power of the business juxtaposed with what we believe is a significant under-valuation of our stock, we will expect, we will continue to prioritize share repurchases along as we believe our stock is undervalued.
and let me tell you, in my view, we have a long way to go. we are also reinforcing our commitment to paying a meaningful and growing dividend rather than identifying a target annual growth rate for our dividend, management expects that it will subject to board approval at the appropriate time allocate $300 million per year toward its common dividend.
as we retire more and more of our shares over time, this $300 million dividend pool will be spread over fewer shares and will offer potentially outsized growth on the remaining shares, for example, if we were to execute all $6 billion worth of the share repurchases at our recent stock price, our annualized dividend per share would grow by more than 100% by year-end 2026.
and our current share price, these share repurchases, and dividend programs are projected to result in an annual average cash yield on the stock of an attractive 15%, as always, we are also committed to a strong balance sheet, we expect we will retire another approximately $1.5 billion of corporate level debt by the end of next year and up to $3 billion by 2026 with projections of debt to ebitda in the mid to high twos during this timeframe for the vistra base business.
for our previous comments, we expect to combine project financing with renewable-related preferred equity and cash flows from existing renewable projects to cost effectively develop our current nearly five gigawatt renewable and battery pipeline over the next 5 years. using only $500 million of our own capital, and that is $500 million on a cumulative basis over the 5-year period, a significantly lower estimate than our previous expectation of spending approximately $500 million per year on growth capital.
these funds can now be used to support other capital allocation priorities especially share repurchases. it is important to note that vistra's zero will be a highly contracted business with 3rd party and internal ppas. so the leverage ratios will be commensurate with similarly situated businesses. slide 10, outlines the sources and uses for the long-term capital allocation plan that i just laid out.
importantly, we expect we will be able to execute on this capital allocation plan by growing our vistra's zero renewable and battery storage portfolio to a more than five gigawatt business generating approximately $450 to $500 million of adjusted ebitda annually by year-end 2026. we are excited about this long-term capital allocation plan and believe strongly that it is the best way to maximize the value of our business as we expect we will return the majority of our free cash flow from our base business to our financial stakeholders, while being mindful of our overall leverage levels and cost effectively accelerating our renewables and battery storage growth pipeline, which should ultimately be valued at a higher multiple over time.
using the midpoint of the vistra zero ebitda of $475 million by 2026 and a 14 times multiple would result in a total value of $6.65 billion for these projects. as i mentioned earlier, the strategic review we undertook was thorough evaluating multiple scenarios and potential paths to unlock shareholder value. ultimately, we believe the path we have outlined here today will be the path that will result in the greatest financial reward over time, taking into account risk of execution, cost-effectiveness in economies of scale.
with that, i will now turn the call over to jim burke, to discuss our financial results in more detail, jim.
jim burke -- president, and chief financial officer
thank you, curt, as shown on slide 12, vistra delivered strong financial results during the quarter with adjusted ebitda from ongoing operations of $1.177 billion results that are comparable to our 3rd quarter 2020 financial results, period over period our retail segment results were $205 million higher than 3rd quarter 2020 driven by the realization of our self-help initiatives and the lower cost of goods sold in 2021.
the collective generation segments ended the quarter, $211 million lower than 3rd quarter 2020 driven primarily by the lower realized energy margin in texas, east, and sunset after a very strong 2020. turning now to slide 13, we wanted to briefly touch on the momentum we have seen in spark spreads across the markets where we operate.
since september, we've seen a dramatic rise in commodity pricing across the board. as gas prices, power prices, and spark spreads are all climbing higher for 2022 and beyond. this is true in all the markets where we operate. though, we highlight our 2 largest markets ercot and pjm on the slide. as a general rule, vistra as the company that benefits from higher natural gas price environment as gas units are typically the marginal unit setting the price of power leading to higher overall power prices.
we expect this will benefit us in the outer years where we are less hedged. as of october 31, vistra is now 27% and 50% hedged in ercot and pjm respectively for 2023, we are hedged at relatively similar levels in new york, new england, kiso and miso as we have taken advantage of the increase. an outright power prices in spark spreads over the last couple of months, which are rising more in line with our fundamental point of view, we expect our commercial team will continue to take advantage of commodity pricing volatility working to position our integrated operations to earn in a relatively stable earnings profile over time.
i'm turning now to slide 14, which provides a more detailed breakdown of our 2022 financial guidance. we believe the illustrative guidance in the range of $3.05 to $3.55 billion adding back the impact of the euro-related bill credits and the year one impact of various npv positive long-dated retail contracts is the best way to think about the long-term earnings power of this business.
we continue to believe that vistra will be able to convert a majority of its adjusted ebitda to adjusted free cash flow before growth. similarly, our guidance for ongoing operations adjusted free cash flow before growth includes the anticipated receipt of securitization proceeds in addition to the other yuri impacts such as bill credits.
so our illustrative guidance removes these for a more normalized view of adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow before growth, a strong conversion percentage as shown on the slide enables the significant return of capital that curt discussed, while also supporting a strong balance sheet and the transformation of our fleet with our vistra's zero pipelines.
before we close this morning, i wanted to briefly address our long-term leverage target in pursuit of investment-grade credit ratings, which i know has been a strategic question for many of you following yuri. foundationally a strong balance sheet is core to vistra's strategy, our low leverage level proved critical during yuri as our financial strength supported our ability to quickly add more than $2 billion of debt in response to the storm.
as outlined on slide 15, we believe our current leverage in the range of approximately 3 to 3.5 times net debt to adjusted ebitda is a leverage level that will afford us the same level of financial strength, we believe we will be able to maintain our leverage in this range in the near term and reach the mid to high twos over the next 5 years.
we also believe that we would still be a candidate for investment-grade credit ratings in the future as our corporate leverage drops below 3 times and any project financing will relate to a lower risk contracted part of the business. though as we've said recently, we believe this opportunity is at least a few years in the future.
in closing, as i hope you can see from the long-term capital allocation plan we laid out today, we believe in the value of this business and our ability to generate significant free cash flow for allocation in the years ahead. by prioritizing returning the majority of our capital to our financial stakeholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet and pursuing accelerated growth of our vistra's zero portfolio, we believe that we will unlock the value of our business over time.
with that, operator, we're now ready to open the lines for questions.
